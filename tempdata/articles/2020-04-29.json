earlier today appeared skeptical about broad arguments made by the Trump administration that the House of Representatives cannot sue to enforce a subpoena demanding testimony of a former senior White House official.</p> \n  <p>Holding arguments by phone because of the <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a></strong> pandemic, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit considered whether a House committee can sue in an effort to obtain testimony from former White House Counsel <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/21/don-mcgahn-defies-subpoena-congress-trump\">Donald McGahn</a></strong>, <em>Reuters</em> writes.</p> \n  <p>The nine judges heard the case

href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-mexico-border\">US-Mexico border</a></strong> despite the fact Congress had appropriated only $1.375 billion.</p> \n  <p>Although the panel appeared generally sympathetic to the House\u2019s arguments, some judges seemed concerned about opening the door to the House suing over all manner of issues, including policy disputes and military conflicts.</p> \n  <p>Judge Judith Rogers appeared skeptical of the notion that courts cannot intervene when the executive branch and Congress are at odds. \u201cAre you of the view there can be no role for the courts in terms of preserving the separation of powers?\u201d she asked Hashim Mooppan, a Justice Department lawyer arguing for the Trump administration.</p> \n  <p>Judge David Tatel, referencing separate cases now at the Supreme Court concerning the House\u2019s effort to obtain <strong>Trump\u2019s financial records</strong>, questioned whether the Justice Department\u2019s arguments are consistent. </p> \n  <p>The Justice Department has said Trump can sue to block a subpoena but the House cannot sue to enforce one.</p> \n  <p>A divided three-judge panel of the court ruled for Trump in February, saying the court had no place in settling the closely watched dispute between the executive and legislative branches of the US government.<br><br>The House judiciary committee had sought testimony from McGahn, who left his post in October 2018, about Trump\u2019s efforts to impede former special counsel <strong><a

      "bodyText": "Live reporting on the coronavirus in the US continues on Wednesday\u2019s blog: A relatively quiet evening in US political news as we wrap up here. You can continue following our global coronavirus liveblog throughout the evening. The US has confirmed more than 1 million cases of coronavirus, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins. The US now accounts for about a third of all coronavirus cases reported from around the world. Trump is expected to sign an executive order aimed at keeping meat plants open. The planned order comes as some plants have closed after workers tested positive for coronavirus, raising concerns about a meat shortage in the country. But experts expressed concern that the order could jeopardize the health of plant workers Dr. Anthony Fauci said he\u2019s been \u201ctold\u201d that everyone in the United States who needs a coronavirus test will be able to get one by the end of May. But many people, including Fauci himself, remain skeptical that testing can ramp up that quickly. Trump dodged a question about whether he received repeated warnings on the threat of coronavirus in his Presidential Daily Briefing. The Washington Post reported the PDB included warnings about the virus in January and February, even as the president publicly downplayed the seriousness of the health threat. Hillary Clinton officially endorsed Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign. The endorsement is unsurprising, considering Biden has won the backing of nearly every other prominent Democrat, but it is still noteworthy after Biden considered challenging Clinton for the presidential nomination in 2016. Andrew Yang is suing New York\u2019s state board of elections over the effective cancellation of its presidential primary, Politico reported. More than half of Democrats are concerned that not all eligible Americans will be able to cast a vote in the 2020 presidential elections, and that the election may not be fair, according to a new Pew Research Center poll. The vice president was criticized for not wearing a mask during a visit to the Mayo Clinic facilities in Minnesota, even though the clinic requires all visitors to cover their faces. Pence claimed he didn\u2019t have to wear a mask because he\u2019s regularly tested for the virus, but health experts have questioned that argument, noting the vice president could get a false negative result or contract the virus in between tests. Andrew Yang files lawsuit over cancelled NY Democratic primary Former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang has filed a lawsuit in federal court against the New York Board of Elections, which effectively cancelled the state\u2019s June presidential primary, Politico reports. Daily Show honors \u201cheroes\u201d who helped US reach 1 million cases Three US children with Covid-19 have rare inflammatory syndrome Three children infected with the coronavirus in the United States are being treated for a rare inflammatory syndrome that appears similar to one that has raised concerns by doctors in Britain, Italy and Spain, Reuters reports. All three children, who range in age from 6 months to 8 years, have undergone treatment at the same hospital in New York. Italian and British medical experts have already been investigating a possible link between the coronavirus pandemic and clusters of severe inflammatory disease among infants arriving in hospitals with high fevers and swollen arteries. The three New York cases follow a similar report involving a child with coronavirus at Stanford University in California. The pattern of this syndrome in children in some ways follows what is happening with some adult Covid-19 patients, who get very sick, begin to recover, and then have a secondary immune response, a pediatric rheumatologist and immunologist told Reuters. Trump said US could conduct 5m tests a day \u2018very soon\u2019. Really? At a White House event earlier today, Trump responded to a question about a Harvard study recommending that the United States be able to conduct 5m tests a day by saying that could happen \u201cvery soon\u201d. A number of journalists, including CBS News White House correspondent Weijia Jiang, explained why that claim sounds unrealistic. Iranian scientist in Ice detention tests positive for Covid-19 An Iranian scientist who has been pleading for weeks to be released from a US immigration jail due to his fragile health has contracted Covid-19, according to his family and attorneys. Dr Sirous Asgari, a materials science and engineering professor who spoke out in March about the unsanitary and \u201cinhumane\u201d conditions in detention, was placed in an isolation cell this week inside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) jail in Louisiana. His lawyers learned on Tuesday that his Covid-19 test was positive. He and his family are calling for his release to a medical facility where he can receive proper care. But Ice told Asgari\u2019s lawyers he would only be released to a hospital if he was struggling to breathe, his attorneys said. Bryan Cox, an Ice spokesman, said there were two confirmed Covid-19 cases at Winn but declined to answer specific questions about Asgari. \u201cIt makes sense to send me to the hospital as soon as possible. I don\u2019t trust them at all,\u201d Asgari said in a phone call with the Guardian on Tuesday, amid repeated coughing fits. Asgari\u2019s story sparked international outrage after he spoke about his fears of Covid-19 spreading inside crowded Ice facilities with substandard cleaning practices and a lack of supplies. The professor, who has a history of respiratory problems, was exonerated in a US sanctions trial last year, but Ice has refused to release him or allow him to return to Iran. Iran\u2019s foreign minister recently called for his release, as have some US lawmakers and human rights groups. Read the full story here: Poll: 70% of Americans support allowing any voter to vote by mail A new Pew Research Center survey found that 70% of Americans are at least \u201csomewhat\u201d in favor of allowing any voter to vote by mail if they want to, as two-thirds say they believe that it\u2019s likely that coronavirus will disrupt Americans\u2019 ability to vote. Though Trump has pushed back against efforts to expand vote by mail during the Covid-19 crisis, claiming it would lead to voter fraud and a higher Democratic turnout, the policy still has strong overall support among voters. My colleague Sam Levine has a more in-depth look at the survey results, including the finding that less than half of Democrats are confident that November\u2019s election will be fair and accurate. Another interesting finding: while there is a clear partisan divide on voting by mail, with about half of Republicans aligning with Trump in their opposition to the policy, Republican support or opposition to mail voting varies a great deal across different states. \u201cIn states where vote by mail is already widely used, nearly 70% of Republicans support expanding vote by mail,\u201d Sam explained. \u201cEven in states where mail-in voting is not widely used, 40% of Republicans support expanding it.\u201d Aaron Blake at the Washington Post also highlighted this finding as an important survey finding. As Blake put it: \u201cThe [Republicans] with the most experience with this method are quite happy with it.\u201d Read Sam\u2019s full story on the survey results here: Fauci: I\u2019m being \u201ctold\u201d everyone can get a test by the end of May How soon will every American who needs a coronavirus test be able to get one? Speaking to CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper, Dr. Anthony Fauci said this afternoon that he\u2019s being told that testing will ramp up very soon, but that \u201cI\u2019m always the skeptic in the group,\u201d referring to the White House\u2019s coronavirus task force. Fauci said he is being \u201ctold\u201d that tests will \u201chopefully\u201d be widely available \u201cas we get to the end of May and the beginning of June.\u201d Is $1,200 enough? Trump administration considering another payment Lois Beckett here in San Francisco picking up this evening\u2019s live political news coverage. For Americans worried about paying their bills, an update from the White House, which is \u201cstudying very carefully\u201d the possibility of more direct cash support from the government. Speaking to reporters at the White House today, one of Trump\u2019s economic advisers was asked if Americans need to receive something more than the one-time $1,200 individual stimulus checks to make it through the pandemic. \u201cThat\u2019s something we\u2019re studying very carefully,\u201d Hassett said. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Lois Beckett, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The US has confirmed more than 1 million cases of coronavirus, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins. The US now accounts for about a third of all coronavirus cases reported from around the world. Trump is expected to sign an executive order aimed at keeping meat plants open.

Hillary Clinton officially endorsed Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign. The endorsement is unsurprising, considering Biden has won the backing of nearly every other prominent Democrat, but it is still noteworthy after Biden considered challenging Clinton for the presidential nomination in 2016. The vice president was criticized for not wearing a mask during a visit to the Mayo Clinic facilities in Minnesota, even though the clinic requires all visitors to cover their faces. Pence claimed he didn\u2019t have to wear a mask because he\u2019s regularly tested for the virus, but health experts have questioned that argument, noting the vice president could get a false negative result or contract the virus in between tests. Lois will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Vice President Mike Pence defended his decision not to wear a mask during a visit to the Mayo Clinic facilities in Minnesota, even though the clinic requires all visitors to cover their faces. \u201cAs vice president of the United States, I\u2019m tested for the coronavirus on a regular basis, and everyone who is around me is tested for the coronavirus,\u201d Pence told reporters, according to a pool report. \u201cAnd since I don\u2019t have the coronavirus, I thought it\u2019d be a good opportunity for me to be here, to be able to speak to these researchers, these incredible healthcare personnel and look them in the eye and say thank you.\u201d As the blog has previously noted, Pence could have contracted the virus in between tests, so the guidance on face coverings would almost certainly still apply to him. The coronavirus test is also not infallible, so it\u2019s still possible he could be an asymptomatic carrier. And to reiterate, the Mayo Clinic requires all visitors to wear masks, so at a minimum, Pence was ignoring the requests of his hosts while visiting clinic employees and patients. Reporters who were traveling with Pence said he appeared to be the only one at the clinic not covering his face. Restrictions on access to the Capitol have been extended through May 16, according to a new statement from the House and Senate sergeants-at-arms. The statement said Capitol tours would be canceled until at least May 16, and access to the House and Senate office buildings will be limited to members, staffers, credentialed press and official business vistors. \u201cWe are taking this temporary action out of concern for the health and safety of congressional employees as well as the public,\u201d the statement said. Access to the Capitol was first limited in early March, and it seems likely the restrictions will need to be extended again, considering the rising number of coronavirus cases in the Washington metropolitan area. Trump said he felt optimistic about the development of a coronavirus vaccine, but he then dubiously argued the virus would \u201cgo away\u201d regardless. \u201cBut I think what happens is, it\u2019s going to go away. This is going to go away,\u201d Trump said during a White House event with small business owners. \u201cAnd whether it comes back in a modified form in the fall, we\u2019ll be able to handle it. We\u2019ll be able to put out spurts. And we\u2019re very prepared to handle it.\u201d The comments sounded eerily similar to Trump\u2019s confident claims about coronavirus earlier this year, as the virus wreaked havoc in China\u2019s Wuhan region. \u201cIt\u2019s going to disappear,\u201d Trump said in late February. \u201cOne day, it\u2019s like a miracle, it will disappear.\u201d Of course, even countries that have been able to limit the spread of coronavirus have still needed to keep many restrictions in place to prevent a resurgence of the virus, so it is not at all accurate to say the virus went away. Public health experts have warned the country could see a second wave of infections starting in the fall, which could coincide with flu season, potentially creating a dangerous burden on the US healthcare system. Trump is expected to sign an executive order today aimed at keeping meat processing plants open, even though workers at a number of plants have tested positive for coronavirus. The AP reports: The order will use the Defense Production Act to classify meat processing as critical infrastructure to keep production plants open. ... A senior White House official said the administration was working to prevent a situation in which a majority of processing plants shut down for a period of time, which could lead to an 80% drop in the availability of meat in supermarkets. But some experts warned the order could jeopardize the health of meat plant workers and potentially cause a surge in coronavirus infections in towns with major plants. A former deputy labor secretary under Barack Obama expressed concern about the order and noted it comes on Workers\u2019 Memorial Day, which is meant to honor workers who have been injured or killed on the job: Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, on Tuesday endorsed Joe Biden. \u201cI want to add my voice to the many who have endorsed you to be our president,\u201d Clinton said, joining him at a virtual town hall on the impact of the coronavirus on women. \u201cJust think of the difference it would make it right now if we had a president who not only listened to the science, put facts over fiction, but brought us together.\u201d Her support was the latest in a string of high-wattage endorsements from major Democratic leaders as the party\u2019s former vice president makes his case for the White House. Earlier this month, he earned endorsements from his former rivals senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, as well as from former president Barack Obama. On Monday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced her support in a video. Biden, the presumptive Deomcratic nominee, introduced Clinton as \u201cthe woman who should be president of the United states right now.\u201d More than anyone, Clinton knows the importance of Democratic unity when facing Donald Trump. Her narrow loss to Trump has served as a stark reminder to Democrats of the perils of heading into November with a divided party. Clinton and Biden have known each other for decades, and she pointed to their long friendship \u2013 which was at times tested by their competing ambitions \u2013 to endorse his character. They were colleagues in the Senate for several years before running against each other in 2008 for the Democratic nomination. They both ended up serving in the Obama\u2019s administration, where they began weekly breakfasts. Tensions percolated again in 2016, when Biden considered running for president. But on Tuesday, Clinton offered an unconditional and personal endorsement of Biden. \u201cI\u2019ve been in the lobby of the Senate. I\u2019ve been in the cloakroom and I\u2019ve watched Joe bing people together,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cSo for me, this is a moment that we need a leader, a president, like Joe Biden.\u201d During his event with small business owners, Trump once again falsely claimed that his daughter and senior adviser, Ivanka Trump, has created 15 million American jobs. Trump first made the false claim earlier this month during a call with business leaders, and it immediately attracted the scrutiny of fact-checkers. For perspective, there were about 152 million Americans employed as of January, before the coronavirus crisis struck, so the president is falsely claiming his daughter created about 10% of all US jobs. The president appears to be referring to his daughter\u2019s work co-chairing a workforce advisory board, but the Washington Post previously gave Trump three Pinocchios for crediting Ivanka with creating millions of jobs. Trump is hosting an event for small business owners at the White House, with the handful of guests and reporters spread at least six feet apart in the East Room. The president is speaking about the Paycheck Protection Program, the small business loan program created by last month\u2019s stimulus package. The most recent coronavirus relief bill provided additional funding for the program, but some small business owners are already complaining once again about problems trying to apply to the program. Democratic senator Brian Schatz criticized vice prsident Mike Pence for not wearing a mask during a visit to the Mayo Clinic\u2019s facilities in Minnesota. The Hawaii Democrat said the vice president was \u201csetting a dangerous example\u201d by not covering his face, even though the clinic requires all visitors to do so. The Mayo Clinic has now deleted this tweet it sent about how it had informed Mike Pence\u2019s office about the mask requirement before the vice president\u2019s visit to the clinic\u2019s Minnesota facilities. Judging from footage of the visit, Pence appeared to be the only person not wearing a mask as he interacted with the clinic\u2019s employees and at least one patient. Mike Pence\u2019s office has dubiously argued the vice president does not need to wear a mask because he is regularly tested for coronavirus. The vice president faced questions about his lack of mask usage earlier this month after a photo circulated of a mask-less Pence greeting Colorado governor Jared Polis, who was wearing a mask in the picture. \u201cWhen the face-covering guidelines were developed, it was with the intention to not only protect yourself, but primarily to protect others from asymptomatic spread,\u201d Pence\u2019s spokesperson previously said in respnose to questions about him not covering his face. \u201cVice President Pence is negative for Covid-19 and is therefore not asymptomatic.\u201d However, coronavirus tests are not foolproof, and the vice president could potentially contract the virus in between tests, so the mask guidance should still apply to him. Vice President Mike Pence was criticized for ignoring mask guidelines when visiting the Mayo Clinic facilities in Minnesota today. Footage of Pence\u2019s visit showed the vice president not covering his face as he met with the clinic\u2019s employees and at least one patient. The clinic requires all visitors to wear a mask, sparking questions about why the vice president, who has avoided covering his face for photo opportunities, was allowed to flout the rule. In a statement, the Mayo Clinic said the vice president\u2019s team was informed of the mask rule before visiting and referred all other questions to Pence\u2019s office. The United States accounts for about a third of all coronavirus cases that have been confirmed around the world. The global total of confirmed coronavirus cases stands at 3,083,467, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The US has confirmed 1,002,498 cases. The US has confirmed far more cases than any other country in the world. Spain has confirmed 232,128 cases, and Italy has confirmed 201,505 cases. No other country has confirmed more than 200,000 cases. The US has reached the milestone of one million confirmed coronavirus cases, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The US death toll is now over 57,000. US appeals court judges earlier today appeared skeptical about broad arguments made by the Trump administration that the House of Representatives cannot sue to enforce a subpoena demanding testimony of a former senior White House official. Holding arguments by phone because of the coronavirus pandemic, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit considered whether a House committee can sue in an effort to obtain testimony from former White House Counsel Donald McGahn, Reuters writes. The nine judges heard the case alongside another dispute between the House and the Trump administration over Donald Trump\u2019s announcement that he would spend $8.1 billion for a wall on the US-Mexico border despite the fact Congress had appropriated only $1.375 billion. Although the panel appeared generally sympathetic to the House\u2019s arguments, some judges seemed concerned about opening the door to the House suing over all manner of issues, including policy disputes and military conflicts. Judge Judith Rogers appeared skeptical of the notion that courts cannot intervene when the executive branch and Congress are at odds. \u201cAre you of the view there can be no role for the courts in terms of preserving the separation of powers?\u201d she asked Hashim Mooppan, a Justice Department lawyer arguing for the Trump administration. Judge David Tatel, referencing separate cases now at the Supreme Court concerning the House\u2019s effort to obtain Trump\u2019s financial records, questioned whether the Justice Department\u2019s arguments are consistent. The Justice Department has said Trump can sue to block a subpoena but the House cannot sue to enforce one. A divided three-judge panel of the court ruled for Trump in February, saying the court had no place in settling the closely watched dispute between the executive and legislative branches of the US government. The House judiciary committee had sought testimony from McGahn, who left his post in October 2018, about Trump\u2019s efforts to impede former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation that documented Russian interference in the 2016 US election. McGahn declined to testify before the committee after the Trump administration advised him to defy the subpoena. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Trump is expected to sign an exectuvie order on keeping meat plants open. The executive order comes as a number of plants have had to close because workers have tested positive for coronavirus, which has raised concerns about a potential meat shortage. The president dodged a question about whether he received repeated warnings about the threat of coronavirus starting in January. Trump was asked about a Washington Post report that his Presidential Daily Briefing included multiple warnings on the virus in January and February. The president responded by saying he \u201cwould have to check\u201d the dates of the warnings he received. Hillary Clinton is expected to endorse Joe Biden later today. Clinton confirmed she would appear as a special guest for Biden\u2019s virtual town hall later today, and the endorsement was widely expected considering Biden has won the endorsement of virtually every other prominent Democrat. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. The Guardian\u2019s Kenya Evelyn reports on New York governor Andrew Cuomo\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing: Governor Cuomo confirmed that while the number of new cases in the state dropped to under 1,000, an additional 335 New Yorkers died from the coronavirus Monday. \u201cThis number is basically reducing, but not at a tremendous rate,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only thing that is tremendous is the number of New Yorkers that pass away.\u201d The governor announced the formation of an advisory board of business leaders and health experts who are working with state officials to develop a repening plan. Cuomo unveiled a set of data points the state is using to guide its efforts. \u201cIf a hospital system in an area exceeds 70% capacity or the rate of transmission of the virus hits 1.1, those are danger signs,\u201d he said, likening upstate New York to states in the Midwest and West. As protests to reopen the economy gain traction, the governor cautioned against getting \u201cpushed politically into a situation\u201d because \u201cthere are protesters in front of the capitol.\u201d \u201cNo, we\u2019re not going to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not how we make decisions.\u201d Cuomo then pleaded for reopening measures to be based on facts, insisting \u201cemotions can\u2019t drive a reopening process.\u201d \u201cSeparate the emotion from the logic,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to reopen, but we want to do it without infecting more people or overwhelming the hospital system.\u201d \u201cI know how much we want this to be over. But this is not over,\u201d he added. The briefing took a turn, however, when Cuomo went on to chastise national and global organizations for what he called a delayed response to a virus that first appeared in December. The governor specifically took aim at the US intelligence community and global health organizations and NGOs, as well as the New York Times and Wall Street Journal. \u201cWhere was everyone? Who was supposed to blow the bugle and didn\u2019t?\u201d he asked. However, Cuomo told Axios last night that he regretted not raising the alarm sooner himself. On tracking and testing Covid-19 cases, Cuomo said the state needs at least 30 tracers for every 100,000 residents. The need, he said, exposed \u201cfundamental issues\u201d in governmental institutions that will require long-term, structural change. \u201cWe need better systems,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to do a better job at our basic public health system.\u201d Joe Biden confirmed Hillary Clinton would appear at his virtual event later today, which was originally supposed to focus on the impact of coronavirus on women. Clinton is expected to endorse Biden, an unsurprising development considering Biden has won the endorsement of nearly every other prominent Democrat since becoming the presumptive nominee. But Clinton remains a favorite target for the president and his allies, and Trump\u2019s reelection campaign has already put out a statement bashing the former Democratic presidential nominee. \u201cThere is no greater concentration of Democrat establishment than Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton together,\u201d said Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale. \u201cPresident Trump beat her once and now he\u2019ll beat her chosen candidate.\u201d Trump\u2019s planned executive order on the US food supply will order meat processing plants to stay open, according to a Bloomberg News reporter. The president announced during his Oval Office pool spray with Florida governor Ron DeSantis that he would sign a new executive order today regarding the country\u2019s food supply chain. The expected order comes as a number of meat processing plants have been forced to close after workers began testing positive for coronavirus. At least 13 meat and food-processing workers have already died of the virus. The chairman of Tyson Foods warned Sunday that the country could face a meat shortage because of the closures. \u201cThere will be limited supply of our products available in grocery stores until we are able to reopen our facilities that are currently closed,\u201d John Tyson said. \u201cIn addition to meat shortages, this is a serious food waste issue. Farmers across the nation simply will not have anywhere to sell their livestock to be processed, when they could have fed the nation.\u201d Hillary Clinton reportedly intends to announce her endorsement of Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign during a virtual event this afternoon. The endorsement would be far from surprising, considering Biden has secured the endorsements of many prominent Democrats since becoming the party\u2019s presumptive nominee earlier this month. But the expected endorsement is still noteworthy, considering Clinton lost to Trump in 2016 and is still a favorite target for the president and his fans. Clinton previewed her appearance for Biden in a tweet: Trump told governors yesterday that they should \u201cseriously consider\u201d reopening schools, according to an audio recording of a teleconference call obtained by CNN. \u201cSome of you might start thinking about school openings, because a lot of people are wanting to have school openings. It\u2019s not a big subject, young children have done very well in this disaster that we\u2019ve all gone through,\u201d Trump can be heard saying in the recording. \u201cSo a lot of people are thinking about the school openings. And I think it\u2019s something ... they can seriously consider and maybe get going on it.\u201d A number of states have already announced that schools will not reopen for the remainder of the academic year, and public health experts have warned against relaxing social distancing restrictions too quickly, even as the president pushes for reopening the country. Alabama governor Kay Ivey said the state would relax some social distancing restrictions starting Thursday, as several states look to start the process of reopening their economies. Ivey said the state\u2019s stay-at-home order would be allowed to expire Thursday and would be replaced with a \u201csafer-at-home\u201d order that includes slightly relaxed restrictions, which will be in effect until at least May 15. Retail stores will be allowed to reopen starting Thursday, although the businesses must follow sanitization guidelines and enforce a 50% occupancy limit. Beaches will also be allowed to reopen, but people will still need to maintain six feet of physical distance and avoid gathering in groups. Restaurants, bars and breweries will remain limited to takeout and delivery, and churches will not yet be allowed to reopen. Trump declined to answer a question about the health status of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, which remains a matter of intense public speculation. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to comment on that,\u201d Trump said of Kim during an Oval Office pool spray with Florida governor Ron DeSantis. \u201cI just wish him well.\u201d But yesterday, Trump was more than willing to indicate that he knew the health status of Kim, even as he declined to share details on what he knows. \u201cKim Jong-un? I can\u2019t tell you exactly,\u201d Trump said at his press conference yesterday. \u201cYes, I do have a very good idea, but I can\u2019t talk about it now. ... You will probably be hearing in the not-too-distant future.\u201d Trump also dodged a question about whether he was warned in the Presidential Daily Briefing about the threat of coronavirus in January and February. During an Oval Office pool spray with Florida governor Ron DeSantis, the president said he \u201cwould have to check\u201d the dates of the warnings he received. The Washington Post reported yesterday: U.S. intelligence agencies issued warnings about the novel coronavirus in more than a dozen classified briefings prepared for President Trump in January and February, months during which he continued to play down the threat, according to current and former U.S. officials. The repeated warnings were conveyed in issues of the President\u2019s Daily Brief, a sensitive report that is produced before dawn each day and designed to call the president\u2019s attention to the most significant global developments and security threats. For weeks, the PDB \u2014 as the report is known \u2014 traced the virus\u2019s spread around the globe, made clear that China was suppressing information about the contagion\u2019s transmissibility and lethal toll, and raised the prospect of dire political and economic consequences. But the alarms appear to have failed to register with the president, who routinely skips reading the PDB and has at times shown little patience for even the oral summary he takes two or three times per week, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss classified material. Trump said he would be signing an executive order today to address \u201cliability problems\u201d in the food supply chain. The president announced the planned executive order during an Oval Office pool spray with Florida governor Ron DeSantis. The Republican governor was asked why he was still allowing flights to come in to Florida from Latin America, and DeSantis said he was examining the issue. Trump replied by suggesting DeSantis would be \u201ccutting off Braxil.\u201d \u201cWell not necessarily,\u201d DeSantis said. The Senate still plans to reconvene next Monday, majority leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s communications director confirmed in a tweet. McConnell\u2019s office said the statement the majority leader put out yesterday, announcing plans to reconvene next Monday, was still in effect. \u201cWe will modify routines in ways that are smart and safe, but we will honor our constitutional duty to the American people and conduct critical business in person,\u201d McConnell said in his statement yesterday. \u201cIf it is essential for doctors, nurses, healthcare workers, truck drivers, grocery-store workers, and many other brave Americans to keep carefully manning their own duty stations, then it is essential for Senators to carefully man ours and support them.\u201d As House leadership delays members\u2019 planned return to Washington, it\u2019s worth noting a bipartisan pair of senators are pushing to allow remote voting. Republican senator Rob Portman and Democratic senator Dick Durbin penned a New York Times op-ed voicing support for remote voting, which Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has ruled out. The two senators wrote: An essential part of the Senate\u2019s constitutional function, no matter the circumstances, is for senators to cast votes on legislation. We propose allowing remote voting during emergencies on a temporary basis. In times like these, that means updating Senate tradition so senators can follow the guidance of medical experts and adhere to strict social distancing measures. We are at the point where remote voting may be critical for the Senate to be able to govern on behalf of the American people and help lead our country through this crisis. House Democrats have proposed allowing members to vote by proxy for the duration of the current crisis, but House Republicans have voiced strong opposition to the idea. House majority leader Steny Hoyer\u2019s announcement that the chamber will not return next week comes just a day after Democratic leadership announced plans to reconvene starting next Monday. But that announcement was met with immediate pushback, as some House Democrats criticized the planned return as \u201cdangerous\u201d considering the coronavirus situation in Washington. The Capitol physician also reportedly warned lawmakers that there was a lot of work left to be done before Congress could return to full capacity. Hoyer said he spoke to the Capitol physician before making the decision to delay members\u2019 return. House majority leader Steny Hoyer has just announced that the chamber will not return to session next week, as previously planned. The Maryland Democrat said on a call with reporters that he made the decision to delay members\u2019 return last night, after consulting with the House physician and considering the rising number of coronavirus cases in the Washington metropolitan area. Hoyer said he hopes the House will be able to return soon to consider the next coronavirus relief package. The Senate is still scheduled to return next Monday. The White House now says press secretary Kayleigh McEnany\u2019s tweet about Trump\u2019s press conference with the governor of Florida was actually referring to a pool spray. It should be noted that a press conference and a pool spray are two very different things. A press conference gives reporters from a number of outlets the chance to question the president on camera, while a pool spray is restricted to the White House press pool that is on duty today. The confusion over the press conference comes a day after the White House scheduled then canceled then rescheduled its daily briefing on the coronavirus response. Congressional leaders are signaling there is a long fight ahead to reach a deal on the next coronavirus relief bill. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said yesterday that he wanted to tie new liability protections to additional funding for state and local governments, which Democrats have been pushing for. In an interview this morning, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer criticized McConnell for trying to link the funding, which governors say is absolutely necessary, to unrelated demands. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be massive layoffs at the state and local level unless we get some money to them quickly,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cAnd when McConnell says we\u2019ve got to do A, B, C, D, which is irrelevant to getting the people the money they need, that\u2019s wrong.\u201d The Senate will take up this fight starting next Monday, when the chamber reconvenes for the first time in weeks, despite concerns about the rising number of coronavirus cases in the Washington metropolitan area. The White House has just announced Trump will be holding a press conference with Florida governor Ron DeSantis at the White House in about an hour. The press conference did not appear on Trump\u2019s original schedule, which indicated the president\u2019s meeting with the Florida governor would be restricted to an in-house pool. The last-minute announcement comes a day after the White House scheduled then canceled then rescheduled its briefing on the coronavirus response. The White House has reportedly been trying to scale back the daily briefings, but the president, who has repeatedly boasted about the ratings the briefing attracts, may be hesitant to decrease their frequency. Ohio\u2019a vote-by-mail primary is taking place today, providing a reminder that there is in fact still a presidential election going on, even as the country remains focused on limiting the spread of coronavirus. Ohio was originally set to hold its primary last month, but in-person voting was canceled at the last minute due to concerns about spreading the virus at polling places. Many other states have since followed Ohio\u2019s example, delaying their presidential primaries and expanding absentee voting options to keep in-person voting to a minimum. Although Joe Biden is already the presumptive Democratic nominee, Ohio\u2019s handling of the primary could provide clues as to how the country will handle the general election in November, when the US may be seeing another surge in coronavirus cases. Even Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell is suggesting Trump should shorten his White House briefings. Asked by the Washington Post whether the White House should shorten the briefings, the Republican Senate leader said that was \u201cprobably a good idea.\u201d \u201cCertainly, what the American people are most interested in is the advice from health professionals about how to conduct their daily lives safely,\u201d McConnell added. Senate majority whip John Thune similarly said the briefings should focus on exerpertise from public health officials like Dr Anthony Fauci. \u201cI would say for any politician that you know, on a subject like this, you definitely want to give the experts the microphone and the platform as much as possible,\u201d Thune said. \u201cOne of the keys of being a good leader is surrounding yourself with people who have the knowledge and expertise and can kind of talk people through what we\u2019re going through.\u201d The White House is reportedly trying to decrease the frequency of the briefings after Trump\u2019s now-infamous claim about using disinfectants to treat coronavirus. There is currently no briefing on the president\u2019s schedule today, but that\u2019s no guarantee there won\u2019t be one, considering the White House scheduled then canceled then re-scheduled yesterday\u2019s briefing. Trump said in a new tweet that many states are \u201cmoving to SAFELY &amp; QUICKLY reopen,\u201d even as public health experts warn against relaxing restrictions too quickly. Several states have started their phased reopening, allowing some non-essential businesses to start accepting customers again while still enforcing restrictions to limit the spread of coronavirus. But public health experts are signaling some concerns about those states reopening. A model from the University of Washington, which is often cited by the White House, raised its projected number of coronavirus deaths in the US by early August. The model now suggests 74,000 Americans will die of the virus by August 4, up from the 67,000 predicted a week ago, in part due to signs of increasing activity among Americans. Meanwhile, the number of coronavirus cases in the US is approaching 1 million, and the country has recorded more than 56,000 deaths from the virus. Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said loans from the Paycheck Protection Program would be audited if they are worth over $2 million. Mnuchin\u2019s announcement comes as the small-business loan program has attracted criticism for approving funds for some not-so-small businesses, like Shake Shack and the Los Angeles Lakers. Mnuchin said he thought it was \u201coutrageous\u201d that the Lakers had been approved for a $4.6 million loan, which the professional basketball team is now returning following intense criticism. \u201cThis was a program designed for small businesses,\u201d Mnuchin said. \u201cIt was not a program that was designed for public companies if they had liquidity.\u201d The treasury secretary added he is encouraged the average loan amount for the program is coming down, indicating more of the money is going to actual small businesses, which account for half of American jobs. This is Joan Greve, taking over for Martin Pengelly. Another poll indicates most Americans agree with the current restrictions on non-essential businesses, even as protests against stay-at-home orders have received much attention in recent weeks. According to the Washington Post-University of Maryland poll, 66% of Americans say their states\u2019 restrictions on restaurants, stores and other businesses are appropriate. Another 16% say their states\u2019 restrictions are not tight enough. Only 17% say the restrictions are too severe. But Republicans remain more likely than Democrats or independents to say the restrictions go too far. While 27% of Republicans believe the restrictions are too severe, only 8% of Democrats and 17% of independents say the same. Thousands across the country have attended protests against their states\u2019 stay-at-home orders, ignoring social-distancing guidelines to demand their governors allow businesses to reopen. The organizers of the anti-stay-at-home movement have billed the protests as a grassroots operation demonstrating the frustration with restrictions on businesses, but the rallies have actually been backed by groups with ties to the Republican party and the Trump administration. And now in Sean Hannity news, the Fox News host is both threatening the New York Times with legal action over how it reports on him \u2013 and sharing a lawyer with Donald Trump again as he does so \u2013 and writing a book, due out from Simon &amp; Schuster on 4 August. The stories at issue are about Hannity, Fox News and the coronavirus. A Times spokeswoman said the paper had \u201creported fairly and accurately on Mr Hannity. There is no basis for a retraction or an apology.\u201d Here, meanwhile, is some Guardian reporting on Hannity. Hannity\u2019s book, meanwhile, is going to be called Live Free or Die, so in my reckoning it\u2019s either going to be a swiftly written screed about American rights, freedoms and how Big Government Is Bad, available at all good airport and Amtrak branches of Hudson News next to the latest Ann Coulter, or an unexpected swerve from the Ian Fleming estate in which Sebastian Faulks and William Boyd bend the knee to their new master and Bond fights evil villain Cuo Mo and his plan to keep New York on socialistic lockdown for the rest of recorded time. I\u2019m betting on the second, because I like Bond books, even the dodgy non-Fleming ones. The Boyd is actually pretty good. Honest. Noted small business the Los Angeles Lakers \u2013 employers of noted small businessman LeBron James \u2013 have returned a loan of around $4.6m they got from the federal government\u2019s coronavirus relief funds. It seems staggering that an NBA franchise could gain access to funding meant to save everyday businesses during the shutdown of the US economy, but as the Associated Press reports, we\u2019ve been here before: The Lakers applied for the loan under the Small Business Administration\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program, a part of the federal government\u2019s $2.2tn stimulus package. The Lakers\u2019 request was granted in the first round of distribution, but after the fund ran out of money in less than two weeks, the team returned its loan, as did several wealthier businesses including Shake Shack and AutoNation. \u2018The Lakers qualified for and received a loan under the Payroll Protection Program,\u2019 a statement read. \u2018However, once we found out the funds from the program had been depleted, we repaid the loan so that financial support would be directed to those most in need. The Lakers remain completely committed to supporting both our employees and our community.\u2019 It turns out the Lakers, the second-most valuable NBA franchise at $4bn or so, playing in the second-most valuable media market, qualified for small business relief because they only have around 300 employees. The AP report continues: The treasury department issued further guidance for the loan program last week, asking companies not to apply for the funds if they don\u2019t need the cash to survive. The Lakers haven\u2019t furloughed or fired any employees during the coronavirus pandemic, and the franchise doesn\u2019t plan to make any cutbacks. The team\u2019s top executives agreed to defer 20% of their salaries until later this year or early next year. Earlier this month, James, perhaps the most famous current NBA player, told fans \u201che had been spending his time at home during the coronavirus outbreak playing basketball with his teenage sons, enjoying time with his young daughter, and binge-watching Netflix hit Tiger King with his wife\u201d. We have a first tweet of the day from the president, and he is attacking the press once again: We are doing far more, and better, Testing than any other country in the world, and yet the media does nothing but complain. No matter how good a job is done, the same as with the Ventilators, they will never say we are doing a great job, they will only viciously gripe! As fact checkers have consistently pointed out, the US has not done the most tests per capita while the efficacy and efficiency of US testing is, to put it mildly, at issue. The US is getting better at testing, but public health experts suggest it needs to get much better before the economy can properly reopen. Access to ventilators has been a constant theme in the outbreak. It has turned out that states such as New York have not needed as many as they thought they would, but the Trump administration\u2019s handling of the federal stockpile has also been a subject of considerable controversy. Andrew Cuomo has said he wishes he had \u201cblown the bugle\u201d about Covid-19 earlier. Speaking to Axios on HBO, the New York governor discussed US reactions to the first news of the outbreak, from China in December. \u201cWhen we heard in December that China had a virus problem,\u201d he said, \u201cand China said basically, \u2018It was under control, don\u2019t worry,\u2019 we should\u2019ve worried.\u201d Cuomo added: \u201cI wish someone stood up and blew the bugle. And if no one was going to blow the bugle, I would feel much better if I was a bugle blower last December and January. ... I would feel better sitting here today saying, \u2018I blew the bugle about Wuhan province in January.\u2019 I can\u2019t say that.\u201d Again, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University, New York has confirmed more than 290,000 coronavirus cases and approaching 23,000 deaths. France, Italy and Spain have recorded more deaths but not by much, and New York City alone has the fifth-highest death total in the world, with the UK in fourth. Cuomo is widely seen to have had a good outbreak, so to speak, with daily briefings of the media much more to the point than the president\u2019s and a grip on governance of his state that has kept it on lockdown and in line while he manages a tricky relationship with the federal government. Still, questions are increasingly being asked about whether such New York\u2019s heavy death toll might have been avoided. When the US economy will reopen remains the key question but Congress will be back in session for sure on Monday 4 May. Many people think that\u2019s not a good idea at all, not least because the Senate skews old, to say the least, in a time when a virus is disproportionately killing older Americans. Only 14 of 100 senators are under 50 and 28 are 70 or older, six of those past 80. Majority leader Mitch McConnell said on Monday he would \u201cmodify routines in ways that are smart and safe\u201d. Here\u2019s a look at how the House of Commons is doing it in the UK. And here, from the Welsh Assembly, is a chilling demonstration of the perils of forgetting to mute your mic on Zoom. The 100 senators and 435 representatives will return to the usual political battles, anyway, looking to add to coronavirus stimulus/rescue efforts under a president who tweeted on Monday: \u201cWhy should the people and taxpayers of America be bailing out poorly run states (like Illinois, as example) and cities, in all cases Democrat run and managed, when most of the other states are not looking for bailout help. I am open to discussing anything, but just asking?\u201d The mechanics of which states bail out which are fascinating. Ask Andrew Cuomo: \u2026and welcome to another day of coverage of the coronavirus outbreak \u2013 and the politics of it under Donald Trump \u2013 in the US. First, as ever, the figures according to Johns Hopkins University: US cases: 988,303 US deaths: 56,248 New York cases: 291,996 New York deaths: 22,668 Other states are badly hit too: there have been more than 6,000 deaths in New Jersey, more than 3,000 in Michigan and Massachusetts, more than 2,000 in Connecticut and more than 1,000 in many others. Whither Trump, then. On Monday the president first cancelled his daily press briefing, in the aftermath of last week\u2019s disinfectant disaster, then announced it was on again. In the Rose Garden the president seemed a little subdued but also stuck to his usual talking points. Washington bureau chief David Smith\u2019s sketch is here \u2013 and true to its distinctly British journalistic form: His autocratic tendencies are well-known. His sudden absence from public view prompted fierce speculation and rumour. One headline suggested that he was \u201cbrain-dead\u201d. The North Korean leader Kim Jong-un\u2019s whereabouts remain unknown. But after a lost weekend, Donald Trump bounced back into the spotlight on Monday determined to prove that he is not only healthy but working very, very hard. This question, by the by \u2013 \u201cIf an American president loses more Americans over the course of six weeks than died over the entirety of the Vietnam war, does he deserve to be reelected?\u201d \u2013 produced more blowback for the questioner than the questioned, on grounds of whether it showed the proper respect. Such are the mechanics of the White House press corps. For the record, around 58,000 Americans died in Vietnam. Otherwise, at his White House presser Trump also: Announced a plan to increase coronavirus testing, which public health experts say is at nowhere near the level needed if the US economy is to reopen. Blamed China (the subject of this fascinating Politico story about jittery Senate Republicans being told not to defend the president). Refused to take responsibility for more people ingesting disinfectant in the days since his remarks on the subject. After the briefing, Trump made his usual attacks on the press on Twitter, at one point seeming to conflate them with the coronavirus, \u201cthe Invisible Enemy!\u201d But as of this writing, on Tuesday morning, there is no White House briefing on the schedule for Tuesday, though Trump is set to deliver remarks on small business in the Rose Garden at 3pm. Elsewhere, New York governor Andrew Cuomo announced a death toll in continued decline and started to look towards reopening parts of the state, while states including Texas and Ohio outlined their own plans to reopen. More to come. Before it does, some further reading:",

      "bodyText": "Independent Schools Victoria has blasted an offer from the education minister, Dan Tehan to bring forward independent and Catholic schools\u2019 federal funding if they meet benchmarks to return to face-to-face teaching, accusing him of wedging schools in a dispute with the Victorian government. After warning independent schools with the stick of withdrawing their funding if they didn\u2019t open their doors, Tehan is now trying the carrot approach by offering them up to 25% of their total annual recurrent funding early, in late May and early June. In a letter to the Independent Schools Council of Australia and the National Catholic Education Commission, sent on Tuesday, Tehan offered to financially assist schools \u201cin their response to Covid-19 and also [to] encourage the re-engagement of students within a classroom based learning environment\u201d. To be eligible for the first payment of 12.5% of recurrent funding, non-government school authorities must meet a condition Tehan imposed on 9 April to open campuses for term two and have a plan to fully reopen classroom teaching by 1 June. To be eligible for the second payment of 12.5%, the school authority will need to commit to achieving 50% of their students attending classroom-based learning by 1 June. School systems will have until 1 May to apply, with payments set to be made to state and territory treasuries on 21 May and 9 June. Non-government schools have complained that falling enrolments and the fact federal funding is based on a census date of students in August means they are set to lose both fee income and government funding. On Wednesday, the Independent Schools Council of Australia welcomed the offer, which its chief executive, David Mulford, said was \u201cnot a handout\u201d but \u201csimply a matter of adjusting the timing of one of the regular scheduled payments\u201d to help improve cash flow issues. Mulford said independent schools \u201cremain supportive of the government\u2019s intention to reopen schools in a timely manner\u201d. But Independent Schools Victoria chief executive, Michelle Green, said the offer put schools in an \u201cextraordinarily difficult and unfair position\u201d because they had \u201cjust two days to decide if they are able to provide a safe workplace for their teachers and a safe learning environment for their students\u201d. \u201cIndependent schools are being used as a wedge in a policy disagreement between the federal and Victorian governments,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is unfair and entirely inappropriate when what\u2019s at stake is the health of children and their teachers.\u201d Tehan has been publicly lobbying for all schools to return to face-to-face teaching in term two, resisted by teachers\u2019 unions, which want more physical distancing measures in school, and Victoria, which cites its own medical advice in favour of remote learning. Since the national cabinet recognised states\u2019 autonomy rather than a nationally consistent approach, parents have continued to be confused by a patchwork of different approaches on school closures and remote learning. New South Wales is set to return to face-to-face teaching in week three of term two, from 11 May. Queensland will deliver education remotely until 22 May, with a re-evaluation to take place by 15 May. On 9 April, Guardian Australia revealed Tehan had told independent school associations he would impose a new condition in effect requiring them to make classroom learning available or risk losing federal funding. But even that direction acknowledged that schools must follow \u201cthe advice of the health or education authorities of the commonwealth or the state or territory in which the school is located\u201d, leading to confusion particularly in Victoria. On Friday Scott Morrison reiterated that schools do not need to impose physical distancing rules in classrooms \u2013 such as maintaining 1.5 metres between students and four square metres of personal space. The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee advised it believes the \u201cvenue density\u201d rules are not \u201cappropriate or practical in classrooms or corridors\u201d. It did advise that schools should impose room density measures in staff rooms \u201cgiven the greater risk of transmission between adults\u201d. The AHPPC has noted there is \u201cvery limited evidence of transmission between children in the school environment\u201d and just 2.4% of confirmed cases have been in children aged between five and 18 years of age.",

      "bodyText": "Looking every inch the metal drummer he is, Nat (no surname) is an unlikely Vera Lynn for our times. And yet, the Sydney comedian\u2019s no-nonsense cookery segments are bringing comfort to the masses. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Iso-Lords?\u201d he says, introducing his latest clip, The Crowd Goes Mild Curry. \u201cWe\u2019re back in the kitchen, saying no to jar sauce.\u201d Behind a sparkling-clean counter laden with fresh vegetables, spices and herbs stands Nat: black band T-shirt, hair halfway down his torso, arms and neck covered in tattoos. He walks us through the ingredients before getting stuck into the methodology. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got one of these cheeky bastards, use this. It\u2019s called a microplane. I know it sounds like a small aircraft, but it\u2019s just a pretentious name for a fine grater. If you don\u2019t have one of these pratty things you can just use a normal grater, and if you don\u2019t think you\u2019ve got one of these, you\u2019re wrong. You\u2019ve got four of them and they\u2019re buried behind the other three.\u201d The Nat\u2019s What I Reckon YouTube channel has been in operation for 10 years, with 85,000 subscribers to Nat\u2019s ocker brand of social commentary, rife with wordplay and colourful metaphors. Now he\u2019s taken off to an even wider audience with recipes that wage war on processed food, like his End of Days Bolognese. Each video has clocked up around 5m views so far, and won him fans in the Foo Fighters\u2019 Dave Grohl, DJ Carl Cox and the actor Yael Stone. Sitting in a cluttered Sydney office on a Skype call with Guardian Australia, Nat apologies for being ineloquent. He doesn\u2019t mean the fact that his dialogue is always peppered with swearing and mumbling, but the fact he\u2019s trying to be helpful while struggling with fatigue. He works full-time on the clips with his girlfriend \u2013 he edits and answers messages, she films and designs \u2013 and says he\u2019s not sleeping much from fielding business inquiries. \u201cIt\u2019s just a fucking tidal wave at the moment,\u201d he says, looking dazed. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to remember anything.\u201d Nat got the idea to diversify into cooking segments after the lockdown cancellation of what would have been his first live comedy tour (\u201cheartbreaking\u201d), but his own health kick was also an impetus. In earlier material, he\u2019d wander around trade shows and art happenings with a mic, a perplexed attitude and what looked like a well-tended beer gut. \u201cI\u2019ve lost about 24 kilos,\u201d he says. \u201cI had one of my lungs removed a while ago and put on a bit of weight because I was pretty sick. Going to the gym wasn\u2019t doing anything and the gut wasn\u2019t helping my breathing, so I started looking into what food I was eating.\u201d What better time to turn that knowledge into a public service than during the panic-buying of jar sauce and packet soup? \u201cThere\u2019s a fresh food section in the supermarket that hasn\u2019t been touched and yet empty shelves of pasta sauce,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking stuck at home \u2013 what are you doing?

The change is not permanent, however, and will only apply to films released this year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/07/banning-netflix-real-danger-films-future\">Screening out Netflix is the real danger to future of film</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Academy also said it will condense the two sound categories into one, and, in an effort to become more carbon neutral, prohibit DVD screeners for 2022\u2019s 94th Oscars.</p> <p>Oscars eligibility has been a major question since stay-at-home and social distancing orders led to both the cancellation of major film festivals,<strong> </strong>including prominent pre-award season events<strong> </strong>such as South by Southwest and Cannes Film Festival, and the closure of movie theaters across the globe.</p> <p>Previously, a film would have required a minimum seven-day theatrical run in a Los Angeles county commercial theater in order to be considered for the Academy\u2019s highest honor.

      "bodyText": "The Academy Awards will for the first time allow films that debuted on a streaming service without a theatrical run to be eligible for nominations, a break with tradition in direct response to the coronavirus pandemic. The Academy announced the new criteria for the Oscars in a statement on Tuesday. The change is not permanent, however, and will only apply to films released this year. The Academy also said it will condense the two sound categories into one, and, in an effort to become more carbon neutral, prohibit DVD screeners for 2022\u2019s 94th Oscars. Oscars eligibility has been a major question since stay-at-home and social distancing orders led to both the cancellation of major film festivals, including prominent pre-award season events such as South by Southwest and Cannes Film Festival, and the closure of movie theaters across the globe. Previously, a film would have required a minimum seven-day theatrical run in a Los Angeles county commercial theater in order to be considered for the Academy\u2019s highest honor. Now films that had a previously planned theatrical release but are made available through on-demand service may qualify for best picture and other categories. \u201cThe Academy firmly believes there is no greater way to experience the magic of movies than to see them in a theater.

North Korea insists it has yet to identify a single case of Covid-19, despite sharing a border with China, where the outbreak is believed to have started. Despite recent reports claiming that Kim had missed a key anniversary event after undergoing heart surgery, the South Korean unification minister, Kim Yeon-chul, said it was reasonable to assume that he had decided not to attend as a precaution. Kim was absent from a 15 April ceremony to mark the anniversary of the birth of his grandfather \u2013 and North Korea\u2019s founder \u2013 Kim Il-sung. \u201cWe have intelligence capacity that allows us to say confidently that there are no unusual signs [in North Korea],\u201d Kim Yeon-chul told a parliamentary hearing. \u201cHe had not missed the anniversary \u2026 since taking power, but many anniversary events, including celebrations and a banquet, have been cancelled because of coronavirus concerns. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s particularly unusual given the current situation,\u201d he said, describing reports that Kim had undergone heart surgery as \u201cfake news\u201d. US officials told Reuters they believed Kim had taken his private train to the east coast resort town of Wonsan to shelter from the virus. Kim Yeon-chul noted that there had been at least two instances since mid-January when Kim had not been seen in public for almost three weeks. The North Korean leader was last seen in public on 11 April when he presided over a party politburo meeting. State media have not published a single photograph of Kim since, but they have carried reports of his daily routine, including diplomatic messages sent to other world leaders. Speculation that Kim was staying in Wonsan grew over the weekend after the Washington-based North Korea monitoring project 38 North said it had analysed satellite images showing his special train parked at the local station. On Tuesday, the NK News website said leisure boats often used by Kim had been active in the area throughout this month.

The announcement came just hours after Bauer title TV Week cancelled the TV Week Logies, which were originally to be held on the Gold Coast on 28 June. The German-owned media giant refused to say which magazines would not be published but indicated some may never return to print. However, sources say the staff of fashion magazines Harper\u2019s Bazaar and Elle and gossip weeklies OK! and NW have been stood down so they are likely to be among the titles affected. \u201cThe affected brands\u2019 digital assets will continue to operate,\u201d Bauer said in a statement. \u201cThe decision to resume print publication will be made once the trading environment improves.\u201d Bauer Media\u2019s planned acquisition of Seven West Media\u2019s Pacific Magazines, which publishes Better Homes &amp; Gardens, New Idea and Marie Claire, is expected to be completed on Friday despite speculation Bauer may have wanted to pull out.

Many Australia titles have closed in the past few years, including Cleo, Top Gear, Zoo, Madison, Grazia, Burke\u2019s Backyard, BBC Good Food, FHM and Cosmopolitan. Earlier this month the company closed New Zealand Woman\u2019s Weekly and pulled its business out of the country completely. Since Kerry Packer\u2019s ACP Magazines was sold by Nine Entertainment for $500m in 2012, several titles have had their editorial teams merged and others closed entirely. Men\u2019s magazine the Picture and the 69-year-old People magazine will close at the end of the year, ending decades of printed weeklies featuring topless models and readers\u2019 sex stories, after they were banned from sale at service stations.

If antitrust laws are weak, a few behemoths survive while everyone else goes down. If dirty industries are tightly regulated, clean ones flourish. If not, the corner-cutters win. But the dependency of enterprises on public policy has seldom been greater in capitalist nations than it is today. Many major industries are now entirely beholden to the state for their survival. Governments have the oil industry over a barrel \u2013 <a href=\"https://earther.gizmodo.com/oil-companies-are-spending-a-fortune-to-store-unused-cr-1842962500\">hundreds of millions of </a><a href=\"https://earther.gizmodo.com/oil-companies-are-spending-a-fortune-to-store-unused-cr-1842962500\">unsaleable </a><a href=\"https://earther.gizmodo.com/oil-companies-are-spending-a-fortune-to-store-unused-cr-1842962500\">barrels</a>, to be more precise \u2013 just as they had the banks over a barrel in 2008. Then, they failed to use their power to eradicate the sector\u2019s socially destructive practices and rebuild it around human needs. They are making the same mistake today.</p> <p>The Bank of England has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/16/bank-of-england-failing-climate-with-covid-19-stimulus-programme-oil-firms-debt-bond-governor\">decided to buy debt from oil companies</a> such as BP, Shell and Total. The government has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/06/easyjet-secures-600m-coronavirus-loan-from-uk-treasury-and-bank\">given easyJet a \u00a3600m loan</a> even though, just a few weeks ago, the company frittered away \u00a3171m in dividends: profit is privatised, risk is socialised. In the US, the first bailout includes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/us-government-coronavirus-bailout-airlines-industry\">$</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/us-government-coronavirus-bailout-airlines-industry\">25bn (\u00a320.1bn) for airlines</a>. Overall, the bailout involves sucking as much oil as possible into strategic petroleum reserves and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/climate/epa-coronavirus-pollution-rules.html\">sweeping away pollution laws</a>, while freezing out renewable energy. Several European countries are seeking to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/17/polluter-bailouts-and-lobbying-during-covid-19-pandemic\">rescue their airlines and car manufacturers</a>.</p> <p>Don\u2019t believe them when they tell you they do this on our behalf. A <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/two-thirds-britons-believe-climate-change-serious-coronavirus-and-majority-want-climate-prioritised\">recent survey</a> by Ipsos of 14 countries suggests that, on average, 65% of people want climate change to be prioritised in the economic recovery. Everywhere, electorates must struggle to persuade governments to act in the interests of the people, rather than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/17/dark-money-democracy-billionaires-funding\">the corporations and billionaires who fund and lobby them</a>. The perennial democratic challenge is to break the bonds between politicians and the economic sectors they should be regulating, or, in this case, closing down.</p> <p>Even when legislators seek to represent these concerns, their efforts are often feeble and naive. The recent <a href=\"https://www.libdemvoice.org/lib-dems-lead-crossparty-call-for-urgent-support-for-airlines-in-return-for-climate-action-64283.html\">letter to the government</a> from a cross-party group of MPs calling for airlines to receive a bailout only if they \u201cdo more to tackle the climate crisis\u201d could have been written in 1990. Air travel is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2019/jul/19/carbon-calculator-how-taking-one-flight-emits-as-much-as-many-people-do-in-a-year\">inherently polluting</a>. There are no realistic measures that could, even in the medium term, make a significant difference. We now know that the carbon offsetting schemes the MPs call for is useless: every economic sector needs to maximise cuts in greenhouse gases, so shifting the responsibility from one sector to another solves nothing. The only meaningful reform is fewer flights. Anything that impedes the contraction of the aviation industry impedes the reduction of its impacts.</p> <p>The current crisis gives us a glimpse of how much we need to do to pull out of our disastrous trajectory. Despite the vast changes we have made in our lives, global carbon dioxide emissions are likely to reduce by <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-coronavirus-set-to-cause-largest-ever-annual-fall-in-co2-emissions\">only about 5.5%</a> this year. A UN report shows that to stand a reasonable chance of avoiding 1.5C or more of global heating, <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/news/cut-global-emissions-by-76-percent-every-year-for-next-decade-to-meet-15degc-paris-target-un-report\">we need to cut emissions by 7.6% per year</a> for the next decade. In other words, the lockdown exposes the limits of individual action. Travelling less helps, but not enough. To make the necessary cuts we need structural change. This means an entirely new industrial policy, created and guided by government.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/12/the-guardian-view-on-the-climate-and-coronavirus-global-warnings\">The Guardian view on the climate and coronavirus: global warnings | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Governments like the UK\u2019s should drop their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/21/campaigners-take-legal-action-over-27bn-uk-road-building-scheme\">road-building plans</a>. Instead of expanding airports, they should publish plans for reducing landing slots. They should commit to an explicit policy of leaving fossil fuels in the ground.</p> <p>During the pandemic, many of us have begun to discover how much of our travel is unnecessary. Governments can build on this to create plans for reducing the need to move, while investing in walking, cycling and \u2013 when physical distancing is less necessary \u2013 public transport. This means wider pavements, better cycle lanes, buses run for service not profit. They should invest heavily in green energy, and even more heavily in reducing energy demand \u2013 through, for example, home insulation and better heating and lighting. The pandemic exposes the need for <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-were-in-a-real-time-laboratory-of-a-more-sustainable-urban-future-135712\">better neighbourhood design</a>, with less public space given to cars and more to people. It also shows how badly we need the kind of security that a lightly taxed, deregulated economy cannot deliver.</p> <p>In other words, let\u2019s have what many people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/27/climate-breakdown-austerity-green-new-deal\">were calling for</a> long before this disaster hit: a green new deal.

      "bodyText": "Do Not Resuscitate. This tag should be attached to the oil, airline and car industries. Governments should provide financial support to company workers while refashioning the economy to provide new jobs in different sectors. They should prop up only those sectors that will help secure the survival of humanity and the rest of the living world. They should either buy up the dirty industries and turn them towards clean technologies, or do what they often call for but never really want: let the market decide. In other words, allow these companies to fail. This is our second great chance to do things differently. It could be our last. The first, in 2008, was spectacularly squandered. Vast amounts of public money were spent reassembling the filthy old economy, while ensuring that wealth remained in the hands of the rich. Today, many governments appear determined to repeat that catastrophic mistake. The \u201cfree market\u201d has always been a product of government policy. If antitrust laws are weak, a few behemoths survive while everyone else goes down. If dirty industries are tightly regulated, clean ones flourish. If not, the corner-cutters win. But the dependency of enterprises on public policy has seldom been greater in capitalist nations than it is today. Many major industries are now entirely beholden to the state for their survival. Governments have the oil industry over a barrel \u2013 hundreds of millions of unsaleable barrels, to be more precise \u2013 just as they had the banks over a barrel in 2008. Then, they failed to use their power to eradicate the sector\u2019s socially destructive practices and rebuild it around human needs. They are making the same mistake today. The Bank of England has decided to buy debt from oil companies such as BP, Shell and Total. The government has given easyJet a \u00a3600m loan even though, just a few weeks ago, the company frittered away \u00a3171m in dividends: profit is privatised, risk is socialised. In the US, the first bailout includes $25bn (\u00a320.1bn) for airlines. Overall, the bailout involves sucking as much oil as possible into strategic petroleum reserves and sweeping away pollution laws, while freezing out renewable energy. Several European countries are seeking to rescue their airlines and car manufacturers. Don\u2019t believe them when they tell you they do this on our behalf. A recent survey by Ipsos of 14 countries suggests that, on average, 65% of people want climate change to be prioritised in the economic recovery. Everywhere, electorates must struggle to persuade governments to act in the interests of the people, rather than the corporations and billionaires who fund and lobby them. The perennial democratic challenge is to break the bonds between politicians and the economic sectors they should be regulating, or, in this case, closing down. Even when legislators seek to represent these concerns, their efforts are often feeble and naive. The recent letter to the government from a cross-party group of MPs calling for airlines to receive a bailout only if they \u201cdo more to tackle the climate crisis\u201d could have been written in 1990. Air travel is inherently polluting. There are no realistic measures that could, even in the medium term, make a significant difference. We now know that the carbon offsetting schemes the MPs call for is useless: every economic sector needs to maximise cuts in greenhouse gases, so shifting the responsibility from one sector to another solves nothing. The only meaningful reform is fewer flights. Anything that impedes the contraction of the aviation industry impedes the reduction of its impacts. The current crisis gives us a glimpse of how much we need to do to pull out of our disastrous trajectory. Despite the vast changes we have made in our lives, global carbon dioxide emissions are likely to reduce by only about 5.5% this year. A UN report shows that to stand a reasonable chance of avoiding 1.5C or more of global heating, we need to cut emissions by 7.6% per year for the next decade. In other words, the lockdown exposes the limits of individual action. Travelling less helps, but not enough. To make the necessary cuts we need structural change. This means an entirely new industrial policy, created and guided by government. Governments like the UK\u2019s should drop their road-building plans. Instead of expanding airports, they should publish plans for reducing landing slots. They should commit to an explicit policy of leaving fossil fuels in the ground. During the pandemic, many of us have begun to discover how much of our travel is unnecessary. Governments can build on this to create plans for reducing the need to move, while investing in walking, cycling and \u2013 when physical distancing is less necessary \u2013 public transport. This means wider pavements, better cycle lanes, buses run for service not profit. They should invest heavily in green energy, and even more heavily in reducing energy demand \u2013 through, for example, home insulation and better heating and lighting. The pandemic exposes the need for better neighbourhood design, with less public space given to cars and more to people. It also shows how badly we need the kind of security that a lightly taxed, deregulated economy cannot deliver. In other words, let\u2019s have what many people were calling for long before this disaster hit: a green new deal. But please let\u2019s stop describing it as a stimulus package. We have stimulated consumption too much over the past century, which is why we face environmental disaster. Let us call it a survival package, whose purpose is to provide incomes, distribute wealth and avoid catastrophe, without stoking perpetual economic growth. Bail out the people, not the corporations. Bail out the living world, not its destroyers. Let\u2019s not waste our second chance.

Pressure is mounting on the government to outline a more detailed exit strategy from lockdown, while Labour has called for more flexibility in the furlough scheme to help companies and people wanting to work limited hours. Peter Cheese, chief executive of the CIPD, said extending the scheme until at least September would give employers more certainty and remove the risk of a \u201ccliff-edge exit\u201d from furlough straight to redundancy. \u201cUrgent decisions must now be taken to make it more flexible and to extend it so employers can continue to protect jobs,\u201d he added. Extending the scheme would add significantly to the bill facing the exchequer for paying 80% of workers\u2019 wages up to \u00a32,500 per month. The government\u2019s tax and spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, estimated a cost of \u00a342bn over three months to help 8.3 million people. It could cost a further \u00a312bn for each additional month at this level, according to the Resolution Foundation. However, adjusting the scheme to give firms greater flexibility could cut the costs facing the public purse, as the financial aid could be scaled back as staff gradually return to work. Sunak dropped a clear hint on Monday that the scheme could be tweaked to allow for such changes. Speaking in parliament, he said \u201cgradual refinements\u201d were a key part of the government plan to end lockdown measures. There are early signs the furlough scheme has helped stop far greater numbers of redundancies as Britain slides into the worst recession in living memory, with more than 4m positions protected following the first week of its operation. According to a survey of around 700 of its members in the first week of the scheme\u2019s operation, the British Chambers of Commerce said 76% of companies had furloughed at least some of their staff. It said almost no redundancies had been made by these firms. Adam Marshall, the director general of the BCC, also called for it to be extended: \u201cWhile the furlough scheme cannot be indefinite, it will need to run well beyond 30 June in some form to help businesses transition toward a \u2018new normal\u2019 as the lockdown is eased.\u201d",

Let\u2019s set the controls for the heart of the news \u2026</p> \n<p>The UK government\u2019s plan to subsidise workers\u2019 wages should be extended until at least autumn, the trade body for the human resources sector has argued. Peter Cheese from the CIPD said extending the scheme until at least September would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/29/extend-coronavirus-wage-subsidies-or-risk-delayed-redundancies-firms-warn\">prevent the job retention scheme becoming a \u201cwaiting room\u201d for eventual redundancy</a>. The CIPD is calling on the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, for urgent changes including allowing furloughed staff to work reduced hours. There are early signs the furlough scheme is working, with more than 4m positions protected following the first week of its operation. Extending it could add \u00a312bn a month to the cost to the exchequer, according to the Resolution Foundation.</p> \n<p>British Airways has set out plans to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/british-airways-plans-to-make-up-to-12000-staff-redundant\">make up to 12,000 of its staff redundant</a> because of the global collapse in air travel. Its chief executive, Alex Cruz, has told the airline\u2019s 42,000 staff that it \u201cmust act decisively now to ensure that British Airways has a strong future\u201d. The UK\u2019s flag carrier has placed 22,600 people on the government\u2019s furlough scheme and the CEO wrote to staff that it \u201ccannot expect the taxpayer to offset salaries indefinitely \u2026 Yesterday, British Airways flew just a handful of aircraft out of Heathrow. On a normal day we would fly more than 300.\u201d Unions have reacted with shock and anger to the announcement.</p> \n<p>The number of US cases has passed one million as Donald Trump predicted an economic rebound in the fall and claimed there would soon be 5m coronavirus diagnostic tests a day. An international row has erupted as the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, backed calls for an investigation of the origins and spread of the novel coronavirus. The Chinese government has responded by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/australia-defends-plan-to-investigate-china-over-covid-19-outbreak-as-row-deepens\">blasting out belittling messages about \u201cpanda bashing\u201d and \u201cvictim blaming\u201d</a> by Australia.

It\u2019s very worrying.\u201d</p> <p>Gee is far from alone in having heightened anxiety levels during the pandemic. <a href=\"https://nya.org.uk/covid-response-report/\">New research</a> by the National Youth Agency, which works with youth organisations and young people across the UK, and the children\u2019s commissioner, published on Wednesday, shows that there are now 3 million vulnerable young people in England who need support with family relationships, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/31/young-peoples-mental-health-hit-by-coronavirus-uk-poll\">mental health</a>, domestic abuse, or other needs. That\u2019s 2 million more vulnerable eight to 19-year-olds needing help because of the pandemic.</p> <p>The figures were estimated from emerging data collated in March and April, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/sharp-rise-in-number-of-calls-to-childline-over-coronavirus\">from helplines</a>, sector reports and grassroots evidence, and compared with existing official data such as the numbers of children living with a vulnerable family background, figures on offending behaviour and NHS data on mental health.</p> <p>For many, youth clubs provide a vital lifeline, offering somewhere to go, something to do and a trusted adult to talk to. But the lockdown means youth services, already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/20/youth-services-suffer-70-funding-cut-in-less-than-a-decade\">decimated after a decade of austerity</a>, are not easily able to meet this extra need for help. Local authority youth workers have mostly been redeployed, while voluntary, sector-run youth clubs and centres have shut their doors and are providing limited services online. Most street-based youth work has ceased.</p> <p>The report estimates that nationally one in five youth clubs will not reopen, with a higher proportion staying shut in some regions, and calls for swift and generous action from ministers. \u201cThe government needs to provide urgent resources and funding to safeguard youth services,\u201d says Leigh Middleton, chief executive of the <a href=\"https://nya.org.uk/\">National Youth Agency</a>. \u201cThree times the number of young people are at risk as a result of the lockdown, yet just as they need us most, the pandemic is pushing many youth organisations to the brink.\u201d</p> <p>Last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-announces-support-for-post-brexit-future--2\">\u00a3500m youth investment fund</a>, while welcome, provides capital funding to build 60 new youth centres, refurbish hundreds of others, and develop mobile facilities for harder to reach areas. It doesn\u2019t deal with the running costs of existing youth clubs. And although the chancellor announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/08/rishi-sunak-heeds-calls-to-help-charities-with-750m-extra-funding\">\u00a3750m extra funding for charities</a>, insiders are sceptical as to how much money will reach the youth sector. Coming after <a href=\"https://www.ymca.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/YMCA-Out-of-Service-report.pdf\">70% cuts to youth services</a> funding in England since 2010, which have seen <a href=\"https://www.unison.org.uk/content/uploads/2019/04/Youth-services-report-04-2019.pdf\">more than 4,500 youth work jobs cut</a> and 760 youth centres closed, for many clubs and services it will be too little, too late. </p> <p>\u201cThe majority of youth organisations have had to furlough around 40% of their workers,\u201d says Ndidi Okezie, chief executive of <a href=\"https://www.ukyouth.org/\">UK Youth</a>. \u201cWe need an emergency youth fund.\u201d</p> <p>But it\u2019s not all doom and gloom. In Leeds, for example, charity <a href=\"https://barca-leeds.org/what-we-do/\">Barca</a>, which runs youth clubs for 11 to 19-year-olds, is managing to reach many of the young people it works with digitally.</p> <p>Virtual club sessions through Zoom, and one-to-one online drop-in sessions with youth workers at fixed times five days a week, are both proving popular.</p> <p>Barca has also distributed 74 activity packs for young people and their younger siblings. \u201cIt\u2019s great for them, but it also allows us to have face-to-face contact,\u201d says Amanda Sykes, senior practitioner in Barca\u2019s children, young people and family service.</p> <p>And last week the charity held its first socially distant doorstep dance session, run by social enterprise<a href=\"https://eu-west-1.protection.sophos.com/?d=dazl.org.uk&amp;u=aHR0cHM6Ly9kYXpsLm9yZy51ay8=&amp;e=YW1hbmRhQGJhcmNhLWxlZWRzLm9yZw==&amp;h=ebd9fbd9b5a34af6b44b94e35327a592&amp;t=bVZiQzB1T3hnaHJpa1hTNXVxd3dGUm1nSVB1N2ZtZ2drL3hVY1d0clRMMD0=\"> Dazl</a>. \u201cWe had 50 people out in their gardens and 30 joined in,\u201d says Sykes. For Demi, 13, who used to do activities such as football and cooking at the Fairfield Community Centre youth club in west Leeds,<strong> </strong>it made her day.<strong> </strong>\u201cI have been really bored since school shut, but today was brilliant,\u201d she says. Barca plans to roll out doorstep dance to other streets and start running doorstep sport sessions too.</p> <p>While digital support is better than no youth service at all, there are growing calls for youth centres to reopen. The NYA report calls for youth services to be designated as key work, so that youth workers can provide face-to-face support to vulnerable young people. \u201cThe risk to young people of catching coronavirus has to be balanced against the health risks of remaining in lockdown,\u201d says Middleton.</p> <p>In Wales, where the Welsh government still funds statutory youth services and last year announced a <a href=\"https://gov.wales/sites/default/files/publications/2019-06/youth-work-strategy-for-wales.pdf\">new youth work strategy</a> and a <a href=\"https://gov.wales/sites/default/files/publications/2019-12/2020-2021-draft-budget-narrative.pdf\">\u00a36.2m increase</a> in funding in its 2020-21 budget, some youth centres have stayed open during lockdown.</p> <p>David Williams, who manages Torfaen borough council\u2019s youth service, in south Wales, says that statutory youth workers are currently helping support vulnerable and at risk children in schools. And for care leavers, there is still a face-to-face service. Weekly appointments at the Ashley House Youth Centre are strictly spaced so that the building can be cleaned between visitors, a one-way system is in place to ensure social distancing and youth workers are only allowed into the building for the duration of their meeting with the young person. \u201cIt means we can ensure that they have a hot meal, that their phone is charged and clothes are cleaned,\u201d says Williams. \u201cBut most importantly, they get to speak to a youth worker, who in many cases will be the only person they have spoken to that week.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e7866d7fbac74124ac1cc9a0451929137c087aa3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7866d7fbac74124ac1cc9a0451929137c087aa3/0_0_478_638/375.jpg\" alt=\"Gavin Gibbs, from Torfaen Youth Service, talking to a care leaver outside Ashley House Youth Club, Cwmbran.\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gavin Gibbs, from Torfaen Youth Service, talking to a care leaver outside Ashley House Youth Club, Cwmbran, in south Wales.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Torfaen Youth Service</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Steve Elliott (not his real name), 19, who lives alone in supported accommodation, the appointments have been a lifeline. \u201cI usually do lots of activities with the youth service and was really worried about it all ending,\u201d he says. \u201cSo meeting Gav [my youth worker] gives me structure to my week \u2013 it\u2019s a real highlight.

They are now targeting all civilians in the conflict area, with people from Rakhine, Rohingya, Mro, Daignet and Chin communities being killed in recent months,\u201d said Lee, who is concluding her tenure as special rapporteur.</p> <p>Lee cited a recent artillery attack, on 13 April, in which eight civilians died, including at least two children, when the military targeted Kyauk Seik village in Ponnagyun township.</p> <p>\u201cThe Tatmadaw is systematically violating the most fundamental principles of international humanitarian law and human rights. Its conduct against the civilian population of Rakhine and Chin states may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity,\u201d she added.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/myanmar-editor-could-face-life-in-jail-for-interviewing-rebel\">Myanmar blocks hundreds of news sites and threatens editor with life in jail</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has urged warring parties globally to put down their weapons so that all efforts could be focused on protecting civilians from the spread of Covid-19. Humanitarian agencies fear communities in conflict areas are especially vulnerable to the virus, which could spread quickly in camps where displaced people are living in close quarters with extremely limited access to healthcare. <br><br>Earlier this month, a driver working for the World Health Organization who was transporting swabs from patients to be tested for coronavirus was killed after his vehicle was attacked by gunfire in Rakhine state. Both Myanmar\u2019s army and the Arakan Army denied responsibility for the attack.</p> <p>More than 157,000 people have been displaced since the conflict began, according to the UN. Vast numbers of people have been cut off from aid by the military, including 8,000 displaced people sheltering in Paletwa township in Chin.</p> <p>Internet access is also blocked in many conflict-affected areas, meaning people have little access to information about how to protect themselves against the coronavirus, and making it harder for communities to document atrocities committed by armed actors. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/myanmar-editor-could-face-life-in-jail-for-interviewing-rebel\">crackdown on journalists</a> has also been ramped up, forcing editors to live in hiding and further restricting information about human rights abuses.</p> <p>Civilians have also been affected by violence carried out by the Arakan Army, which has kidnapped local officials and parliamentarians. Just weeks ago, the group is reported to have abducted an elected member of a Paletwa township committee. However the Arakan Army has declared a unilateral ceasefire, which has improved protections for civilians.</p> <p>Lee called for an investigation into allegations of ongoing war crimes and crimes against humanity in both Rakhine and Chin states, to ensure perpetrators are held to account. Lee also urged the UN to increase protections for civilians.</p>",

For decades, its tactics have intentionally maximised civilian suffering; we all know what they did to the Rohingya in 2017. They are now targeting all civilians in the conflict area, with people from Rakhine, Rohingya, Mro, Daignet and Chin communities being killed in recent months,\u201d said Lee, who is concluding her tenure as special rapporteur. Lee cited a recent artillery attack, on 13 April, in which eight civilians died, including at least two children, when the military targeted Kyauk Seik village in Ponnagyun township. \u201cThe Tatmadaw is systematically violating the most fundamental principles of international humanitarian law and human rights. Its conduct against the civilian population of Rakhine and Chin states may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity,\u201d she added. The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has urged warring parties globally to put down their weapons so that all efforts could be focused on protecting civilians from the spread of Covid-19. Humanitarian agencies fear communities in conflict areas are especially vulnerable to the virus, which could spread quickly in camps where displaced people are living in close quarters with extremely limited access to healthcare. Earlier this month, a driver working for the World Health Organization who was transporting swabs from patients to be tested for coronavirus was killed after his vehicle was attacked by gunfire in Rakhine state. Both Myanmar\u2019s army and the Arakan Army denied responsibility for the attack. More than 157,000 people have been displaced since the conflict began, according to the UN. Vast numbers of people have been cut off from aid by the military, including 8,000 displaced people sheltering in Paletwa township in Chin. Internet access is also blocked in many conflict-affected areas, meaning people have little access to information about how to protect themselves against the coronavirus, and making it harder for communities to document atrocities committed by armed actors. A crackdown on journalists has also been ramped up, forcing editors to live in hiding and further restricting information about human rights abuses. Civilians have also been affected by violence carried out by the Arakan Army, which has kidnapped local officials and parliamentarians. Just weeks ago, the group is reported to have abducted an elected member of a Paletwa township committee. However the Arakan Army has declared a unilateral ceasefire, which has improved protections for civilians. Lee called for an investigation into allegations of ongoing war crimes and crimes against humanity in both Rakhine and Chin states, to ensure perpetrators are held to account. Lee also urged the UN to increase protections for civilians.",

Giving evidence to a parliamentary inquiry into the effectiveness of UK aid, Trevelyan said her biggest fear was that the secondary impact of the health crisis would be felt by the world\u2019s poorest for years to come. \u201cWe have before us a health crisis, a humanitarian crisis and an economic crisis which threaten to undo 30 years of international development work,\u201d she said. \u201cThe devastating impacts are already being seen both at home and abroad. My personal profoundest concern is that the secondary impacts will be felt for years to come for the poorest, most disproportionately affected.\u201d \u201cThe reality is that no one if safe until we are all safe. So finding treatments and a vaccine will be critical to allow the world\u2019s economic activity to go back to some sort of new normal.\u201d Trevelyan told MPs she was really proud that the UK was at the forefront of the global response and had been repurposing aid and expertise to work on solutions in the UK and across the world. The UK is a leading donor to coronavirus research for testing and developing a vaccine, and has pledged \u00a3744m towards the international response to developing countries in the Covid-19 crisis. Trevelyan said: \u201cThe reality is that the humanitarian picture is bleak right now. The threat of famines, exacerbated by the worst locust plague for 70 years, weak healthcare system allowing the spread of the disease and economic disruptions hitting the world\u2019s poorest and threatening a global recession and a much longer and harder road back to recovery.\u201d Last week, the head of the UN\u2019s food agency warned of widespread famine \u201cof biblical proportions\u201d because of the coronavirus pandemic. Members of the international development committee, in its first virtual evidence session, asked Trevelyan about the plans to merge the Department for International Development (DfID) with the FCO Foreign Office (FCO) and whether poverty reduction would remain a priority. Last month, Boris Johnson was accused by Labour and charities of taking British aid policy backwards by linking aid to the UK\u2019s trade goals and insisting DfID missions in other countries report to FCO ambassadors. Trevelyan was asked if the new reporting arrangements were intended to be a merged \u201cby the back door\u201d, she said: \u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t agree with that statement. That isn\u2019t what it is.\u201d Asked whether poverty reduction would remain a priority, in a refreshed DfID strategy, she said it would be. Nick Dyer, acting permanent secretary for DfID, told the committee that Covid-19 was a perfect example of how the new joint ministerial arrangements made sense, because it brought diplomatic and development levers together. Trevelyan said the government remained committed to the 0.7% of gross national income target for aid funding, despite the health crisis and she believed that having DfID separate from the FCO, with two secretaries of state, was good for global leadership and presented a \u201creally good message to the rest of the world\u201d. The committee, chaired by MP Sarah Champion, also asked Trevelyan whether the government was considering its own definition of overseas development assistance (ODA). The secretary of state replied that she believed the ODA rules are \u201csensible, really broad and countries are using them in different ways\u201d. Earlier, James Cleverly, joint FCO/DfID minister of state for the Middle East and North Africa, told MPs that the \u201cUK does not have tied aid\u201d.",

Climate campaigners believe it could be one of the first places where a decision is made to \u201ckeep it in the ground\u201d.</p> \n<p>The Argentinian government threw the project into limbo last week, when the minister of productive development, Mat\u00edas Kulfas, called Vaca Muerta \u201can issue that will have to wait\u201d until the crisis was over. Last month, the chairman of Argentina\u2019s national oil company, YPF, <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dead-cow-oil-play-set-155931929.html\">said</a> the oil price collapse \u201cputs all Argentine oil production in doubt\u201d.</p> \n<p>As elsewhere in the world, key decisions have been put on hold. But more than any other country, the IMF will play an unusually crucial role in deciding the project\u2019s fate \u2013 and this will send a strong signal about the stance of international institutions in shaping the post-pandemic world.</p> \n<p>Two years ago, the IMF made its largest ever loan of $44bn (\u00a335bn) to help Argentina through a debt crisis that continues today. A new restructuring is now being arranged by the fund, which also expects to conduct its annual \u201chealth check\u201d on the country next month. That will include a review of Vaca Muerta.</p> \n<p>Initially, the IMF promoted this project as a way for Argentina to earn foreign currency and become more energy independent. But \u2013 with growing pressure on international institutions to back away from fossil fuels \u2013 the fund insisted last year that Argentina cut subsidies for Vaca Muerta. This was potentially fatal even before the pandemic.</p> \n<p>The Argentinian government has had to lure foreign oil companies including Chevron, Shell, ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips and Pan American Energy (a British Petroleum subsidiary) with billions of dollars in subsidies. Without this financial crutch, projects could not stand up economically even at an oil price far higher than the current level of about $20 a barrel. The region was too remote, transport links too poor and local demand too weak. The project has also faced fierce opposition from the Mapuche indigenous community who say their territory has been stolen and contaminated for the benefit of foreigners. This made it one of the world\u2019s most <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/14/indigenous-mapuche-argentina-fracking-communities\">expensive and controversial</a> fossil fuel projects.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7544779e8a304c792c2e9dbc3d5d90583ac92c25\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7544779e8a304c792c2e9dbc3d5d90583ac92c25/0_570_8516_5108/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman wrapped in a flag with oil facilities in the distance\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lorena Bravo, a spokesperson for members of the Mapuche indigenous community, who say their territory has been contaminated.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emiliano Lasalvia/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The lockdown is another blow. \u201cThe historical drop in oil prices is a new sign of the infeasibility of Vaca Muerta,\u201d said Fernando Cabrera of the independent watchdog Observatorio Petrolero Sur in Neuqu\u00e9n. \u201cWe have long warned there was a lack of essential export infrastructure, weak global demand and over-dependence on subsidies which Argentina cannot afford due to its debt crisis. The pandemic deepens the problems.\u201d</p> \n<p>Veteran Argentinian oil executives \u2013 known inside the industry as <em>viejos petroleros</em> or old oil tankers \u2013 are pressing the government to go ahead with Vaca Muerta, to inflate the oil price inside the country, and to pass on the costs to drivers at the pumps. \u201cIn this industry you have to do what nobody does. Don\u2019t go after the herd,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.mejorinformado.com/plus-energtico/2020/4/26/vaca-muerta-no-hay-que-ir-detras-de-la-manada-62248.html\">wrote Jos\u00e9 Luis Sureda</a>, a former government secretary of hydrocarbon resources. But without funds, the government\u2019s hands are tied.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe demand and price crash is certainly disrupting the Argentinian government\u2019s fossil fuel expansion plans in the short term,\u201d said Lorne Stockman, a senior research analyst at <a href=\"www.priceofoil.org\">Oil Change International</a>. He said this was part of a global trend. Dozens of planned oil and gas projects are likely to be scrapped or indefinitely postponed, including three liquid natural gas plants in Brownsville, Texas, and many US offshore oil terminals. Canadian tar sands, Brazilian offshore oil wells, and Guyana drilling projects will also struggle to break even.</p> \n<p>At a price of $35 per barrel, 4% of existing oil supply becomes uneconomical, according to a <a href=\"https://www.woodmac.com/news/feature/how-will-the-oil-price-crash-hit-the-upstream-sector/\">recent study</a> by the energy industry analysts Wood Mackenzie. If values fall below $25 \u2013 as they have in the US \u2013 this loss-making share rises to 9% \u2013 equivalent to 10m barrels per day.</p> \n<p>The situation is even tougher for new oil and gas projects. At $35 a barrel, 75% of new oil and gas projects fail to cover their financing costs.</p> \n<p>Since the start of the pandemic, the world\u2019s major oil companies have <a href=\"https://www.woodmac.com/news/feature/how-will-the-oil-price-crash-hit-the-upstream-sector/\">cut capital investment by almost $25bn</a>. This will make it difficult for companies to reach their production forecasts. Last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/10/oil-firms-barrels-markets\">the Guardian revealed</a> that the world\u2019s 50 biggest oil companies planned to pump an additional 7m barrels per day by 2030. This is now far less likely.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf prices don\u2019t rebound, the taps will inevitably be turned off,\u201d the study warned. \u201cGiven the difficulties and costs associated with restarting mature production, a proportion of this supply may never return.\u201d</p> \n<p>How much will largely depend on government leadership, said Valentina Kretzschmar, the vice-president of corporate research at Wood Mackenzie. \u201cUltimately it is about demand. If there is demand for oil, it will be produced. It won\u2019t stay in the ground,\u201d she said. \u201cThe question is what we learn from the Covid crisis. How will it change us? How will governments respond? It will really be the government response that will have a huge impact on what happens next.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/28/un-chief-dont-use-taxpayer-money-to-save-polluting-industries\">UN chief: don\u2019t use taxpayer cash to rescue carbon-intensive industries</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The IMF said last year it would incorporate climate risks into decision-making, which could would undermine the already-weak viability of Vaca Muerta. Mar\u00eda Marta Di Paola, the director of research at the Environment and Natural Resources Foundation in Argentina, said the project was not aligned with the Paris climate agreement. \u201cIf the Vaca Muerta fracking expands as initially planned, its emissions will <a href=\"http://ggon.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GGON_OilGasClimate_English_Dec2019-1.pdf\">quadruple</a> by 2050,\u201d she wrote.</p> \n<p>Stockman urged the IMF, Argentina and other governments to move away from fossil fuels in their economic stimulus packages. More subsidies, he said, would simply set up another boom and bust in the future. \u201cRather than bailing companies out so that executives and shareholders are protected, governments should be using the stimulus to support clean energy production and demand, and help workers transition. That is not happening.\u201d</p> \n<p>While a lot of projects look uneconomic in the current situation, few are being actively scrapped when the prospects of a price spike may be only a year or so away.

      "bodyText": "Whether the post-pandemic world moves back to fossil fuels or forward to a clean economy will become clearer in the coming weeks as the International Monetary Fund and Argentina decide whether to continue support for the vast Vaca Muerta oil and gas fields in Patagonia. The development aims to tap the second biggest shale deposits on the planet (after the Permian basin in Texas), but its future has been thrown in doubt by the coronavirus lockdown, which has induced the steepest fall of the oil price in 30 years. Analysts say Vaca Muerta (which means Dead Cow in English) is now among the most economically vulnerable fossil fuel projects in the world. Climate campaigners believe it could be one of the first places where a decision is made to \u201ckeep it in the ground\u201d. The Argentinian government threw the project into limbo last week, when the minister of productive development, Mat\u00edas Kulfas, called Vaca Muerta \u201can issue that will have to wait\u201d until the crisis was over. Last month, the chairman of Argentina\u2019s national oil company, YPF, said the oil price collapse \u201cputs all Argentine oil production in doubt\u201d. As elsewhere in the world, key decisions have been put on hold. But more than any other country, the IMF will play an unusually crucial role in deciding the project\u2019s fate \u2013 and this will send a strong signal about the stance of international institutions in shaping the post-pandemic world. Two years ago, the IMF made its largest ever loan of $44bn (\u00a335bn) to help Argentina through a debt crisis that continues today. A new restructuring is now being arranged by the fund, which also expects to conduct its annual \u201chealth check\u201d on the country next month. That will include a review of Vaca Muerta. Initially, the IMF promoted this project as a way for Argentina to earn foreign currency and become more energy independent. But \u2013 with growing pressure on international institutions to back away from fossil fuels \u2013 the fund insisted last year that Argentina cut subsidies for Vaca Muerta. This was potentially fatal even before the pandemic. The Argentinian government has had to lure foreign oil companies including Chevron, Shell, ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips and Pan American Energy (a British Petroleum subsidiary) with billions of dollars in subsidies. Without this financial crutch, projects could not stand up economically even at an oil price far higher than the current level of about $20 a barrel. The region was too remote, transport links too poor and local demand too weak. The project has also faced fierce opposition from the Mapuche indigenous community who say their territory has been stolen and contaminated for the benefit of foreigners. This made it one of the world\u2019s most expensive and controversial fossil fuel projects. The lockdown is another blow. \u201cThe historical drop in oil prices is a new sign of the infeasibility of Vaca Muerta,\u201d said Fernando Cabrera of the independent watchdog Observatorio Petrolero Sur in Neuqu\u00e9n. \u201cWe have long warned there was a lack of essential export infrastructure, weak global demand and over-dependence on subsidies which Argentina cannot afford due to its debt crisis. The pandemic deepens the problems.\u201d Veteran Argentinian oil executives \u2013 known inside the industry as viejos petroleros or old oil tankers \u2013 are pressing the government to go ahead with Vaca Muerta, to inflate the oil price inside the country, and to pass on the costs to drivers at the pumps. \u201cIn this industry you have to do what nobody does. Don\u2019t go after the herd,\u201d wrote Jos\u00e9 Luis Sureda, a former government secretary of hydrocarbon resources. But without funds, the government\u2019s hands are tied. \u201cThe demand and price crash is certainly disrupting the Argentinian government\u2019s fossil fuel expansion plans in the short term,\u201d said Lorne Stockman, a senior research analyst at Oil Change International. He said this was part of a global trend. Dozens of planned oil and gas projects are likely to be scrapped or indefinitely postponed, including three liquid natural gas plants in Brownsville, Texas, and many US offshore oil terminals. Canadian tar sands, Brazilian offshore oil wells, and Guyana drilling projects will also struggle to break even. At a price of $35 per barrel, 4% of existing oil supply becomes uneconomical, according to a recent study by the energy industry analysts Wood Mackenzie. If values fall below $25 \u2013 as they have in the US \u2013 this loss-making share rises to 9% \u2013 equivalent to 10m barrels per day. The situation is even tougher for new oil and gas projects. At $35 a barrel, 75% of new oil and gas projects fail to cover their financing costs. Since the start of the pandemic, the world\u2019s major oil companies have cut capital investment by almost $25bn. This will make it difficult for companies to reach their production forecasts. Last year, the Guardian revealed that the world\u2019s 50 biggest oil companies planned to pump an additional 7m barrels per day by 2030. This is now far less likely. \u201cIf prices don\u2019t rebound, the taps will inevitably be turned off,\u201d the study warned. \u201cGiven the difficulties and costs associated with restarting mature production, a proportion of this supply may never return.\u201d How much will largely depend on government leadership, said Valentina Kretzschmar, the vice-president of corporate research at Wood Mackenzie. \u201cUltimately it is about demand. If there is demand for oil, it will be produced. It won\u2019t stay in the ground,\u201d she said. \u201cThe question is what we learn from the Covid crisis. How will it change us? How will governments respond? It will really be the government response that will have a huge impact on what happens next.\u201d The IMF said last year it would incorporate climate risks into decision-making, which could would undermine the already-weak viability of Vaca Muerta. Mar\u00eda Marta Di Paola, the director of research at the Environment and Natural Resources Foundation in Argentina, said the project was not aligned with the Paris climate agreement. \u201cIf the Vaca Muerta fracking expands as initially planned, its emissions will quadruple by 2050,\u201d she wrote. Stockman urged the IMF, Argentina and other governments to move away from fossil fuels in their economic stimulus packages. More subsidies, he said, would simply set up another boom and bust in the future. \u201cRather than bailing companies out so that executives and shareholders are protected, governments should be using the stimulus to support clean energy production and demand, and help workers transition. That is not happening.\u201d While a lot of projects look uneconomic in the current situation, few are being actively scrapped when the prospects of a price spike may be only a year or so away. Once again, the absence of policies to guide and manage a transition are failing us on climate, as well as on equity, justice and preventing the next disaster.",

Released in 2002, The Warrior was selected for the prestigious San Sebasti\u00e1n film festival and won the Bafta award for best British film.

May his soul rest in peace.\u201d Fellow Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan said Khan\u2019s death left a \u201chuge vacuum\u201d. \u201cAn incredible talent, a gracious colleague, a prolific contributor to the world of cinema \u2026 left us too soon,\u201d tweeted Bachchan. \u201cThe charisma you brought to everything you did was pure magic,\u201d tweeted Priyanka Chopra. \u201cYour talent forged the way for so many in so many avenues. You inspired so many of us. Irrfan Khan you will truly be missed. Condolences to the family.\u201d Indian politician Rahul Gandhi described Khan as a \u201cversatile and talented actor\u201d who would be \u201cgreatly missed\u201d while Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said India had lost \u201cone of the most exceptional actors of our time.\u201d In March 2018, Khan revealed he had been diagnosed with a neuroendocrine tumour, but after extensive treatment he recovered well enough to shoot Angrezi Medium, the film that would turn out to be his last, and whose release this March was cut short because of the coronavirus pandemic. Best known to English-speaking audiences as the police inspector in Slumdog Millionaire and for his roles in Jurassic World and Life of Pi, Khan was a Bollywood mainstay, acting in hits such as Haider, Piku and Hindi Medium. \u201cI always object to the word Bollywood,\u201d he told the Guardian in 2013. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to have that name. Because that industry has its own technique, its own way of making films that has nothing to do with aping Hollywood. It originates in Parsi theatre.\u201d Khan was born Saahabzaade Irfan Ali Khan in Jaipur in 1966, the son of a tyre seller, and went to drama school after failing as a cricketer. He struggled to make headway in the film industry, despite being cast in a small role as a letter writer in Mira Nair\u2019s 1988 Salaam Bombay! \u2013 to his frustration he only managed to find regular work in low-grade TV soap operas. \u201cI came into this industry to tell stories and do cinema and I was stuck in television,\u201d he told the Guardian. Khan\u2019s breakthrough role came from an unlikely source: the feature debut of then-unknown British director Asif Kapadia, whose low budget samurai-esque tale, The Warrior, was shot in India. Released in 2002, The Warrior was selected for the prestigious San Sebasti\u00e1n film festival and won the Bafta award for best British film. Khan subsequently broke into mainstream Indian films, often playing cops or villains \u2013 including the title role of Maqbool, an adaptation of Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth set in the Mumbai underworld. More orthodox Bollywood productions followed, such as Rog and the slice-of-life musical Life in a \u2026 Metro. Khan also maintained a parallel career in British-American cinema: he played the chief of police in Michael Winterbottom\u2019s A Mighty Heart, and another police officer in Slumdog Millionaire, which won eight Oscars. In later roles, he became a reliable standby character actor in big-budget Hollywood films, playing a doctor in The Amazing Spider-Man in 2012 and businessmen in Jurassic World (2015) and Inferno (2016). In 2012, he also played the adult version of the lead character in another Oscar-winner: Life of Pi, directed by Ang Lee. Director Wes Anderson said he specifically wrote a small role for Khan in his film The Darjeeling Limited just so they could work together. Meanwhile, Khan found box-office success with the Indian-produced art film The Lunchbox, in which he played an accountant who strikes up a letter-writing romance with unhappy housewife Nimrat Kaur. Khan also continued his high Bollywood profile with significant roles in the Amitabh Bachchan comedy Piku and Hindi Medium, as a rich businessman trying to get his daughter into a good school. Khan is survived by his wife, Sutapa Sikdar, and sons Babil and Ayan.",

      "bodyText": "It has been two months since Andi Rizky last saw her uncle Jimmy, a drug offender in Cilegon Prison, Banten province, in person. Since the middle of March, the prison has banned visitors because of concerns about the spread of the coronavirus. In 10-minute video calls to replace the visits, the pair have discussed the Indonesian government\u2019s plan to release thousands of prisoners. Jimmy, 56, constantly asks Rizky to investigate the possibility that he may qualify for the Covid-19 pardon programme. He is very scared of getting infected. But those with short drug sentences or political convictions are not eligible. Jimmy shares a cell with nine other men. They sleep crammed together, filling the cell floor. Prison food is pretty dire. Three times a day inmates are given a bowl of wrapped rice with scraps of salted fish. Those who can afford it buy bread and instant noodles as additional staples. In such conditions, fear of the pandemic among Indonesian prisoners and their families has erupted in violent riots in several prisons in recent weeks. The death of a high-profile prisoner who had coronavirus symptoms has added to those fears. Hermanus Bin Bison, 35, a father of two, was among three indigenous farmers from central Kalimantan jailed in February, after they were accused of stealing fruit from a plantation. The owners of the plantation had themselves been accused of stealing the farmers\u2019 land. Rights activists had been asking for medical attention for Bin Bison, but he died after spending weeks in overcrowded jail cells. Prison protests began on 12 April when, as Indonesian Christians celebrated Easter, a riot broke out in Manado prison, North Sulawesi, after a group of drug convicts demanded to be released. Prisoners torched the jail and several were injured. The Indonesian government is processing 50,000 people, including children, for release as concern grows over the spread of the pandemic. As of Tuesday, Indonesia had 9,096 confirmed cases and 765 deaths. The decision to start releasing prisoners came after Human Rights Watch (HRW) called on Indonesian authorities to curb the spread of Covid-19 in overcrowded prisons. According to the HRW\u2019s data, last month the country\u2019s prisons and detention centres held almost 270,000 inmates, more than double the total capacity. \u201cFirst [thing] is to immediately release all those wrongfully held behind bars, including all Papua political prisoners,\u201d said Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch. But the government\u2019s plans apparently include releasing those convicted of corruption, as well as prisoners who have already served 10 years of a drug sentence and 53 foreign prisoners who have served two-thirds of their sentences. This plan is seen by some as favouring public officials jailed for corruption or \u201cgraft\u201d offences, including Setya Novanto and Suryadharma Ali \u2013 men from political circles who were convicted of stealing public funds. \u201cIf we look at the data, the overcrowded prison is because we have a large number of prisoners convicted of drug crimes, not corruption. Logically, if we release the corruptor, the prison will still be overcrowded,\u201d Jakarta Legal Aid director Asfinawati told the Guardian. A study from the prison Corruption Eradication Commission released on 3 April said those convicted of corruption charges are on their own in cells, such as in Sukamiskin, Bandung, one of the few prisons under capacity, and already enjoy better facilities. Asfinawati and others want the government to prioritise the vastly larger numbers of prisoners convicted on lesser criminal charges or for political activism. Images received by the Guardian from a source inside Salemba prison, show a large cell with hundreds of people sharing the space, their clothes hanging lengthwise around the walls. There is one toilet. Since the coronavirus outbreak, Surya Anta Ginting, spokesperson for the Indonesian People\u2019s Front for West Papua, and a political prisoner, has complained about his health. \u201cI have fever and fatigue, I am afraid,\u201d he told Suarbudaya Rahadian, a priest at Salemba prison. Rika Aprianti, spokesperson of the Directorate General of Corrections, told the Guardian conditions inside Indonesia\u2019s prisons were far better than the reports. She denied all the criticisms, saying the directorate provides adequate health facilities in collaboration with the health ministry. \u201cWe are working hard,\u201d she said. Sixty-three political prisoners, including the \u201cJakarta six\u201d, detained on treason charges in Indonesia have made a joint urgent appeal to the UN to intervene in the release programme. Jennifer Robinson, lawyer for the Jakarta Six, said: \u201cThese urgent appeals have been made given the imminent threat to the prisoners\u2019 lives from being detained in overcrowded prisons amid the Covid-19 pandemic in Indonesia. \u201cTheir detention is now not only unlawful but life-threatening. All 63 prisoners should be immediately and unconditionally released.\u201d President Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo has said he had agreed to the release of some inmates from prisons considered at risk of rapid Covid-19 transmission, but only with certain requirements. \u201cThey cannot be released just like that, of course. There are conditions, and there will be supervision. The [early] release is only for general crime inmates.\u201d But more prisoners are also being incarcerated. On 25 April six political prisoners were given jail sentences of between eight and nine months for treason. Their crimes: singing a song, waving a morning star flag, and chanting \u201cfreedom West Papua\u201d while protesting at what they say is racism from Indonesian security forces towards indigenous Papuans. Rahardian is still hoping the government will change its mind on the political prisoners. \u201cI think if we want to apply this for the sake of humanity, these political prisoners should be treated fairly. They should get the offer first, not the corruptors,\u201d he said. In Depok, Rizky is still waiting for the government\u2019s decision but has little hope. She hopes her uncle stays healthy while in prison, and that the government improves the facility. \u201cIf something happens, they will not be able to handle it,\u201d she said.",

In <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=25033&amp;LangID=E\">Nigeria</a> nearly 70% of urban populations live informally and 130 million people lack access to adequate sanitation.</p> <p>In Dharavi, Mumbai, one of the largest informal settlements in the world, the <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/concerns-mumbai-dharavi-slum-reports-covid-19-cases-200403053646046.html\">population density</a> is 277,000 people per square km; in <a href=\"https://journals.openedition.org/eastafrica/521?lang=en\">Kibera</a>, the largest slum in Kenya, it\u2019s 300,000. By way of comparison, <a href=\"https://worldpopulationreview.com/boroughs/manhattan-population/\">Manhattan\u2019s</a> density is 27,350 people per square km. <br><br>\u201cStay at home\u201d orders also assume households have the financial means to do so. The unaffordability of housing has plagued renters the world over, with countless households living month to month. Rents have soared as institutional investors eat up more and more stock. Now, with unemployment skyrocketing and a deep, potentially lasting recession, many tenants are moving from the frying pan into the fire.<br></p> <p>A few surprising policies have emerged. Governments in <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/international/2020/04/12/might-the-pandemic-be-a-lifeline-for-the-rich-worlds-homeless\">Berlin and Denmark</a> have re-purposed youth hostels; the UK boasts having <a href=\"https://twitter.com/robertjenrick/status/1251828247538667522?s=12\">housed 90% of rough sleepers</a>; and <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/493499-newsom-says-california-now-has-over-15000-hotel-rooms-for-homeless\">California</a> \u2013 the hotbed of homelessness in North America \u2013 has acquired 15,000 hotel rooms for homeless people to shelter.</p> <p>Governments in several African countries, including <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLuy0s2Al2k\">Kenya</a> and <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/water/brief/wash-water-sanitation-hygiene-and-covid-19\">Ethiopia</a>, have committed to getting water and sanitation facilities to informal settlements; and a water company has ensured shared taps are in place in a settlement in <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/blog/2020/04/coronavirus-inequality-cities\">Rio de Janeiro</a>.</p> <p>Perhaps most surprising of all are moratoriums on evictions as seen in <a href=\"https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/rental-housing/covid-19-eviction-bans-and-suspensions-to-support-renters\">Canada</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/millionacres/real-estate-market/articles/cities-and-states-that-have-paused-evictions-due-to-covid-19/\">US</a> and <a href=\"https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/spain-bans-evictions-to-ease-virus-hardship/1786986\">Spain</a>, where suspension of utilities due to non-payment is also prohibited. Changes to mortgage payments through short-term <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51814481\">deferrals</a> \u2013 unthinkable six weeks ago \u2013 are part of many packages being adopted.</p> <p>These developments could be signs of a better, post-pandemic world where governments view housing as a social good and a human right. Scratch the surface, however, and what you\u2019ll find is very familiar.</p> <p>For example, the trend to criminalise homeless people continues. In a number of cities in <a href=\"https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/coronavirus-impact-on-homessless-population/\">France</a> and <a href=\"https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/multiple-homeless-montrealers-given-tickets-for-physical-distancing-infractions-1.4893128\">elsewhere</a>, homeless people are being ticketed for being on the streets in violation of lockdown and physical distancing rules, though they have nowhere to go. In other areas, governments continue to exhibit indifference to the wellbeing of homeless people, reinterpreting the \u201cstay home/physical distance\u201d policy to mean living in overcrowded shelters, mega-tents or convention centres.</p> <p>Critics say the approach to informal settlements in the global south has largely been \u201c<a href=\"https://mg.co.za/article/2020-04-12-covid-19-and-the-call-for-solidarity-challenges-for-informal-settlements/\">firefighting</a>\u201d, suggesting there is no long-term plan to address overcrowding and the lack of basic services.</p> <p>Reports are also emerging that removing tenants from property is still commonplace, with <a href=\"https://time.com/5820634/evictions-coronavirus/\">landlords in the US</a>, for example, flouting the moratorium on eviction. It has also come to light that under most mortgage deferral schemes, including in <a href=\"https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/banks-confirm-six-month-mortgage-payment-deferral-due-coronavirus-but-interest-still-accrues\">New Zealand</a>, interest will continue to accrue and is added to the principal loan to be paid back post-pandemic, which means simply a deferral of debt owed, and a likely longer-term mortgage. Meanwhile <a href=\"https://t.co/uLg5yfzklH?amp=1\">private equity firms</a> are chomping at the bit, waiting for residential real estate to come on the market so they can make money.</p> <p>Policies that ensure access to adequate housing for everyone remain a blind spot. In other words, governments are failing to do what they are obliged to, pandemic or not, under international human rights law: implement the right to housing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/20/society-weekly-email-newsletter-sign-up\">Sign up for Society Weekly: our newsletter for public service professionals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Here\u2019s a to-do list:</p> <ul> <li><p>Ensure access to emergency and long-term housing for people who are homeless, including through securing hotel and hostel rooms and other vacant units.</p></li> <li><p>Cease all forced evictions and evictions into homelessness.</p></li> <li><p>Regularlise informal settlements and ensure they have access to water and sanitation.</p></li> <li><p>Regulate housing costs so they are commensurate with household income.</p></li> <li><p>Prohibit speculative investment in housing that contributes to unaffordability and eviction.</p></li> </ul> <p>As the world waits for a viable vaccine to eliminate the virus, now is a good time to start on housing rights for all.</p> <p>\u2022 Leilani Farha is the UN special rapporteur on adequate housing</p>",

The unaffordability of housing has plagued renters the world over, with countless households living month to month. Rents have soared as institutional investors eat up more and more stock. Now, with unemployment skyrocketing and a deep, potentially lasting recession, many tenants are moving from the frying pan into the fire. A few surprising policies have emerged. Governments in Berlin and Denmark have re-purposed youth hostels; the UK boasts having housed 90% of rough sleepers; and California \u2013 the hotbed of homelessness in North America \u2013 has acquired 15,000 hotel rooms for homeless people to shelter. Governments in several African countries, including Kenya and Ethiopia, have committed to getting water and sanitation facilities to informal settlements; and a water company has ensured shared taps are in place in a settlement in Rio de Janeiro. Perhaps most surprising of all are moratoriums on evictions as seen in Canada, the US and Spain, where suspension of utilities due to non-payment is also prohibited. Changes to mortgage payments through short-term deferrals \u2013 unthinkable six weeks ago \u2013 are part of many packages being adopted. These developments could be signs of a better, post-pandemic world where governments view housing as a social good and a human right. Scratch the surface, however, and what you\u2019ll find is very familiar. For example, the trend to criminalise homeless people continues. In a number of cities in France and elsewhere, homeless people are being ticketed for being on the streets in violation of lockdown and physical distancing rules, though they have nowhere to go. In other areas, governments continue to exhibit indifference to the wellbeing of homeless people, reinterpreting the \u201cstay home/physical distance\u201d policy to mean living in overcrowded shelters, mega-tents or convention centres. Critics say the approach to informal settlements in the global south has largely been \u201cfirefighting\u201d, suggesting there is no long-term plan to address overcrowding and the lack of basic services. Reports are also emerging that removing tenants from property is still commonplace, with landlords in the US, for example, flouting the moratorium on eviction. It has also come to light that under most mortgage deferral schemes, including in New Zealand, interest will continue to accrue and is added to the principal loan to be paid back post-pandemic, which means simply a deferral of debt owed, and a likely longer-term mortgage. Meanwhile private equity firms are chomping at the bit, waiting for residential real estate to come on the market so they can make money. Policies that ensure access to adequate housing for everyone remain a blind spot. In other words, governments are failing to do what they are obliged to, pandemic or not, under international human rights law: implement the right to housing. Here\u2019s a to-do list: Ensure access to emergency and long-term housing for people who are homeless, including through securing hotel and hostel rooms and other vacant units. Cease all forced evictions and evictions into homelessness. Regularlise informal settlements and ensure they have access to water and sanitation. Regulate housing costs so they are commensurate with household income. Prohibit speculative investment in housing that contributes to unaffordability and eviction. As the world waits for a viable vaccine to eliminate the virus, now is a good time to start on housing rights for all. \u2022 Leilani Farha is the UN special rapporteur on adequate housing",

      "body": "<p>Since the lockdown began, time and memory seem to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/24/lockdown-time-coronavirus-prisoners\">lost all meaning</a>. In March, the days seemed incredibly long, interspersed by daily news that had radical effects on our lives. I found myself saying things like, \u201ccan you believe it\u2019s only been three days since we went into lockdown\u201d? Now, in April, the converse is true. I often find myself trying to remember whether it has been two, three or five weeks since this first started.</p> <p>During lockdown, the passing of time has come to resemble a Salvador Dal\u00ed dreamscape. The surrealist artist\u2019s famous painting of melting clocks includes a silver pocketwatch draped like a shirt hung up to dry over a dead tree branch. Like overripe cheese, his clocks are soft and malleable, and represent what Dal\u00ed referred to as \u201cthe camembert of time\u201d. In an attempt to challenge our sense of reality, he titled this piece <a href=\"https://uk.phaidon.com/agenda/art/articles/2016/may/10/salvador-dalis-the-persistence-of-memory-explained/\">The Persistence of Memory</a>. It reminds us that time and memory are inherently linked, and neither are as rigid as we seem to think.</p> <p>The fact that every day is objectively the same length doesn\u2019t matter nearly as much as how long every day <em>feels</em>. Research has shown that we perceive time passing more slowly if it is \u201cempty\u201d \u2013 bringing to mind the proverb that a watched kettle never boils. When there is little perceptible change, and it feels like nothing is really happening, time feels like it is stretched \u2013 like one of Dal\u00ed\u2019s clocks.</p> <p>But the opposite is true when we assess time retrospectively. When we are looking back, an eventful minute feels like it was longer than an uneventful one. Similarly, we find that when remembering the past, we perceive a year as longer if it included more memorable events. The more unique or important events you can remember from a period of your life, the longer that period is likely to feel in retrospect.</p> <p>No matter who you are, your life has probably <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/how-will-the-world-emerge-from-the-coronavirus-crisis\">quite suddenly changed</a> from having a diverse range of experiences \u2013 going to work, socialising with friends, going to events \u2013 to feeling much more repetitive. Perhaps you are now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/apr/27/stock-markets-rally-covid-19-lockdown-oil-recession-ftse-business-live\">furloughed at home</a> without the routine of work to structure your day, or living in a wild turmoil of childcare and remote working, or you\u2019re an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/23/uk-key-workers-ppe-ministers-clapping-protect-nhs\">essential worker</a> who can\u2019t take part in the social activities that would normally break up your days.</p> <p>Often when we perceive time, what we\u2019re actually perceiving is change. If you have fewer changes in your life, you are going to struggle to perceive time as you normally would. This can help to explain why periods that are historically momentous seem longer. The lockdown could also have longer-term implications for how we<em> remember</em> time. The unprecedented situation we now find ourselves in will inevitably be recounted again and again once it\u2019s over. How will we remember this lockdown in a year, a decade, or 50 years from now?</p> <p>Our internal timelines, our autobiographical memories, need a \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d, or what memory<strong> </strong>researchers call <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/13/temporal-landmarks-oliver-burkeman\">\u201ctemporal landmarks\u201d</a>. These landmarks allow us to organise our lives into a story. Any good story relies on a narrative arc of emotional highs and lows, rather than a flat line of emotions and events. According to <a href=\"https://psyarxiv.com/sha8c/\">psychological researchers </a><a href=\"https://psyarxiv.com/sha8c/\">Johanna Peetz and Mariya Davydenko</a>, \u201cany important point in time that stands out in the everyday humdrum of life may be a temporal landmark\u201d. Maybe you organise your memories according to a particular point in time: after you fell in love with someone, before you got ill, or after you were promoted at work. Landmarks often include flashbulb memories of very intense moments of your life. These landmarks are intricately linked with how your autobiographical memory is structured.</p> <p>If we don\u2019t have suitable landmark memories, we are more likely to mistake what we did in the past. As time passes, this may even allow more room for memories of events that we never experienced at all. As a false memory researcher, this worries me. I\u2019ve found that <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614562862\">it\u2019s possible to implant false memories</a> of criminal or highly emotional events in people\u2019s minds \u2013 and that <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00650/full\">false memories of highly emotional events</a> can seem as \u201creal\u201d as those that are true. Without temporal landmarks, the profound illusions our memories are capable of generating are likely to be magnified.</p> <p>And the lack of temporal landmarks during the lockdown may lead to an increase in memory gaps.<strong> </strong>When we have gaps in our memories, our brains have a tendency to fill them, and sometimes we fill them with rubbish.

By recognising what influences your perception of time, you can regain some control over how you will remember this period of your life. If you want to parse the flow of your memory into meaningful pieces again, one of the most important things to avoid is routine.

      "bodyText": "From cheques bearing the signature of the market-loving president of the United States to mountains of state money being used around the world to help businesses and individuals \u2013 the era of big government is back. That may have seemed impossible in some countries in December, but the economic devastation of the pandemic has turned decades\u2019 worth of economic orthodoxies on their head. This, argues world affairs editor Julian Borger in this week\u2019s cover story, could be a moment of transformation on a par with the New Deal in 1930s America. Elsewhere in our latest extended look at the impact of the pandemic, Justin McCurry reports on how well the South Korean government handled the country\u2019s initially daunting outbreak.

Despite the success of some countries, the scientific and political consensus is that we cannot return to anything like normality until a vaccine is found. So how far are we away from one? This week, science correspondent Hannah Devlin goes on the trail of a working vaccine \u2013 from recently announced human trials at Oxford University to other labs around the world working to beat the virus.

The Anglicare chief executive, Grant Millard, said he had been told to anticipate more deaths this week, with 34 residents testing positive to the disease.

Western Australia and Queensland both recorded one new case on Wednesday. Victoria recorded three new cases and in NSW the total increased by 11. Victoria \u2018disappointed\u2019 by schools funding offer The federal government has offered to advance $13bn in funding to independent schools that commit to reopening by 1 May, in a move that has been criticised in Victoria as putting independent schools in \u201can extraordinarily difficult and unfair position\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The Victorian education minister, James Merlino, has condemned the \u201ccompletely inappropriate\u201d decision of the federal government to link Catholic and independent schools\u2019 funding to reopening campuses against state medical advice. The federal minister, Dan Tehan, has written to non-government schools offering to bring forward one quarter of their funding if they reopen in term two and half their students return to classrooms by 1 June. The decision prompted outrage from Independent Schools Victoria, which said it placed members in the \u201cextraordinarily difficult and unfair position\u201d of having to decide if they could provide a safe workplace by 1 May, the deadline to apply. Merlino said the federal plan was \u201cdisappointing\u201d because there was no need to link non-government schools funding to their decision to return to face-to-face teaching. \u201cWhat the federal government is doing is using funding to force non-government schools to ignore the expert medical advice of the Victorian chief health officer,\u201d he told reporters in Melbourne. \u201cExpert medical advice, not money, should determine whether schools open.\u201d Merlino said the Victorian government had a plan for a testing blitz of 100,000 people before the current state of emergency expired on 11 May and noted that \u201csettings may change\u201d after that date. Guardian Australia understands the federal intervention on Wednesday was unwelcome because it attempted to enlist non-government schools into pressuring the Victorian government to back down and also because the state was working on its own plan for a phased return to face-to-face learning in public schools by 1 June. On Wednesday the federal deputy chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, described 11 May as a \u201ctarget\u201d after which \u201cthere will be many announcements about changes in the way we\u2019ll be living our lives and hopefully getting back to some sort of new normality living in a Covid-19-safe society\u201d. It is unclear how many Victorian non-government schools will apply for early funding. Merlino said that he \u201cfeels for Victorian non-government schools\u201d but the move \u201cwon\u2019t force our hand\u201d. \u201cEvery decision we\u2019ve made has been by expert medical advice ... My expectation is the vast majority of non-government schools will continue to follow the advice.\u201d Merlino argued the federal intervention was inconsistent with Scott Morrison\u2019s statement on 16 April that \u201cif you are going to school in Victoria, there is only one person you need to listen to and that is the premier of Victoria\u201d. The chief executive of Independent Schools Victoria, Michelle Green, said independent schools were \u201cbeing used as a wedge in a policy disagreement between the federal and Victorian governments\u201d. \u201cThis is unfair and entirely inappropriate when what\u2019s at stake is the health of children and their teachers,\u201d she said. The chief executive of the National Catholic Education Commission, Jacinta Collins, said Catholic schools \u201care keen to minimise the disruption on students\u2019 education and return to classroom learning as quickly as possible\u201d but recognised schools\u2019 responses might vary \u201cin response to differing local considerations and differing state health advice\u201d. Tehan has been publicly lobbying for all schools to return to face-to-face teaching in term two, but has been resisted by teachers\u2019 unions, which want more physical distancing measures in school, and Victoria, which cites its own medical advice in favour of remote learning. Since the national cabinet recognised states\u2019 autonomy rather than a nationally consistent approach, parents have continued to be confused by a patchwork of different approaches on school closures and remote learning. New South Wales is set to return to face-to-face teaching in week three of term two, from 11 May. Queensland will deliver education remotely until 22 May, with a re-evaluation to take place by 15 May. On 9 April, Guardian Australia revealed Tehan had told independent school associations he would impose a new condition in effect requiring them to make classroom learning available or risk losing federal funding. But even that direction acknowledged that schools must follow \u201cthe advice of the health or education authorities of the commonwealth or the state or territory in which the school is located\u201d, leading to confusion particularly in Victoria.",

      "bodyText": "A cabinet minister has acknowledged the government focused more on the NHS than care homes in the early stages of the outbreak, as the UK prepares to publish daily death figures for the community as well as hospitals. As the outbreak continues to worsen in care homes, George Eustice, the environment secretary, defended the government\u2019s handling of the crisis for older people, while acknowledging its approach had not been \u201cperfect\u201d. The death toll from coronavirus in care homes will be announced daily from Wednesday after figures this week revealed a sharp rise of more than 4,300 deaths in a fortnight in England and Wales and care operators said they were at the centre of the crisis. On Wednesday, Sir David Spiegelhalter, professor of the public understanding of risk at the University of Cambridge, said he thought there may be at least as many deaths in care homes and the community as in hospitals. \u201cI would push my neck out that it is plausible that there are now as many Covid-labelled deaths occurring out of hospital as there are in hospitals in England,\u201d he said. Asked whether the risk of spread in care homes had been overlooked, Eustice told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI don\u2019t accept it was overlooked but obviously there was a real focus on the NHS because there were concerns it might be overwhelmed. \u201cBut in the case of care homes we\u2019ve always recognised there was more vulnerability there and that residents were more susceptible to this virus. That is why a lot of things were done in making sure they could get some PPE \u2013 we all know there have been challenges with PPE.\u201d He said the NHS procurement system had taken time to set up to serve 15,000 care homes and in the meantime the government had been distributing equipment through local resilience forums. \u201cIt has not been perfect, we recognise that,\u201d he added. The government has been criticised for being slow to realise that coronavirus was spreading unchecked in care homes, with initial advice in mid-March only that unwell visitors should be banned. Testing in care homes has also been criticised as all residents with symptoms have still not been getting checked despite the government\u2019s promise two weeks ago that this would be rolled out. With the government now promising tests for all care home residents regardless of their symptoms, Eustice said the capacity for tests had been hugely scaled up and the ability to test everyone in residential settings was now there. \u201cWe got it there as quickly as we can,\u201d he said. On the same programme, Prof John Newton, the government\u2019s coordinator on testing, said he was \u201cpretty confident\u201d that the target of 100,000 tests a day would be hit by the end of the week. He said the latest widening of the eligibility criteria meant the next step would be providing \u201ca test to everyone who needs one\u201d with symptoms.",

In recent days, striking images of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoaquimCampa/status/1252612589701550080?s=20\">scientific charts and graphs</a> from the 1918 influenza pandemic have been making the rounds on social media. Though these hand-drawn diagrams may look archaic to our eyes, they offer a clear rebuke to those moving too quickly to step away from the public health restrictions so many around the world are currently enduring.</p> <p>In 1918, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/05/1918-flu-pandemic-coronavirus-drug-trials-scientists-treatments-evidence\">influenza swept the globe</a> in a series of waves. Probably emerging in the spring of 1918 in the American midwest, this new virus moved through the US largely unnoticed by a nation at war. Soon, though, it travelled to Europe through American troops, infecting first combatants, then the entire continent and beyond. But this pandemic was only getting started. In late August a second, more deadly wave crashed on to the shores of the US, France and Sierra Leone almost simultaneously and rushed from there to sicken the entire world. This was, in many communities, soon followed by a third wave. When the virus finally slowed in 1920, an estimated 500 million people had been stricken worldwide, and 50 million to 100 million people had perished. Of those, 675,000 deaths were in the US.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d6e62907f9e6fb0cf23d48fbefa4b73fb8bfb409\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6e62907f9e6fb0cf23d48fbefa4b73fb8bfb409/0_0_748_1024/730.jpg\" alt=\"A graph showing deaths in US cities from the Spanish flu pandemic\" width=\"730\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A graph showing the percentage of people dying in US cities from the 1918 flu pandemic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As they faced this scourge in 1918, scientists lacked technology that would allow them to see the virus that caused it. The bacteriological revolution of the 19th century gave American medical and public health authorities confidence, though, that this was a contagious disease. Nationally, the United States Public Health Service (USPHS) encouraged education and, if needed, a range of controls on Americans\u2019 behaviour. It would be up to state, county and local leadership to make the decisions about how to manage the pandemic. Their choices proved critical.</p> <p>Public health leaders had a range of tools at hand. They began by training the population in basic hygienic practices \u2013 washing their hands and covering coughs and sneezes. The USPHS printed millions of pamphlets<em> </em>providing information on the disease and recommending precautions for avoiding and treating the illness. The American Red Cross published its own circular in eight different languages. Many communities passed laws against public spitting, and banned the common drinking cup still shared in public spaces such as schoolrooms and train stations.</p> <p>These were the easy steps. Soon, better ventilation was called for on streetcars, and some cities staggered work times and store hours to prevent crowding. The flu kept coming, and more comprehensive controls often followed. Bans on public gatherings, the closure of all but the most essential businesses, even prohibitions on weddings and funerals frequently followed. Some cities tried requiring the wearing of masks. Others turned to quarantining the sick. There were even cities that employed new and untested vaccines.</p> <p>But what\u2019s most useful to us today is the comparative experience of Philadelphia and Seattle. Philadelphia, despite having some warning that the pandemic was coming, did little to prepare. Though Boston was under siege by late September, Philadelphia continued to conduct business as usual. On 28 September it hosted a massive kickoff parade for the Fourth Liberty Loan, the bond drive used to support the American war effort. Three days later the city reported 635 new influenza cases, and the situation soon worsened. Though the city now moved to protect itself, Philadelphia was overwhelmed by the epidemic. Available healthcare resources, already compromised by the war effort, were quickly stretched past their limits. Morgues overflowing with the dead, a desperate shortage of coffins and a resort to mass graves resulted from the city\u2019s failure to move early to prepare. Philadelphia suffered one of the nation\u2019s highest death rates.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/27/california-beaches-coronavirus-orange-county\">Thousands of people pack California beaches despite coronavirus concerns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Seattle offers a very different story. On 20 September, the city\u2019s commissioner of health, Dr JS McBride, acknowledged that \u201cit was not unlikely\u201d that influenza would reach the city and warned the citizenry that, if it did, isolating cases would be necessary. When soldiers at nearby Camp Lewis came down with the flu, the camp was quarantined. On 4 October, the story broke that large numbers of students at the naval training station at the University of Washington had contracted influenza. Within two days the city had, despite significant opposition, closed schools, prohibited church services and shuttered many public entertainments. Crowding was prohibited in those businesses still operating.</p> <p>In the days to come, other measures followed. A local hotel was requisitioned for use as an emergency hospital. Spitting in public could mean a jail cell and public shaming, the wearing of masks was required in public, business hours were shortened and further limitations were placed on those allowed to remain open. Though he had initially hoped the pandemic would pass in less than a week, the health commissioner maintained the restrictions, even as the number of cases began to decrease. Finally, on 11 November, both the city and state announced an end to closures and masking. Not uncommonly, the city soon faced a return of the disease. Again the city acted, this time quarantining the sick. As a result of these actions, Seattle suffered one of the lower death rates on the West Coast, substantially lower than Philadelphia\u2019s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76ae46b1882b7607ea95656535ec5f78d01f7716\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76ae46b1882b7607ea95656535ec5f78d01f7716/0_0_600_797/376.jpg\" alt=\"A bar chart showing the relative number of deaths in US cities from the Spanish flu pandemic\" width=\"376\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A bar chart showing the relative number of deaths in US cities from the flu pandemic</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There was certainly opposition to the kinds of restrictions Americans faced during the 1918 pandemic.

And as the US contemplates getting back to normal, it is also becoming clear our definition of \u201cnormal\u201d may have changed forever.</p> <p>Several states have now begun unwinding the quarantine initiatives introduced as the pandemic hit the US.</p> <p>Texas started reopening this week. Georgia\u2019s stay-at-home order expires on 30 April but Governor Brian Kemp has already allowed some businesses, including hair salons, gyms, tattoo parlors and bowling alleys to reopen. Alaska, Oklahoma, Colorado, Tennessee and some other states are also relaxing their quarantine orders or preparing to. Big business is watching carefully and some \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/22/boeing-coronavirus-resume-work-washington-state\">notably Boeing</a> \u2013 have started up again. But big business is not yet rushing to open its doors in a post Covid-19 world.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Some 49% of CFOs see remote working as a permanent solution for some workers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Joanna Daly, vice-president of human resources at IBM, said she has never been busier. With 350,000 employees across 170 countries IBM has witnessed firsthand the global response to the pandemic and is taking a cautious, case-by-case approach to opening its own offices. Some 95% of its staff are now working from home.</p> <p>States can begin to lift stay-at-home orders, she said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we will immediately return to the workplace.\u201d</p> <p>IBM has set up a set of global standards that includes governments and states lifting those orders, but also looks at the clinical data in the community and individual workplaces.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ba538ee88abd7c78f56fc2e4c2bcbe4b09b648c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba538ee88abd7c78f56fc2e4c2bcbe4b09b648c2/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A stylist wearing a protective mask cuts a customer\u2019s hair while another customer has their temperate checked at a barbershop in Atlanta, Georgia, on Monday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A stylist wearing a protective mask cuts a customer\u2019s hair while another customer has their temperate checked at a barbershop in Atlanta, Georgia, on Monday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dustin Chambers/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWorkplaces weren\u2019t designed for an environment that requires social distancing. There is a lot of detail going into redesigning the workplace, making changes, decisions, so that the workplace is one that is safe for people to come back to.\u201d</p> <p>The company is looking at office layouts, removing desks that are too close together, visual reminders to keep your distance, rethinking bathrooms, cafeterias, reassessing cleaning. \u201cWe are entering a workplace where we will have to behave differently, move differently, we have to be more aware.\u201d</p> <p>IBM\u2019s experience tallies with the wider business community. A PriceWaterHouseCoopers survey found 77% of US chief financial officers (CFOs) are anticipating changing workplace safety measures upon returning to on-site work and 65% anticipate reconfiguring work sites to promote physical distancing.</p> <p>The very nature of work-life is being rethought: some 49% of CFOs see remote working as a permanent solution for some workers.</p> <p>A widespread reopening will have to take all these factors into account. Country by city, building by building, job by job. A federal or local order to reopen will be just one part of this incredibly complex puzzle and all these changes will take time.</p> <p>There are plenty of plans for reopening but one of the most often quoted is from the American Enterprise Institute co-authored by Scott Gottlieb, a physician and former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. Trump\u2019s plan seems to be a slightly watered down version of the AEI\u2019s. The AEI roadmap offers <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/national-coronavirus-response-a-road-map-to-reopening/\">a three-phase plan </a>to reopening:</p> <ul> <li><p>Phase I (the phase we are currently in) focuses on using stay-at-home orders and the closure of businesses and public spaces to slow the spread of Covid-19.</p></li> <li><p>Phase II starts the reopening in a state-by-state basis, \u201cWhen they are able to safely diagnose, treat, and isolate Covid-19 cases and their contacts.\u201d Much of normal life can begin to resume but we would have to maintain physical-distancing measures and more stringent public hygiene measures while protecting the vulnerable.</p></li> <li><p>Phase III and a return to \u201cnormal\u201d would come only after testing, tracing, treatment and vaccines become widely available.</p></li> </ul> <p>The current reopenings come while most of the US is still in phase I and Trump has said those decisions are down to the states.</p> <p>The pressure to get America working again is intense and growing but opening up too soon, too fast could trigger a second wave of Covid-19 infections, said Saskia Popescu, a hospital epidemiologist in Phoenix, Arizona.</p> <p>\u201cThe sentiment is everybody wants to move forward, of course, but ultimately we in public health and global health security know that it is not something that can be rolled out in one sweeping movement,\u201d Popescu said.</p> <p>The Business Roundtable, the US\u2019s most powerful business lobby, wrote to Vice-President Mike Pence and all 50 governors last week outlining its recommendations for reopening.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e67e441c3610760d0a2c7decd102f85b43dab1ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e67e441c3610760d0a2c7decd102f85b43dab1ee/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump attends a teleconference with governors at the Federal Emergency Management Agency headquarters in Washington DC on 19 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump attends a teleconference with governors at the Federal Emergency Management Agency headquarters in Washington DC on 19 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Vucci/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The lobby group, whose members include Amazon, Apple, AT&amp;T, General Motors and Walmart, set out guidelines for different environments including offices, retail, construction and manufacturing.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWe\u2019re ready to open up the state to get back to work,\u201d Kathryn Goppelt told reporters last weekend as protesters marched on the Louisiana capitol in Baton Rouge calling for an end to the coronavirus pandemic lockdowns. Goppelt is one of thousands of people who have taken to the streets in Michigan, Wisconsin, California and other states demanding an end to stay-at-home orders that have brought the US economy to a standstill and so far cost 26m jobs. On Tuesday Donald Trump rolled out a new blueprint, dubbed Opening up America Again, that included ramping up testing and a partnership with drugstore chains to expand access to tests nationwide. \u201cWe are doing everything in our power to heal the sick and to gradually reopen our nation and to safely get our people back to work,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere is a hunger for getting our country back, and it is happening.\u201d But the real truth is that the reopening of America will happen slowly, bit by bit, state by state, city by city, business by business, building by building. Corporate America will have as large a say as Trump as to when things will really reopen. So will the state governors. And as the US contemplates getting back to normal, it is also becoming clear our definition of \u201cnormal\u201d may have changed forever. Several states have now begun unwinding the quarantine initiatives introduced as the pandemic hit the US. Texas started reopening this week. Georgia\u2019s stay-at-home order expires on 30 April but Governor Brian Kemp has already allowed some businesses, including hair salons, gyms, tattoo parlors and bowling alleys to reopen. Alaska, Oklahoma, Colorado, Tennessee and some other states are also relaxing their quarantine orders or preparing to. Big business is watching carefully and some \u2013 notably Boeing \u2013 have started up again. But big business is not yet rushing to open its doors in a post Covid-19 world. Joanna Daly, vice-president of human resources at IBM, said she has never been busier. With 350,000 employees across 170 countries IBM has witnessed firsthand the global response to the pandemic and is taking a cautious, case-by-case approach to opening its own offices. Some 95% of its staff are now working from home. States can begin to lift stay-at-home orders, she said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we will immediately return to the workplace.\u201d IBM has set up a set of global standards that includes governments and states lifting those orders, but also looks at the clinical data in the community and individual workplaces. \u201cWorkplaces weren\u2019t designed for an environment that requires social distancing. There is a lot of detail going into redesigning the workplace, making changes, decisions, so that the workplace is one that is safe for people to come back to.\u201d The company is looking at office layouts, removing desks that are too close together, visual reminders to keep your distance, rethinking bathrooms, cafeterias, reassessing cleaning. \u201cWe are entering a workplace where we will have to behave differently, move differently, we have to be more aware.\u201d IBM\u2019s experience tallies with the wider business community. A PriceWaterHouseCoopers survey found 77% of US chief financial officers (CFOs) are anticipating changing workplace safety measures upon returning to on-site work and 65% anticipate reconfiguring work sites to promote physical distancing. The very nature of work-life is being rethought: some 49% of CFOs see remote working as a permanent solution for some workers. A widespread reopening will have to take all these factors into account. Country by city, building by building, job by job. A federal or local order to reopen will be just one part of this incredibly complex puzzle and all these changes will take time. There are plenty of plans for reopening but one of the most often quoted is from the American Enterprise Institute co-authored by Scott Gottlieb, a physician and former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. Trump\u2019s plan seems to be a slightly watered down version of the AEI\u2019s. The AEI roadmap offers a three-phase plan to reopening: Phase I (the phase we are currently in) focuses on using stay-at-home orders and the closure of businesses and public spaces to slow the spread of Covid-19. Phase II starts the reopening in a state-by-state basis, \u201cWhen they are able to safely diagnose, treat, and isolate Covid-19 cases and their contacts.\u201d Much of normal life can begin to resume but we would have to maintain physical-distancing measures and more stringent public hygiene measures while protecting the vulnerable. Phase III and a return to \u201cnormal\u201d would come only after testing, tracing, treatment and vaccines become widely available. The current reopenings come while most of the US is still in phase I and Trump has said those decisions are down to the states. The pressure to get America working again is intense and growing but opening up too soon, too fast could trigger a second wave of Covid-19 infections, said Saskia Popescu, a hospital epidemiologist in Phoenix, Arizona. \u201cThe sentiment is everybody wants to move forward, of course, but ultimately we in public health and global health security know that it is not something that can be rolled out in one sweeping movement,\u201d Popescu said. The Business Roundtable, the US\u2019s most powerful business lobby, wrote to Vice-President Mike Pence and all 50 governors last week outlining its recommendations for reopening. The lobby group, whose members include Amazon, Apple, AT&amp;T, General Motors and Walmart, set out guidelines for different environments including offices, retail, construction and manufacturing. Overall the plan calls for careful control of public spaces, more monitoring and testing of staff, more personal protection equipment and consistent guidelines. \u201cAmericans want to feel confident returning to work and being in public spaces, and employers who operate in multiple states and want to keep their employees and customers safe need the clarity that consistent guidelines provide,\u201d said Joshua Bolten, the president of Business Roundtable. The problem is that while some suggestions the lobby group made are in the control of businesses (such as limiting the number of people in an office) others are in control of the government \u2013especially testing and monitoring. But so far the US has shown itself to be woefully underprepared to deal with the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic as it was to deal with its arrival. Both Bolten and the Amazon chief, Jeff Bezos, have said widespread testing is needed for businesses to reopen around the world. So far just 5.4m tests have been administered across the US, about 1.6% of the population. An analysis by Harvard researchers and the health news website Stat found more than half of US states need to significantly step up testing in order to even consider starting to relax stay-at-home orders after 1 May. More worrying still, some of the states now relaxing their quarantine order, including Georgia and Florida, are still well behind the level of testing they will need in order to identify and close down new hotspots. \u201cHow can we really gauge how things are going if we can\u2019t get accurate case counts?\u201d Popescu said. For all the shouting and hectoring at protests, polls show most people, as well as businesses, agree with the need for caution and are putting safety first. New York City barber Justin Virgil Gramelspacher left the city shortly after his East Village shop, The Blind Barber, decided to close its doors. \u201cI\u2019m getting a lot of calls from clients. I think when we do open, we are going to be slammed for weeks,\u201d he said.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s longtime close relationship with Fox News, like so many other unions in the time of lockdown, is beginning to buckle under pressure, with an increasingly sensitive president furious at the conservative media channel. Trump has attacked the conservative channel in recent days, accusing the usually uncritical network of being \u201cfed Democratic talking points\u201d, with some observers suggesting his ire may have been caused in part by a string of anti-Trump ads due to run on Fox News this week. The breakdown between president and news channel was laid bare in a string of tweets from Trump on Sunday evening. Trump has occasionally criticized Fox News in recent months, but this attack went further, as Trump declared he wants \u201can alternative now\u201d. \u201c[Fox News] just doesn\u2019t get what\u2019s happening! They are being fed Democrat talking points, and they play them without hesitation or research,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cThey forgot that Fake News @CNN &amp; MSDNC [a term Trump has used for MSNBC] wouldn\u2019t let @FoxNews participate, even a little bit, in the poor ratings Democrat Debates.\u201d Trump continued his criticism by attacking prominent Fox News personalities including the Democratic strategist Donna Brazile, before concluding: \u201cThe people who are watching @FoxNews, in record numbers (thank you President Trump), are angry. They want an alternative now. So do I!\u201d Trump did not give a specific reason for his upset, but it could be linked to a critical advert a group of anti-Trump Republicans are running on Fox News this week. Republicans for the Rule of Law, a group opposed to the president, paid for an ad spot during Fox &amp; Friends \u2013 one of Trump\u2019s favorite shows \u2013 which highlights his response to the coronavirus. \u201c50,000 people have died,\u201d reads capitalized text at the start of the advert. \u201cThis is our president.\u201d The advert then cuts to Trump musing about the potential ability of \u201cvery powerful light\u201d in curing coronavirus. The advert ends with the words \u201cUnfit, unwell, unacceptable\u201d appearing on screen. Despite Trump\u2019s objections and insults, Fox News has remained largely supportive of his administration and performance during the coronavirus outbreak. After Trump suggested the possibility of injecting coronavirus patients with disinfectant, Fox News\u2019 website billed the ensuing criticism as a matter of \u201ctwisted words\u201d. Hosts Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity have praised Trump\u2019s performance, with the latter suggesting: \u201cNew York would be dead without Donald Trump\u2019s help.\u201d The Trump-Fox fracture comes as the profile of One America News Network (OANN), a news outlet which has repeatedly pushed conspiracy theories and is regarded as even more rightwing than Fox News, continues to rise. In early April the then White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, personally invited an OANN reporter to a coronavirus briefing. The same reporter has been called on repeatedly by Trump to ask questions \u2013 frequently questions that tee Trump up to praise his own performance \u2013 at the briefings. On Monday it was reported that Fox News had also cut ties with Diamond and Silk, two outspoken Trump supporters who have peddled misinformation about the coronavirus. The booting of the influential pair, whose loyalty has won repeated praise from Trump, is unlikely to have pleased the president.

Australians will find markets, as we have been now for a long time, all around the world, and for many years now our markets have been diversified. <br></p> \n   <p>I mean, the predominance of our trading relationship with China is obviously resources-based, and I see no reason why that would alter in the future. <br></p> \n   <p>I mean, the thing about our relationship with China is it is a mutually beneficial one. <br></p> \n   <p>It is a comprehensive strategic partnership, and we will continue to pursue that partnership, respecting China\u2019s sovereignty, and their independence, and its success will continue to depend on that being returned.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-29T02:10:13.052Z\">at 3.10am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea8de778f0853abef6595ac\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-29T01:56:12.700Z\">2.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>When it comes to monitoring wildlife wet markets (which are not just in China and are different to wet markets, which is an all-encompassing term for a fresh food market \u2013 the distinction is important) Morrison says:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>On wildlife wet markets, my position has never been directed only to one country.

      "bodyText": "We will wrap up our Australian rolling coverage of Covid-19 developments now. Thank you for your company and correspondence. The Guardian\u2019s international liveblog continues here: In summary: The global death toll from Covid-19 has surpassed 217,000. There are more than 3.125m confirmed cases worldwide. Australia has a total of 6,746 confirmed cases. Ninety people have died across the country from Covid-19. There was another death at Sydney\u2019s beleaguered Newmarch House aged care home. Twelve people have now died there. More than 3 million Australians have downloaded the government\u2019s Covidsafe app. The degenerating relationship between Canberra and Beijing deteriorated further, with tit-for-tat bickering, trade threats and a gate-crashed press conference, all emerging out of Australia\u2019s proposal for an independent inquiry into the origins of the Covid-19 outbreak. There is far to run here. We will return tomorrow as this country, and this world, continues to grapple with the pandemic. All of you, stay well and stay safe. Thanks Alby ... this is helpful \u2013 6.67, you say? From our global liveblog ... The Press Association has just snapped this: A spokesman for Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds said: \u201cThe prime minister and Ms Symonds are thrilled to announce the birth of a healthy baby boy at a London hospital earlier this morning. Both mother and baby are doing very well. The PM and Ms Symonds would like to thank the fantastic NHS maternity team. Some further details on South Australia\u2019s suppression of Covid-19. There have been no new cases reported in the state again today, the seventh day in a row of zero new cases. A total of 438 cases have been reported across South Australia, 420 of which have been cleared and those people recovered. Fourteen cases remain active in the state. Four people have died from Covid-19. A 68-year-old man is currently in a stable condition in intensive care at the Royal Adelaide hospital. SA Pathology has undertaken more than 55,000 tests for Covid-19 so far. The degeneration of Australia-China relations over Australia\u2019s proposal for an independent, international investigation into the origins of the Covid-19 outbreak continued apace today. Helen Davidson has this excellent tick-tock marking this week\u2019s developments in the deterioration. We reported earlier the remarkable press conference held by federal health minister Greg Hunt feat. China\u2019s consul general for Victoria, Zhou Long, who was invited to speak at the conference by Andrew Forrest. Notable in this piece, the prominent role played by the Global Times in prosecuting the Chinese government\u2019s position. Neither novel nor unusual, but particularly pronounced in this episode. This week saw a dramatic slowing in the number of new Covid-19 cases across the Pacific islands with 259 reported, up from 239 last week. But in the Indonesia province of Papua, official figures may belie a much grimmer picture. The official tally of 155 infections in the province is likely to be low, given the state of health care, and the systemic distrust between the indigenous population and the state. One batch of 300 tests administered to government officials in Mimika returned 110 positive results. This is an excellent summation of the Covid-19 situation across the Pacific from Dan McGarry and Tess Newton Cain. The people\u2019s poet, First Dog on the Moon, answers the critical questions... who indeed? That\u2019s all from me today. I will leave you with my colleague Ben Doherty. Stay well. Kristina Keneally, Labor\u2019s home affairs spokeswoman, has responded to Peter Dutton attacks. The Greens have released a statement on the call for an international inquiry into the cause of Covid-19. \u201cIf the Australian government wants to really lead from the front on this issue it will call for an end to the global trade of wildlife, not just an investigation into wildlife markets,\u201d said Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young. There cannot just be an investigation of wildlife markets in China or other countries like Indonesia as the prime minister seemed to be suggesting today. Ultimately the trade of wildlife for consumption and other purposes, which is a global issue including in Australia, must end. A push to end wildlife markets is welcome but it must be accompanied by a push to end the trade of wild animals, otherwise very little will have been achieved in the battle to prevent future pandemics like Covid-19. The prime minister also needs to commit to looking at wildlife trade in his own backyard. The federal government needs to close the loopholes in our laws that allow our rare and endangered native animals to be traded for profit and ensure they are protected here where they belong. Trevor Watts, the state MP Toowoomba North, was fined more than $1,300 for attending this get-together at the weekend. Some good news in South Australia. Linda Burney, Labor\u2019s social services spokeswoman, is asked by Patricia Karvelas on the ABC about the jobseeker payment. Scott Morrison said today the coronavirus supplement is temporary, and rejected the case for a permanent increase to the dole when the pandemic is over. Taking the Newstart payment back to its original $550 a fortnight, I think that is going to be an extremely difficult thing for the government to do. I mean, if it was OK to live on $40 a day before the pandemic, why are they increasing it now? There are going to be economic impacts as well. The WA premier Mark McGowan provided an update earlier. It clashed with the national update so I am providing it to you now. WA recorded one new case overnight, a 19-year-old woman from Perth who returned from overseas The state has only 43 active cases, 500 people have no recovered Public school students went back today, attendance was about 60% Meanwhile, still on the ABC, Peter Dutton has launched a blistering attack against his Labor counterpart Kristina Keneally. Keneally has been blaming the federal government for the Ruby Princess debacle, arguing that ultimately the buck stops with the Commonwealth, meaning Home Affairs and Border Force. Others argue responsibility was delegated to NSW authorities. Dutton notes there are inquiries ongoing into the issue, but labels Keneally a \u201cfailed premier\u201d. He claims that she did not alter the arrangements governing these issues while she was premier. I think an individual or others have made a mistake here in New South Wales Health has been well documented. It was a decision that relied on information from the ship. All that is under investigation at the moment. But Kristina Keneally\u2019s frankly unhinged attacks on the Border Force uniform officers have been quite remarkable and regrettable. The death toll at the stricken Sydney nursing home Newmarch House has risen to 12. In a statement, operator Anglicare said: The past 24 hours have been tragic for Anglicare Sydney and today we are saddened to announce the death of another resident who had tested positive for Covid-19 at Newmarch House. The family has been contacted as have all relevant authorities. The total number of our residents who are Covid-19 positive who have died since the outbreak on Easter Sunday is now 12. The commonwealth and NSW governments through their health departments continue to support us in providing the clinical support we require to deliver the care our residents need. This is a terrible situation and a challenge for us, our staff, but especially for our residents and their families. Please keep our residents and their families in your thoughts and prayers, especially those who are grieving the loss of their loved ones.\u201d Peter Dutton has rejected Andrew Forrest\u2019s call that any international inquiry into the Covid-19 pandemic be held after the US election. He says: I just don\u2019t see what the US election has to do with it any more than the German elections or the elections in France or Italy or New Zealand or Australia. I think at the moment we are seeing parts of the world absolutely devastated by this Covid virus and we know it originated out of Wuhan in China and we want to know how it happened, why it happened, and why it\u2019s not going to happen again next year or the year after. Nathan Cleary has escaped further sanction by police after he was fined by the NRL for his appearance in photos with a number of women at his house on Anzac Day, as the AFL becomes the latest sporting organisation to open an investigation into players breaching social distancing rules. Cleary is $4,000 lighter in the pocket following the NRL\u2019s punishment, but he won\u2019t be fined any further after police dropped their investigation into him. They will, however, follow up inquiries into those who Cleary said had come to his home and stayed for 10 minutes. Fellow rule-breakers Josh Addo-Carr and Latrell Mitchell, for comparison, were fined $1,000 after they were photographed in a group of men at a farm. But it appears that Cleary escaped a similar fine as the visit was unplanned and he did not leave his house. \u201cFollowing inquiries conducted by Nepean Police Area Command, no offence relating to the 22-year-old man was detected,\u201d a police spokeswoman said. \u201cInvestigations are continuing into other potential offences.\u201d Meanwhile, the AFL is aware of a video in which three Fremantle players are seen in a group of people, reportedly on Sunday night. The gathering of seven people, which included star defender Luke Ryan and fringe players Michael Frederick and Jason Carter, has prompted a club investigation. Before Monday, gatherings in Western Australia were limited to two people. That limit is now 10. \u201cWe have been made aware of a video of a small gathering of people at a home on Sunday night, including three Fremantle players,\u201d a Dockers spokesman told AAP. \u201cWe are in the process of speaking to the players involved and gathering all the relevant details and information. Once that is completed, the club will be in a position to comment further.\u201d Dutton says China should \u201cwelcome\u201d the transparency that would come from an inquiry. He won\u2019t weigh into the fracas between DFAT and the Chinese ambassador. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, is on the ABC with Patricia Karvelas. Making the case for an international inquiry into the Covid-19, he says people who have lost loved ones during the pandemic deserve answers. Is he confident the virus started in Wuhan? I think we need to accept the facts. Where else did it start if it wasn\u2019t in Wuhan? What other concentrations or clusters where there in other jurisdictions, I\u2019m not aware of any, at that early stage. And the reason it is important is we want to make sure we don\u2019t see this restart. We don\u2019t want to see a new version of this virus in 12 months\u2019 time or in two years, that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been critical not of wet markets but of wildlife wet markets where to this very day bats are still being sold.\u201d Andrew Forrest was just on the ABC where he was asked if there were any tensions with health minister Greg Hunt standing alongside the Chinese consul-general, Zhou Long, at the press conference today. Forrest claims there was a \u201clessening of tension\u201d. \u201cThe Minderoo Foundation did ask for the blessing of the consul-general to attend,\u201d he says. There was a lessening of tension and I think the consul-general of China made some globally powerful statements about China\u2019s attitude of pulling together to get through this. The minister and myself have that same attitude. The world has got to pull together to get the world through this pandemic. Thanks to Amy for her great work today, and always. I\u2019ll be with you for the next few hours. You can reach me at luke.henriques-gomes@theguardian.com or on Twitter @lukehgomes. And on that note, I am going to hand you over to Luke Henriques-Gomes for the next little bit. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow morning. Thanks again for joining me, and if you still have questions, you can reach me here or here (apologies if I take some time replying, I am making my way through the backlog). As always, take care of you. Paul Kelly thinks that it is \u201cinteresting\u201d the US is talking about establishing a permanent pandemic response team, given it already has it \u2013 that would be the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) (which is always turning up in hazmat suits in American movies) . I believe we [Australia] have that structure. There have been calls in the past to set up something like the CDC or a Centre for Disease Control in Australia so we can be like the US. I think it\u2019s interesting that the US is talking about setting up something which they\u2019ve already got. We have that structure at the federal level and there is expertise in each of the states and territories and we have a virtual centre if you like. On professional sport resuming, the deputy chief medical officer says an answer should be provided very soon We are working with the AFL, NRL and other codes and specifically with the Australian Institute of Sport. Thank you to Dr David Hughes who has done excellent work with a team there at AIS, to look more broadly, not just at the elite level of sport, but to community sport and Olympic sports and so on about what would be a safe transition back to sporting codes, including the elite ones and others. We had a discussion about that today at the AHPPC and there will be advice to the national cabinet on Friday with some general principles and some advice on those matters. Professor Paul Kelly then gives a reminder of what the Covid tracing app actually does (ie: it doesn\u2019t make you \u2018safer\u2019 by preventing you from coming into contact with the virus) The app doesn\u2019t replace good contact tracing. We have real expertise in Australia in relation to public health broadly and including contact tracing. Every state and territory has a very good unit and the heads of those units, the chief health officers, meet with us every day in the Australia Health Protection Commit There are public health units on a more regional basis too. The app is only a technological assistance to that expertise that\u2019s already there. I\u2019m very confident in our ability there. Professor Paul Kelly goes on to talk about the dangers of a second wave of coronavirus in Australia: So the second wave I\u2019m sure will be a topic for quite some time. In one sense we\u2019re victims of our success there to an extent. Because we\u2019ve had so few people that have been diagnosed with COVID-19, and we are nowhere near that concept of herd immunity. That would be one way of guarding against a second wave. We\u2019re definitely not looking to do that in Australia, as some of the countries have either planned to do or have been forced to achieve very large caseloads. We\u2019ve seen what that has done in other parts of the world. So we won\u2019t be going to that. A second wave is always possible and that\u2019s why those three precedents have been set by the Prime Minister before we lift those social distancing and socialisation rules about case finding, keeping the cases low if possible, if cases occur, finding them quickly, finding their contacts, quarantining them and decreasing the size of any outbreaks that we might have by having a very detailed and quick response. If a second wave does occur we\u2019ll deal with it quickly and we\u2019ll respond to it. Looks like 11 May is D-day for examining the relaxation of restrictions, at least from what the deputy chief medical officer says here: You might remember a few weeks ago, as we were on some very worrying upswings of the pandemic in Australia, where we were getting several hundred new cases of Covid-19 diagnosed every day. At that time there was a lot of change, a lot of new things were announced. Premiers sometimes announcing slightly different social distancing measures, slightly different figures and so on. So the word confusion was used a lot then. I\u2019ve heard it a lot over the last week or so. That in one way is not surprising because we\u2019re on a new phase in this epidemic, much less frightening phase, but a phase of change. So over the next few weeks \u2013 and as we get closer to that May 11 target and after that as well \u2013 there will be many announcements about changes in the way we\u2019ll be living our lives and hopefully getting back to some sort of new normality living in a Covid-19-safe society. There will be a lot of information. It may be slightly different in different states. That\u2019s not a mixed message. That is a changed message. And we will, as we have always done, undertake to share those differences and share those announcements as soon as they come to be. And I\u2019m sure across Australia people will understand that. The deputy chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, is giving the national update today: Over 544,000 tests so far. It\u2019s worthwhile considering where we are in Australia compared to the rest of the world right now. There was another milestone I guess overnight or yesterday where there is now over 3 million cases that have been diagnosed. About a third of those in the US. And over 200,000 deaths. An incredible figure when you think that the first cases we heard of were just in early January. Only four months ago. So we\u2019re continuing to do well in Australia. We\u2019re in that suppression phase of and we have well and truly flattened that curve. If they had just set up NRL island, none of this would have happened. I will never let go of the island dream. But Nick Tedeschi has a much more measured take: Optics are as important now as reality and the flagrant disregard for both rugby league and the law of the land has marginalised public opinion about a 28 May return. The NRL may be able to survive a PR crisis relatively unfettered now but any breach by any player once teams return to training \u2013 scheduled to start on Monday \u2013 will have a catastrophic impact for the code with the game certain to be shut down. Given some players are clearly unable to comprehend the impact their actions have on the wider game, those at League HQ must be petrified at the prospect of trying to get all players to adhere.\u201d You\u2019ll find that story, here AAP has an update on the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, which will be held in 2021 (but still called the 2020 Olympics, because everything is already printed): Staging the Tokyo Olympics next year isn\u2019t contingent on the discovery of coronavirus vaccine, senior International Olympic Committee (IOC) member John Coates says. Japan\u2019s Medical Association believes the Games, postponed until July and August next year, can only proceed if a vaccine is found. \u201cI saw that opinion,\u201d Coates told AAP on Wednesday. \u201cBut the advice we\u2019re getting from WHO [the World Health Organisation] says we should continue to plan for this date and that is what we\u2019re doing, and that\u2019s not contingent on a vaccine. \u201cA vaccine would be nice. But we will just continue to be guided, as we must be, by WHO and the Japanese health authorities because in all of this, the health and wellbeing of the athletes and other participants in the Games is the number one priority.\u201d Coates, the chair of the IOC\u2019s coordination commission, said organisers at every level were working at pace towards holding the Games in Tokyo from July 23 to August 8 next year. The Victorian education minister, James Merlino, is not a fan of federal minister Dan Tehan\u2019s decision to link early non-government school funding to returning to classrooms by 1 June. Merlino told reporters in Melbourne the plan was \u201cdisappointing\u201d and \u201ccompletely inappropriate\u201d because independent schools were feeling financial pressure and there was no need to attach strings to the funding. He said: What the federal government is doing is using funding to force non-government schools to ignore the expert medical advice of the Victorian chief health officer. Expert medical advice, not money, should determine whether schools open. Merlino also noted the latest intervention was \u201cdifferent to the advice from the prime minister\u201d that the \u201conly person\u201d Victorian parents should look to for advice about whether their kids should go to school was the Victorian premier. Merlino said he \u201cfeels for Victorian non-government schools\u201d but the move \u201cwon\u2019t force our hand\u201d. Every decision we\u2019ve made has been by expert medical advice ... My expectation is the vast majority of non-government schools will continue to follow the advice. I have seen a few comments over the past week or so, so for anyone who is still wondering, Murph is off for a few weeks so she can work on a project. Malcolm Farr is with us in the meantime. Sarah Martin is on maternity leave, having welcomed Annabel to her (and our) family. Universities Australia has warmly embraced Victoria\u2019s contribution to help international students. Eligible students can access up to $1,100 in payments (equal to two weeks of jobseeker) in a $45m announcement made in conjunction with universities today: Victoria now joins the Australian Capital Territory, Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australian, Tasmanian and Western Australian governments in assisting international students who, like their Australian peers, have lost casual or part-time jobs as a result of the global pandemic. Universities Australia chief executive Catriona Jackson said almost all states and territories, together with every Australian university, now offer support for international students. \u201cMany international students now find themselves in extremely difficult circumstances due to the economic impact of Covid-19. Unlike their Australian classmates, there will be those who won\u2019t have family or local support networks to fall back on,\u201d Ms Jackson said. \u201cAssistance from all levels of government adding to that from our universities is vital at this time of growing need.\u201d Western Australia has recorded just one new positive diagnosis for Covid-19 in the past 24 hours. Christian Porter is then asked about his Victorian counterpart\u2019s letter, allowing for the publication of the redacted documents which related to George Pell in the child abuse royal commission\u2019s final report. Porter says: So, that letter\u2019s been received. Process is \u2013 and I apologise if this sounds bureaucratic \u2013 but this is the process: I receive it, I read it, it goes to the department, they satisfy themselves, I get final legal advice, and yep, and then documents can be published. If I were you, I would keep an eye on tabled documents during the next sitting of parliament, given that response. Pressed on that comment by Gareth Parker, who asks whether or not diplomats are known to go free-range with their responses, Christian Porter says: Well, I\u2019m not entirely sure about that. There\u2019s been some other responses in some other countries and responses differ from diplomat to diplomat. And, you know, every human being gets emotional from time to time. But I would describe that an emotional response to what is, I think, just an inarguably reasonable proposition that a virus which has killed enormous numbers of people, brought the world economy to a grinding halt, brought the Australian economy to its knees \u2013 from which position we have to recover \u2013 should be the subject of a forthright investigation so that we can understand the origins, the early transmission, the way in which the disease was administered, well or not well in its early stages. And that\u2019s a matter of global concern. The idea that you wouldn\u2019t have an investigation like that is irrational, illogical, unreasonable, and the response suggesting that that style of investigation is not warranted and necessary, to me is an emotional response. So, you know, we stand by the need for an investigation of the origins of the virus. It\u2019s as simple as that. Christian Porter then goes on to say he believes China\u2019s ambassador to Australia, Cheng Jingye, was \u201cemotional\u201d when he responded to Australia\u2019s call for an independent investigation into the Covid response: I think that the Chinese ambassador\u2019s response was largely emotional and generally speaking those type of emotional responses are relatively short-lived. So whether this escalates or not will be a matter to wait, watch and see. Christian Porter told Perth radio 6PR he believes the privacy argument regarding the Covid tracing app is \u201cover\u201d. The source code has not been released as yet (security agencies are deciding how much can go out) and the legislation surrounding the app won\u2019t reach parliament until May. Well, I do, I do think that there is no more private, more secure information, and what we have done is make it an offence for the information to be used for any other purpose than the purpose that Greg Hunt has set out, which is to allow for the quicker ability to work out where someone has been diagnosed with Covid-19, who they\u2019ve been in proximity-contact with for a period of time that puts that person they\u2019ve been in contact with at risk of contracting the disease. That\u2019s all it\u2019s being used for. Any other use is unlawful, and you know in normal circumstances when you consent or volunteer information to a private or public sector entity, it is possible for that information potentially to be the subject of a warrant or to be provided to law enforcement agencies. Not with this information ... That is strictly prohibited by a biosecurity direction of Greg Hunt by agreement with the states and by legislation. So it\u2019s very safe, it\u2019s very secure, it serves a very important purpose and everyone in WA wants to get their lives back and get their businesses back on track and get our economy roaring back to life. And this is a very, very important part of achieving that. And as a country we\u2019ve achieved better health results than virtually every other country on Earth. And trying to continue those health results, whilst also re-animating our economy, means that we as a government have to try things and this is definitely worth a very strong try. I think it will succeed and I think the early numbers are extremely encouraging. The government has announced $1m to help connect older and vulnerable Australians become (or stay) digitally connected: Minister for families and social services Anne Ruston said the government was committed to support older Australians stay digitally connected during these difficult times. \u201cOne-off payments of up to $5000 would allow existing Be Connected Network partners to purchase and loan digital devices and sim cards to Australians aged over 50 years,\u201d minister Ruston said. \u201cWe expect these grants will help provide devices such as a laptop or iPad and data plans to up to 3500 older Australians who would otherwise be at risk of disconnecting during the coronavirus pandemic. The National Catholic Education Commission has released a statement about Dan Tehan\u2019s offer to bring forward non-government schools funding - noting that Catholic schools in different states may have to manage the return to face-to-face teaching differently. Executive director, Jacinta Collins, said:\u201dCatholic schools are keen to minimise the disruption on students\u2019 education and return to classroom learning as quickly as possible. However, there may be variances in the way Catholic schools across Australia manage the transition of students back to school in response to differing local considerations and differing state health advice. Parents and carers will be advised of specific arrangements by their child\u2019s school. In the meantime, Catholic schools will continue to remain open for students who need to attend, and will provide remote learning to ensure that all students can continue their schooling during this period.\u201d Winston Peters has given an interview which includes a pretty extraordinary admission of something the New Zealand cabinet was asked to consider: Via AAP: New Zealand\u2019s cabinet formally considered and dismissed a potentially illegal ministry of health proposal last month to shut the country\u2019s borders to stranded Kiwis. The extraordinary cabinet leak was revealed by deputy prime minister Winston Peters on Tuesday. Mr Peters, in Wellington for the first time since the country\u2019s lockdown, gave a speech thank the ministry of foreign affairs and trade for their above-and-beyond consular efforts in the crisis. The NZ First leader then made the revelation when fighting back criticism that the government\u2019s response has been \u201ctoo myopic and captured by advice from the ministry of health\u201d. \u201cBoth critiques could not be further from the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ministry of health recommended a total shutdown of the border, including to returning New Zealanders. From its health perspective this was understandable and appropriate advice. \u201cBut the Coalition cabinet rejected that advice because it was and is inconceivable that we will ever turn our backs on our own.\u201d Still confused about quantitative easing? Economist Warwick McKibbin is a specialist at modeling the economic effects of pandemics and a former RBA board member. Anthony Albanese was just on Sky News. He was asked if it was weird to see Greg Hunt standing next to a Chinese ambassador, given the latest round of diplomatic sparring: Well, it was probably fair to say it was an unexpected vision at that press conference. But it\u2019s not a bad thing, either. I\u2019m not critical at all of Greg Hunt for doing that. What we saw here was a practical difference being made by Twiggy Forrest and to enable an increase in the number of tests that are taking place here in Australia. Australia always has to stand up for our own national interest. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done here. Australians, as well as others, it must be said, have an interest in finding out exactly the details of how this crisis came about, the source of the virus, how it happened. Not as an academic exercise, but so that we can avoid it ever happening again. The car manufacturer Ford is planning to use its remaining Australian facilities to produce and donate about 100,000 face shields to healthcare workers. PPE stocks have been the subject to unprecedented demand across the globe during the pandemic. Australia has sought to boost its own stocks by getting existing industries to pivot into PPE manufacturing. Ford Australia this morning announced it would use its existing development facilities at Broadmeadows to produce and donate the face shields after working with the Victorian government on a design. \u201cProducing face shields is certainly something new for us, but our innovation team and engineers were able to test a number of different designs in hospitals, and with their input we have been able to get the face shield right for the people who will be wearing them,\u201d Kay Hart, the company\u2019s Australia and New Zealand president, said in a statement. \u201cWith testing of the prototype shield now complete, we\u2019re quickly ramping up production and working to dispatch the shields to medical workers and other facilities that need them.\u201d The company says it has already assembled about 50,000 shields and is talking to government about ongoing needs. Ford last year sold off many of its facilities at Broadmeadows, including its assembly plant, after ceasing local manufacturing. But it still retains a presence there for staff in its engineering and design divisions. Will Australia back Taiwan\u2019s bid to rejoin the World Health Organisation? It wants us to. But Greg Hunt, standing next to Zhou Long says: I will completely leave those those questions to the foreign minister. It\u2019s not one within my remit. It was a nice try. Zhou Long: Ladies and gentlemen, the virus knows no ideology, border or race, and in face of the pandemic the testings of all countries are closely interwoven where we\u2019re all in this together. Solidarity and the cooperation is the only way to overcome the public health challenge and all countries should unite as one in this undertaking. And only by working together can we secure the ultimate victory against Covid-19. Views have been expressed that Covid-19 pandemic is the biggest crisis faced by mankind since World War II. If that is the case, we have no choice but to work together to transform the crisis, the challenges, into new opportunities of cooperation. There\u2019s also a view expressed that this pandemic will certainly change the world as whole. If that is the case, we have no choice but to work together to make the world a safer, more harmonious and a better world. In this regard, all of us, no matter who we are \u2013 whether we are philanthropists or politicians or government representatives, or medical people, scientists or media people \u2013 we all have roles to play. The weirdest part of that Greg Hunt and Andrew Forrest press conference? The China consul general for Victoria, Zhou Long, was there \u2013 despite the press conference being held in the midst of a diplomatic spat between the Chinese embassy and Australia, and just an hour after the embassy fired off its latest annoyed missive. Long: The Chinese government has released information related to the Covid-19 in open, transparent and responsible manner and we have worked closely with WHO and other countries including shared experiences in epidemic prevention and control and providing assistance within our capacity. China very much appreciates and thankful to the compassion, support and sympathy of the Australian people to towards the Chinese people in our fight against the virus and vice versa. We are also doing everything possible to help Australia. And this is \u2013 this project is another testimony of the friendship and the cooperation between our two countries and the two peoples We are finally listening to the experts. Can we expect this to flow in other issues? One can only hope so. The government has asked a range of experts to answer a range of questions to help aid the Covid response: The Rapid Research Information Forum (RRIF) was convened and is chaired by Australia\u2019s chief scientist, Dr Alan Finkel. It benefits from operational support and leadership from the Australian Academy of Science and is a collaboration of the participant organisations listed below. RRIF participants are working together to rapidly answer pressing questions about Covid-19, as they emerge. Questions are put to the RRIF by ministers and other key decision-makers, for example to support the work of the chief medical officer, the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee and the National Covid-19 Coordination Commission. The first three reports, published in response to questions asked by the health minister, are available now. What is the impact of winter on the spread of Covid-19? Is reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 possible? What is the feasibility of monitoring wastewater for early detection and monitoring of Covid-19 in the population? Is there evidence for differential learning outcomes for online versus in-class education? What factors moderate the relative effectiveness? And are there distinct implications for students in metropolitan, remote, rural and indigenous communities? What is the predictive value of serological antibody tests, and are point-of-care tests comparable to laboratory tests? What impact is the pandemic having and likely to have on Australia\u2019s research workforce and will we have the research workforce capability to support our recovery efforts? What are the most vaccines and treatments being developed globally that are regarded as having most promise (including national and international collaborations and consortia) and what are the mechanisms for action for each of these, their stage of development and their strengths and limitations? Asked for his opinion on whether or not there should be an independent inquiry into the original pandemic response, Andrew Forrest says: The relationship I see between the Australian people and the Chinese people is really one of a common heart. Each of us would like to leave this world a better, kinder, more environmentally sustainable one than we have now. That is the motive behind the Chinese people and, as I know, all my mates behind the Australian people. So I see a commonality in cause here. There will be points in any good relationship. There\u2019s ups and downs. But this is a solid and long-term relationship which has existed since prior to World War I. They\u2019ve been on our side in World War I, in World War II, and that should not change, specifically ... a call for a priority. My priority is to see the pandemic come to an end, so I\u2019ll be putting everything I can personally, and as the foundation and as my businesses, to remove the fear of this pandemic from the Australian people as quickly as possible. Greg Hunt and Andrew Forrest are officially announcing the partnership between the government and the Minderoo foundation to secure 10m more covid testing kits What did we just learn? A national mental health program will be rolled out to ensure any gaps in access are closed. Some 800,000 people have had their jobseeker claims processed. The increased jobseeker payment will not be extended beyond the emergency response. So far 2.8 million people have downloaded the Covid-19 tracing app. The prime minister has linked the app\u2019s take-up to restrictions being relaxed. Scott Morrison watches TikTok \u201cmashups\u201d to chill out. Jacinda Ardern* received a phone call from the Queen. Scott Morrison has heard from Prince Charles. *favoured child The drought and Covid-19 panic buying pushed annual inflation above 2% for the first time in two years, according to figures released by the Bureau of Statistics this morning. The bureau said the figures, which cover the first three months of the year, don\u2019t include the full impact of the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cThere were some price effects of Covid-19 apparent in the March quarter due to higher purchasing of certain products towards the end of the quarter, as restrictions came into effect,\u201d said the ABS chief economist, Bruce Hockman. \u201cMost notably, rises were seen in other non-durable household products (+3.4%), which includes toilet paper; personal care products (+2.2%), which includes soap and hand sanitiser; and other cereal products (+4.4%), which includes rice and pasta. \u201cMore evident effects of Covid-19 are expected in the June quarter CPI.\u201d A rise of 0.3% for the quarter pushed the annual rate to 2.2%. \u201cCPI annual inflation was above 2% for the first time since 2018 and the highest since September 2014 quarter,\u201d Hockman said. The government has not really shifted on this. Scott Morrison echoes Mathias Cormann this morning on not extending the jobseeker payment rate beyond the emergency response timeframe: This was an emergency response measure. This was not a change in the government\u2019s view about the broader role of the social safety net in Australia. I think we have a very strong social safety net, but in this particular point of time and as the Treasury secretary pointed out yesterday, when you\u2019re looking at unemployment going above 10%, as I have said to you on a number of occasions, I fear worst statistics coming forward on the economy in the months ahead and we need to prepare ourselves for that. That\u2019s why jobseeker and jobkeeper were put in place, to deal with the heavy blow that the Covid-19 pandemic is going to have on the Australian economy. But that\u2019s why we also need to move as quickly as we can, getting these protections in place to ensure that our economy can grow. The budget will be restored by our economy growing. And that\u2019s why as we move towards the budget scheduled for October this year then we\u2019ll be in a position to line a range of measures that will support that growth into the future. Which will support to budget. That\u2019s important because the budget supports essential services. It\u2019s all about jobs, it\u2019s all about services going forward and ensuring that we can do in a responsible and sustainable way with the budget. These emergency measures come at a great cost and clearly that level of cost is not sustainable beyond what we have flagged. Christine Morgan on what you can do to help your mental health fitness: I think many of us are feeling as though we have lost a bit of our own autonomy, our own ability to control our environment and that kind of feels a bit deflating, takes away from us and also makes us anxious because we don\u2019t know how long this is going for. I sort of go, regain control. You can set a routine within your own home. You can choose to do this in your own unique way. You can actually have more freedom to do that than perhaps we can when we\u2019re going to work and doing other things. I think psychologically it\u2019s really important, it\u2019s also really good for our health that we have a routine. Doing things like the right amount of exercise, sleeping, not too much alcohol, those kinds of things I think are really important and reaching out to others. We heard from \u2013 and I said this before \u2013 fellow Aussies during the bushfires that when the chips were down we really needed to rely on each other and build community so how we can proactively build a community. We are in a digital world, we have people in our society who don\u2019t know how to do the online stuff, how can we reach out and help them. Random acts of kindness are great and I think the good old Aussie spirit. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen it, the dress up for bin night, where we\u2019re reclaiming some of that creativity, some of that energy and hope that as we come out of this we can actually come out of it different but OK. Scott Morrison: Watching those mashups, too, on TikTok can help*. *TikTok is now cancelled. I don\u2019t make the rules. Downloading the covid tracing app is once again linked to restrictions lifting. Scott Morrison: But I stress again if we want to get back to sport then we need to download the app. It\u2019s not mandatory, but it\u2019s common sense. As we sit down as a national cabinet and make this decisions about easing restrictions it\u2019s one of the many things we\u2019ll be looking at. I\u2019d love to see community sport get back. The evidence we\u2019re seeing about transmission about outdoor areas and medical evidence is encouraging. But for us to have confidence of a Covid-safe Australia we need the Covidsafe app to be in place. The NRL is pushing ahead with a 28 May start date. But Scott Morrison says there has been no national cabinet determination. The commonwealth has made no decision about the access by the Warriors into Australia. That hasn\u2019t happened. Scott Morrison spoke to Prince Charles. Jacinda Ardern got a call from the Queen. Scott Morrison is again asked about China, and whether Australia needs to address its economic reliance on that nation\u2019s economy. (Just as Australia had (to date) 29 years of uninterrupted growth, China had 30 years of uninterrupted economic growth, which was only slowed by the pandemic) He again points to Australia becoming a bit more self-sufficient in terms of supply chains and manufacturing, in a post Covid restriction world: There are things that have restrained the competitiveness of our manufacturing and other sectors in Australia, that if we want to have these sovereign capabilities, it isn\u2019t achieved through nationalisation or large public subsidies and protectionism. It\u2019s achieved by having competitive businesses that can operate in these sectors and be successful. That is what the road back looks like. It doesn\u2019t look like, you know, and industry run from Canberra. It looks like an industry made up of very successful, innovative businesses on the ground, finding markets, sustaining themselves, employing many Australians, engaging new technology, and using the best minds that we have. That is where sovereignty comes from, and that is the type of approach that we will be pursuing. Australians will find markets, as we have been now for a long time, all around the world, and for many years now our markets have been diversified. I mean, the predominance of our trading relationship with China is obviously resources-based, and I see no reason why that would alter in the future. I mean, the thing about our relationship with China is it is a mutually beneficial one. It is a comprehensive strategic partnership, and we will continue to pursue that partnership, respecting China\u2019s sovereignty, and their independence, and its success will continue to depend on that being returned. When it comes to monitoring wildlife wet markets (which are not just in China and are different to wet markets, which is an all-encompassing term for a fresh food market \u2013 the distinction is important) Morrison says: On wildlife wet markets, my position has never been directed only to one country. It has been a broad position. These markets exist in many places, just as the next pandemic could come from any country, any country in the world. It could occur in any part of the globe, and it is important that we learn the lessons of how this pandemic started, so we can move on any future pandemic, wherever it starts. This is why it is an important initiative, and one that I believe has support to occur at the right time. In Europe at the moment, I was speaking to the president of the European Commission last night. We discussed this issue. The Europeans are bringing forward a motion on this matter at the World Health Assembly. I think it is a very good motion. And on China\u2019s reaction, specifically, Scott Morrison says: That is a matter for them. Australia will do what is in our interest, in the global interest, and we will of course continue to support moves to ensure there is a proper independent assessment of what has occurred here. I mean, that is in the global health interest, it is in the global economic interest. It is not a remarkable position. It is a fairly commonsense position, and one that we don\u2019t resile from. Will Australia continue to pursue an independent investigation, given China\u2019s reaction? Scott Morrison: Australia will of course continue to pursue what is a very reasonable and sensible course of action. This is a virus that has taken more than 200,000 lives across the world. It has shut down the global economy. The implications and impacts of this are extraordinary. Now, it would seem entirely reasonable and sensible that the world would want to have an independent assessment of how this all occurred, so we can learn the lessons and prevent it from happening again. I don\u2019t think this is a remarkable suggestion. I think it is a fairly obvious and commonsense suggestion, that I believe there will be support for at the right time, to ensure we do that. We are a supporter and a funder of the World Health Organization. We have supported particularly the work they do on the ground here, in our region, in south-east Asia, and the south-west Pacific. But it is an organisation like any that can learn lessons from how this began, and the authorities they had to understand what was happening, and the transparency around those issues. Nothing extraordinary about that. So what Australia is pursuing is not targeted. It is said independently, it is said out of common sense, and I think in Australia\u2019s national interests, and in the global interest. And so I find Australia\u2019s position to be not remarkable at all, but one that is entirely responsible, and I am sure is broadly seen in that light around the world. On lifting restrictions, Scott Morrison says don\u2019t get your hopes up for a return to normal as we knew it. Not until there is a vaccine (and even then, things will continue to be different. We are not going back to what we knew before), Putting the protections in place for a Covid-safe Australia, which means we can get an economic growth occurring again, and move on to what Australians like doing again. It won\u2019t be exactly like it was before. I can\u2019t see international travel occurring anytime soon. Can\u2019t see that. The risks there are obvious. The only exception to that, as I have flagged, is potentially with New Zealand, and we have had some good discussions about that. But outside of that, that is unlikely. But I look forward to the time when Australians can travel again within Australia. I look forward to the time where they can sit down for a meal at a restaurant or a cafe or a pub again. I look forward to the time where they can see, whether it is the AFL, the netball, the NRL, or whatever code they support, and being able to watch that again. But I can\u2019t see them going along to a game for a while, those larger mass gatherings. I can see, I suppose, the opportunity for those seeking private prayer in a place of worship, I can see that happening. I can\u2019t necessarily, though, is the largest services occurring again. But anyway, these are the issues we have to work through. Scott Morrison again makes a point of saying there is no beef between him and state and territory leaders who may have a different view on restrictions. In this case, it is in relation to Dan Andrews: First of all, Daniel and I, the premier and I, talk quite regularly, as you would expect, with all the premiers. We are working together. That doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t from time to time have a different view about particular issues. It would be extraordinary if we didn\u2019t. But the fact is, when we do work through these issues, we do it in a very cooperative and respectful way. And that is very much the relationship I have not only with Dan, but with all the premiers and chief ministers, as we work through these issues. So yes, we talk all the time about this, and the point about the states that have gone beyond the baseline levels of restrictions is, that is entirely a matter for those states, and for them to make that judgment, based on how they see the conditions in their own state. He says all the leaders are \u201cswapping notes\u201d and will continue to do so. Scott Morrison says Christine Morgan will address the national cabinet when it meets on Friday but adds the state and territory mental health ministers have been developing a plan, which should be rolled out soon. Beyond that, Christine Morgan says a plan is now being developed for what happens once the restrictions are lifted: As the prime minister has said, that is absolutely critical to us getting back to the life we all want to have. Will we be anxious during that time? Yes, that\u2019s inevitable. We can\u2019t stop the anxiety, but we can certainly support and address it. So the second phase that we will be looking at will be looking at the reality of that, and how can we from a mental health perspective ensure that we are there to meet the needs of Australians? We will look at what are the particular issues? Should there be surges or hotspots, and we will look at what is needed for the long-term recovery. And that is a plan which I understand from the prime minister he has invited to be put before the national cabinet. And we are doing this in a very short turnaround time. We will have something to present for consideration by the end of next week. Christine Morgan says a national plan is being developed to help address mental health gaps: In conversation this morning with the prime minister and with our federal health minister, and reflecting on a very, very strong meeting that we had with Australian ministers responsible for mental health just at the end of last week, we are looking at significantly ramping up our ability to coordinate service delivery, to ensure that the accessibility that we have opened up with telehealth, the accessibility that we have opened up with increased digital and online services, is able to be accessed by Australians in a way that passes across our jurisdictional and commonwealth systems. We need to make that work better. We need to ensure that anybody who actually needs a service is reached. We are looking at how can we reach those Australians who are not currently coming to us for help? We know when we look at those we lose to suicide that 50% of those we lose have not come in touch with our mental health services. We are looking to what we can do by way of outreach. So the commonwealth is working in conjunction with the states and the territories on a plan, on a mental health response plan, which will look at what are we doing on the current scenario. What are the current specific issues, challenges and services we need when we are in this state of physical distancing, and staying at home? Then we will look at what is the appropriate response as we ease those restrictions, and we must ease those restrictions. And it is also important that the onus is not left on those who are struggling. If you notice someone may be in trouble, or not coping well, or just generally feeling anxious and unsafe, don\u2019t be afraid to talk to them about what they might need. Christine Morgan: Your mental health is really important, your mental wellbeing is important. As I said before, it is actually foundational. It is foundational to our creative resilience and being able to get through this in the best way that we can. But also just some circumstantial things which we are hearing, which I think it is just important to put to our notice. I mentioned that in particular in talking to my colleague Georgie Harman at Beyond Blue that they are hearing stories of people not feeling safe. And I think this is a reality that all Australians need to address. I have said before that it is incredibly difficult to go behind closed doors to see what is happening in confined spaces, but we can look at the increase in calls to 1800 Respect, we can look at the increased calls, not there, but which we have also recorded, to Men\u2019s Help Line. We know that this is happening, we know that people may be more challenged than normal to reach out for help, so I call on all Australians, keep your eyes alert for what may be needed. Christine Morgan says people need to keep up their mental health checkups and appointments: For those Australians who live on their own, who actually cannot have that tangible reality of a hug from a loved one, we cannot underestimate the mental health impact that that is having on our Australians. And, of course, there is the worry, that is being addressed, but it is a worry, about the job security, housing security, employment security. Those issues. So what we would have hoped to have seen as a response to that is actually an increase in the use of mental health services. The reality is that, overall, there has actually been a decrease. Now, why is that happening? Why we think that is happening is that, for those who would normally be using mental health services to support their mental health and wellbeing, or their mental health challenges, they are not actually going out and doing those visits. Morgan says telehealth has helped address that but she encouraged people to reach out when they need to. Christine Morgan, the chief executive of the National Mental Health Commission, is at the press conference with Scott Morrison. She is going through some of the stats on mental health since the pandemic measures began: Beyond Blue has seen a 40% increase in contact being made to it over this time last year and what we are seeing with respect to those calls is an increase in the distress levels and an increase in the anxiety levels and in the complexity of what people are feeling. We are also hearing \u2013 and this is anecdotal \u2026 that people aren\u2019t feeling as safe as they once did. That is a concern. Head to Health has also seen a spike in visits. The economic downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic has sparked calls for greater transparency around welfare statistics as Labor argues the most recent data is now four months old. The Labor frontbenchers Brendan O\u2019Connor and Linda Burney argued on Wednesday that the criss \u201cheightens the (pre-existing) need for timely and accurate data\u201d on the number of people who had lost jobs and were now accessing welfare. In a letter to their counterparts Michaelia Cash and Anne Ruston, they noted that the ABS labour forces released last week were a \u201clagging indicator\u201d. They said: Of particular importance to evaluating the impacts of the crisis on employment and social security payments would be the timely release of claims for forms of social security like Newstart and jobseeker payments. However, the Department of Social Services claims to only release such data monthly. It appears the department has not uploaded any data recently, as the most recent available data is from December 2019. This is in stark contrast the practices in comparable jurisdictions, such as the United States that releases comparable data weekly. Scott Morrison said last week 587,686 new jobseeker payment claims had been processed during the pandemic. But it is unclear how many recipients are now on the payment. In December 728,000 people received Newstart. Some 800,000 jobseeker claims have now been processed. Now we get to the point of the press conference \u2013 mental health. Half of the mental health consultations are now being done through telehealth. Scott Morrison: One million telehealth mental health consultations have taken place since mid-March and some $35m specifically in mental health-related consultations have been conducted over that period of time, since telehealth was put in place. A reminder that the app only helps authorities trace who a Covid-positive person has been in contact with (for more than 15 minutes). It won\u2019t alert you to who might be positive in your vicinity \u2013 the app isn\u2019t going to mean you don\u2019t come in contact with the coronavirus. He likes that so much, he says it twice: We are unable to give you breakdowns of what ages of people have downloaded the app or what states they are from because all of that information is locked in the national data store. As you know, that is not information that is available to the commonwealth government or the state governments. That is the protection we have put in place. We would encourage all Australians, if you want to see us return to the more eased restrictions that I know you\u2019re looking forward to and that I\u2019m looking forward to, then it is important that you download the Covidsafe app. That is your ticket, Australia\u2019s ticket to a Covid safe Australia where we can go about the things that we love doing once again. But Scott Morrison says he needs \u201cmillions and millions and millions\u201d more Australians to download the app for a \u201cCovid safe Australia\u201d: I would liken it to the fact that if you want to go outside when the sun is shining, you have to put sunscreen on. This is the same thing. Australians want to return to community sport. If you want to return to a more liberated economy and society, it is important that we get increased numbers of downloads when it comes to the Covidsafe app. This is the ticket to ensuring that we can have eased restrictions and Australians can go back to the lifestyle and the many things that they previously were able to do and this is important. If you have downloaded the app, thank you very much. Convince two or three more people that haven\u2019t downloaded the app to do the same thing. Scott Morrison says 2.8 million people have downloaded the Covidsafe tracing app so far and Australia is \u201cnot too far\u201d from restrictions being relaxed: We are looking at what the bigger-picture success is when it comes to Covid-19 and we are working to all of that together as a national cabinet, our own cabinet here at a commonwealth level will meet again today as we do every week, to ensure we\u2019re focused on all elements of the recovery and the road back. It is important to understand that on the road back, when we get to that Covid-19 safe environment, where we can ease the restrictions, which is not too far away, and you\u2019re already seeing that happen with many of the states and territories \u2013 as I said they would over this interim period before we get together in the week beginning the 11th of May and consider the baseline restrictions. States are already moving back from where they were ahead of those baselines and you have seen those announcements, whether it is in New South Wales or WA or other places. That is welcome and that demonstrates to Australians that there is a dividend for them, for the way that they have been conducting themselves. The prime minister has arrived at the podium (it is raining in Canberra so it is the blue room, the second most fancy press conference location). What does success look like in a Covid-19 world? It doesn\u2019t just look like having a low number of cases. That is welcome. If we were to consider our success on Covid-19 as just having a low number of cases, that is not good enough. That is not what our government is seeking to achieve and I don\u2019t believe it is what the national cabinet is seeking to achieve either. We have had great success in flattening our curve, that is obvious. But having a low number of cases but having Australians out of work, having a low number of cases and children not receiving in classroom education, having a low number of cases and businesses not being open, having a low number of cases and Australians not able to be going about their as normal lives as possible, that is not what success looks like. This is the success we\u2019re seeking, to be able to have the protections in place, to enable Australians to go back to as normal a life and economy as possible. To be able to achieve that as soon as we possibly can. Tasmania is also spending an additional $4.1m to help homeless and vulnerable people through the pandemic. Queensland recorded one new case of Covid-19 in the last 24 hours. The war of words over an independent investigation into the origins of Covid-19 continues. In a statement, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Canberra responded to the latest from the Department of Foreign affairs and Trade: The Q&amp;A of the Embassy Spokesperson in the afternoon of 28 April was a legitimate response to the earlier breach of diplomatic protocol by the Australian side. The report on the phone call between the Chinese Ambassador and DFAT Secretary first appeared on Australian media. The phone call itself as well as the content of the conversation was obviously leaked by some Australian officials. As the Australian media report was inaccurate and misleading, the Embassy had no choice but to set the record straight. The Embassy of China doesn\u2019t play petty tricks, this is not our tradition. But if others do, we have to reciprocate. The crossbench senator Rex Patrick says China\u2019s reaction to Australia\u2019s calls for an independent inquiry into Covid-19\u2019s origins and the initial reaction to the pandemic is more evidence taht an inquiry into Australia\u2019s relationship with China is needed: Chinese Ambassador to Australia Cheng Jingye\u2019s explicit threat this week of a Chinese boycott of Australian services leaves no doubt that a substantial reset of Australia\u2019s relations with China is required. The Ambassador revealed China\u2019s true diplomatic face and confirmed concerns about China\u2019s preference for control and coercion rather than partnership. The Chinese Government\u2019s response to Australian support for an international inquiry into of the COVID-19 pandemic confirms the increasingly fraught nature of Australia-China relations and makes it all the more important that Australia carefully consider our future approach to dealings with Beijing. A business as usual approach is clearly not a sustainable proposition. We need a deep dive into the dynamics of Australia-China relations to determine the best strategies moving forward. The Royal Melbourne Show is the latest event to be cancelled because of Covid-19. We are expecting the prime minister to make some sort of announcement on mental health. That has been a particular focus of Scott Morrison for sometime, which has been heightened during the coronavirus lockdowns. Lithuanians are among the smartest and best people in the world and I am not at all biased about this. The actions of the four NRL players who broke social distancing rules were \u201cbeyond belief\u201d, according to Gladys Berejiklian, and their actions could ultimately jeopardise the planned restart of the season on 28 May, the NSW premier said. Josh Addo-Carr, Latrell Mitchell, Tyronne-Roberts Davis and Nathan Cleary were fined by the league on Tuesday for bringing the game into disrepute, although none are expected to miss any games after being given suspended bans. Mitchell and Addo-Carr are also facing firearms charges. The NRL is forging ahead with plans to restart a shortened season at the end of next month, but still needs to overcome several hurdles if the proposal is to be given the green light. Berejiklian: We always base any decision on health advice and on the ability of an organisation to stick to that health advice. I think it does jeopardise [the restart], because the season hasn\u2019t even started. We are in a pandemic. It\u2019s life and death. You might forgo your own safety, but to compromise someone else\u2019s safety, that\u2019s inexcusable. All of us are making huge sacrifices to protect other people. And if that doesn\u2019t occur \u2013 if we don\u2019t know that\u2019s the intent \u2013 that will of course come into our decision-making, to the extent that it [the season restart] is our decision \u2026 We can not afford to take chances or endorse any risky behaviour in a situation where lives could be lost because of a flagrant breach of a rule.\u201d Tourism Australia will be revamping its campaigns and redirecting its marketing focus to domestic tourism, which makes sense given that the borders are closed to international visitors. Since 2013, Tourism Australia has focused on international tourists, under a directive from the Abbott government. The bushfires had already started to change the focus \u2013 shutting the borders sort of made the decision for them. Scott Morrison will hold a press conference at 11am. What a surprise that the \u2019Bra responds this way. Independent Schools Victoria has criticised Dan Tehan\u2019s offer to bring forward funding, accusing the federal government of using independent schools as a \u201cwedge\u201d in a dispute with the Victorian government. Michelle Green, chief executive of ISV, said: The federal government\u2019s announcement ... has placed the staff, students and parents in Victorian independent schools in an extraordinarily difficult and unfair position. Schools now have just two days to decide if they are able to provide a safe workplace for their teachers and a safe learning environment for their students ... Independent schools are being used as a wedge in a policy disagreement between the federal and Victorian governments. This is unfair and entirely inappropriate when what\u2019s at stake is the health of children and their teachers. The students and teachers at independent schools are being pitted against their government counterparts. ISV has consistently recommended to its member schools that they follow the advice of the Victorian government, based in turn on the advice of Victoria\u2019s chief health officer. While not mandatory for independent schools, this advice is that schools should provide remote and flexible learning for the majority of their students, while providing onsite learning for those who have no alternative. Just two weeks ago the federal government told us that independent schools that acted in accord with Victorian government health advice were effectively compliant with federal advice. This announcement, which was given to the media before it was sent to independent schools, will leave many schools \u2013 and their teachers, students and parents \u2013 confused and frustrated at a time of extraordinary and unprecedented stress. Meanwhile, the casino group controlled by the Hong Kong billionaire Lawrence Ho, Melco Resorts, has sold its 10% stake in James Packer\u2019s Crown Resorts to the US investment giant Blackstone. In an extremely brief statement to the stock exchange, Crown, which has shut down its casinos due to the coronavirus crisis, said it \u201chas been informed that an entity owned by funds managed or advised by The Blackstone Group Inc and its affiliates has purchased 67,675,000 shares in Crown, representing 9.99% of the issued capital of Crown, from Melco Resorts &amp; Entertainment Limited at a price of $8.15 per share\u201d. That\u2019s about $550m. Melco bought the shares for $13 each, so Ho\u2019s group has suffered a significant loss. Ho\u2019s company had agreed to buy almost 20% of Crown but this was later wound back. The original transaction is under scrutiny from an inquiry in NSW, which is itself on hold due to the coronavirus crisis. It\u2019s not clear whether Blackstone will need approval from state gaming authorities for the purchase. Victoria is the latest jurisdiction to provide support to international students (another group who have missed out on federal government support). Forty-five million dollars will be spent on payments of up to $1,100 (two weeks of jobseeker) which approximately 45,000 international students will be eligible for. A woman in her 80s who had been diagnosed with Covid-19 died in Victoria, taking that state\u2019s death total to 18 and the nation\u2019s total to 89. Three more Victorians were diagnosed with Covid-19 in the last 24 hours. The Greens senator Dr Mehreen Faruqi is not a fan of the government\u2019s $13bn advanced funding plan to get independent schools open by 1 June (particularly when state schools are still struggling to get things like hand soap). Faruqi: This is yet another special deal for private schools. Ninety-nine per cent of public schools are underfunded as they work to support kids and families through this pandemic. Their students need urgent investment, not the 99% of private schools that are overfunded. What the minister proposes is a bizarre approach to both school funding and public health. School reopenings should be based on considerations of the health and wellbeing of students and teachers, as well as careful discussions with school communities, not on whether private school boards are willing to accept bribes from the minister in the form of advance funding. It is despicable of the government to try and put pressure on public schools in this way. We know the combination of economic conditions and exorbitant fees at private schools is very likely to cause student withdrawals. An advance for next year based on current enrolments will inevitably include money for students that won\u2019t be there. This comes only weeks after the Liberals and Labor pushed $3.4bn in additional private school funding through parliament during an emergency Covid-19 sitting. Days after indicating that Newstart payments would return to below the poverty line, the government has found money in its back pocket to pay out billions of dollars to private schools ahead of schedule. These are not just numbers. They represent people. The family and federal circuit courts have set up a special Covid-19 list to deal with the urgent applications that have emerged during the lockdown. Women\u2019s Safety NSW says calls for help in domestic violence situations have risen in the past month and services need government assistance to meet the demand. Victims Services NSW statistics show a greater than 10% increase in the number of domestic violence client referrals \u2013 13,767 in total \u2013 being received by NSW government\u2019s Safer Pathway services statewide in March 2020 when compared to the same time last year. Women\u2019s Safety NSW provided detailed information to the NSW government three weeks ago on the significant outlays domestic violence services right across the state had made in changing the way they offer support to victim-survivors, many spending several thousands of dollars on laptops, mobile phones, lockable filing cabinets and information technology upgrades to keep confidential files secure whilst workers shifted to working from home. \u2022 If you or someone you know is impacted by sexual assault, domestic or family violence, call 1800RESPECT on 1800 737 732 or visit 1800RESPECT.org.au. Greg Hunt will hold his press conference at 11.45am today. Gladys Berejiklian said her government had contacted the federal government over the communication issues families connected to the Anglicare Newmarch House aged care home are reporting. At least 30 Covid-19 cases have been linked to the Sydney home, and 11 residents who had been diagnosed with Covid-19 have died, including five in the past 24 hours. Berejiklian: The number of deaths yesterday was devastating, but I think what it does is remind us how contagious this virus is and how it attacks the elderly and vulnerable in particular. And our hearts go out to all the families of the people who have succumbed to the disease, but also to all the families who, um, are really worried about their loved ones. I can confirm that last night the minister for health contacted the federal minister for aged care to express our government\u2019s concerns at the lack of communication between the centre\u2019s operators and the relatives. Linda Burney was asked about the Cook anniversary on Sky news this morning. Well, it\u2019s an anniversary of mixed feelings for all Australians, and for First Nations people like myself. It\u2019s obviously a very difficult anniversary. I\u2019m not saying that Cook was not a great navigator. I\u2019m not saying that Cook\u2019s contribution to the world is not significant. But what [that] today means for First Nations people was the beginning of Terra Nullius \u2013 the beginning of a very difficult period in our history. I think the most important thing is that truth be told \u2013 that it not be a one-sided celebration of Cook. And Cook didn\u2019t circumnavigate Australia as the prime minister said*. That was somebody else. But it is a difficult day. But it\u2019s a day for reflection and truth-telling. I think that\u2019s what\u2019s really important. There is the story from the ships out in Botany Bay. But there is also the story from the shore. And both stories need to be told. *When announcing $6.7m would be spent sending a replica of the Endeavour to circumnavigate Australia, Scott Morrison referred to it as a \u201cre-enactment\u201d. Cook never circumnavigated Australia. In terms of Europeans making their way around the continent, history writes Matthew Flinders as the first to do that. Morrison later corrected himself. The economics committee will hold its second day of insurance hearings today. Sales at the supermarket giant Coles soared more than 13% due to panic buying sparked by the coronavirus crisis. In a statement to the stock exchange Coles said its supermarkets had sold more than $8.2bn of stuff in the first three months of 2020, compared with about $7.2bn at the same time last year. It said its costs were also going to be higher because it had hired extra people to restock shelves and run its stores during longer trading hours. The crisis also caused price hikes averaging 2.6% for supermarket goods because some things were in short supply and Coles stopped putting goods on special due to the floods of shoppers in their stores. By contrast, prices went up by average 0.9% at the same time last year, and if fresh food and cigarettes are excluded actually went down 1.4%. Coles also thinks the virus crisis has changed what people are buying. \u201cAs more customers either work at home or stay at home there is early evidence of customers changing their habits, purchasing less convenience and impulse products and moving towards more cooking and baking from scratch,\u201d it said. \u201cThis is supported by the best viewer numbers of MasterChef in five years.\u201d The Independent Schools Council of Australia has welcomed Dan Tehan\u2019s offer to bring forward non-government schools funding if they open their doors by 1 June. David Mulford, ISCA chief executive, said: The independent sector greatly appreciates this offer as it will help to alleviate some major cashflow issues facing many schools resulting from the financial impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. It is important to note that this is not a handout. It is simply a matter of adjusting the timing of one of the regular scheduled payments to assist in effective financial management by schools. It will have no extra cost to government, but it will make a big difference in helping schools wrestle with the complexities of the Covid-19 impact. While the health and safety of all students and staff remain of the utmost priority, independent schools remain supportive of the government\u2019s intention to reopen schools in a timely manner and look forward to working cooperatively with the government to restore face-to-face learning as soon as practicable. It has been 250 years since Captain James Cook rocked up uninvited on Dharawal land. In some good news, which we all desperately need in these times, the Logies have been cancelled. Australian TV\u2019s \u201cnight of nights\u201d will return in 2021. The number of people downloading the Covid-19 tracing app has topped 2 million. Health experts continue to urge people to download it. The interview ends with a question about Angus Taylor. Mathias Cormann: I have full confidence in Angus Taylor. I\u2019m not close to the ins and out of all this. I will let Angus explain himself. Q: Even if there are differences? Cormann: I will let Angus deal with these matters. Q: Are you confident he has not mislead parliament? Cormann: I have confidence in Angus Taylor, absolutely. Taylor has maintained that he and his staff have done nothing wrong. Should Australia expand its trade base so it is not so reliant on China? Mathias Cormann: Well, obviously Australia is always focused on diversifying our trading opportunities. We are pursuing a very ambitious free-trade agenda, getting access to markets all around the world for Australian products and services all the time. We came into government only 26% of our trade was covered by free-trade arrangements. We have been able to boost that to in excess of 70% and we\u2019re continuing to pursue other opportunities. Having said, that clearly our trading relationship with China will continue to be incredibly important. In fact it\u2019s the most important trade relationship we have and I would expect that to continue for some time. What does Cormann think of where relations are now? Well, look, we obviously are always keen to ensure the relationship is as good as it possible can be. But we are always going to stand up for Australia\u2019s national interest. And in relation to the recent discussion, we think it\u2019s entirely unremarkable for our government to argue that the appropriate time there should be an independent review into what happened and the response to it, and how we can avoid such a crisis in the future. This is a crisis that is impacting on the health and economies and social structures all around the world and it\u2019s of course a principle and right decision to seek to get to the bottom of what happened and how we can better respond to it in the future. And just to drive that point home: Q: You\u2019re happy to have the old Newstart go back to where it was, the $40-a-day level? Mathias Cormann: Well, the decision is that the supplement is in place for the period of the Covid-19 crisis. And as soon as this \u2013 we\u2019re on the other side of this period, the supplement would not continue. That\u2019s right. Q: What do you say to the Jacqui Lambies who say if you do that, and clearly based on what you are saying, you will, the government is pretty heartless. Cormann: I don\u2019t agree. We have provided significant support through this period. We have doubled the level of jobseeker support through this period in recognition of the unique circumstances. But it is a temporary arrangement to deal with a temporary crisis. The independent senator Jacqui Lambie has joined the people calling for the government to keep the increased rate of jobseeker (previously Newstart), beyond the six-month slated time period. Mathias Cormann says \u201cWell, no.\u201d What is being provided right now is a Covid-19 supplement to the jobseeker payment. It is in place for the, you know, the period impacted. Q: So you wouldn\u2019t consider it being permanent? After we\u2019re through this? Cormann: Well, there is a supplement that is in place specifically for \u2013 to deal with the impact of the Covid-19 crisis. And the Covid-19 supplement won\u2019t be in place on the other side. The initial period this is in place for is about six months. And you know, capacity to adjust depending on how long this continues to go for. You can find details of the independent schools funding plan here. Asked about what the Treasury secretary, Dr Steven Kennedy, had to say yesterday about Australia\u2019s unemployment rate, the man who looks like Mathias Cormann says: Well, some jobs will not return. But new jobs will emerge as well. We are working on a plan for a strong recovery on the other side. Clearly the first priority was to ensure we provided the necessary and appropriate supports for our economy, for business, for Australians through this period and we\u2019ve done that through a combination of jobseeker and jobkeeper and various other programs designed to support business and support Australians. And our focus now is on maximising the strength of the recovery on the other side. That clearly is going to be the focus now and there will be new opportunity, fresh opportunities as well, as a result of some of the adaptation that business has been forced to go through over this period. Mathias Cormann is asked why the government is providing up to 25% of independent schools\u2019 recurrent funding early, if they reopen by June. Because we want to see our kids get back into the classroom to receive the benefit of classroom teaching. The health advice is emphatic. The health advice from all the health experts reporting to state and federal governments is emphatic. Schools are safe to be open. The best place for kids is in the classroom and to receive high-quality teaching. We don\u2019t want our kids to have this massive disruption to their education if that is not required or justified on health grounds and the advice is very clear, it\u2019s not. He\u2019s speaking to ABC News Breakfast from Perth and looks how I feel (dead tired). Gladys Berejiklian started her press conference with some more information on the slight relaxing of restrictions planned for this weekend (when you can have up to two visitors): The reasons why we\u2019re allowing people to come into other people\u2019s households is to extend the definition of care. It\u2019s to reduce social isolation and it\u2019s to improve mental health, because we know that so many people in our community have been literally locked up in their homes for weeks on end. We thank them for it. However, we expect every family, every close friendship, to have a conversation about the new arrangements. I\u2019ll still be standing outside the house when I visit my parents. I\u2019m in contact with a lot of people and I don\u2019t want to put them at risk. If you\u2019re visiting someone who is vulnerable, is a particular age, has a comorbidity, please know how contagious this disease is and the horrible impact it can have if you get the serious side effects from it. We don\u2019t want to see families unnecessarily go through that grief. Please have those conversations with your families. Have conversations about what you can do and we haven\u2019t put a limit on how far you can travel in order to visit a loved one. But we ask everyone to be responsible. This is not a holiday. The reason we\u2019re allowing people to do this, to reduce isolation, to improve mental health and give people that bit of contact which they haven\u2019t \u2013 for some people, if you\u2019re working for home \u2013 for a very long time. New South Wales has reported 11 new cases in the last 24 hours. Victoria still appears to be the main holdout when it comes to adhering to the prime minister\u2019s wish that schools return by June (in terms of the big states). NSW has announced a staggered return to onsite learning from 11 May. Queensland has signalled it will return to some form of en masse onsite learning from 22 May (announced around 15 May). Northern Territory schools remain open. Western Australian schools are open for onsite learning, with social distancing in place. That state is expecting attendance to increase over the next few weeks. South Australian schools are open for onsite learning with students slowly returning. Tasmania still has restrictions in place for the north-west, and is encouraging parents who can keep their children home, to do so. ACT has nine \u201chub\u201d schools open for onsite learning but is maintaining at-home learning for now. Here was the Victorian chief health officer a couple of weeks ago: This seems awkward ... (via AAP) A Queensland MP has resigned from the Liberal National party\u2019s shadow ministry after he and two police officers were fined for breaching coronavirus restrictions. Toowoomba North MP Trevor Watts and the sergeant and senior constable were each fined $1,334 over a weekend street gathering in breach of social distancing rules. LNP leader Deb Frecklington said she had accepted Watts\u2019 resignation as shadow minister for police and counter-terrorism and corrective services. \u201cI expect the highest standards from my team, especially my shadow ministers,\u201d Frecklington said in a statement on Tuesday. Watts said he had been catching up with his neighbours on their respective driveways on Sunday afternoon and did not think he was in breach at the time. \u201cMy actions demonstrated a momentary lack of judgment and I regret them deeply,\u201d he said in a statement posted by Seven News. Greg Hunt and Brendan Murphy have announced a \u201ccritically important partnership\u201d between the government and Andrew Forrest\u2019s Minderoo Foundation to provide an additional 10m Covid-19 testing kits. Over 500,000 Covid-19 tests have been completed to date. The addition of 10m tests across the country between now and the end of the year equates to an almost 20-fold increase in testing. This increased testing capability is critical to enabling Australia to expand the testing criteria for Covid-19, and providing national cabinet with the confidence that widespread surveillance testing and expanded testing is achievable and adequately resourced. This is one of the precedent conditions the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) have set for the national cabinet to achieve over the next four weeks before the further easing of social distancing and economic restrictions. Further, the diversification of Covid-19 testing supplies in Australia ensures adequate testing capability whilst there are uncertain supply lines and shortages globally. Expanded testing will also protect healthcare and essential workers on the front line, and ensures the healthcare systems remain strong and resilient to future challenges. Good morning and welcome to today\u2019s coverage of the coronavirus crisis in Australia. We will bring you all the latest developments, including the federal government\u2019s push for independent and Catholic schools\u2019 to return to face-to-face teaching by June. Here were some of yesterday\u2019s major developments to bring you up to speed: Four more deaths at Sydney\u2019s Newmarch House aged care home were announced on Tuesday evening, bringing the death toll at the facility to 11. On Wednesday morning the aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, labelled the deaths \u201cabsolutely tragic\u201d. More than 2.4 million Australians have downloaded the government\u2019s Covidsafe app. The NRL has said it has confirmed it will start playing matches on 28 May, resuming a 20-round season. The deteriorating relationship between Canberra and Beijing worsened further over Australia\u2019s proposal for an independent inquiry into China\u2019s handling of the Covid-19 outbreak. We\u2019ll bring you all of today\u2019s updates as they happen. You have Amy Remeikis with you for most of the day. Ready?",

      "body": "<p>San Francisco seems to have done a good job of flattening the coronavirus curve. Initially perceived as an overreaction, the <a href=\"https://www.sfdph.org/dph/alerts/files/HealthOrderC19-07-%20Shelter-in-Place.pdf\">shelter-in-place order</a> issued on 16 March now seems prudent in light of the sustained public health crisis that New York has endured.</p> <p>San Francisco has seen roughly 1,450 confirmed coronavirus cases and 23 deaths but the city wasn\u2019t always so good at heeding the advice of experts.</p> <p>A century ago, the influenza pandemic hit San Francisco harder than any other major US city, with 45,000 infections and 3,000 deaths. As NPR\u2019s Tim Mak pointed out in a 19 April <a href=\"https://twitter.com/timkmak/status/1251936242834563073\">Twitter thread</a>, protests in late 1918 and early 1919 helped turn a manageable public-health situation into a disaster \u2013 courtesy of a now-forgotten movement known as the Anti-Mask League.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a93319ecf786ed5344bf5e03a613c219dbea191\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a93319ecf786ed5344bf5e03a613c219dbea191/0_0_5256_3420/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A San Francisco pedestrian passes graffiti encouraging masks during the coronavirus outbreak.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"651\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A San Francisco pedestrian passes graffiti encouraging masks during the coronavirus outbreak.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It began after the initial wave of infections in the fall of 1918 died down, the approximate juncture where California is now vis-a-vis Covid-19. But instead of flattening the curve, hostility to commonsense measures on grounds of personal liberty turned that curve into a double hump. Cases spiked in October, and mask use became mandatory, but only for four weeks. As of 21 November, they were no longer required.</p> <p>Seemingly clear of danger, the city reopened, and a populace weary from the first world war and the widespread destruction of the 1906 earthquake and fire jumped back into the conviviality of life. Predictably, this led to a second wave of illness and death, and the city became convulsed by debates over the efficacy of masks and whether their use should be compulsory or not.</p> <p>Then as now, a loose alliance of constitutional conservatives and economic boosters coalesced in opposition to the idea of masks, even as the caseload exploded to more than 600 a week by January 1919. A port city of 500,000 couldn\u2019t <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/gunnison-colorado-the-town-that-dodged-the-1918-spanish-flu-pandemic\">seal itself off from the world</a> the way a remote mountain town like Gunnison, Colorado, could, and ultimately around 3,000 residents would succumb to the flu. All the while, civic-minded physicians coaxed people into adopting masks as a kind of fashionable accessory, with one <a href=\"https://www.influenzaarchive.org/cities/city-sanfrancisco.html#\">claiming</a> that \u201cchiffon veils for women and children have been as satisfactory as the common gauze masks\u201d. But the Anti-Mask League complained bitterly that an obligation to cover one\u2019s nose and mouth was an unconstitutional affront to the principles of a free society.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f3a1c3fcb9b5fd822267f54819b294b236aabb89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3a1c3fcb9b5fd822267f54819b294b236aabb89/0_0_4188_3075/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A police officer wearing a flu mask leads two men away from the Ferry building in San Francisco in 1918.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"734\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A police officer wearing a flu mask leads two men away from the Ferry building in San Francisco in 1918.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hamilton Henry Dobbin/California State Library handout/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The San Francisco Board of Supervisors nonetheless reinstated the mask requirement on 17 January 1919. People caught without one were typically fined $5 or $10, money that was donated to the Red Cross, although a minority of scofflaws were sentenced to brief jail terms. In one case, a zealous public health official <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/how-fragmented-country-fights-pandemic/608284/\">shot three people</a> on a downtown street.</p> <p>The League \u201cseems to have been an ad hoc thing that was set up to respond to the board of supervisors reinstituting the mandate that citizens wear masks\u201d, says Brian Dolan, a professor at the University of California San Francisco school of medicine.

      "bodyText": "San Francisco seems to have done a good job of flattening the coronavirus curve. Initially perceived as an overreaction, the shelter-in-place order issued on 16 March now seems prudent in light of the sustained public health crisis that New York has endured. San Francisco has seen roughly 1,450 confirmed coronavirus cases and 23 deaths but the city wasn\u2019t always so good at heeding the advice of experts. A century ago, the influenza pandemic hit San Francisco harder than any other major US city, with 45,000 infections and 3,000 deaths. As NPR\u2019s Tim Mak pointed out in a 19 April Twitter thread, protests in late 1918 and early 1919 helped turn a manageable public-health situation into a disaster \u2013 courtesy of a now-forgotten movement known as the Anti-Mask League. It began after the initial wave of infections in the fall of 1918 died down, the approximate juncture where California is now vis-a-vis Covid-19. But instead of flattening the curve, hostility to commonsense measures on grounds of personal liberty turned that curve into a double hump. Cases spiked in October, and mask use became mandatory, but only for four weeks. As of 21 November, they were no longer required. Seemingly clear of danger, the city reopened, and a populace weary from the first world war and the widespread destruction of the 1906 earthquake and fire jumped back into the conviviality of life. Predictably, this led to a second wave of illness and death, and the city became convulsed by debates over the efficacy of masks and whether their use should be compulsory or not. Then as now, a loose alliance of constitutional conservatives and economic boosters coalesced in opposition to the idea of masks, even as the caseload exploded to more than 600 a week by January 1919. A port city of 500,000 couldn\u2019t seal itself off from the world the way a remote mountain town like Gunnison, Colorado, could, and ultimately around 3,000 residents would succumb to the flu. All the while, civic-minded physicians coaxed people into adopting masks as a kind of fashionable accessory, with one claiming that \u201cchiffon veils for women and children have been as satisfactory as the common gauze masks\u201d. But the Anti-Mask League complained bitterly that an obligation to cover one\u2019s nose and mouth was an unconstitutional affront to the principles of a free society. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors nonetheless reinstated the mask requirement on 17 January 1919. People caught without one were typically fined $5 or $10, money that was donated to the Red Cross, although a minority of scofflaws were sentenced to brief jail terms. In one case, a zealous public health official shot three people on a downtown street. The League \u201cseems to have been an ad hoc thing that was set up to respond to the board of supervisors reinstituting the mandate that citizens wear masks\u201d, says Brian Dolan, a professor at the University of California San Francisco school of medicine. Local denim manufacturer Levi Strauss was a major producer of masks, Dolan adds, lending credence to the suspicion that profit was the real motive. The medical literature was scant, with a Canadian health official casting doubt on masks\u2019 effectiveness as well. \u201cHe said it was quite clear from the epidemiological evidence: when people across the world were asked to wear masks, the numbers still went up,\u201d Dolan says. \u201cSo people began to lose confidence against this measure, and his recommendation as a result was to focus on quarantine and isolation: what we\u2019re calling social distancing.\u201d Only a week after the supervisors took action, some 4,500 League members \u2013 far more than any gathering this month in Sacramento or Lansing \u2013 assembled at the long-gone Dreamland skating rink. After that show of force, the chair of the Anti-Mask League, one Mrs E C Harrington, implored the board of supervisors to grant \u201cspeedy relief\u201d from the \u201cburdensome\u201d requirement.

      "bodyText": "California advocates who have long worked to keep young men safe from gun violence are adapting their activities to deal with another pressing public health emergency that\u2019s disproportionately killing black Americans: Covid-19. Before the coronavirus outbreak, staff at the Office of Neighborhood Safety in the San Francisco Bay area city of Richmond worked with young men who were at risk of being caught up in the cycles of gun violence that have long rocked the community. The six outreach workers in the team counseled them, connected them with services, and intervened in local conflicts \u2013 all in an effort to prevent shootings and stop retaliatory gunfire. Richmond has seen at least 15 shooting incidents since the start of the stay-at-home orders that followed the coronavirus outbreak, including the first murder of the year and a triple shooting at a barbecue. Although the rate of gun violence in the city has steadily declined over the years, ONS staff says that the recent uptick coupled with new limits on in-person contact with the 37 fellows they work with is a tough adjustment. \u201cMost of our strategy is based on human interaction,\u201d said Sam Vaughn, program manager for ONS. \u201cWe need access and to be able to hug our youngsters and tell them that we\u2019re there, we need to be with them.\u201d \u201cOne of our young people\u2019s friends was shot and to only be able to talk to him through FaceTime was difficult,\u201d said James Houston, lead neighborhood change agent for ONS. \u201cIt was good to be able to engage him, but for me, showing love is the most important part of our job,\u201d he continued. The staff said the stay-at-home orders have made it more difficult for some of the fellows in the program to avoid conflict. Before the stay-at-home orders went into effect, many of the young men who knew they were in danger of being targeted could keep themselves safe by staying with friends or family in different cities. Or they could blend into street and highway traffic to avoid being caught off guard by a rival. Now, that\u2019s not an option. \u201cAll of a sudden they\u2019re in the same place for a month, that news is gonna get out,\u201d said Vaughn. \u201cIt\u2019s not about getting lucky and seeing someone, it\u2019s just about waiting long enough.\u201d Now, instead of the usual hugs, handshakes and daps, Vaughn and Houston are waiting in line at Costco early in the morning to buy groceries that staff will drop off to ONS fellows. Neighborhood change agents do about 12 grocery deliveries a week and will continue to do so until supplies run out or Richmond\u2019s shelter-in-place order \u2013 which is set to expire on 31 May \u2013 is lifted. Houston and Vaughn say that some of the young men they interact with still believe they are too young and healthy to become severely ill if they contract Covid-19. \u201cSome of the young still feel like they\u2019re more susceptible to being shot and killed than catching the virus and dying,\u201d said Vaughn. But many people in their communities are at high risk of complications when contracting Covid-19. Black Californians account for just 6% of the state\u2019s population but make up almost 12% of its total Covid-19 related deaths, according to the most recent state data, a discrepancy that stems from decades of systemic failings and medical discrimination. So, in addition to their regular violence prevention work and delivering food and supplies, Houston and Vaughn are relaying the seriousness of Covid-19 to the people they interact with. \u201cIt\u2019s been great to deliver food to our young people and their families and tell them, \u2018Stay inside, you don\u2019t have to go out for anything\u2019,\u201d said Houston. \u201cWe\u2019re doing all we can so they can just ride this out.\u201d \u201cThe number one focus is to make sure folks have the needs in their homes met so they don\u2019t feel desperate and do something drastic,\u201d echoed Vaughn. ONS staff and other violence interrupters in a handful of California cities are recognized as an essential part of city operations. Even with this recognition Vaughn finds himself \u201chustling\u201d to get the necessary protective equipment \u2013 like masks and gloves \u2013 for himself and the rest of the staff. The supplies they do have are mostly donations from local residents and gun violence reduction groups such as Moms Demand Action. \u201cWe\u2019re piecemealing it together and using all of our networks to make sure we have all the basics, cause it\u2019s a lot of exposure,\u201d said Vaughn. Vaughn adds that he sees the pandemic to be an \u201cequalizer\u201d of sorts. He argues that many Americans are now getting a glimpse into some of the hardships faced by many in underserved communities \u2013 especially the locales that have been stricken by gun violence for decades. He continued: \u201cAll the things people are feeling and dealing with now is what young people in urban America have been dealing with forever: questions of mortality, not having basic needs, feeling all alone.\u201d",

On Tuesday President Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/28/trump-executive-order-meat-processing-plants-coronavirus\">issued an executive order </a>to keep slaughterhouses open which would, he said, help solve liability problems for meat companies.</p> <p>At least two million animals have already reportedly <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/two-million-delmarva-chickens-euthanized-as-virus-hobbles-processing/2020/04/24/82fc93a4-865d-11ea-878a-86477a724bdb_story.html\">been culled on farm</a>, and that number is expected to rise. Approved methods for slaughtering poultry include slow suffocation by covering them with foam, or by shutting off the ventilation into the barns. <br><br>A nationwide advisory <a href=\"https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/newsroom/stakeholder-info/sa_by_date/sa-2020/sa-04/meat-processing-coordination-center\">issued</a> last Friday by the US Department of Agriculture and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said state veterinarians and government officials would be ready to assist with culls, or \u201cdepopulation\u201d, if alternatives could not be found. </p> <p>The advisory was described by Leah Garc\u00e9s, president of US welfare organisation Mercy for Animals, as a clear indication of a national farm animal emergency. Garc\u00e9s told the Guardian that chickens are most at risk, followed by piglets. \u201cChickens are bred for speedy growth and are meant to be slaughtered at between 42 and 47 days. After that they die.\u201d</p> <p>Political leaders in Iowa \u2013 the biggest pig producing state in the US - <a href=\"https://www.grassley.senate.gov/sites/default/files/Iowa%20group-2020-covid-pork-letter-1.pdf\">have warned</a> that producers could be forced to kill 700,000 pigs a week due to meat plant slowdowns or closures. The situation has been exacerbated by <a href=\"https://thefern.org/2020/04/when-meat-plants-shutter-what-happens-to-market-ready-animals/\">consolidation</a> within the sector, with the number of meat plants having fallen by half in 45 years.</p> <p>An 8 April letter from the chicken producer Allen Harim, seen as a photo by the Guardian, said that as of 10 April the company \u201cwill begin depopulating flocks in the field\u201d. The letter went on to tell contract farmers that \u201cgrowers, whose flocks we depopulate, will be fairly compensated\u201d. It was signed by Michele V Minton, director of live operations.</p> <p>In response to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/two-million-delmarva-chickens-euthanized-as-virus-hobbles-processing/2020/04/24/82fc93a4-865d-11ea-878a-86477a724bdb_story.html\">reports</a> that nearly 2 million chickens have already been killed, trade body Delmarva Poultry Industry (DPI) <a href=\"https://www.wmdt.com/2020/04/nearly-two-million-delmarva-chickens-being-killed-not-processed-amidst-covid-19-staffing-shortage/?fbclid=IwAR298TH1gCcNZQGgJSqDiR2lF6FAHeu_2NC3IJkFDBGoJO3WKjr3In4rdbA\">told</a> local media that methods used to \u201cdepopulate\u201d flocks are accepted by the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA).</p> <p>In a letter this month to leading poultry companies, Mercy for Animals called AVMA <a href=\"https://www.avma.org/sites/default/files/resources/AVMA-Guidelines-for-the-Depopulation-of-Animals.pdf\">culling methods</a> \u2013 which include water-based foam generators, whole-house gassing and ventilation shutdown \u2013 inhumane.</p> <p>Foaming means covering hens with a layer of foam that blocks their airways, gradually suffocating them over several minutes. Ventilation shutdown, meanwhile, although described by the AVMA as \u201cnot preferred\u201d, is one of the cruellest, but cheapest options, said Garc\u00e9s. \u201cShutting down broiler chicken house ventilation systems means animals die of organ failure due to overheating, as temperatures quickly rise.\u201d<br><br>An AVMA spokesperson said the guidelines list several methods of depopulation that may be considered in emergency situations. \u201cEach decision to depopulate animals is unique, and the myriad factors surrounding that decision and those animals need to be considered on a case-by-case basis to determine the most appropriate method in that situation, with as much consideration given to the welfare of the animals as practicable.\u201d</p> <p>Tyson Foods, one of America\u2019s largest meat producers, has closed or reduced production at several facilities throughout the US, including a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/d21fe9a4864971427d40fd2caa61ad34\">pork-processing plant in Iowa</a>, where several workers tested positive for Covid-19. Tyson plants in Texas and Indiana <a href=\"https://www.tysonfoods.com/news/news-releases\">also closed</a>. Other facilities, including a <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/another-smithfield-meat-processing-plant-shuts-down-over-coronavirus-concerns-1500285\">Smithfield Foods pork plant in South Dakota</a>, and a <a href=\"https://www.wbay.com/content/news/JBS-facility-to-temporarily-close-in-Green-Bay-569962531.html\">JBS beef plant in Wisconsin</a>, have announced temporary shutdowns.</p> <p>On Sunday Tyson chairman, John Tyson, <a href=\"https://thefeed.blog/2020/04/26/feeding-the-nation-and-keeping-our-employees-healthy/\">warned in a blog post that</a>: \u201cIn addition to meat shortages, this is a serious food waste issue. Farmers across the nation simply will not have anywhere to sell their livestock to be processed, when they could have fed the nation. Millions of animals \u2013 chickens, pigs and cattle \u2013 will be depopulated because of the closure of our processing facilities. The food supply chain is breaking.\u201d<br><br>In a 14 April <a href=\"http://nppc.org/hog-farmers-face-covid-19-financial-crisis/\">statement</a>, the president of the National Pork Producers Council (NPPC), Howard Roth, said that the combination of restaurant and slaughterhouse suspensions meant pigs \u201care backing up on farms with nowhere to go, leaving farmers with tragic choices to make [because] hog farmers have nowhere to move their hogs.\u201d<br><br>A spokesperson for the NPPC said: \u201cOn the topic of euthanasia, our farmers are focused on doing the right thing for their animals and employees while raising food for consumers. Euthanasia is always a devastating last resort for any farmer.

      "bodyText": "Covid-related slaughterhouse shutdowns in the US are leading to fears of meat shortages and price rises, while farmers are being forced to consider \u201cdepopulating\u201d their animals. More than 20 slaughterhouses have been forced to close, although some have subsequently reopened. On Tuesday President Trump issued an executive order to keep slaughterhouses open which would, he said, help solve liability problems for meat companies. At least two million animals have already reportedly been culled on farm, and that number is expected to rise. Approved methods for slaughtering poultry include slow suffocation by covering them with foam, or by shutting off the ventilation into the barns. A nationwide advisory issued last Friday by the US Department of Agriculture and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said state veterinarians and government officials would be ready to assist with culls, or \u201cdepopulation\u201d, if alternatives could not be found. The advisory was described by Leah Garc\u00e9s, president of US welfare organisation Mercy for Animals, as a clear indication of a national farm animal emergency. Garc\u00e9s told the Guardian that chickens are most at risk, followed by piglets. \u201cChickens are bred for speedy growth and are meant to be slaughtered at between 42 and 47 days. After that they die.\u201d Political leaders in Iowa \u2013 the biggest pig producing state in the US - have warned that producers could be forced to kill 700,000 pigs a week due to meat plant slowdowns or closures. The situation has been exacerbated by consolidation within the sector, with the number of meat plants having fallen by half in 45 years. An 8 April letter from the chicken producer Allen Harim, seen as a photo by the Guardian, said that as of 10 April the company \u201cwill begin depopulating flocks in the field\u201d. The letter went on to tell contract farmers that \u201cgrowers, whose flocks we depopulate, will be fairly compensated\u201d. It was signed by Michele V Minton, director of live operations. In response to reports that nearly 2 million chickens have already been killed, trade body Delmarva Poultry Industry (DPI) told local media that methods used to \u201cdepopulate\u201d flocks are accepted by the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA). In a letter this month to leading poultry companies, Mercy for Animals called AVMA culling methods \u2013 which include water-based foam generators, whole-house gassing and ventilation shutdown \u2013 inhumane. Foaming means covering hens with a layer of foam that blocks their airways, gradually suffocating them over several minutes. Ventilation shutdown, meanwhile, although described by the AVMA as \u201cnot preferred\u201d, is one of the cruellest, but cheapest options, said Garc\u00e9s. \u201cShutting down broiler chicken house ventilation systems means animals die of organ failure due to overheating, as temperatures quickly rise.\u201d An AVMA spokesperson said the guidelines list several methods of depopulation that may be considered in emergency situations. \u201cEach decision to depopulate animals is unique, and the myriad factors surrounding that decision and those animals need to be considered on a case-by-case basis to determine the most appropriate method in that situation, with as much consideration given to the welfare of the animals as practicable.\u201d Tyson Foods, one of America\u2019s largest meat producers, has closed or reduced production at several facilities throughout the US, including a pork-processing plant in Iowa, where several workers tested positive for Covid-19. Tyson plants in Texas and Indiana also closed. Other facilities, including a Smithfield Foods pork plant in South Dakota, and a JBS beef plant in Wisconsin, have announced temporary shutdowns. On Sunday Tyson chairman, John Tyson, warned in a blog post that: \u201cIn addition to meat shortages, this is a serious food waste issue. Farmers across the nation simply will not have anywhere to sell their livestock to be processed, when they could have fed the nation. Millions of animals \u2013 chickens, pigs and cattle \u2013 will be depopulated because of the closure of our processing facilities. The food supply chain is breaking.\u201d In a 14 April statement, the president of the National Pork Producers Council (NPPC), Howard Roth, said that the combination of restaurant and slaughterhouse suspensions meant pigs \u201care backing up on farms with nowhere to go, leaving farmers with tragic choices to make [because] hog farmers have nowhere to move their hogs.\u201d A spokesperson for the NPPC said: \u201cOn the topic of euthanasia, our farmers are focused on doing the right thing for their animals and employees while raising food for consumers. Euthanasia is always a devastating last resort for any farmer. However, when farmers cannot send pigs to market, barns can become overcrowded, limiting access to food and water and present significant animal welfare challenges. The farmers we represent believe it is unethical to allow any animal to suffer.\u201d Slaughterhouses are acknowledged to be the vulnerable point in the meat supply chain. A huge amount of consolidation in the last few decades means that both the US and EU have fewer, larger meat processing plants. When a single US Tyson beef plant was shut down by a fire last summer, it caused a market shock that some called \u201chistorically significant\u201d. The margins for beef carcasses doubled, while prices for live cattle fell. This is because shutdowns mean farmers may not be able to take their cattle to slaughter, and will then face unexpected costs in feed and care. \u201cIt is not a broken system by any means,\u201d said senior analyst with Agribusiness Intelligence in Memphis, Adam Speck. \u201cIt is a black swan event. There are hogs available. We are full to the brim. But when we are down about 23% in hog harvesting capacity and we can\u2019t process at normal rates, then the only option is to depopulate.\u201d \u201cChickens have a super-short life. I understand they started euthanising them about the second week of April and the cull must be in the millions now. We might be down about 10% of current chicken availability now.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s going to be painful for the next few weeks until about mid-May when hopefully processing plants start to come back online.\u201d In Europe, by contrast, the situation appears reversed, as slaughterhouses remain open and intensive pig and poultry farmers benefit from lockdown shopping sprees for home cooking. \u201cThe main cause of the supply chain problems in the US seems to be Covid-19 and the number of sick workers at slaughterhouses,\u201d said Professor Peter Sand\u00f8e at the University of Copenhagen\u2019s Department of Food and Resource Economics. In Denmark, a major European exporter of pork and chicken, slaughterhouses are still running and \u201cintensive pig and poultry farmers are doing OK thanks to consumer demands both locally and in the countries\u2019 we are exporting to,\u201d said Sand\u00f8e. In the UK the situation appears to be similar. \u201cThe irony is that smaller, more sustainable farmers are the hardest hit while supermarkets in the UK stock up on the cheapest, most intensively reared pork and poultry,\u201d said Patrick Holden, dairy farmer and founder of the Sustainable Food Trust.",

      "bodyText": "Next is cancelling its dividend and share buyback programme to save \u00a3480m as it warned sales would fall \u201cfaster and steeper\u201d than previously feared during the coronavirus crisis. The fashion and homewares retailer warned it could suffer losses of \u00a3150m \u2013 from a profit of almost \u00a3600m last year \u2013 as full-price sales collapse by up to 40%. The potential scenario outlined by Next on Wednesday is a significant worsening from the worst case of a 25% drop predicted by the group just last month. It said expectations had changed because of a bigger-than-expected 38% slump in sales in the three months to 26 April after having to close its stores and website for a period. It also believes it likely trading will continue to decline through the autumn and winter season. Simon Wolfson, the chief executive, said it was not clear when Next would be able to reopen stores. \u201cThere is no way that we or the government can know. No one knows what next week\u2019s infection rates will be and there\u2019s no comparable event to what we are experiencing at the moment that allows people to use the past to inform a prediction about the future. \u201cRather than bully the government to give information it can\u2019t give we have to prepare for all eventualities.\u201d Next confirmed it would not pay a dividend due in August and added it was also highly unlikely to pay one in January as much had changed since it last updated investors just over a month ago amid \u201cunprecedented uncertainty\u201d caused by the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cWe anticipate that it will take some time for customers to return to their normal shopping habits and that sales will be very subdued when trade commences,\u201d the group said. \u201cWe believe that the effects of the coronavirus will be felt for longer than we first anticipated. The economic consequences and continued social distancing will mean that both retail sales and online sales will be disrupted even after full lockdown measures have been lifted.\u201d The retailer stressed its finances were secure as \u201chistoric maintenance of healthy margins and high returns on capital have built a strong base from which to weather the storm\u201d. To help it cope with the crisis, Next is raising \u00a3155m in cash with the sale and leaseback of three warehouses and its headquarters in Leicester. It has saved \u00a3290m by cancelling stock orders from suppliers and made \u00a3120m in other cost savings, including marketing and distribution. The company has also won approval for a government-backed emergency loan and furloughed more than 80% of staff under the government\u2019s job retention scheme. Next said it was working on getting back to business, and has 70% of its ranges available online, after putting in place physical distancing measures at its warehouse. Overseas online operations are closed in all but two countries, Germany and Russia, but the company expects to begin reopening by the end of this week. The group is working on plans to reopen stores with physical distancing measures in place, once it is allowed to do so. Wolfson said Next had begun trialling measures such as till screens and one-way systems in one store and had ordered kit for other outlets. Next said large, out-of-town stores would be the first to open as they had the space to organise queuing systems similar to those used by supermarkets. The update from Next came as Dixons Carphone said it was also cancelling its dividend, although the electrical products retailer said its sales had fallen by just 3% in the five weeks to 25 April. A surge in online demand allowed the retailer to recover about two-thirds of sales lost in its closed UK stores. Online sales jumped by 166% in the UK and Ireland and by 16% overseas, as shoppers sought out computers to cope with working from home as well as breadmakers, gaming equipment and TVs for entertainment during the lockdown.",

      "body": "<p>Efforts by the UK government to achieve gender equality through its aid programmes need to be better managed and more transparent, according to the financial watchdog.</p> <p>The National Audit Office (NAO) said the Department for International Development\u2019s (DfID) 12-year gender equality strategy was wide-ranging, but did not have a long-term, costed, implementation plan, limiting \u201cits ability to assess progress and consider value for money\u201d.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Improving-the-lives-of-women-and-girls-overseas.pdf\">report</a> published on Wednesday, the NAO said DfID did not have \u201can accurate grasp of which of its programmes have a gender equality focus and how much it spends on them\u201d.</p> <p>In 2018, when the department launched its <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/708116/Strategic-vision-gender-equality1.pdf\">strategy</a>, it estimated that two-thirds of bilateral aid, \u00a34.2bn, was spent on programmes that targeted gender equality as a policy objective \u2013 71% more than in 2011.</p> <p>However, the watchdog said its analysis showed that 33% of this money had been incorrectly classified.</p> <p>\u201cInaccuracy in DfID\u2019s gender-marked data means that DfID does not have an accurate grasp of which of its programmes have a gender equality focus and how much it spends on them, limiting its ability to monitor progress against its 2018 strategic vision,\u201d said the report.</p> <p>The watchdog recommended DfID publish a plan for implementing its strategy setting out key milestones and planned achievements in the short, medium and long term.</p> <p>The NAO also questioned the department\u2019s efforts to address harmful social norms \u2013 the unwritten \u201crules\u201d that govern behaviour and actions. DfID has recognised that addressing social norms will have the most long-term impact on tackling gender equality, but how it works may restrict progress, said the report. \u2018\u201cProgrammes can have a relatively short-term life cycle, and there is often little scope for evaluating the impact of the programme in the years following completion,\u201d it said.</p> <p>The department\u2019s approach, which involved the use of outside contractors, meant the involvement of smaller, local organisations was limited, the report added, which \u201ccould mean that women\u2019s rights organisations and smaller non-governmental organisations, some of which DfID supports financially, are unable to receive DfID funding. In their opinion, they are often <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/mar/08/emma-watson-keira-knightley-among-stars-calling-for-better-protection-international-womens-day-letter\">best-placed to address</a> successfully harmful social norms in the community.\u201d</p> <p>Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said: \u201cDfID\u2019s commitment to tackling gender inequality is ambitious and wide-ranging.

      "bodyText": "Efforts by the UK government to achieve gender equality through its aid programmes need to be better managed and more transparent, according to the financial watchdog. The National Audit Office (NAO) said the Department for International Development\u2019s (DfID) 12-year gender equality strategy was wide-ranging, but did not have a long-term, costed, implementation plan, limiting \u201cits ability to assess progress and consider value for money\u201d. In a report published on Wednesday, the NAO said DfID did not have \u201can accurate grasp of which of its programmes have a gender equality focus and how much it spends on them\u201d. In 2018, when the department launched its strategy, it estimated that two-thirds of bilateral aid, \u00a34.2bn, was spent on programmes that targeted gender equality as a policy objective \u2013 71% more than in 2011. However, the watchdog said its analysis showed that 33% of this money had been incorrectly classified. \u201cInaccuracy in DfID\u2019s gender-marked data means that DfID does not have an accurate grasp of which of its programmes have a gender equality focus and how much it spends on them, limiting its ability to monitor progress against its 2018 strategic vision,\u201d said the report. The watchdog recommended DfID publish a plan for implementing its strategy setting out key milestones and planned achievements in the short, medium and long term. The NAO also questioned the department\u2019s efforts to address harmful social norms \u2013 the unwritten \u201crules\u201d that govern behaviour and actions. DfID has recognised that addressing social norms will have the most long-term impact on tackling gender equality, but how it works may restrict progress, said the report. \u2018\u201cProgrammes can have a relatively short-term life cycle, and there is often little scope for evaluating the impact of the programme in the years following completion,\u201d it said. The department\u2019s approach, which involved the use of outside contractors, meant the involvement of smaller, local organisations was limited, the report added, which \u201ccould mean that women\u2019s rights organisations and smaller non-governmental organisations, some of which DfID supports financially, are unable to receive DfID funding. In their opinion, they are often best-placed to address successfully harmful social norms in the community.\u201d Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said: \u201cDfID\u2019s commitment to tackling gender inequality is ambitious and wide-ranging. Two years into the department\u2019s 12-year vision, individual interventions are already improving the lives of women and girls overseas. \u201cHowever, if DfID is to achieve its ambitious aims, it needs to develop a clearer long-term plan for implementing its vision and continue to take steps to improve the accuracy and transparency of its performance information.\u201d Meg Hillier, chair of the public accounts committee, added: \u201cDfID should be congratulated for setting an ambitious vision to tackle gender inequality by 2030. \u201cHowever, good intentions are not enough. DfID hasn\u2019t set milestones to check if it is on the right track, or assessed how its local offices balance competing priorities. It doesn\u2019t even have accurate information about which projects are supposed to be reducing gender inequality.\u201d DfID said it would take on board some of the recommendations, including publishing a long-term plan for its partners with key milestones for achieving gender equality by 2030. It also said it would publish a progress report on its work every two years. A spokesperson said: \u201cThe NAO rightly recognises the department\u2019s work to promote girls\u2019 education, challenge child marriage, end female genital mutilation and tackle sexual violence around the world. \u201cOur evidence-based approach allows us to quickly respond to constantly changing global challenges, such as coronavirus, so we can direct our life-saving support to wherever it is needed most.\u201d",

While Trump clearly botched his response to the pandemic, he has found a successful way out of it: refocusing the debate on \u201cReopening America\u201d. By downplaying the health costs of the pandemic and emphasizing the economic costs, Trump hopes to come out of the crisis as the savior of the US economy. While the grim unemployment numbers might not seem to support this strategy, there are reasons to believe it might work.</p> <p>It is true that, compared with other democratic leaders, Trump has received a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/04/08/why-trumps-received-much-smaller-approval-bump-than-other-world-leaders-during-pandemic/\">smaller and shorter electoral bump</a> from this pandemic. He has, however, benefited from the usual rallying-around-the-flag effect. He has also benefited from the relative invisibility of the Democrats, most notably the party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee, Joe Biden, who has a hard time establishing himself in the debate as he holds no political office at the moment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/27/donald-trump-coronavirus-kim-jong-un\">Trump returns to White House briefing, subdued but no less shameful</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many anti-Trump pundits take hope from public opinion polls that show that a majority of Americans, including a plurality of Republicans, <a href=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/22/outbreak-poll-most-americans-favor-continued-lockdown/\">support the current lockdown</a> measures and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/americans-republicans-oppose-anti-coronavirus-lockdown-protests-poll-2020-4\">oppose the anti-lockdown protests</a>. But, as time passes, the US will inevitably have to \u201creopen\u201d \u2013 as even Democratic governors like <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2020/04/21/cuomo-commits-to-reopening-new-york-state-regionally-1278366\">Andrew Cuomo</a> have argued \u2013 and Trump will be able to claim, with some credibility, that he was the one to put this on the political agenda.</p> <p>Moreover, Trump has always been vague enough about the details of \u201creopening\u201d America that he can easily distance himself from possible outbreaks of new cases in the most irresponsible states.

Three weeks ago, <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/2020/04/22/coronavirus-economy-public-health-concern-gop/\">55%</a> of Republicans were more concerned about the pandemic\u2019s public health impact than the economic impact; that number has dropped to 44%.

He has consistently used the term \u201cChina virus\u201d and increasingly blames China for the whole pandemic \u2013 a strategy <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/04/25/senate-gop-talking-points-coronavirus-blame-china-not-trump/\">enthusiastically endorsed</a> by the Republican party.</p> <p>But it could get uglier. With a large number of Covid-19 cases and deaths in New York and California, the far right is working hard to characterize coronavirus as an urban, coastal disease that does not threaten so-called Heartland America.

Digital subscriptions across the Guardian\u2019s premium apps and tablet editions stand at 265,000, a 39% increase vs March 2019 (191,000). Total print subscriptions to the Guardian, the Observer and Guardian Weekly are at a record high of 111,000, a 3% increase vs March 2019 (107,000). Digital subscriptions have grown particularly quickly, driven by the October 2019 launch of the Guardian\u2019s paid Daily app as well as an increase in subscriptions to the Guardian\u2019s existing premium Live app. With record traffic to the Guardian\u2019s high-quality journalism, so far in April 2020 the Guardian has added an additional 50,000 recurring supporters, with all categories of Guardian support growing 2-3 times faster than normal. In the 12 months to 31 March 2020 the Guardian received a further 342,000 one-off contributions from readers around the world (2019: 341,000) - meaning that over the past 12 months 1.16 million people have supported the Guardian in some way, in addition to the UK readers who support by buying the Guardian and Observer regularly. A Reuters Institute study published this week found that the Guardian\u2019s coverage of the coronavirus pandemic is considered the best of all British newspapers, with twice as many people saying the Guardian is doing a \u201cgood job\u201d covering the coronavirus pandemic than any other news publisher. Despite the significant challenges presented by coronavirus The Guardian also confirms that it achieved its goal of financial sustainability for a second consecutive year in 2019/20, with its cash requirements remaining within the expected long-term annual returns of the Scott Trust Endowment Fund of \u00a325-30m. The Guardian will publish full 2019/20 financial results in July 2020, as normal.

Most chose to continue. \u201cThe movement of the deceased is in line with funeral industry standards and best practice, and has been agreed with experts who have experience in the movement of the deceased and the risks posed in the handling of those who have tragically died from Covid-19.\u201d A spokesperson for the National Association of Funeral Directors said: \u201cWhile [this role] can be done functionally by an untrained person, it would not be done with the expert understanding of infection control and care that funeral directors bring to the role.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "In March, the Treasury had a whip-round and cobbled together \u00a33.2m for British councils to spend on rough sleeping. The government promised to instantly eradicate street homelessness during the pandemic, with homeless people housed, for their safety and the safety of the general public. There was only one problem. Based on recent council data that showed 25,000 people slept rough on our streets in 2019, the \u00a33.2m works out at a measly \u00a3128 per head; more an act of contempt than compassion. Yet again the government appeared to be prioritising saving money over saving lives. And now the facts are beginning to bear that out. According to the Observer, at least six people linked to homeless hostels in London have died from coronavirus since March. While most rough sleepers have been moved into hotels, B&amp;Bs and other temporary accommodation, up to 35,000 people may still be crammed together in crowded hostels where physical distancing is simply an impossibility. The government claims to have temporarily sheltered 90% of Britain\u2019s rough sleepers but many are still slipping through the net \u2013 often highly vulnerable people, most of them with long-term mental health and dependency issues. Getting them into a hotel is the easy thing. Keeping them there, looking after them, making sure their needs are met, is another. Last month Boris Johnson also pledged to provide all necessary accommodation and support for destitute migrants with no recourse to public funds, but this promise does not seem to have been kept.

      "body": "<p>As the weeks go on, it is becoming clear coronavirus is not an equal opportunity pandemic. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/racial-inequality-in-britain-found-a-risk-factor-for-covid-19?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">Guardian analysis</a> last week found ethnic minorities in England are dying in disproportionately high numbers compared with white people. And now <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/disability/articles/coronavirusandthesocialimpactsondisabledpeopleingreatbritain/2020-04-24\">research from the Office for National Statistics</a> (ONS) shows the pandemic is having a disproportionate impact on disabled people\u2019s lives.</p> <p>More disabled adults said they were \u201cvery worried\u201d about the effects of coronavirus on their lives than non-disabled adults (45.1% compared with 30.2%). Nearly two-thirds of disabled people said coronavirus-related concerns were affecting their wellbeing, from loneliness and problems at work, to worsening mental health.</p> <p>This is all too predictable when you consider disabled people are more likely to be in low income and insecure work, isolated, and at higher risk from the virus itself (even more so if you\u2019re disabled and BAME).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The idea that poverty, isolation or even early death is somehow natural for disabled people is still worryingly prevalent</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/11/coronavirus-ill-disabled-people\">first argued</a> that coronavirus would impact disabled and marginalised people hardest, some readers responded by pointing out a virus doesn\u2019t check a victim\u2019s bank balance before striking. But understanding that structural inequality means a pandemic will hurt some more than others is crucial if we hope to slow the impact of the virus.</p> <p>Take the social security system. Universal credit has been increased by \u00a320 since the lockdown to pay for the extra costs of the pandemic, but millions of disabled people on older out-of-work benefits such as the employment and support allowance (ESA) will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/20/labour-urges-universal-credit-rethink-to-help-low-income-families-coronavirus-lockdown?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">not receive the extra financial support</a>. Charities call it \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d and it\u2019s hard to disagree. A survey by the Disability Consortium found <a href=\"https://disabilitybenefitsconsortium.wordpress.com/campaign-news/\">nine out of </a><a href=\"https://disabilitybenefitsconsortium.wordpress.com/campaign-news/\">10 disabled people</a> are struggling with additional food costs, with others unable to pay for medicine collections or their rising utility bills as they shield at home.</p> <p>These are people who, by definition of being on ESA,<strong> </strong>are some of the most severely disabled or ill people in society and yet are being forgotten.</p> <p>It\u2019s no coincidence that this follows a decade of austerity that has made disabled people poorer and more isolated. The man on crutches who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/27/disabled-people-left-off-coronavirus-vulnerable-list-tell-of-struggles?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">lost his Motability car</a> after having his disability benefits removed now has no safe way to nip to the shops for supplies during lockdown.</p> <p>Or consider access to healthcare. I recently reported concerns that disabled people would not be deemed a priority for treatment if they caught coronavirus, but getting help for existing health conditions in a pandemic can be just as difficult.</p> <p>With the NHS working tirelessly to cope with the crisis, many disabled people have had appointments postponed or cancelled. A study by the <a href=\"http://www.ridc.org.uk/news/covid-19-impact-disabled-and-older-people-uk\">Research Institute for Disabled Consumers</a> (RiDC) shows almost half of disabled people are concerned about access to medicine. Two in five are \u201cextremely concerned\u201d about making medical appointments if they have to self-isolate for more than three months.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/england-campaign-targets-seriously-ill-patients-avoiding-hospitals?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">A government campaign</a> has been launched to encourage people with acute non-Covid conditions such as heart attacks to seek help amid concerns some are avoiding hospitals, but this needs to include those with chronic illness too. Lockdown is a perfect storm for patients with long-term health conditions, where those who are at high risk of coronavirus are simultaneously more likely to be afraid of catching the virus in a hospital and more in need of seeing their doctors.</p> <p>Or consider mental health. Disabled people are more used to dealing with restrictions on their social lives than most but this doesn\u2019t make lockdown any easier. Indeed, it is considerably harder. One in 10 adults with a disability reported often or always feeling lonely in the last seven days, according to the ONS, compared with less than one in 20 non-disabled adults. Unlike the general population, many disabled people aren\u2019t able to pop out for our hour of fresh air and exercise, while others can\u2019t even access Facebook or Zoom;<strong> </strong>in<strong> </strong>a<strong> </strong><a href=\"http://gda.scot/our-community/news/2020/4/28/covid-19-supercharges-existing-inequalities-faced-by-glasgows-150-000-disabled-people\">survey</a> by Glasgow Disability Alliance <strong> </strong>only<strong> </strong>just over a third of disabled people reported having home broadband during the pandemic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/27/disabled-people-left-off-coronavirus-vulnerable-list-tell-of-struggles\">Disabled people left off coronavirus vulnerable list tell of struggles</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As talk of a prolonged lockdown is floated, there has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/older-people-could-face-extended-coronavirus-lockdown-lords-hears?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">concern in recent days</a> over how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/28/longer-lockdown-for-over-70s-could-create-sense-of-victimisation?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">older people</a> would cope with long-term isolation but noticeably near silence on younger people with disabilities stuck at home. This is partly a policy issue but it is largely about attitudes. The idea that poverty, isolation or even early death is somehow natural for disabled people is still worryingly prevalent. \u201cUnderlying health conditions\u201d increasingly feels like a euphemism for those society has quietly given up on. Just look at how we still don\u2019t know how many disabled people have died in care homes; their deaths are being written out of the stories we are using to make sense of this crisis. </p> <p>Amid great uncertainty, what is clear is that it will be a long while yet before we return to any sense of normalcy. This is especially true for marginalised groups. Over the coming weeks, shut behind closed doors in more ways than one, disabled people will be all too easy to forget. The only thing more dangerous than inequality is when that inequality is invisible.</p> <p>\u2022 Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "As the weeks go on, it is becoming clear coronavirus is not an equal opportunity pandemic. Guardian analysis last week found ethnic minorities in England are dying in disproportionately high numbers compared with white people. And now research from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows the pandemic is having a disproportionate impact on disabled people\u2019s lives. More disabled adults said they were \u201cvery worried\u201d about the effects of coronavirus on their lives than non-disabled adults (45.1% compared with 30.2%). Nearly two-thirds of disabled people said coronavirus-related concerns were affecting their wellbeing, from loneliness and problems at work, to worsening mental health. This is all too predictable when you consider disabled people are more likely to be in low income and insecure work, isolated, and at higher risk from the virus itself (even more so if you\u2019re disabled and BAME). When I first argued that coronavirus would impact disabled and marginalised people hardest, some readers responded by pointing out a virus doesn\u2019t check a victim\u2019s bank balance before striking. But understanding that structural inequality means a pandemic will hurt some more than others is crucial if we hope to slow the impact of the virus. Take the social security system. Universal credit has been increased by \u00a320 since the lockdown to pay for the extra costs of the pandemic, but millions of disabled people on older out-of-work benefits such as the employment and support allowance (ESA) will not receive the extra financial support. Charities call it \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d and it\u2019s hard to disagree. A survey by the Disability Consortium found nine out of 10 disabled people are struggling with additional food costs, with others unable to pay for medicine collections or their rising utility bills as they shield at home. These are people who, by definition of being on ESA, are some of the most severely disabled or ill people in society and yet are being forgotten. It\u2019s no coincidence that this follows a decade of austerity that has made disabled people poorer and more isolated. The man on crutches who lost his Motability car after having his disability benefits removed now has no safe way to nip to the shops for supplies during lockdown. Or consider access to healthcare. I recently reported concerns that disabled people would not be deemed a priority for treatment if they caught coronavirus, but getting help for existing health conditions in a pandemic can be just as difficult. With the NHS working tirelessly to cope with the crisis, many disabled people have had appointments postponed or cancelled. A study by the Research Institute for Disabled Consumers (RiDC) shows almost half of disabled people are concerned about access to medicine. Two in five are \u201cextremely concerned\u201d about making medical appointments if they have to self-isolate for more than three months. A government campaign has been launched to encourage people with acute non-Covid conditions such as heart attacks to seek help amid concerns some are avoiding hospitals, but this needs to include those with chronic illness too. Lockdown is a perfect storm for patients with long-term health conditions, where those who are at high risk of coronavirus are simultaneously more likely to be afraid of catching the virus in a hospital and more in need of seeing their doctors. Or consider mental health. Disabled people are more used to dealing with restrictions on their social lives than most but this doesn\u2019t make lockdown any easier. Indeed, it is considerably harder. One in 10 adults with a disability reported often or always feeling lonely in the last seven days, according to the ONS, compared with less than one in 20 non-disabled adults. Unlike the general population, many disabled people aren\u2019t able to pop out for our hour of fresh air and exercise, while others can\u2019t even access Facebook or Zoom; in a survey by Glasgow Disability Alliance only just over a third of disabled people reported having home broadband during the pandemic. As talk of a prolonged lockdown is floated, there has been concern in recent days over how older people would cope with long-term isolation but noticeably near silence on younger people with disabilities stuck at home. This is partly a policy issue but it is largely about attitudes. The idea that poverty, isolation or even early death is somehow natural for disabled people is still worryingly prevalent. \u201cUnderlying health conditions\u201d increasingly feels like a euphemism for those society has quietly given up on. Just look at how we still don\u2019t know how many disabled people have died in care homes; their deaths are being written out of the stories we are using to make sense of this crisis. Amid great uncertainty, what is clear is that it will be a long while yet before we return to any sense of normalcy. This is especially true for marginalised groups. Over the coming weeks, shut behind closed doors in more ways than one, disabled people will be all too easy to forget. The only thing more dangerous than inequality is when that inequality is invisible. \u2022 Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "The longest economic expansion in US history officially came to an end on Wednesday when the commerce department announced the economy shrank at an annual rate of 4.8% in the first three months of the year. The economic slump, the steepest since the last recession in 2008, is just an early indicator of how severely the coronavirus pandemic has affected the US economy. Much of the US economy shut down in March in an effort to contain the virus, triggering 26 million people to file for unemployment benefits and wiping out a decade of jobs gains, at the end of the first quarter. The next set of figures from the commerce department will more accurately reflect the true scale of its impact. Kevin Hassett, senior economic adviser to the White House, has predicted gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 the widest measure of the economy \u2013 could fall at an annualized rate of 30% in the next quarter. Goldman Sachs expects a 15% unemployment rate in the US by mid-year, up from 4.4% at present. The fall is the sharpest quarterly decline in GDP since the end of 2008 when the economy contracted by an annualized rate of 8.4%. But on current forecasts the drop-off could soon rival the economic collapse of the Great Depression. In 1932 the US economy shrank 13% over the year. \u201cThe US economy is in recession right now,\u201d said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know how deep.\u201d Faucher said that while this quarter\u2019s figure looks bad it is nothing to what we can expect next quarter. Most of the shutdowns happened at the tail end of the first three months of the year. PNC is expecting a contraction of about 30% which will be \u201cby far the worst quarter in history\u201d. But he expects the recovery to start soon after that, and for a strong rebound, if not as dramatic as the fall, once the virus is under control. The contraction is devastating large parts of the economy and small businesses in particular have been hit hard. Forbidden Planet, a 30-year-old comics and toys store in Union Square, New York, is one of many businesses that have started money raising online in the hope of keeping their shuttered business alive. The store closed on 16 March but business had trailed off before that as fear of the virus spread through the city. \u201cThere are still a million expenses going out. We are still paying rent,\u201d said Jeff Ayers, the general manager. Even if the store can weather the pandemic, he said, he worries about what business will look like afterwards. \u201cWe are expecting a recession if not a depression. What will that do to sales?\u201d he said. He said he also worries that limiting occupancy at the store in compliance with social distancing orders will kill a business largely built on volume and people\u2019s ability to browse. \u201cNothing is going to be the same for a very long time,\u2019\u2019 he said.",

Raab was deputising for Boris Johnson as he spent time with his fiancee, Carrie Symonds, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/29/boris-johnson-and-carrie-symonds-announce-birth-of-baby-boy\">their </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/29/boris-johnson-and-carrie-symonds-announce-birth-of-baby-boy\">son was born </a>in the early hours of Wednesday.</p> \n<p>Starmer said the government\u2019s advisers had said a figure under 20,000 would be a good outcome in March. \u201cWe are clearly way above that number and we are only part way through this crisis. We are possibly on track to have one of the worst death rates in Europe,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cOn Monday, the prime minister said in his short speech that many were looking at our apparent success in the United Kingdom. Does the first secretary agree with me that far from success, these figures are truly dreadful?\u201d</p> \n<p>On the 20,000 figure, Raab said the coronavirus pandemic was unprecedented and the scientific and medical advisers\u2019 understanding of the illness had developed since that comment was made.</p> \n<p>He also said figures on deaths were collated at different times and they were keen to deliver a clearer breakdown of deaths in NHS and care homes, which they were making progress on.</p> \n<p>\u201cI absolutely share his, I guess, our, joint horror at the number of deaths. Tragedies each and every one,\u201d said Raab.</p> \n<p>\u201cEqually I\u2019m going to disagree with him that it is far too early to make international comparisons. If they are to be done, they should be on a per capita basis. We are already seeing there are different ways that deaths are measured not just in the UK, but across Europe and across the world.\u201d</p> \n<p>On Johnson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/27/boris-johnsons-post-coronavirus-speech-what-he-said-what-it-means\">reference, on Monday,</a> that there is a second phase of coronavirus response planning, Raab said it was too early to spell out exact plans.</p> \n<p>Raab was also accused of incorrectly saying deaths in care homes were on the decline in a recent statement.</p> \n<p>The latest figures released by the Care Quality Commission were 4,343 deaths for the two-week period up to Friday 24 April.</p> \n<p>Starmer put it to Raab that deaths in care homes were in fact rising as they fell in the NHS.</p> \n<p>In his response, Raab said there were positive signs on the numbers of deaths in care homes but they are \u201cwithin the margin of error\u201d.</p> \n<p>The principal challenge in care homes, unlike in NHS settings, was the ebb and flow of residents and staff and a less centralised structure, he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, criticised the government over the UK\u2019s \u201ctruly dreadful\u201d Covid-19 death rate at prime minister\u2019s questions, saying the country was on course to have one of the worst records in Europe. Starmer, who was facing Dominic Raab at the despatch box on Wednesday for the second week in a row, said the UK had 27,241 recorded deaths when known hospital and care home figures were combined. The first secretary hit back and said it was far too early to make international comparisons. Raab was deputising for Boris Johnson as he spent time with his fiancee, Carrie Symonds, after their son was born in the early hours of Wednesday. Starmer said the government\u2019s advisers had said a figure under 20,000 would be a good outcome in March. \u201cWe are clearly way above that number and we are only part way through this crisis. We are possibly on track to have one of the worst death rates in Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cOn Monday, the prime minister said in his short speech that many were looking at our apparent success in the United Kingdom. Does the first secretary agree with me that far from success, these figures are truly dreadful?\u201d On the 20,000 figure, Raab said the coronavirus pandemic was unprecedented and the scientific and medical advisers\u2019 understanding of the illness had developed since that comment was made. He also said figures on deaths were collated at different times and they were keen to deliver a clearer breakdown of deaths in NHS and care homes, which they were making progress on. \u201cI absolutely share his, I guess, our, joint horror at the number of deaths. Tragedies each and every one,\u201d said Raab. \u201cEqually I\u2019m going to disagree with him that it is far too early to make international comparisons. If they are to be done, they should be on a per capita basis. We are already seeing there are different ways that deaths are measured not just in the UK, but across Europe and across the world.\u201d On Johnson\u2019s reference, on Monday, that there is a second phase of coronavirus response planning, Raab said it was too early to spell out exact plans. Raab was also accused of incorrectly saying deaths in care homes were on the decline in a recent statement. The latest figures released by the Care Quality Commission were 4,343 deaths for the two-week period up to Friday 24 April. Starmer put it to Raab that deaths in care homes were in fact rising as they fell in the NHS. In his response, Raab said there were positive signs on the numbers of deaths in care homes but they are \u201cwithin the margin of error\u201d. The principal challenge in care homes, unlike in NHS settings, was the ebb and flow of residents and staff and a less centralised structure, he said.",

      "bodyText": "May Day demonstrations planned for German cities on Friday pose a dilemma for police as officers face conflicting advice on whether they should ask protesters to put on face masks or pull them off. Wearing masks in shops and on public transport was made mandatory in most German states this week, as the country relaxed some of the lockdown measures introduced to curb the spread of Covid-19. German law makes it illegal to cover your face while participating in a public gathering, such as a strike or a political demonstration, so as to prevent identification by the police. In Berlin, a paragraph was hastily added to right-of-assembly regulations this month to clarify that anti-mask laws should not prevent the wearing of mouth and nose coverings aimed at reducing the spread of coronavirus. However, a spokesperson for Berlin police told the Guardian that officers would have to use their personal judgment regarding which kinds of masks were and were not unacceptable. Police spokesperson Thilo Cablitz said: \u201cIf you cover your mouth and nose with a surgical mask or a scarf that would be fine, but if protesters also wear hoodies, baseball caps or sunglasses we would have to consider the intention behind those items and might request their removal.\u201d About 5,000 officers policing the protest would be equipped with high-protection face masks, gloves and disinfectant spray, he added. Leftwing activists in Germany announced earlier this week they would go ahead with a non-conventional take on traditional May Day protests in spite of an ongoing ban on public gatherings of more than two people, which is not due to be relaxed until next week. In a plan for Friday\u2019s demonstration put out via radical left websites, activists said they wanted to \u201cflood the streets with anti-racist, anti-patriarchal and anti-capitalist content\u201d through a decentralised march that would temporarily convene at locations in Berlin\u2019s Kreuzberg district, announced via social media. The callout said: \u201cStick to the minimum distance and cover up your faces with scarves and masks, and keep moving.\u201d The radical left network Interventionist Left advised protesters to wear \u201cunsuspicious jogging clothes\u201d and join queues outside corner stores holding placards or banners \u201ccut to the relevant size to mark safety distances\u201d. The first day of May, which marks the achievements of labour movements in several countries across the globe, has in Berlin been the scene of regular clashes between far-left and anarchist protesters and police since the 1980s. While the number of violent incidents have broadly decreased over the last 10 years, last year\u2019s May Day demonstrations in Berlin nonetheless resulted in 50 arrests and 39 injured police officers. Earlier this month, Germany\u2019s constitutional court ruled that citizens have the right to hold political protests even while the country\u2019s \u201ccontact ban\u201d is in place, as long as they adhere to distancing rules. In Berlin, political protests with a maximum number of 20 people are allowed to go ahead as long as they have been registered with authorities and given the green light by the local health authority. Last Thursday, for example, 17 people gathered outside the Brandenburg to protest against Germany\u2019s asylum policy and conditions at Greece\u2019s Moria refugee camp, with each protester having marked their physically distanced spot on the square with spray paint. Thirty separate protests have registered for Friday, with their applications currently being assessed by the health authorities. Berlin\u2019s senator for the interior, Andreas Geisel, said on Monday: \u201cWhen it comes to the first of May, protecting the public from infections will be a priority.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want the gatherings on 1 May to become Berlin\u2019s Ischgl\u201d, the Social Democrat party politician added, referencing the Austrian skiing resort seen as a focal point for the spread of coronavirus around central Europe.",

Today he is the third prime minister of the 21st century to be celebrating the birth of a new baby in No 10. It would require a heart of stone \u2013 and doubtless there are some of those where Johnson is concerned \u2013 not to be moved by this vertiginous private ascent from darkness into light. As a metaphor for the optimistic way the prime minister would like a troubled country to see the coronavirus crisis, it is beyond audacious. You could not make it up.</p> <p>Let\u2019s acknowledge, if nothing else, that today\u2019s announcement was a brilliantly executed piece of political tradecraft. The operation in Downing Street is still a lot smarter than many would like to think when they see it preside over those wooden and evasive daily briefings. That\u2019s because, over the 24 hours preceding the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/29/boris-johnson-and-carrie-symonds-announce-birth-of-baby-boy\">announcement</a> that Carrie Symonds and Johnson had had a baby son, No 10 played the media brilliantly.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Downing Street was studiously evasive about whether Johnson, who had only returned from his Covid-19 recuperation the previous day, would be taking his first prime minister\u2019s questions in the virtual Commons <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/21/parliament-returns-covid-19-constructive-politics\">reassembled last week</a>. The evasiveness triggered speculation that Johnson\u2019s health might in fact not be up to the task. No 10\u2019s silence this morning fed the speculation still further. How many journalists began to question Johnson\u2019s and the government\u2019s continuing fragility? Then came the news of the birth. <em>Chapeau!</em></p> <p>Any birth beneath the shadow of death is bound to touch the emotions with special poignancy. Think how struck so many of us have been by the sights, sounds and feel of the seasonal rebirth of nature during the Covid-19 crisis. Note also that, in Downing Street briefings this week, the questions from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/public-to-submit-questions-for-uk-covid-19-coronavirus-press-conference\">the public</a> have expressed the longing of grandparents to see grandchildren again.

The birth of a baby is the same.</p> <p>The birth of a child to the country\u2019s leader is also, inescapably, a moment that brings the much wider population together too. Johnson\u2019s death, had it occurred, would have transcended the many raw political and other judgments about him as an individual. Similarly, the birth of his and his partner\u2019s son now also vaults across much of the bitterness that many will always feel about his political career \u2013 a bitterness that, it is crucial to understand, large parts of the population do not feel towards Johnson in any way.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"459f9a8cf1aa984abdaf0d0a950858f1a08b2249\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/459f9a8cf1aa984abdaf0d0a950858f1a08b2249/0_0_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Blair family with baby Leo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Blair family with baby Leo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Yet there is still something inescapably different about this particular prime ministerial birth.

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> vote of 2016 might very well not have happened without him. He consistently breaks rules in all sorts of ways.

      "body": "<p>In common with the many thousands of people whose lives have suddenly been devastated by Covid-19, Ken Sazuze cannot know exactly when the coronavirus landed on his family and wreaked its terrible damage. His wife, Elsie, was 44, a much-loved nurse, mother to their children, Anna, 16, and Andrew, 22; she was his soulmate and best friend, a \u201cgenuine person,\u201d he says. Elsie died on 8 April, on a ventilator, in Birmingham\u2019s Good Hope hospital.</p> \n<p>Ken believes she became infected sometime in that eerie, frightening week after Monday 16 March, when Boris Johnson\u2019s government reconsidered its previous light-touch approach, which had envisaged 60% of the population \u2013 40 million people \u2013 would become infected, and while many would die, the majority would recover and attain \u201cherd immunity\u201d. That week, although more physical distancing had been advised by Johnson, normal life mostly continued until the compulsory lockdown; pubs, restaurants and gyms stayed open, as did schools, until Friday 20 March. Sazuze, who served 10 years in the British army before studying to be a nurse himself, says he \u201cnever liked that herd immunity idea\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8bfbec52fe2b60312f5f87f832ea1848727717a3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8bfbec52fe2b60312f5f87f832ea1848727717a3/28_225_800_480/500.jpg\" alt=\"Elsie Sazuze\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elsie Sazuze.

I strongly believe that if the government had acted more quickly we wouldn\u2019t have lost so many lives, and my wife could be here today.\u201d</p> \n<p>The health secretary, Matt Hancock, supported by Downing Street, has persistently denied that attaining herd immunity, by allowing the disease to infect most people, was ever a policy, goal, strategy or even \u201cpart of the plan\u201d. Well-placed government sources said on the strictest reading of the word \u201cpolicy\u201d that may be true. But they do not understand how the government can claim that herd immunity was not part of its plan.</p> \n<p>The Guardian\u2019s account of the government\u2019s response to the crisis is based on interviews with sources in or close to Downing Street, the Department of Health and Social Care, the Cabinet Office, Cobra and Sage, as well as other advisers and experts. Many asked not to be named, because they were not authorised to speak publicly. Some said that while they had concerns, they were holding back some of their criticism because they did not want to damage public trust in government at such a delicate time. All are wary of being wise in hindsight, and sympathetic to ministers who took decisions they felt were right at the time.</p> \n<p>But with Covid-19 having spread virulently, particularly during those first three weeks of March, more than 21,000 people have now died in hospitals alone and Britain is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/coronavirus-deaths-in-uk-hospitals-surpass-10000\">predicted to be possibly the worst affected country in Europe</a>. There are profound questions to be answered, about why Johnson\u2019s government stood alone among the countries of the world, pursuing that herd immunity approach, and why, when they realised stricter measures were needed, the lockdown was still delayed.</p> \n<p>Prof Neil Ferguson, the lead scientist on the Covid-19 response team at Imperial College London, whose <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf\">advice paper of 16 March</a> is credited with convincing the government to change course, responded extensively to questions from the Guardian for this article. He emphasised that one alarming estimate in that paper was not new: that under the \u201cmitigation scenario\u201d, which apparently envisaged herd immunity as one outcome, and included measures then being considered by the government, 250,000 people would die.</p> \n<h2><strong>Brexit</strong></h2> \n<p>Viewed from today\u2019s unimaginably changed perspective, this year\u2019s pre-crisis months can seem like a parallel world. Johnson\u2019s media backers were feting him then for winning the \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d election, and his private life, since criticised by some as a distraction, was portrayed as a cause for national rejoicing when on 29 February he and Carrie Symonds announced their engagement.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"chapter-1\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Johnson <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-address-to-the-nation-31-january-2020\">took Britain out of the European Union</a> on 31 January, portraying the moment as an opportunity to \u201cunleash the full potential of this brilliant country and to make better the lives of everyone in every corner of our United Kingdom.\u201d A day earlier, an emergency committee of the World Health Organization declared that Covid-19, which had broken out in China and spread to 18 countries, <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/30-01-2020-statement-on-the-second-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)\">was a </a><a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/30-01-2020-statement-on-the-second-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)\">public </a><a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/30-01-2020-statement-on-the-second-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)\">health </a><a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/30-01-2020-statement-on-the-second-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)\">emergency of </a><a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/30-01-2020-statement-on-the-second-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)\">international </a><a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/30-01-2020-statement-on-the-second-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)\">concern</a> (PHEIC). The WHO stated then, as it has emphasised throughout, that this highest state of alert required an immediate response. In the absence of a vaccine, the WHO insisted that the virus should be addressed like the operation mounted in South Korea, with extensive testing, tracing people with whom a person testing positive has had close contact, and isolating all of them, \u201cto interrupt virus spread\u201d.</p> \n<p>David Nabarro, the WHO Covid-19 envoy, told the Guardian that he and the director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, knew then that the coronavirus was going to become \u201chuge\u201d and would be \u201creally difficult\u201d for governments.</p> \n<p>\u201cCoronaviruses are horrible,\u201d Nabarro said. \u201cThey\u2019re rather stable and incredibly well designed to wreak havoc among populations because they are very, very easy to transmit and quite tough to contain. You can\u2019t just let this thing go, and let it wash over your society, because it will kill lots of old people, and a few younger people, it will make hospitals into a big mess, and it will endanger health workers.\u201d</p> \n<p>On 3 February, Johnson made <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-speech-in-greenwich-3-february-2020\">another triumphal Brexit speech</a>, in which he even sounded a note against responding too strongly to Covid-19, arguing it ran counter to his vision of Britain as a \u201csupercharged champion\u201d of global free trade.</p> \n<p>He was labelled a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/28/boris-johnson-not-to-hold-coronavirus-crisis-meeting-cobra-until-monday\">\u201cpart-time prime minister\u201d</a> by the Labour opposition on 28 February, after he spent 12 days away at the Chevening country residence in Kent, and did not attend four of the first five meetings of the Cobra committee, convened to consider Britain\u2019s response to Covid-19, until one on Monday 2 March. He did go to a meeting in late February, attended by senior officials, but only very briefly, without making a substantial contribution, which one attendee says seemed strange. Asked about this, a Downing Street spokesperson clarified that Johnson went to be updated on coronavirus, and left after that.</p> \n<p>The government\u2019s decision-making on Covid-19 has since become a focus of fierce scrutiny and much criticism, partly for its lack of transparency. Cobra, the forum for considering emergencies, attended by ministers and their officials, meets in secret. It takes scientific advice from Sage, whose membership was not made public <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/coronavirus-whos-who-on-secret-scientific-group-advising-uk-government-sage\">until the Guardian revealed the names of participants</a>. They included Johnson\u2019s chief of staff, Dominic Cummings, and another Downing Street adviser, Ben Warner, a data scientist who worked on the Vote Leave Brexit campaign, and is said by one Sage attendee to have \u201cbehaved as Cummings\u2019 deputy\u201d.</p> \n<p>Supposed to be impartial and free from political influence, Sage responds to questions passed down from Cobra. Its own makeup has been criticised by some as too narrow, overly reliant on epidemiologists who specialise in mathematical modelling. One participant told the Guardian that Sage lacked diversity and was \u201cway too slow\u201d to consider how other countries, including those in south Asia, were managing to contain the spread of the virus. A spokesperson for Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, rejected those criticisms, saying the scientists are engaged with experts in other countries and \u201ccontainment strategies form part of those discussions\u201d.</p> \n<p>Sage receives advice from three expert groups: Nervtag, which examines the science of the virus itself; SPI-M, which models how it spreads; and SPI-B, which involves behavioural scientists in considering how people may respond to restrictive measures.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/archive-zip/giv-3902rB07aqC7wGcf/\" data-alt=\"graphic\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/archive-zip/giv-3902rB07aqC7wGcf/\">graphic</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Following initial criticism, the government has published some details, making public the Nervtag membership and minutes of meetings, and some limited papers from SPI-M and SPI-B. Yet even these few documents do establish that Covid-19\u2019s catastrophic threat to life was communicated clearly to ministers by the scientific advisers.</p> \n<p>On 2 March, a brief \u201cconsensus statement\u201d from SPI-M reported very stark assessments to Sage. \u201cIt is highly likely that there is sustained transmission of Covid-19 in the UK at present,\u201d it said. The coronavirus was noted to be highly contagious, with each infected person infecting two to three more. If \u201cstringent measures\u201d were not imposed, \u201cit would correspond to around 80% of the population [53 million people] becoming infected\u201d. SPI-M\u2019s best estimate of the death rate was 0.5% to 1%: between 250,000 and 500,000 people. Of those requiring hospital treatment, 12% were likely to die. If, like Elsie Sazuze, they needed to be put on a ventilator, they had only a 50% chance of survival.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"chapter-2\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Yet somehow, the genuine peril and need to act fast was not seized on by the government. The first phase of a plan to contain the virus with testing and tracing was ended on 12 March, and the policy moved to try to delay the peak of the infection. Later, the plan was for \u201cmitigation\u201d, for a series of measures to be gradually brought in: \u201ccase isolation\u201d of seven days for somebody who felt they had symptoms, then \u201chousehold isolation\u201d for everybody living with them to quarantine themselves for 14 days, then at some point, to shield elderly and vulnerable people.</p> \n<p>The day after the 2 March Cobra meeting and SPI-M statement, Johnson held the first televised press conference with Vallance and Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer. Whitty did say solemnly that a worst-case scenario estimated 80% of people could become infected, and 1% of those could die, but the message best remembered is Johnson joshingly telling the nation: \u201cI was at a hospital the other night where I think there were actually a few coronavirus patients and I shook hands with everybody.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fd75780859586d069ccd9d3e98a86ffa764bccdc\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd75780859586d069ccd9d3e98a86ffa764bccdc/0_434_6517_3911/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson flanked by Chris Whitty, left, and Patrick Vallance, during a news conference 3 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson flanked by Chris Whitty, left, and Patrick Vallance, during a news conference on 3 March.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Dawson/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Johnson\u2019s advice was: \u201cWe should all basically just go about our normal daily lives.\u201d He also advised: \u201cThe best thing you can do is to wash your hands with soap and hot water while singing Happy Birthday twice.\u201d</p> \n<p>Over the next fortnight, as Italy moved to impose a lockdown, France and Spain began to do the same, and Germany embarked on physical distancing measures coupled with Europe\u2019s most extensive testing and contact tracing operation, Britain did comparatively little. Hand-washing was still the main advice, along with case isolation of people feeling symptoms.</p> \n<p>The first official report of somebody dying in hospital having tested positive for Covid-19 caught in the UK came on 5 March. Still, elderly and vulnerable people were not given any advice to shield themselves. A member of one Sage advisory committee said that around this time there was a gap between the scientific advice and political messaging. \u201cThe prime minister was going around shaking people\u2019s hands to demonstrate that there wasn\u2019t a problem. There was a disconnect at that point. We were all slightly incredulous that that was happening.\u201d</p> \n<p>Some experts believe Britain\u2019s exceptional response arose in part because government preparations for a pandemic were so weighted to a flu outbreak. Prof Graham Medley, a Sage member and the chair of SPI-M \u2013 which stands for scientific pandemic influenza \u2013 modelling \u2013 explains. \u201cEverything \u2013 government preparedness, the modelling \u2013 was based on pandemic influenza. And that\u2019s not because of lack of awareness on our part, that\u2019s because that got the government attention and the funding. We could persuade them that flu was important.\u201d The group\u2019s terms of reference were eventually broadened to include different kinds of pandemic but the emphasis lingered.</p> \n<p>Scientists are used to seeing flu spread through populations very fast, then become milder as it mutates, and to seeing people indeed develop immunity and populations become resistant. Covid-19 is lethally different, new, its properties more uncertain, and the idea of addressing it by allowing it to move through the population and attain herd immunity was widely condemned for risking far too many lives.</p> \n<h2><strong>Herd immunity</strong></h2> \n<p>Given the repeated denials, it can be overlooked that the reason the world believes that attaining herd immunity was the government\u2019s approach is largely because Vallance said it was. On Friday 13 March, when the virus was spreading exponentially, he set out publicly to explain the government\u2019s strategy.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"chapter-3\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cOur aim is to try and reduce the peak, broaden the peak, not suppress it completely,\u201d Vallance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-science-chief-defends-uk-measures-criticism-herd-immunity\">explained on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme</a>: \u201cAlso, because the vast majority of people get a mild illness, to build up some kind of herd immunity, so more people are immune to this disease, and we reduce the transmission. At the same time, we protect those who are most vulnerable to it. Those are the key things we need to do.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked on Sky News what proportion of the population would need to become infected to achieve herd immunity, Vallance replied: \u201cProbably about 60% or so.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ac61c94c4cb5321daef12f99ac894d0ee70d048\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ac61c94c4cb5321daef12f99ac894d0ee70d048/0_211_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crowds in the stands during day four of the Cheltenham Festival.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crowds in the stands during day four of the Cheltenham Festival.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Few mitigation measures were yet put in place. The week is remembered for the mega-events that went ahead: the Cheltenham Festival of horseracing, the Liverpool v Atletico Madrid Champions League tie, the Stereophonics concert in Cardiff. In allowing them, the government was indeed, as it consistently said, following the UK science that, surprisingly to many, considers that \u201cmass gatherings\u201d do not have a major impact on virus transmission. The numbers of people infected will almost certainly never be known, but the pictures of packed stands, particularly at Cheltenham, have become emblems of the government\u2019s delay and inaction.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-early-coronavirus-events\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-early-coronavirus-events&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-early-coronavirus-events</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>On 11 March, the WHO formally declared Covid-19 a pandemic. Tedros, the director general, maintained that the virus spread could still be confronted, and criticised \u201calarming levels of inaction\u201d by some countries.</p> \n<p>That same day, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/herd-immunity-will-the-uks-coronavirus-strategy-work\">a further explanation of the government\u2019s strategy</a> was given by Dr David Halpern, a psychologist who heads the Behavioural Insights Team, a company part-owned by the Cabinet Office, which it advises. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a point, assuming the epidemic flows and grows, as we think it probably will do, where you\u2019ll want to cocoon, you\u2019ll want to protect those at-risk groups so that they basically don\u2019t catch the disease, and by the time they come out of their cocooning, herd immunity\u2019s been achieved in the rest of the population.\u201d</p> \n<p>At a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/uk-moves-to-delay-phase-of-coronavirus-plan\">press conference the following day</a>, Johnson famously said: \u201cI must level with the British public: many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time.\u201d</p> \n<p>Whitty announced then that the initial effort to contain the disease by testing and tracing had been abandoned, yet despite that, and Johnson\u2019s dire warning, the measures discussed for the new \u201cdelay\u201d phase were almost negligible. People over 70 were advised not to go on cruises. Johnson said even \u201chousehold quarantine\u201d would not be required until sometime \u201cin the next few weeks\u201d. The government\u2019s <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/869827/Coronavirus_action_plan_-_a_guide_to_what_you_can_expect_across_the_UK.pdf\">published plan</a> did say that social distancing and school closures could be considered.</p> \n<p>That evening, the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt spoke on the BBC, saying he was concerned Britain had become an \u201coutlier\u201d. Hunt says now he became worried that Whitty was too resigned to the virus spreading: \u201cI couldn\u2019t understand why they were so certain that nothing could be done to stop nearly 60% of our population becoming infected, when I had figures showing that even in Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak in China, less than 1% of the population actually became infected.\u201d</p> \n<p>Vallance made his media appearances the following day, explaining the herd immunity approach. He was asked on Sky News why in the UK \u201csociety was continuing as normal\u201d, and it was put to him that a 60% infection rate would mean \u201can awful lot of people dying\u201d. Vallance replied that it was difficult to estimate the number of deaths, but said: \u201cWell of course we do face the prospect, as the prime minister said yesterday, of an increasing number of people dying.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"49816b747a8b3331eb855f242f53b8cb6e0afc20\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49816b747a8b3331eb855f242f53b8cb6e0afc20/0_115_2127_1276/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Hancock, the health secretary, arrives for a meeting at Downing Street.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matt Hancock, the health secretary, arrives for a meeting at Downing Street.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vedat Xhymshiti/News Pictures/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Matt Hancock, the health secretary, issued the first denial that herd immunity was part of the government\u2019s plan, despite Halpern and Vallance having days earlier indicated that it was, in a column in the Sunday Telegraph on 15 March. \u201cWe have a plan, based on the expertise of world-leading scientists,\u201d Hancock wrote. \u201cHerd immunity is not a part of it. That is a scientific concept, not a goal or a strategy.\u201d</p> \n<p>By then, a dizzying number of experts were sounding the alarm. An <a href=\"http://maths.qmul.ac.uk/~vnicosia/UK_scientists_statement_on_coronavirus_measures.pdf\">open letter</a> issued on 14 March dismissing herd immunity as \u201cnot a viable option\u201d and calling for stricter social distancing measures so that \u201cthousands of lives can be spared\u201d was signed by more than 500 UK scientists.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, the evidence that appears to have prompted the change of course was contained in the Imperial College paper, published on 16 March.</p> \n<h2><strong>A political decision</strong></h2> \n<p>Ferguson\u2019s paper has been greatly reported on but somewhat misunderstood. It did suddenly warn that the NHS would be overwhelmed \u201ceight-fold\u201d, resulting in \u201chundreds of thousands of deaths\u201d if the government did not change its strategy from mitigation to \u201csuppression\u201d. But the reason was comparatively technical: experience in Italy and of the first UK cases had shown that double the number of intensive care beds was required than previously estimated. The paper sets out the measures that would apparently comprise a mitigation policy, which the government was then planning: \u201cCase isolation, household quarantine and social distancing of those at higher risk of severe outcomes (older individuals and those with other underlying health conditions) are the most effective policy combination for epidemic mitigation.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f19e9999c03fdf7122b1f2a0208fb53279f9175\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f19e9999c03fdf7122b1f2a0208fb53279f9175/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Neil Ferguson, professor at Imperial College London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neil Ferguson, professor at Imperial College London.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Angus/Imperial College London</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Ferguson made it clear to the Guardian that the estimate in that paper of 250,000 deaths was not new and was based on \u201cthe mitigation scenario\u201d. The paper indicated that, in effect, the virus had to be allowed to spread initially, so that over time people would become infected, recover, and attain immunity: \u201cIntroducing such interventions too early risks allowing transmission [of the virus] to return once they are lifted (if insufficient herd immunity has developed).\u201d</p> \n<p>Ferguson held a press conference on 16 March to explain the new findings. His colleague, Prof Azra Ghani, said: \u201cUnder strategies we were pursuing, we were expecting a degree of herd immunity to build up. If we now realise it\u2019s not possible to cope with that in the current health system, and it may not be acceptable in terms of the numbers, then we need to try and reduce transmission.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Guardian asked Ferguson how that policy could be contemplated, if it predicted that 250,000 people would die. He emphasised that he was never sanguine about people dying, and made it very clear that it was the politicians, not the scientists, who decided on policies to pursue. \u201cWhile policy can be guided by scientific advice, that does not mean scientific advisers determine policy,\u201d he said. \u201cThough I do try to make it clear to policymakers what the potential consequences of different policies might be, to the extent the science allows.\u201d</p> \n<p>Prof Graham Medley, another Sage member, and chair of its influential modelling subcommittee, agreed that while the scientists gave their analysis on the epidemic to inform the politicians, deciding what to do was \u201ca political decision\u201d. Medley told the Guardian that Johnson, Hancock and other ministers continually saying they have been guided by the scientists has \u201csometimes gone a bit past the mark\u201d. Asked if he meant that the politicians were passing the buck, Medley replied: \u201cYes.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>\u2018Drastic action\u2019 needed</strong></h2> \n<p>Even after the stark warning that the NHS would be overwhelmed if the policy did not change, Johnson and his government still hesitated. He made another speech that day in which he advised \u201cdrastic action\u201d was now needed, but the measures were advisory and still tentative. People over 70, pregnant women, and those with some health conditions were advised only to \u201cavoid all unnecessary social contact\u201d. Britons were asked \u201cwhere they possibly can\u201d to work from home, and Johnson told them \u201cyou should avoid pubs, clubs, theatres and other such social venues\u201d, although all were permitted to stay open.</p> \n<p>The delay to introducing stricter measures, until the lockdown was finally ordered on 23 March, appears to have been at least partly based on a flawed misreading of the government\u2019s own scientific advice. In early March, Whitty mentioned the idea that the government should wait to impose restrictions because people might tire of them, later saying this was based on both \u201ccommon sense\u201d and \u201cbehavioural science\u201d. \u201cWhat we are moving now to is a phase when we will be having to ask members of the general public to do different things than they would normally do,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a risk if we go too early people will understandably get fatigued and it will be difficult to sustain this over time.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hancock supported that, suggesting it was the result of official advice. \u201cThe evidence of past epidemics and past crises of this nature shows that people do tire of these sorts of social distancing measures, so if we start them too early, they lose their effect and actually it is worse,\u201d he said. \u201cThe social science and the behavioural science are a very important part of the scientific advice that we rely on.\u201d</p> \n<p>Yet this concept of \u201cfatigue\u201d was rejected by the behavioural scientists appointed by the government itself to Sage\u2019s subcommittee, SPI\u2013B. \u201cThe word was never used in any of our committee reports,\u201d said Susan Michie, a SPI-B member. \u201cIt is just not a concept that exists in behavioural science, and it was unhelpful for it to be used.\u201d Four other members of SPI-B also told the Guardian that the committee never advised that people would tire of restrictive measures.</p> \n<p>The publicly available summaries of their conclusions show the group advised that people should be given clear explanations and reasons for social distancing measures, and warn that those measures would affect people unequally, but nowhere do they suggest that people will become \u201cfatigued\u201d. Three behavioural scientists on SPI-B, Stephen Reicher, John Drury and Clifford Stott, even wrote an article for <a href=\"https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/two-psychologies-and-coronavirus\">the Psychologist journal</a>, rejecting the notion of \u201cfatigue\u201d and suggesting that delaying stricter social distancing measures on that premise was taking a risk with lives. \u201cPsychological considerations were put at odds with what medical science demanded,\u201d they wrote.</p> \n<p>The Guardian understands that Halpern\u2019s Behavioural Insights Team, or \u201cnudge unit\u201d, was also opposed to this view that people would tire of restrictive measures. One senior Whitehall source said Whitty himself was the main advocate of the \u201cfatigue\u201d notion, based partly on his own experience of patients in medical practice who do not see drug prescriptions through to their completion.</p> \n<p>A Downing Street spokesperson, responding on behalf of Whitty, emphasised that he was indeed concerned about timing interventions, and their impact on people\u2019s wellbeing if introduced too early, and that Sage had agreed a balance needed to be struck between the impact of measures, and the time the public could feasibly sustain them.</p> \n<p>During the week after 16 March, there was a fierce debate within government about whether a stricter lockdown needed to be imposed. \u201cSeveral of us thought measures needed to be introduced earlier,\u201d one source close to the Cabinet Office said. Hancock appears to have been under great pressure, stretched between that view and resistance elsewhere to taking genuinely drastic action. A senior source at the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) recalled discussions about the herd immunity policy continuing, despite Hancock having disowned it, and a senior official still advocating it. \u201cHis basic view was that we were all going to develop antibodies, and ultimately the question was how to manage the release of the disease into the population over time.\u201d</p> \n<p>The health secretary is said by another well-placed source to have argued forcefully for a lockdown in one Cobra meeting, chaired by Michael Gove, with a junior treasury minister who was resisting due to its huge economic impact and worries that a lockdown would itself kill many people. The source said Hancock kept referring to the modelling that predicted deaths would surge dramatically without a lockdown.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b533fe0d3483449e7a91d766872021d58755ce4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b533fe0d3483449e7a91d766872021d58755ce4/0_0_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dominic Cummings, the chief adviser to Boris Johnson, listens during a press conference at Downing Street.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dominic Cummings, the chief adviser to Boris Johnson, listens during a press conference at Downing Street.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Dunham/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The DHSC source sums up this period soberly: \u201cThey knew we would have to go into lockdown; they were debating when. Every single day they wasted, every day we weren\u2019t in lockdown, was resulting in people contracting the disease \u2013 people who have since died.\u201d</p> \n<p>One source on Sage said there was also nervousness among their group that week, a feeling that the virus was getting out of control and they were not sure the politicians understood its exponential spread. The advice was being communicated, the source said, but they were told that Whitty and Vallance were having to cajole the politicians in the right direction, and there was \u201cfriction\u201d.</p> \n<p>Reflecting on the presence at Sage of Cummings and Warner, some attendees now say the group\u2019s deliberations were affected by a sense of what could feasibly be done, with a government run by politicians to whom a lockdown looked unthinkable, although others say they were not. Then, that week, when stricter measures were needed, some say it was useful to have Cummings there, because they knew he would communicate that directly to Johnson.</p> \n<p>One source in Downing Street who personally urged the prime minister to stop delaying and move into lockdown that week said his reticence was partly down to his \u201clibertarian instinct\u201d. \u201cThere was also a bit of \u2018rabbit caught in headlights\u2019.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Incubation</strong></h2> \n<p>Ken Sazuze remembers that week very well. He and Elsie, who grew up together in Malawi before he came to Britain and joined the army, were worried, he recalls, particularly about Elsie working without personal protective equipment suitable for Covid-19, and about the coronavirus spreading in Birmingham. She had moved last year from working in NHS hospitals to caring for people in nursing homes, so she could have more regular shifts and help Anna with her GCSEs. That week, Anna\u2019s school was open, Andrew was travelling on public transport to Wolverhampton University, where he is in the third year of a finance degree. Ken was on a placement during the final year of his nursing degree, while Elsie was working.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was still life as normal,\u201d he says. \u201cEverywhere was open. People weren\u2019t social distancing; they didn\u2019t know what to do. We went to the gym, to the shops, to uni, to the library.\u201d On Wednesday 18 March, they went into Birmingham, to the Bullring, shopping for presents for Anna, whose 16th birthday was 10 days away. They went to Marks &amp; Spencer looking for perfume, he remembers, and to an Apple store, where they bought her some AirPods.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t know we were infecting ourselves,\u201d Ken says. \u201cI am really annoyed when I start thinking about it too much. I am furious with the government, with people making decisions, that the virus was spreading at that time.\u201d</p> \n<p>Given the incubation period of Covid-19, Boris Johnson may have contracted the virus that week too. The nation was given the highest profile demonstration of Covid-19\u2019s destructive force, as the prime minister went into hospital days later, then into intensive care. While there was great sympathy for Johnson undergoing that personal ordeal, some experts have argued that the spectacle of Johnson, Cummings, Hancock, Whitty and other advisers contracting the virus indicated that the government was not taking social distancing seriously enough. One source in Downing Street the week before the lockdown said they were surprised to find staff at No 10 still shaking hands with visitors.</p> \n<p>A Downing Street spokesperson made clear they do not accept that Johnson should have been more careful, saying that No 10 did enforce social distancing where practical.</p> \n<h2><strong>Lockdown</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"chapter-3\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>On 23 March, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/boris-johnson-orders-uk-lockdown-to-be-enforced-by-police\">lockdown was finally imposed</a>, Johnson clasping his hands during his televised address to the nation, telling people they must stay at home, to save lives and protect the NHS, and go out only for exercise and to shop for essentials.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c0a1eab18566d58074eefc22ca0781e254b7e73\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c0a1eab18566d58074eefc22ca0781e254b7e73/0_350_5437_3262/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson addresses the nation on 23 March, announcing the UK would be placed in lockdown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson addresses the nation on 23 March, announcing the UK would be placed in lockdown.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Parsons/10 Downing Street</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>That week, apart from work, Sazuze says he and Elsie only went to Asda and Costco. But on Wednesday 25 March, Elsie began to feel unwell. The unthinkable happened very quickly. Three days later, at 2am, she was struggling with her breathing and had a very high temperature, so they called an ambulance which took her to hospital. By 2 April, Ken had a call with her, on FaceTime, before she was put on a ventilator.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat was my last goodbye with my wife,\u201d he says. \u201cWe knew it was 50-50 if she went on the ventilator. She said: \u2018Ken, I\u2019ve prayed, I\u2019ve talked to the doctor, I\u2019m happy to do this. I love you, and if anything happens, you look after the children.\u2019 I told her: \u201cHoney, come on, let\u2019s think positive; let\u2019s not think you\u2019re not going to pull through.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"714064e2c147c41f5cffff3703886e87a5b8decb\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/714064e2c147c41f5cffff3703886e87a5b8decb/0_14_1125_675/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elsie Sazuze and her family.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elsie Sazuze with her husband, Ken, and their daughter, Anna, 16, and son, Andrew, 22.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Family</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>They were called on 8 April at 1am and told to rush to the hospital.

A spokesperson replied in a statement:</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is an unprecedented global pandemic and we have taken the right steps at the right time to combat it, guided by the best scientific advice. We are so grateful for the response of the public, who have helped us to slow the spread of the virus and stop the NHS from being overwhelmed. The government has been working day and night to battle coronavirus, delivering a strategy designed to protect our NHS and save lives. Herd immunity has never been a policy or goal. We have provided the NHS with all the support it needs, made sure everyone requiring treatment has received it and taken unprecedented steps to support businesses and workers, to protect the economy.\u201d</p> \n<p>The spokesperson for Vallance said: \u201cHerd immunity was a scientific point, that ultimately immunity is an important way to tackle infectious disease, ideally through vaccination.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ken Sazuze says he understood that this was an unprecedented pandemic, but could not understand how the government could say its response had been faultless. \u201cI\u2019m in a different world now,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s something you can\u2019t believe. I am angry as well. It would help if they accept their mistakes and apologise. It was slow, the testing and PPE was not adequate, and this virus was allowed to spread. Sometimes you just have to stand up and admit your mistakes, as a human being.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/04/case-counter-chapterised/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Covid-19%3A%20help%20us%20investigate&amp;description=The%20Guardian%20is%20investigating%20how%20the%20UK%20government%20prepared%20for%20%E2%80%93%20and%20is%20responding%20to%20%E2%80%93%20the%20coronavirus%20pandemic.%20We%20want%20to%20learn%20more%20about%20recent%20decisions%20taken%20at%20the%20heart%20of%20government.%20If%20you%E2%80%99re%20a%20whistleblower%20or%20source%20and%20with%20new%20information%2C%20you%20can%20email%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22mailto%3Acovid19.investigations%40theguardian.com%22%3Ecovid19.investigations%40theguardian.com%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20or%20(using%20a%20non-work%20phone)%20use%20Signal%20or%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.whatsapp.com%2Fsend%3Fphone%3D447584640566%22%3EWhatsApp%3C%2Fa%3E%20to%20message%20(UK)%20%2B44%207584%20640566.%20(The%20number%20does%20not%20take%20calls.)%20For%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E.%20For%20general%20advice%20on%20confidentially%20contacting%20the%20Guardian%2C%20see%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.%20&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"The Guardian is investigating how the UK government prepared for \u2013 and is responding to \u2013 the coronavirus pandemic.

      "bodyText": "In common with the many thousands of people whose lives have suddenly been devastated by Covid-19, Ken Sazuze cannot know exactly when the coronavirus landed on his family and wreaked its terrible damage. His wife, Elsie, was 44, a much-loved nurse, mother to their children, Anna, 16, and Andrew, 22; she was his soulmate and best friend, a \u201cgenuine person,\u201d he says. Elsie died on 8 April, on a ventilator, in Birmingham\u2019s Good Hope hospital. Ken believes she became infected sometime in that eerie, frightening week after Monday 16 March, when Boris Johnson\u2019s government reconsidered its previous light-touch approach, which had envisaged 60% of the population \u2013 40 million people \u2013 would become infected, and while many would die, the majority would recover and attain \u201cherd immunity\u201d. That week, although more physical distancing had been advised by Johnson, normal life mostly continued until the compulsory lockdown; pubs, restaurants and gyms stayed open, as did schools, until Friday 20 March. Sazuze, who served 10 years in the British army before studying to be a nurse himself, says he \u201cnever liked that herd immunity idea\u201d. \u201cDuring those weeks, the virus was allowed to spread,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have suffered such a painful blow. I strongly believe that if the government had acted more quickly we wouldn\u2019t have lost so many lives, and my wife could be here today.\u201d The health secretary, Matt Hancock, supported by Downing Street, has persistently denied that attaining herd immunity, by allowing the disease to infect most people, was ever a policy, goal, strategy or even \u201cpart of the plan\u201d. Well-placed government sources said on the strictest reading of the word \u201cpolicy\u201d that may be true. But they do not understand how the government can claim that herd immunity was not part of its plan. The Guardian\u2019s account of the government\u2019s response to the crisis is based on interviews with sources in or close to Downing Street, the Department of Health and Social Care, the Cabinet Office, Cobra and Sage, as well as other advisers and experts. Many asked not to be named, because they were not authorised to speak publicly. Some said that while they had concerns, they were holding back some of their criticism because they did not want to damage public trust in government at such a delicate time. All are wary of being wise in hindsight, and sympathetic to ministers who took decisions they felt were right at the time. But with Covid-19 having spread virulently, particularly during those first three weeks of March, more than 21,000 people have now died in hospitals alone and Britain is predicted to be possibly the worst affected country in Europe. There are profound questions to be answered, about why Johnson\u2019s government stood alone among the countries of the world, pursuing that herd immunity approach, and why, when they realised stricter measures were needed, the lockdown was still delayed. Prof Neil Ferguson, the lead scientist on the Covid-19 response team at Imperial College London, whose advice paper of 16 March is credited with convincing the government to change course, responded extensively to questions from the Guardian for this article. He emphasised that one alarming estimate in that paper was not new: that under the \u201cmitigation scenario\u201d, which apparently envisaged herd immunity as one outcome, and included measures then being considered by the government, 250,000 people would die. Brexit Viewed from today\u2019s unimaginably changed perspective, this year\u2019s pre-crisis months can seem like a parallel world. Johnson\u2019s media backers were feting him then for winning the \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d election, and his private life, since criticised by some as a distraction, was portrayed as a cause for national rejoicing when on 29 February he and Carrie Symonds announced their engagement. Johnson took Britain out of the European Union on 31 January, portraying the moment as an opportunity to \u201cunleash the full potential of this brilliant country and to make better the lives of everyone in every corner of our United Kingdom.\u201d A day earlier, an emergency committee of the World Health Organization declared that Covid-19, which had broken out in China and spread to 18 countries, was a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). The WHO stated then, as it has emphasised throughout, that this highest state of alert required an immediate response. In the absence of a vaccine, the WHO insisted that the virus should be addressed like the operation mounted in South Korea, with extensive testing, tracing people with whom a person testing positive has had close contact, and isolating all of them, \u201cto interrupt virus spread\u201d. David Nabarro, the WHO Covid-19 envoy, told the Guardian that he and the director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, knew then that the coronavirus was going to become \u201chuge\u201d and would be \u201creally difficult\u201d for governments. \u201cCoronaviruses are horrible,\u201d Nabarro said. \u201cThey\u2019re rather stable and incredibly well designed to wreak havoc among populations because they are very, very easy to transmit and quite tough to contain. You can\u2019t just let this thing go, and let it wash over your society, because it will kill lots of old people, and a few younger people, it will make hospitals into a big mess, and it will endanger health workers.\u201d On 3 February, Johnson made another triumphal Brexit speech, in which he even sounded a note against responding too strongly to Covid-19, arguing it ran counter to his vision of Britain as a \u201csupercharged champion\u201d of global free trade. He was labelled a \u201cpart-time prime minister\u201d by the Labour opposition on 28 February, after he spent 12 days away at the Chevening country residence in Kent, and did not attend four of the first five meetings of the Cobra committee, convened to consider Britain\u2019s response to Covid-19, until one on Monday 2 March. He did go to a meeting in late February, attended by senior officials, but only very briefly, without making a substantial contribution, which one attendee says seemed strange. Asked about this, a Downing Street spokesperson clarified that Johnson went to be updated on coronavirus, and left after that. The government\u2019s decision-making on Covid-19 has since become a focus of fierce scrutiny and much criticism, partly for its lack of transparency. Cobra, the forum for considering emergencies, attended by ministers and their officials, meets in secret. It takes scientific advice from Sage, whose membership was not made public until the Guardian revealed the names of participants. They included Johnson\u2019s chief of staff, Dominic Cummings, and another Downing Street adviser, Ben Warner, a data scientist who worked on the Vote Leave Brexit campaign, and is said by one Sage attendee to have \u201cbehaved as Cummings\u2019 deputy\u201d. Supposed to be impartial and free from political influence, Sage responds to questions passed down from Cobra. Its own makeup has been criticised by some as too narrow, overly reliant on epidemiologists who specialise in mathematical modelling. One participant told the Guardian that Sage lacked diversity and was \u201cway too slow\u201d to consider how other countries, including those in south Asia, were managing to contain the spread of the virus. A spokesperson for Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, rejected those criticisms, saying the scientists are engaged with experts in other countries and \u201ccontainment strategies form part of those discussions\u201d. Sage receives advice from three expert groups: Nervtag, which examines the science of the virus itself; SPI-M, which models how it spreads; and SPI-B, which involves behavioural scientists in considering how people may respond to restrictive measures. Following initial criticism, the government has published some details, making public the Nervtag membership and minutes of meetings, and some limited papers from SPI-M and SPI-B. Yet even these few documents do establish that Covid-19\u2019s catastrophic threat to life was communicated clearly to ministers by the scientific advisers. On 2 March, a brief \u201cconsensus statement\u201d from SPI-M reported very stark assessments to Sage. \u201cIt is highly likely that there is sustained transmission of Covid-19 in the UK at present,\u201d it said. The coronavirus was noted to be highly contagious, with each infected person infecting two to three more. If \u201cstringent measures\u201d were not imposed, \u201cit would correspond to around 80% of the population [53 million people] becoming infected\u201d. SPI-M\u2019s best estimate of the death rate was 0.5% to 1%: between 250,000 and 500,000 people. Of those requiring hospital treatment, 12% were likely to die. If, like Elsie Sazuze, they needed to be put on a ventilator, they had only a 50% chance of survival. Yet somehow, the genuine peril and need to act fast was not seized on by the government. The first phase of a plan to contain the virus with testing and tracing was ended on 12 March, and the policy moved to try to delay the peak of the infection. Later, the plan was for \u201cmitigation\u201d, for a series of measures to be gradually brought in: \u201ccase isolation\u201d of seven days for somebody who felt they had symptoms, then \u201chousehold isolation\u201d for everybody living with them to quarantine themselves for 14 days, then at some point, to shield elderly and vulnerable people. The day after the 2 March Cobra meeting and SPI-M statement, Johnson held the first televised press conference with Vallance and Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer. Whitty did say solemnly that a worst-case scenario estimated 80% of people could become infected, and 1% of those could die, but the message best remembered is Johnson joshingly telling the nation: \u201cI was at a hospital the other night where I think there were actually a few coronavirus patients and I shook hands with everybody.\u201d Johnson\u2019s advice was: \u201cWe should all basically just go about our normal daily lives.\u201d He also advised: \u201cThe best thing you can do is to wash your hands with soap and hot water while singing Happy Birthday twice.\u201d Over the next fortnight, as Italy moved to impose a lockdown, France and Spain began to do the same, and Germany embarked on physical distancing measures coupled with Europe\u2019s most extensive testing and contact tracing operation, Britain did comparatively little. Hand-washing was still the main advice, along with case isolation of people feeling symptoms. The first official report of somebody dying in hospital having tested positive for Covid-19 caught in the UK came on 5 March. Still, elderly and vulnerable people were not given any advice to shield themselves. A member of one Sage advisory committee said that around this time there was a gap between the scientific advice and political messaging. \u201cThe prime minister was going around shaking people\u2019s hands to demonstrate that there wasn\u2019t a problem. There was a disconnect at that point. We were all slightly incredulous that that was happening.\u201d Some experts believe Britain\u2019s exceptional response arose in part because government preparations for a pandemic were so weighted to a flu outbreak. Prof Graham Medley, a Sage member and the chair of SPI-M \u2013 which stands for scientific pandemic influenza \u2013 modelling \u2013 explains. \u201cEverything \u2013 government preparedness, the modelling \u2013 was based on pandemic influenza. And that\u2019s not because of lack of awareness on our part, that\u2019s because that got the government attention and the funding. We could persuade them that flu was important.\u201d The group\u2019s terms of reference were eventually broadened to include different kinds of pandemic but the emphasis lingered. Scientists are used to seeing flu spread through populations very fast, then become milder as it mutates, and to seeing people indeed develop immunity and populations become resistant. Covid-19 is lethally different, new, its properties more uncertain, and the idea of addressing it by allowing it to move through the population and attain herd immunity was widely condemned for risking far too many lives. Herd immunity Given the repeated denials, it can be overlooked that the reason the world believes that attaining herd immunity was the government\u2019s approach is largely because Vallance said it was. On Friday 13 March, when the virus was spreading exponentially, he set out publicly to explain the government\u2019s strategy. \u201cOur aim is to try and reduce the peak, broaden the peak, not suppress it completely,\u201d Vallance explained on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cAlso, because the vast majority of people get a mild illness, to build up some kind of herd immunity, so more people are immune to this disease, and we reduce the transmission. At the same time, we protect those who are most vulnerable to it. Those are the key things we need to do.\u201d Asked on Sky News what proportion of the population would need to become infected to achieve herd immunity, Vallance replied: \u201cProbably about 60% or so.\u201d Few mitigation measures were yet put in place. The week is remembered for the mega-events that went ahead: the Cheltenham Festival of horseracing, the Liverpool v Atletico Madrid Champions League tie, the Stereophonics concert in Cardiff. In allowing them, the government was indeed, as it consistently said, following the UK science that, surprisingly to many, considers that \u201cmass gatherings\u201d do not have a major impact on virus transmission. The numbers of people infected will almost certainly never be known, but the pictures of packed stands, particularly at Cheltenham, have become emblems of the government\u2019s delay and inaction. On 11 March, the WHO formally declared Covid-19 a pandemic. Tedros, the director general, maintained that the virus spread could still be confronted, and criticised \u201calarming levels of inaction\u201d by some countries. That same day, a further explanation of the government\u2019s strategy was given by Dr David Halpern, a psychologist who heads the Behavioural Insights Team, a company part-owned by the Cabinet Office, which it advises. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a point, assuming the epidemic flows and grows, as we think it probably will do, where you\u2019ll want to cocoon, you\u2019ll want to protect those at-risk groups so that they basically don\u2019t catch the disease, and by the time they come out of their cocooning, herd immunity\u2019s been achieved in the rest of the population.\u201d At a press conference the following day, Johnson famously said: \u201cI must level with the British public: many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time.\u201d Whitty announced then that the initial effort to contain the disease by testing and tracing had been abandoned, yet despite that, and Johnson\u2019s dire warning, the measures discussed for the new \u201cdelay\u201d phase were almost negligible. People over 70 were advised not to go on cruises. Johnson said even \u201chousehold quarantine\u201d would not be required until sometime \u201cin the next few weeks\u201d. The government\u2019s published plan did say that social distancing and school closures could be considered. That evening, the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt spoke on the BBC, saying he was concerned Britain had become an \u201coutlier\u201d. Hunt says now he became worried that Whitty was too resigned to the virus spreading: \u201cI couldn\u2019t understand why they were so certain that nothing could be done to stop nearly 60% of our population becoming infected, when I had figures showing that even in Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak in China, less than 1% of the population actually became infected.\u201d Vallance made his media appearances the following day, explaining the herd immunity approach. He was asked on Sky News why in the UK \u201csociety was continuing as normal\u201d, and it was put to him that a 60% infection rate would mean \u201can awful lot of people dying\u201d. Vallance replied that it was difficult to estimate the number of deaths, but said: \u201cWell of course we do face the prospect, as the prime minister said yesterday, of an increasing number of people dying.\u201d Matt Hancock, the health secretary, issued the first denial that herd immunity was part of the government\u2019s plan, despite Halpern and Vallance having days earlier indicated that it was, in a column in the Sunday Telegraph on 15 March. \u201cWe have a plan, based on the expertise of world-leading scientists,\u201d Hancock wrote. \u201cHerd immunity is not a part of it. That is a scientific concept, not a goal or a strategy.\u201d By then, a dizzying number of experts were sounding the alarm. An open letter issued on 14 March dismissing herd immunity as \u201cnot a viable option\u201d and calling for stricter social distancing measures so that \u201cthousands of lives can be spared\u201d was signed by more than 500 UK scientists. Ultimately, the evidence that appears to have prompted the change of course was contained in the Imperial College paper, published on 16 March. A political decision Ferguson\u2019s paper has been greatly reported on but somewhat misunderstood. It did suddenly warn that the NHS would be overwhelmed \u201ceight-fold\u201d, resulting in \u201chundreds of thousands of deaths\u201d if the government did not change its strategy from mitigation to \u201csuppression\u201d. But the reason was comparatively technical: experience in Italy and of the first UK cases had shown that double the number of intensive care beds was required than previously estimated. The paper sets out the measures that would apparently comprise a mitigation policy, which the government was then planning: \u201cCase isolation, household quarantine and social distancing of those at higher risk of severe outcomes (older individuals and those with other underlying health conditions) are the most effective policy combination for epidemic mitigation.\u201d Ferguson made it clear to the Guardian that the estimate in that paper of 250,000 deaths was not new and was based on \u201cthe mitigation scenario\u201d. The paper indicated that, in effect, the virus had to be allowed to spread initially, so that over time people would become infected, recover, and attain immunity: \u201cIntroducing such interventions too early risks allowing transmission [of the virus] to return once they are lifted (if insufficient herd immunity has developed).\u201d Ferguson held a press conference on 16 March to explain the new findings. His colleague, Prof Azra Ghani, said: \u201cUnder strategies we were pursuing, we were expecting a degree of herd immunity to build up. If we now realise it\u2019s not possible to cope with that in the current health system, and it may not be acceptable in terms of the numbers, then we need to try and reduce transmission.\u201d The Guardian asked Ferguson how that policy could be contemplated, if it predicted that 250,000 people would die. He emphasised that he was never sanguine about people dying, and made it very clear that it was the politicians, not the scientists, who decided on policies to pursue. \u201cWhile policy can be guided by scientific advice, that does not mean scientific advisers determine policy,\u201d he said. \u201cThough I do try to make it clear to policymakers what the potential consequences of different policies might be, to the extent the science allows.\u201d Prof Graham Medley, another Sage member, and chair of its influential modelling subcommittee, agreed that while the scientists gave their analysis on the epidemic to inform the politicians, deciding what to do was \u201ca political decision\u201d. Medley told the Guardian that Johnson, Hancock and other ministers continually saying they have been guided by the scientists has \u201csometimes gone a bit past the mark\u201d. Asked if he meant that the politicians were passing the buck, Medley replied: \u201cYes.\u201d \u2018Drastic action\u2019 needed Even after the stark warning that the NHS would be overwhelmed if the policy did not change, Johnson and his government still hesitated. He made another speech that day in which he advised \u201cdrastic action\u201d was now needed, but the measures were advisory and still tentative. People over 70, pregnant women, and those with some health conditions were advised only to \u201cavoid all unnecessary social contact\u201d. Britons were asked \u201cwhere they possibly can\u201d to work from home, and Johnson told them \u201cyou should avoid pubs, clubs, theatres and other such social venues\u201d, although all were permitted to stay open. The delay to introducing stricter measures, until the lockdown was finally ordered on 23 March, appears to have been at least partly based on a flawed misreading of the government\u2019s own scientific advice. In early March, Whitty mentioned the idea that the government should wait to impose restrictions because people might tire of them, later saying this was based on both \u201ccommon sense\u201d and \u201cbehavioural science\u201d. \u201cWhat we are moving now to is a phase when we will be having to ask members of the general public to do different things than they would normally do,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a risk if we go too early people will understandably get fatigued and it will be difficult to sustain this over time.\u201d Hancock supported that, suggesting it was the result of official advice. \u201cThe evidence of past epidemics and past crises of this nature shows that people do tire of these sorts of social distancing measures, so if we start them too early, they lose their effect and actually it is worse,\u201d he said. \u201cThe social science and the behavioural science are a very important part of the scientific advice that we rely on.\u201d Yet this concept of \u201cfatigue\u201d was rejected by the behavioural scientists appointed by the government itself to Sage\u2019s subcommittee, SPI\u2013B. \u201cThe word was never used in any of our committee reports,\u201d said Susan Michie, a SPI-B member. \u201cIt is just not a concept that exists in behavioural science, and it was unhelpful for it to be used.\u201d Four other members of SPI-B also told the Guardian that the committee never advised that people would tire of restrictive measures. The publicly available summaries of their conclusions show the group advised that people should be given clear explanations and reasons for social distancing measures, and warn that those measures would affect people unequally, but nowhere do they suggest that people will become \u201cfatigued\u201d. Three behavioural scientists on SPI-B, Stephen Reicher, John Drury and Clifford Stott, even wrote an article for the Psychologist journal, rejecting the notion of \u201cfatigue\u201d and suggesting that delaying stricter social distancing measures on that premise was taking a risk with lives. \u201cPsychological considerations were put at odds with what medical science demanded,\u201d they wrote. The Guardian understands that Halpern\u2019s Behavioural Insights Team, or \u201cnudge unit\u201d, was also opposed to this view that people would tire of restrictive measures. One senior Whitehall source said Whitty himself was the main advocate of the \u201cfatigue\u201d notion, based partly on his own experience of patients in medical practice who do not see drug prescriptions through to their completion. A Downing Street spokesperson, responding on behalf of Whitty, emphasised that he was indeed concerned about timing interventions, and their impact on people\u2019s wellbeing if introduced too early, and that Sage had agreed a balance needed to be struck between the impact of measures, and the time the public could feasibly sustain them. During the week after 16 March, there was a fierce debate within government about whether a stricter lockdown needed to be imposed. \u201cSeveral of us thought measures needed to be introduced earlier,\u201d one source close to the Cabinet Office said. Hancock appears to have been under great pressure, stretched between that view and resistance elsewhere to taking genuinely drastic action. A senior source at the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) recalled discussions about the herd immunity policy continuing, despite Hancock having disowned it, and a senior official still advocating it. \u201cHis basic view was that we were all going to develop antibodies, and ultimately the question was how to manage the release of the disease into the population over time.\u201d The health secretary is said by another well-placed source to have argued forcefully for a lockdown in one Cobra meeting, chaired by Michael Gove, with a junior treasury minister who was resisting due to its huge economic impact and worries that a lockdown would itself kill many people. The source said Hancock kept referring to the modelling that predicted deaths would surge dramatically without a lockdown. The DHSC source sums up this period soberly: \u201cThey knew we would have to go into lockdown; they were debating when. Every single day they wasted, every day we weren\u2019t in lockdown, was resulting in people contracting the disease \u2013 people who have since died.\u201d One source on Sage said there was also nervousness among their group that week, a feeling that the virus was getting out of control and they were not sure the politicians understood its exponential spread. The advice was being communicated, the source said, but they were told that Whitty and Vallance were having to cajole the politicians in the right direction, and there was \u201cfriction\u201d. Reflecting on the presence at Sage of Cummings and Warner, some attendees now say the group\u2019s deliberations were affected by a sense of what could feasibly be done, with a government run by politicians to whom a lockdown looked unthinkable, although others say they were not. Then, that week, when stricter measures were needed, some say it was useful to have Cummings there, because they knew he would communicate that directly to Johnson. One source in Downing Street who personally urged the prime minister to stop delaying and move into lockdown that week said his reticence was partly down to his \u201clibertarian instinct\u201d. \u201cThere was also a bit of \u2018rabbit caught in headlights\u2019.\u201d Incubation Ken Sazuze remembers that week very well. He and Elsie, who grew up together in Malawi before he came to Britain and joined the army, were worried, he recalls, particularly about Elsie working without personal protective equipment suitable for Covid-19, and about the coronavirus spreading in Birmingham. She had moved last year from working in NHS hospitals to caring for people in nursing homes, so she could have more regular shifts and help Anna with her GCSEs. That week, Anna\u2019s school was open, Andrew was travelling on public transport to Wolverhampton University, where he is in the third year of a finance degree. Ken was on a placement during the final year of his nursing degree, while Elsie was working. \u201cIt was still life as normal,\u201d he says. \u201cEverywhere was open. People weren\u2019t social distancing; they didn\u2019t know what to do. We went to the gym, to the shops, to uni, to the library.\u201d On Wednesday 18 March, they went into Birmingham, to the Bullring, shopping for presents for Anna, whose 16th birthday was 10 days away. They went to Marks &amp; Spencer looking for perfume, he remembers, and to an Apple store, where they bought her some AirPods. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know we were infecting ourselves,\u201d Ken says. \u201cI am really annoyed when I start thinking about it too much. I am furious with the government, with people making decisions, that the virus was spreading at that time.\u201d Given the incubation period of Covid-19, Boris Johnson may have contracted the virus that week too. The nation was given the highest profile demonstration of Covid-19\u2019s destructive force, as the prime minister went into hospital days later, then into intensive care. While there was great sympathy for Johnson undergoing that personal ordeal, some experts have argued that the spectacle of Johnson, Cummings, Hancock, Whitty and other advisers contracting the virus indicated that the government was not taking social distancing seriously enough. One source in Downing Street the week before the lockdown said they were surprised to find staff at No 10 still shaking hands with visitors. A Downing Street spokesperson made clear they do not accept that Johnson should have been more careful, saying that No 10 did enforce social distancing where practical. Lockdown On 23 March, the lockdown was finally imposed, Johnson clasping his hands during his televised address to the nation, telling people they must stay at home, to save lives and protect the NHS, and go out only for exercise and to shop for essentials. That week, apart from work, Sazuze says he and Elsie only went to Asda and Costco. But on Wednesday 25 March, Elsie began to feel unwell. The unthinkable happened very quickly. Three days later, at 2am, she was struggling with her breathing and had a very high temperature, so they called an ambulance which took her to hospital. By 2 April, Ken had a call with her, on FaceTime, before she was put on a ventilator. \u201cThat was my last goodbye with my wife,\u201d he says. \u201cWe knew it was 50-50 if she went on the ventilator. She said: \u2018Ken, I\u2019ve prayed, I\u2019ve talked to the doctor, I\u2019m happy to do this. I love you, and if anything happens, you look after the children.\u2019 I told her: \u201cHoney, come on, let\u2019s think positive; let\u2019s not think you\u2019re not going to pull through.\u2019\u201d They were called on 8 April at 1am and told to rush to the hospital. He laments that Anna was deemed too young to go into the intensive care unit, and had to be in touch with her and Andrew, by Elsie\u2019s side, via FaceTime. \u201cWe were praying,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there was no response.\u201d That day, 8 April, Elsie was among 938 people reported to have died in hospitals from Covid-19, as the catastrophe in Britain steepled, and so many families, including those of doctors, nurses, other NHS staff and key workers, were plunged into grief. In a response to questions about the government\u2019s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, and whether Johnson regrets any elements of it, Downing Street did not accept any criticisms. A spokesperson replied in a statement: \u201cThis is an unprecedented global pandemic and we have taken the right steps at the right time to combat it, guided by the best scientific advice. We are so grateful for the response of the public, who have helped us to slow the spread of the virus and stop the NHS from being overwhelmed. The government has been working day and night to battle coronavirus, delivering a strategy designed to protect our NHS and save lives. Herd immunity has never been a policy or goal. We have provided the NHS with all the support it needs, made sure everyone requiring treatment has received it and taken unprecedented steps to support businesses and workers, to protect the economy.\u201d The spokesperson for Vallance said: \u201cHerd immunity was a scientific point, that ultimately immunity is an important way to tackle infectious disease, ideally through vaccination.\u201d Ken Sazuze says he understood that this was an unprecedented pandemic, but could not understand how the government could say its response had been faultless. \u201cI\u2019m in a different world now,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s something you can\u2019t believe. I am angry as well. It would help if they accept their mistakes and apologise. It was slow, the testing and PPE was not adequate, and this virus was allowed to spread. Sometimes you just have to stand up and admit your mistakes, as a human being.\u201d",

The secretary of state would not give a date for reopening, but ruled out schools opening during the summer holidays as a way of helping pupils who have missed out on education to catch up. Questioned by the education select committee on Wednesday, Williamson told MPs: \u201cWe recognise that the idea of schools all returning on day one with the full complement of pupils is not realistic or practical. \u201cI do expect schools to be opened in a phased manner.

No biggies. So imagine our (relative) glee when word got out that Newcastle United boss Bernard Cribbins will be for the off should the mellow dudes behind ever-popular business collective Saudi Arabia take control. He\u2019ll supposedly be replaced by Mauricio Pochettino, who\u2019ll trouser \u00a319m a year and be worth every penny too, on account of his peerless ability to finish third in two-horse races and fail to turn up for major finals. A perfect, heartbreaking fit for Newcastle, you\u2019d think.</p> <p>Or maybe manager and club will go on to finally slake their trophy thirst, in which case long-time suitors Manchester United may wonder whether the arrival of Bruno Fernandes and the accompanying Ole-rescuing upturn in form came at exactly the wrong time.

So imagine our (relative) glee when word got out that Newcastle United boss Bernard Cribbins will be for the off should the mellow dudes behind ever-popular business collective Saudi Arabia take control. He\u2019ll supposedly be replaced by Mauricio Pochettino, who\u2019ll trouser \u00a319m a year and be worth every penny too, on account of his peerless ability to finish third in two-horse races and fail to turn up for major finals. A perfect, heartbreaking fit for Newcastle, you\u2019d think. Or maybe manager and club will go on to finally slake their trophy thirst, in which case long-time suitors Manchester United may wonder whether the arrival of Bruno Fernandes and the accompanying Ole-rescuing upturn in form came at exactly the wrong time. Either way, it\u2019s going to be fascinating seeing how this all pans out when things finally get going again. Decisions, please, someone, somewhere, anyone, anywhere! Because The Fiver can\u2019t go on like this. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cWhen I took over, the team [had] got beat by Ajax six or seven and I did think: have I made the right decision here? But it was in my mind to go and work abroad and that was really what I wanted to do. I probably will end up in England and with a club who have got the opportunity to push for some kind of promotion or some kind of success\u201d \u2013 Alan Pardew \u2013 fresh off eight games in charge of Den Haag, in which he won one, faced angry fans at the training ground protesting at his tactics, failed to get them out of the relegation zone and only earned a reprieve when the Eredivisie was voided \u2013 sets his sights on more success after his deal was ended by mutual consent. RECOMMENDED LISTENING Check out the latest edition of Football Weekly, right here. FIVER LETTERS \u201cRe: the 10-year-old Plymouth fan sending them his pocket money from the USA! USA!! USA!!! (yesterday\u2019s News, Bits and Bobs). That really is quite beautiful. Mine used to go straight on Curly Wurlys but, then again, we did send the Pilgrims there in the first place, so it\u2019s only appropriate they do something in return\u201d \u2013 Antony Train. \u201cI once planned to send York City my pocket money, but went on a Panini stickers and spicy tomato Wheat Crunchies bender instead. Still, the thought was there\u201d \u2013 Dave Mixon. \u201cGiven all the hand-wringing about ending/voiding seasons, why don\u2019t all leagues just agree they have until the end of 2020 to complete theirs? The next two seasons in Europe could run from January to November, which would mean the 2022 version finishes just in time for the Ethics World Cup in Qatar. I don\u2019t know how they\u2019d get back to normal after that, but my cunning plan gives everyone two and a half years to work that out\u201d \u2013 Tim Woods. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Antony Train. NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Premier League clubs are concerned about fans gathering outside stadiums if the season resumes and fear being made scapegoats if there is a subsequent rise in coronavirus cases. Manchester United will \u2013 in theory \u2013 trial 1,500 barrier seats that will allow fans to stand next season, after being given permission by Trafford council. Watford have signed Le Havre midfielder Pape Gueye on a 1 July freebie. \u201cAn official pre-contract agreement has already been lodged with all relevant authorities,\u201d blabbed a Watford suit. A winding-up petition against Southend over tax-knack has been adjourned until 22 July. And Standard Li\u00e8ge have asked Marouane Fellaini to follow Alex Witsel\u2019s lead and dig deep to help his former club avoid being relegated into the wilderness of the Belgian amateur ranks. Witsel has already put \u20ac1.5m into the kitty, according to reports. STILL WANT MORE? \u201cThe chairman has said he can\u2019t afford to keep us \u2013 it\u2019s a shock but I understand.\u201d Frank Nouble, who has just been released by Colchester, on the fragile life of being a lower-league footballer right now. Underrated Premier League players part one: from Arsenal to Liverpool. Get clicking. Ending Ligue Urrrrrrn early has left us with more questions than answers, so says French football aficionado Eric Devin. Who is the shortest goalkeeper to have played in the English top flight?

Lesley Rudd, chief executive of the charity Electrical Safety First said: \u201cIt is alarming that five months into this recall we are only now hearing of these extra models which pose a risk to owners. This new discovery throws into question the robustness of the original investigation. It\u2019s vital that these machines are removed from people\u2019s homes as soon as possible.\u201d The washing machine recall comes in the wake of criticism of Whirlpool for selling more than 5m fire-prone tumble dryers that the company failed to recall for four years until forced to do so by the government\u2019s regulator. Unlike the issues relating to the washing machine recall there were a number of high-profile fires linked to the recalled tumble dryers which were reported to have caused devastating damage. At the end of last year, Whirlpool agreed to pay an undisclosed amount in compensation to victims of the Shepherds Court fire which broke out in 2016, leaving many residents in the west London tower block needing alternative accommodation.",

      "body": "<p>Among the many events cancelled this spring because of the coronavirus pandemic, one in particular stands out.</p> <p>The 75th anniversary of the end of the second world war in Europe, which takes place this May, was due to be a genuinely international occasion. In Berlin, 8 May was declared a public holiday and a major commemoration was planned. In London, there were to have been three days of celebrations, including a procession of war veterans down the Mall. Across the continent, thousands of street parties, concerts, festivals and commemorative church services were planned. Almost all of these events have now been called off \u2013 though today we learned that in the UK the Queen will address the nation and there will be some form of Vera Lynn singalong.</p> <p>For many veterans and survivors of the war, this would have been their last chance to take part in a major celebration of this kind. Sad though this is, perhaps it will give us time to rethink the way we remember the second world war. Commemorations in recent years have become toxic, divisive affairs.</p> <p>At the D-Day 75th-anniversary commemorations in Portsmouth last year, a steel wall had to be erected around the festival site: organisers were worried about demonstrations against Donald Trump, who was attending. Vladimir Putin was not even invited, and Russian officials responded to the snub by saying that D-Day was not worth commemorating anyway, because by that point in the war Russian heroes had already won all the truly important battles.</p> <p>Similar tensions have marred commemorations across Europe.

      "bodyText": "Among the many events cancelled this spring because of the coronavirus pandemic, one in particular stands out. The 75th anniversary of the end of the second world war in Europe, which takes place this May, was due to be a genuinely international occasion. In Berlin, 8 May was declared a public holiday and a major commemoration was planned. In London, there were to have been three days of celebrations, including a procession of war veterans down the Mall. Across the continent, thousands of street parties, concerts, festivals and commemorative church services were planned. Almost all of these events have now been called off \u2013 though today we learned that in the UK the Queen will address the nation and there will be some form of Vera Lynn singalong. For many veterans and survivors of the war, this would have been their last chance to take part in a major celebration of this kind. Sad though this is, perhaps it will give us time to rethink the way we remember the second world war. Commemorations in recent years have become toxic, divisive affairs. At the D-Day 75th-anniversary commemorations in Portsmouth last year, a steel wall had to be erected around the festival site: organisers were worried about demonstrations against Donald Trump, who was attending. Vladimir Putin was not even invited, and Russian officials responded to the snub by saying that D-Day was not worth commemorating anyway, because by that point in the war Russian heroes had already won all the truly important battles. Similar tensions have marred commemorations across Europe. This January, the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, pulled out of attending a Holocaust remembrance ceremony in Jerusalem. He was angry that Putin would be delivering a speech there. Putin replied by boycotting a similar ceremony in Poland for the Auschwitz liberation anniversary. In Croatia, Serbs, Jews and Roma have for years refused to attend Holocaust commemorations, in protest against the rise of the Croatian far right. Jewish groups in Hungary and Austria did the same in 2014 and 2018, claiming that populists were hijacking the commemorations for their own purposes. The European parliament has become so concerned that last September it passed an extraordinary resolution condemning the growing trend across Europe to glorify fascists, communists and their many wartime collaborators.

ITV Studios, which makes programmes for many broadcasters, has been advertising shows it made for audiences in the US and China which they hope to sell to broadcasters elsewhere in the world. There is also the risk that commercial broadcasters, who are currently seeing record-high viewing figures with record-low advertising income as the economy contracts, could be left with major gaps in their autumn and winter schedules. Channel 4 has already had to make enormous cuts to its programming budget in order to avoid financial collapse. Charlotte Moore, BBC director of content, told an Edinburgh TV festival session that audiences were tiring of programmes that look like they were filmed on videoconference calls and are instead yearning for more substantive and slick programmes. \u201cWe\u2019re very keen not everything is made on Zoom,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the moment people are enjoying \u2018we\u2019re all in it together\u2019 and seeing inside everyone\u2019s house \u2026 But there\u2019s also a massive appetite for all the flashy shows.\u201d",

But it\u2019s not just computer issues: \u201cit turns out that the reason small businesses haven\u2019t been able to get their money, is because the big businesses have been snapping it up,\u201d said Noah. In the first round of the funding, $810m went to large, publicly traded companies, some with market values of over $100m, including the national restaurant chain Shake Shack and the Los Angeles Lakers.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what anybody says, the Lakers do not need $4m,\u201d said Noah. \u201cThe Knicks need $4m to bribe their fans to act like they don\u2019t see what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that although what these big companies did was shitty, it wasn\u2019t illegal,\u201d Noah continued. \u201cThey saw a chance \u2013 a chance to get money \u2013 and they took it. Which is what companies are always gonna do.\u201d Which raises the question: \u201cwhy didn\u2019t the government come up with regulations to make sure that the money for small businesses actually went to small businesses?\u201d</p> <p>Instead of keeping the big dogs out, the treasury <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/business/sba-loans-ppp-coronavirus.html\">ceded authority to the banks</a>, \u201cand then the banks did what the banks do, which is: screw over the little guys\u201d, said Noah. Already, a lawsuit against four major banks \u2013 Bank of America, US Bank, Chase and Well Fargo \u2013 alleges the banks prioritized bigger customers (with their bigger bank fees) over small businesses.</p> <p>The PPP situation proves \u201cyou can\u2019t leave the loan decisions up to the banks,\u201d Noah concluded, as banks are businesses \u2013 they\u2019re \u201calways going to take care of its top customers first\u201d.</p> <p>Furthermore, many small businesses are owned by women and African Americans, who often lack pre-exisiting relationships with banks. \u201cSo, if the banks didn\u2019t know you before coronavirus, you\u2019re definitely not going to be on their radar now,\u201d said Noah, which is why <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/women-minority-business-owners-paycheck-protection-program-loans/\">some experts have warned</a> that up to 90% of minority and women-owned businesses will be shut out of the paycheck protection program. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you fix this program overnight,\u201d Noah concluded, \u201cbut if you\u2019re a woman or a minority who owns a small business, I suggest you start practicing your jump shot, because that might be the only way you get some of this government cash.\u201d</p>",

At her daily coronavirus briefing, Sturgeon said: \u201cIt is incumbent on care home providers, whether they are in the public or private sector, to follow and to implement the guidance.\u201d She said the Care Inspectorate, the sector\u2019s regulator, would be examining every care home\u2019s conduct during the pandemic. Donald Macaskill, the chief executive of the umbrella body Scottish Care, said the sector had already voluntarily adopted lockdown policies on 11 March, banning visits by families. \u201cThat started before anybody in the UK or Scottish governments arrived at that position,\u201d he said. Operators had seen similar crises emerge in other European countries, he said, but the pandemic required grades of personal protective equipment never normally needed or used by care homes. Prices for medical-grade PPE had gone up by 1,000% since the crisis began, he said, while the sector was expected to deliver 24-hour care for its residents at a cost of \u00a34.41 an hour. \u201cWe have long argued that you can\u2019t provide care on the cheap,\u201d he said. NRS figures showed a total of 2,272 people had died from Covid-19 in Scotland by Sunday 26 April. Of those, 52% occurred in hospitals, 39% in care homes and 9% in private homes and elsewhere since 13 March. Macaskill said Scottish Care had gone further than Sturgeon by calling for hospital-grade face masks to be mandatory in all care homes, for staff and residents. Sturgeon on Tuesday recommended the public should use scarves and cloth as face coverings in busy shops or on public transport. \u201cI\u2019m prepared to accept we will in retrospect learn lessons on how things would be done differently [in future] but we have certainly followed all the guidance issued by Public Health England and Health Protection Scotland,\u201d he said. \u201cI have absolutely no doubt that every woman and man who delivers care has one thing on their mind: to keep the virus out. The care home sector hasn\u2019t been complacent.\u201d With many care homes reporting multiple deaths, the families of residents, the charity Age Scotland and care home managers have alleged that GPs have refused to visit care homes, or pressured families to sign \u201cdo not resuscitate\u201d orders, while sick residents have not been admitted to hospital. NHS boards have also been accused of failing to allow care home staff to be tested for the virus. Those allegations forced ministers to intensify their demands that care homes are treated as a priority by the NHS, but Sturgeon also denied her government had let care homes down. \u201cThere has been no complacency at any stage of dealing with this crisis. Does that mean we haven\u2019t made mistakes along the way, I\u2019m not here talking about care homes in particular, I\u2019m talking in general \u2013 of course we will make mistakes,\u201d she said. \u201cAt every step we have sought to do what is right, what is best, what is necessary.\u201d",

Later, three months after forming a coalition government in 2010, his daughter Florence was born. Cameron never shied away from talking about the influence of his children, including in his speeches, and, without displaying them, never hid them away, allowing them to attend middle-rank receptions, and doing his best to integrate them into an all-consuming life. On a book tour for his memoir, For the Record, Cameron said Florence, who was only five when the family left Downing Street in 2016, had hardly been scarred by the glare of life in No 10. He told the Cheltenham literature festival that his daughter had asked him only last summer: \u201cDaddy, is it true, were you actually the prime minister?\u201d If Johnson\u2019s latest offspring can end his period in No 10 as ignorant of his father\u2019s occupation, he, and his parents will have done well.",

Infection rates have also increased sharply in Monaghan, which has an incidence of 570.2, and Louth, with 463.2. The regional surge has put scrutiny on the border and diverging responses to the Covid-19 pandemic in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.

Speaking in the Japanese parliament, Abe stressed the importance of developing vaccines and drugs to combat Covid-19 before the Games begin on 23 July next year. \u201cThe Olympic Games must be held in a way that shows the world has won its battle against the coronavirus pandemic,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise, it will be difficult to hold them. \u201cWe\u2019ve been saying we will hold the Olympics and Paralympics in which athletes and spectators can participate safely and in a complete form.

Of the total global working population of 3.3 billion, about 2 billion work in the \u201cinformal economy\u201d, often on short-term contracts or self-employment, and have suffered a 60% collapse in their wages in the first month of the crisis. Sweden passes 20,000 confirmed cases The country, which has not imposed strict lockdown measures, passes the 20,000-case mark as it reports another 681 infections. Another 107 deaths are reported, bringing the Swedish death toll to 2,462, while 1,005 patients have recovered. Ireland set to extend lockdown Ireland looks likely to extend its lockdown, despite growing calls to ease restrictions and salvage the economy. The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, tells the country that new cases, deaths and intensive care admissions appear too high to start relaxing rules that are to expire on 5 May. Parisian \u2018exiles\u2019 told to return after lockdown Paris\u2019s coronavirus \u201cexiles\u201d should return to the city at the end of lockdown on 11 May, but not all at once, says France\u2019s transport minister, Jean-Baptiste Djebbari. The exodus of city-dwellers in the hours before the strict lockdown came into effect was hugely controversial as those who left for holiday homes were accused of spreading the virus to rural communities, while the episode also highlighted stark inequalities in France. Vietnam reports no domestic transmission for two weeks Vietnam says it has gone five days straight without reporting any new confirmed cases \u2013 and nearly two weeks without any domestic transmission. Its prime minister declares that Vietnam has \u201cbasically put the pandemic under control\u201d. Switzerland extends ban on large public events No public event exceeding an attendance of 1,000 people will be allowed until the end of August, despite Swiss ministers announcing the easing of some other restrictions on sporting events, shops, restaurants and museums. Some border restrictions will also begin being eased from 11 May, the government says. Professional sports teams can resume play behind closed doors on 8 June. Germany extends travel warning Berlin extends its global travel warning until 14 June and says it will review the situation again then. But with some German summer holidays due to start in some regions on 22 June, there are calls to make a more a definitive ruling as to whether summer is on or off. UK government minister only read key pandemic planning report last week Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, admits he did not get round to reading a confidential government report on a 2016 pandemic modelling exercise in full until just last week. Giving evidence to the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee, Gove says he read the report from Exercise Cygnus last week \u2013 although he insists he read recommendations prompted by the report earlier. No clinical benefits from remdesivir, study finds Treating patients with the antiviral drug remdesivir shows no \u201csignificant clinical benefits\u201d in the first randomised trial of its kind. In a study among more than 200 Covid-19 patients in China published in the Lancet on Wednesday, doctors find no positive effects of administering the drug, compared with a control group of adults. More than 3.1m people infected worldwide Researchers say at least 3,142,942 are known to have been infected, while at least 218,649 are confirmed to have died. The figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University are likely to underestimate the scale of the pandemic because of suspected official underreporting.",

Despite news that the longest expansion in US history came to an abrupt end in the first three months of 2020, financial markets were buoyed by an update from the American biopharma company Gilead Sciences on its experimental drug remdesivir. US drug regulators are expected to announce they will allow the emergency use of remdesivir in the treatment of the coronavirus following a large scale clinical trial of the anti-viral drug by the US government. Dr Anthony Fauci, the country\u2019s top infectious disease official, told reporters at the White House on Wednesday that initial data on the potential treatment with the experimental drug looked promising but needed further review, adding that he had no timeline for the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval. However, a separate set of results published by the Lancet medical journal on Wednesday of a trial conducted in China concluded remdesivir failed to improve patients\u2019 condition or reduce the pathogen\u2019s presence in the bloodstream. Gilead said previously that those findings, released inadvertently by the World Health Organization last week, were inconclusive because the study was terminated early.

      "bodyText": "The latest annual rental affordability snapshot released on Thursday by Anglicare reveals the continuing precarious nature of housing for those on low incomes. But while this has been an ongoing issue, this year\u2019s snapshot highlights the magnitude of the impact the recent temporary doubling of welfare payments has on the ability for people to find a place to live. The coronavirus has brought to the fore a number of issues in the economy, which makes it easy to forget that many people were struggling even before the economy hit a wall. Anglicare\u2019s 21st rental affordability snapshot released on Thursday highlights that even prior to the coronavirus wreaking havoc on our economy, it was as hard as ever for those on minimum wage and government payments to find places to rent. Each year Anglicare surveys properties available to rent on a certain date, and rates them as affordable and suitable for differing households, because importantly, the rental price is not the only consideration. Obviously a one room apartment might be affordable for a family of four with a parent on the minimal wage, but it is not suitable. This year, Anglicare\u2019s survey was undertaken on 21 March \u2013 just before the introduction of the temporary increase in payments for benefits such as the Jobseeker allowance (formerly Newstart). This allowed them to compare the difference in affordability before and after the changes. And it is stark. On 21 March there were 69,960 places for rent, and just nine of those were suitable and affordable for a person on jobseeker. But if the doubling of the payment was treated as permanent, that increases to 1,040 places: For a couple on the jobseeker payment with two children under 10, the difference is even greater \u2013 from 589 under the old amount to 8,106 \u2013 an increase from 0.8% of all rental properties to 11.6%. Those payments that have not been increased due to the coronavirus \u2013 the aged pension and the disability support pension, not surprisingly saw the least change. The only increase for these payments came from including a rise as a result of Wednesday\u2019s latest inflation figures. Anglicare notes that \u201cclose to 750,000 people receive the disability support pension\u201d and that \u201c660,000 people on the aged pension do not own their own home.\u201d They argue that \u201cit defies logic that they have not been included in the coronavirus supplement\u201d. The impact on the exclusion of the aged pension from the increase is clear when we compare it with affordability for those on the parenting payment: For both payments, the pre-Covid payment period in March saw rental affordability as bad as it has been for five years. But while the aged pensioners only got a small boost when the April CPI increase was taken into account, those on the parenting payment were able to afford more places to rent than ever before due to the doubling of their payment. That this takes the parenting payment affordability to just 2.6% of all rental properties highlights just how poor the situation is. The latest inflation figures released on Wednesday by the Bureau of Statistics show that average rents have declined in Perth, Sydney and Darwin, and that for the past three years they have, in all cities except Canberra and Hobart, risen by less than inflation: But this slight slowing of rent rises has done little to make up for the massive jump that occurred from 2007 to 2012: The Anglicare snapshot highlights just how unfit for purpose were the levels of jobseeker and other government payments \u2013 less about assisting the survival of those out of work than punishing them for not being employed. Anglicare has called for the increases to be permanent \u2013 something the prime minister has recently ruled out. It has also called for a \u201cnational economic stimulus package with targets for building social housing\u201d. This echoes a recent call by Geoff Hanmer, adjunct professor of architecture at the University of Adelaide. Australia\u2019s public construction of residential properties is currently at near record low levels \u2013 it barely makes a dent in the total building of houses and apartment: After the global financial crisis, public housing construction nearly reached 6% of all residential construction, but even that was well below the levels that occurred routinely in the 1970s and 1980s. The coronavirus looks set to change our economy, but we should not forget that beforehand there were many problems \u2013 and chief among them was the inability of those on government payments to survive for any length of time. The Anglicare rental affordability snapshot highlights just how great an impact the increase in the payments makes on the ability of families to find a place to rent. But it also should shine a light on the need for public and social housing \u2013 not just to create places for people to live but, in a period where private investment is retreating, to also provide jobs. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

It\u2019s one or the other,\u201d Rudd said, while suggesting the prime minister was criticising UN agencies as part of \u201ca far-right domestic political agenda\u201d. Morrison has been critical of the WHO\u2019s performance in handling the coronavirus pandemic and indicated the government is close to completing a broader audit of how Australia engages with global institutions. The review stems from the prime minister\u2019s speech to the Lowy Institute last year when he warned against \u201ca new variant of globalism that seeks to elevate global institutions above the authority of nation states to direct national policies\u201d. Morrison argued at the time that Australia should avoid \u201cany reflex towards a negative globalism that coercively seeks to impose a mandate from an often ill-defined borderless global community, and worse still, an unaccountable internationalist bureaucracy\u201d. More recently, Morrison has floated the idea of reforms to the WHO to ensure public health investigators could visit member countries to verify key facts about disease outbreaks, in powers that he likened to those of weapons inspectors. In an interview with Guardian Australia, Rudd described Morrison\u2019s idea as a \u201cthought bubble\u201d that needed more detail, but said it was inconsistent with the prime minister\u2019s political positioning on global bodies. \u201cWe have Morrison arguing on the one hand, \u2018I, Morrison, want a more powerful and interventionary WHO\u2019,\u201d Rudd said. \u201cWell, hallelujah!

Around the world, he said, centre-right and far-right parties saw attacking the UN and its alleged erosion of national sovereignty as \u201cgood raw meat to throw out to the would-be nationalist political constituencies within your countries in order to bolster your own domestic political base\u201d. While it remains unclear whether Australia will follow the US in cutting funding to certain international agencies, Rudd said conservative governments had a track record of acting \u201creally hairy chested [by] defunding a whole bunch of UN institutions\u201d. \u201cYou\u2019re either going to recognise that these institutions advance the Australian national interest and can be used for that purpose and resource them accordingly, or you play the cheap-jack opportunist line of permanently bashing the UN, bashing unnamed globalism in pursuit of a far-right domestic political agenda \u2013 and as a consequence, lose your credibility within those institutions and your ability to influence their direction,\u201d Rudd said.

Rudd also said there was no evidence the Australian government had done anything to vigorously pursue the recommendations of numerous past reviews into the WHO\u2019s handling of the Ebola outbreak.

As countries around the world struggle to keep up with demand for PPE, the report, conducted by the Australian National University\u2019s cybercrime observatory on behalf of the AIC, found 224 listings of PPE from 110 vendors on 12 omnibus Tor darknet markets. \u201cWe found almost half, 45%, [of all coronavirus-related product listings] were PPE. A lot of surgical marks, a lot of K95 masks. Lots of gowns and sanitisers,\u201d ANU professor Rod Broadhurst told Guardian Australia. \u201cAnd surprisingly a lot of dealers were selling bulk PPE, so thousands of gowns, and thousands of masks and so on, and they had quite hefty prices on them.\u201d Mask, sanitisers and gloves were the most common, followed by protective suits, diagnostic equipment, rapid testing gear and thermoscanners. One bulk offer on one market was for 10,000 \u201cgood quality lab-tested face mask for corona[sic]\u201d valued at A$17,952. Most of the sellers were purportedly from the US or China, but two vendors said they were based in Australia.

Ceaseless hours indoors with your family? Fretting about falling into financial ruin? Feeling an outsized thrill at a neighbour who stops by to visit? There\u2019s an Austen for that.</p> \n<p>I have been bingeing a suite of the best adaptations during my own period of isolation, starting with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/14/emma-review-jane-austen-anya-taylor-joy\">acerbic new adaptation of Emma</a> and then ploughing through the back catalogue of series and films. I had read all the books one winter, living in the US after the election of Donald Trump, and found them brilliantly escapist, a tonic for an anxious mind. Hoovering up all the screen adaptations this time, I, like many others, are seeing the characters\u2019 lives anew.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/29/zoeys-extraordinary-playlist-yes-the-musical-series-is-cheesy-but-its-also-a-glorious-lockdown-escape\">Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist: yes, the musical series is cheesy. But it's also a glorious lockdown escape</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cLife seems but a quick succession of busy nothings,\u201d Fanny Price says straight into the camera in 1999\u2019s Mansfield Park, and I felt her gaze right on me.</p> \n<p>In these stories, people\u2019s lives are shaped by domestic confinement and social inhibition.<strong> </strong>Lives are lived on top of each other. Think of poor Mr Bingley trying to overcome the insane awkwardness of proposing to Jane Bennet while her sisters and mother wait pressed to the door in the next room.</p> \n<p>Not exactly my situation, but life has certainly shrunk lately. For many of us, the jobs and social lives that occupied us have either disappeared or gone online, and our home lives have become all-consuming. Adult kids are living back with their parents, share house occupants have no escape from one another, and all of us are discovering new intimacies \u2013 and indignities \u2013 by having to spend almost every minute in such close quarters.</p> \n<p>The inherent suffocation of a life lived almost entirely within the same four walls has given me fresh appreciation for why characters like Elizabeth Bennet and Sense and Sensibility\u2019s Marianne Dashwood find a simple walk so electrifying. It gives them freedom and perspective. \u201cAdieu to disappointment and spleen. What are men to rocks and mountains?\u201d Austen muses in Pride and Prejudice.<strong> </strong>It\u2019s also a chance to steal a private conversation.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The best adaptations thrum with romantic yearning and a sense of delayed gratification, which is to say, they are spectacularly horny</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>It all feels so familiar right now \u2013 at a time when a walk may be our only time outside the house, and our only legal pretext (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/29/social-distancing-rules-australia-coronavirus-strict-new-laws-legal-illegal-state-physical-restrictions-guidelines-explained-nsw-victoria-qld-queensland-act-sa-wa-two-person-rule\">in some states</a>) to meet and download whatever crumbs of gossip our friends might have stored away. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/17/supermarket-trysts-and-video-chats-how-australians-are-dating-during-covid-19\">As my colleague Ellen Leabeater wrote last week</a>, they\u2019re also one of the few options left for a date; a new generation of singles walking slowly, at a distance, sizing up potential objects of affection.</p> \n<p>That celibacy, or at least drastically reduced physical contact, has been forced on so many people by this pandemic gives us all a new affinity for Austen\u2019s young characters. The best adaptations thrum with romantic yearning and a sense of delayed gratification, which is to say, they are spectacularly horny.

      "bodyText": "In the 1995 BBC version of Pride and Prejudice, during yet another interminable evening, Caroline Bingley, all dressed up with nowhere to go, wanders about the drawing room of her country house. She walks past her sister who simply sits and yawns, past her brother-in-law Mr Hurst who has collapsed drunk on a couch, past Mr Darcy who has his nose buried in a book, until she stops and puts a proposal to their guest, Elizabeth Bennet. \u201cLet me persuade you to follow my example and take a turn about the room,\u201d Miss Bingley says. \u201cIt\u2019s so refreshing.\u201d It\u2019s a memorably absurd moment capturing the lives of the Regency-era idle rich, and a line my sisters and I used to trill aloud with laughter as we watched and rewatched the show as kids. But revisiting the series in the sixth week of coronavirus lockdown, I discovered a newfound sympathy \u2013 affinity even \u2013 for every character battling tedium in that room. We are all Mr Hursts and Caroline Bingleys now. These days, I only envy Miss Bingley for having a room large enough to take a refreshing constitutional in. Bully for her. Though never far from cultural ubiquity, the works of Jane Austen are having a real moment thanks to the pandemic. Stills from the 2005 film version showing Mr Darcy and Elizabeth romancing from a sensible six feet apart are being memed as models of physical distancing. His repeated nervous inquiries about whether her family \u201care in good health\u201d is now, as writer Hannah Long pointed out, a strong opening for all your work emails. All of a sudden, period dramas have become extremely relatable. Ceaseless hours indoors with your family? Fretting about falling into financial ruin? Feeling an outsized thrill at a neighbour who stops by to visit? There\u2019s an Austen for that. I have been bingeing a suite of the best adaptations during my own period of isolation, starting with the acerbic new adaptation of Emma and then ploughing through the back catalogue of series and films. I had read all the books one winter, living in the US after the election of Donald Trump, and found them brilliantly escapist, a tonic for an anxious mind. Hoovering up all the screen adaptations this time, I, like many others, are seeing the characters\u2019 lives anew. \u201cLife seems but a quick succession of busy nothings,\u201d Fanny Price says straight into the camera in 1999\u2019s Mansfield Park, and I felt her gaze right on me. In these stories, people\u2019s lives are shaped by domestic confinement and social inhibition. Lives are lived on top of each other. Think of poor Mr Bingley trying to overcome the insane awkwardness of proposing to Jane Bennet while her sisters and mother wait pressed to the door in the next room. Not exactly my situation, but life has certainly shrunk lately. For many of us, the jobs and social lives that occupied us have either disappeared or gone online, and our home lives have become all-consuming. Adult kids are living back with their parents, share house occupants have no escape from one another, and all of us are discovering new intimacies \u2013 and indignities \u2013 by having to spend almost every minute in such close quarters. The inherent suffocation of a life lived almost entirely within the same four walls has given me fresh appreciation for why characters like Elizabeth Bennet and Sense and Sensibility\u2019s Marianne Dashwood find a simple walk so electrifying. It gives them freedom and perspective. \u201cAdieu to disappointment and spleen. What are men to rocks and mountains?\u201d Austen muses in Pride and Prejudice. It\u2019s also a chance to steal a private conversation. It all feels so familiar right now \u2013 at a time when a walk may be our only time outside the house, and our only legal pretext (in some states) to meet and download whatever crumbs of gossip our friends might have stored away. As my colleague Ellen Leabeater wrote last week, they\u2019re also one of the few options left for a date; a new generation of singles walking slowly, at a distance, sizing up potential objects of affection. That celibacy, or at least drastically reduced physical contact, has been forced on so many people by this pandemic gives us all a new affinity for Austen\u2019s young characters. The best adaptations thrum with romantic yearning and a sense of delayed gratification, which is to say, they are spectacularly horny. Bosoms heave, undershirts cling to sodden, hairy chests and yet characters cannot act on all that pent up thirst. In the new Emma, Mr Knightley seems to be driven almost literally mad with desire, wandering through the night after a ball where he dances with the titular heroine. You just know Mr Wickham would have sent a lot of unsolicited dick pics if he could. All that romantic turmoil and deep lust is immensely soothing to watch. \u201cFeeling horny is one of the only ways I can relieve anxiety and boredom,\u201d the illustrator Lisa Hanawalt wrote in the New Yorker this week about her desire to rewatch Pride and Prejudice, obsessing over the smallest touch. \u201cFictional romance is my escapist distraction from this tragedy and it\u2019s stupid, but I feel powerless to stop it.\u201d Relatability aside, the reliable romantic fulfilment and neat narrative closure of Austen\u2019s works is also why I keep seeking them out right now. I can\u2019t understand why people are spending nights watching Contagion or 28 Days Later \u2013 if I want horror and fear I can read the latest news about morgue trucks parked in Manhattan streets, or look at graphs depicting soaring unemployment.

Covid-19 has claimed many things in its dastardly travails \u2013 lives, jobs, a common sense of security \u2013 and it might well add Australian sport to its list of casualties. Not in the sense that it is gone. But the chronology of the way top-level sport is administered in this country will reveal it as having two identities: one pre-coronavirus, the other post-coronavirus. In this sense the crisis might in time be seen as a blessing in disguise. When the virus reached Australia and paused life as we knew it, it swept through sport in the shape of a grim reaper with scythe in one hand and spotlight in the other.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/apr/28/playing-the-waiting-game-shutdown-of-sport-is-beginning-to-test-patience\">Playing the waiting game: shutdown of sport is beginning to test patience | Jonathan Howcroft</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Spotting the difference between mismanagement and lavish government might be an exercise in futility. But if some Australian sporting organisations haven\u2019t exactly been guilty of the former, the roadkill left in the coronavirus\u2019s wake suggests the latter has been rife and unchecked in certain quarters. Until now. In the words of Robert Louis Stevenson: \u201cDon\u2019t judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant.\u201d</p> <p>For too long Australian sport has been judged, feted even, by its harvest: spiralling broadcast deals and player wages, and the subsequent benefits that high revenues bring. Now is the time to dig deeper and look at those seeds. Nobody saw Covid-19 coming, and nobody could rightly have prepared for the damage it would cause. But what the pandemic has done is lift the hood on Australian sport; the chassis might be a Bentley, but the engine powering it is somewhere between a Holden and a Victa. We thought sport in Australia was rich, but in reality it\u2019s been living pay cheque to pay cheque. And now the rainy day has arrived.</p> <p>The times of coronavirus have already claimed two high-profile scalps: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/21/todd-greenbergs-cards-were-marked-once-peter-vlandys-landed-in-rugby-league\">Todd Greenberg, the chief executive of the NRL</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/25/raelene-castle-becomes-latest-casualty-of-australias-flawed-rugby-system\">his equivalent at Rugby Australia, Raelene Castle</a>. The picture is barely brighter elsewhere. Cricket Australia, which presided over a sport that yielded almost $500m in revenue last financial year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/22/coronavirus-crisis-exposes-black-hole-in-cricket-australias-finances\">is virtually broke</a>. \u201cIt was certainly plausible that our cash and investments could track down to zero at the end of August, absolutely,\u201d CA chief executive Kevin Roberts says. Little wonder Allan Border wondered last week where all the money had gone when in 2016 Cricket Australia sat proudly on $199m in cash reserves.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/28/australia-only-cricket-series-would-turn-disaster-into-something-bold\">Australia-only cricket series would turn disaster into something bold | Adam Collins</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Football is one sport long thought to be living beyond its means. Fox Sports was already losing money hand over fist by broadcasting the A-League and W-League. But the fight FFA has on its hands to keep its domestic competitions viable has been accelerated by Covid-19, with the broadcaster recently refusing to pay a $12m rights fee instalment. Netball Australia, having watched its game grow over the past few seasons, is now counting the cost of lost sponsorship dollars and the loss of momentum that will follow. The AFL, like the rest, has laid off staff, cut player wages and pruned costs to stay afloat. But while tomorrow wouldn\u2019t be soon enough for the code to resume competition, it has assets and half a billion dollars of bank-funded credit. Where the NRL\u2019s manoeuvring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/29/what-the-restructured-nrl-season-will-look-like-with-28-may-restart-date\">to return to the playing field</a> has bordered on desperate, the AFL\u2019s relative comfort is reflected in its more measured approach.</p> <p>And the NRL is desperate. Greenberg has become the poster boy of rugby league\u2019s failure, the scapegoat the NRL had to have as a marker point to a brighter future. But while the departed chief executive\u2019s extravagant spending might have turned a pot of gold into dust, the clubs themselves must accept their share of culpability. As former Blues Origin coach Laurie Daley said: \u201cI think there has been a lot of wastage in rugby league. If you get a $10m grant, which they won\u2019t going forward, I believe if you want to sack a player or coach that should come off your grant.\u201d</p> <p>And now, as perhaps it always has been, it\u2019s all about the money. The jostling between broadcasters and ruling bodies is on in earnest. Cricket Australia is caught between the proverbial rock and hard place, arguing reasonably that if the coming summer is played in its entirety then their payments under the $1.18bn rights deal should not be reduced. But with Foxtel and Seven West Media in the grips of their own financial crises, squeezing blood out of stones won\u2019t serve the game in any shape or form. Where FFA and Rugby Australia end up on their next broadcast deals is anyone\u2019s guess. In striking a deal ahead of the 28 May resumption of the NRL season, Nine successfully argued crowd-less games were detrimental to the viewing experience. On these lines agreements will be reached.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/23/give-up-on-the-w-league-to-keep-a-league-going-thats-just-crazy\">Give up on the W-League to keep A-League going?

But where global competitions like the NBA and Premier League have managed to somewhat cushion the blow, Australia\u2019s major codes have been picked up and shaken silly by this once-in-a-lifetime event. Each will live on but under the glare of the spotlight it is all change from here. Organisations will be forced to reinvent the way they do business, to administer risk management and matters of governance as if their survival depends on it. That\u2019s because it does.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The chickens they are a-roosting. Covid-19 has claimed many things in its dastardly travails \u2013 lives, jobs, a common sense of security \u2013 and it might well add Australian sport to its list of casualties. Not in the sense that it is gone. But the chronology of the way top-level sport is administered in this country will reveal it as having two identities: one pre-coronavirus, the other post-coronavirus. In this sense the crisis might in time be seen as a blessing in disguise. When the virus reached Australia and paused life as we knew it, it swept through sport in the shape of a grim reaper with scythe in one hand and spotlight in the other. Spotting the difference between mismanagement and lavish government might be an exercise in futility. But if some Australian sporting organisations haven\u2019t exactly been guilty of the former, the roadkill left in the coronavirus\u2019s wake suggests the latter has been rife and unchecked in certain quarters. Until now. In the words of Robert Louis Stevenson: \u201cDon\u2019t judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant.\u201d For too long Australian sport has been judged, feted even, by its harvest: spiralling broadcast deals and player wages, and the subsequent benefits that high revenues bring. Now is the time to dig deeper and look at those seeds. Nobody saw Covid-19 coming, and nobody could rightly have prepared for the damage it would cause. But what the pandemic has done is lift the hood on Australian sport; the chassis might be a Bentley, but the engine powering it is somewhere between a Holden and a Victa. We thought sport in Australia was rich, but in reality it\u2019s been living pay cheque to pay cheque. And now the rainy day has arrived. The times of coronavirus have already claimed two high-profile scalps: Todd Greenberg, the chief executive of the NRL, and his equivalent at Rugby Australia, Raelene Castle. The picture is barely brighter elsewhere. Cricket Australia, which presided over a sport that yielded almost $500m in revenue last financial year, is virtually broke. \u201cIt was certainly plausible that our cash and investments could track down to zero at the end of August, absolutely,\u201d CA chief executive Kevin Roberts says. Little wonder Allan Border wondered last week where all the money had gone when in 2016 Cricket Australia sat proudly on $199m in cash reserves. Football is one sport long thought to be living beyond its means. Fox Sports was already losing money hand over fist by broadcasting the A-League and W-League. But the fight FFA has on its hands to keep its domestic competitions viable has been accelerated by Covid-19, with the broadcaster recently refusing to pay a $12m rights fee instalment. Netball Australia, having watched its game grow over the past few seasons, is now counting the cost of lost sponsorship dollars and the loss of momentum that will follow. The AFL, like the rest, has laid off staff, cut player wages and pruned costs to stay afloat. But while tomorrow wouldn\u2019t be soon enough for the code to resume competition, it has assets and half a billion dollars of bank-funded credit. Where the NRL\u2019s manoeuvring to return to the playing field has bordered on desperate, the AFL\u2019s relative comfort is reflected in its more measured approach. And the NRL is desperate. Greenberg has become the poster boy of rugby league\u2019s failure, the scapegoat the NRL had to have as a marker point to a brighter future. But while the departed chief executive\u2019s extravagant spending might have turned a pot of gold into dust, the clubs themselves must accept their share of culpability. As former Blues Origin coach Laurie Daley said: \u201cI think there has been a lot of wastage in rugby league. If you get a $10m grant, which they won\u2019t going forward, I believe if you want to sack a player or coach that should come off your grant.\u201d And now, as perhaps it always has been, it\u2019s all about the money. The jostling between broadcasters and ruling bodies is on in earnest. Cricket Australia is caught between the proverbial rock and hard place, arguing reasonably that if the coming summer is played in its entirety then their payments under the $1.18bn rights deal should not be reduced. But with Foxtel and Seven West Media in the grips of their own financial crises, squeezing blood out of stones won\u2019t serve the game in any shape or form. Where FFA and Rugby Australia end up on their next broadcast deals is anyone\u2019s guess. In striking a deal ahead of the 28 May resumption of the NRL season, Nine successfully argued crowd-less games were detrimental to the viewing experience. On these lines agreements will be reached. Australia is not alone in sport suffering as a result of Covid-19. But where global competitions like the NBA and Premier League have managed to somewhat cushion the blow, Australia\u2019s major codes have been picked up and shaken silly by this once-in-a-lifetime event. Each will live on but under the glare of the spotlight it is all change from here. Organisations will be forced to reinvent the way they do business, to administer risk management and matters of governance as if their survival depends on it. That\u2019s because it does.",

One Nepalese worker at the laundry, who declined to be named for fear he could not return to his job, told Guardian Australia the company was \u201cunable to give us work because of the downturn in the business\u201d but \u201cthey are still giving the work to people who are jobkeeper eligible\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about releasing my super at the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter that I don\u2019t know \u2026 it\u2019s hard to say how I\u2019m going to survive.\u201d With just $6,000 in superannuation and his wife a casual employee also currently out of work, the laundry worker said it would be difficult to make ends meet. \u201c[The number of] migrants and students working there, there are more than 100 affected. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping something is going to happen for us \u2013 to pay groceries, bills and rent. They\u2019re all accessing super, but many people don\u2019t have much.\u201d The CFMEU manufacturing division New South Wales district secretary, Michael Aird, said: \u201cThe treatment of these workers is disgraceful. \u201cThese are hard-working families, they have been paying their taxes for years. They deserve a fair go.\u201d Aird called on the company to reverse the stand-down and for the government to \u201cfix the faults in the jobkeeper scheme\u201d. Robson said the restructure \u201chas been driven entirely by our immediate focus to continue servicing our healthcare and remaining hospitality customers while keeping a positive mindset on how we can emerge from this downturn with our workforce largely retained\u201d. \u201cWith the assistance of the jobkeeper scheme, more than 20% of our employees remain at work, while the number of employees stood down will be constantly reducing as business conditions improve.\u201d Robson said the restructure had \u201cendeavoured to consider the well-being of everyone\u201d and noted stood-down employees continue to accrue entitlements and have other benefits. On 24 April the company told workers it was \u201cextremely saddened that the government decisions to keep us all safe have had such an unfortunate impact on your life and our business\u201d. Unions and Labor have complained that one million short-term casuals and 1.1 million temporary visa-holders are ineligible for the jobkeeper scheme, which has so far reached 3.3 million employees out of a target of 6 million due to exclusions and cashflow issues with employers expected to stump up the first month\u2019s payments. \u201cFixing the scheme is the right thing to do not just for the workers being cast aside but for our communities and for the economy,\u201d Aird said. While some states and territories have begun offering support packages to international workers and students, the federal government has offered nothing beyond early access to superannuation and relaxation of some visa conditions. Andrew Giles, Labor\u2019s multicultural affairs spokesman, said \u201cthis is exactly why we need greater support for temporary migrants trapped in Australia during this pandemic\u201d. \u201cWe can\u2019t allow people to fall through the cracks and become destitute,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe Morrison government can fix this situation with a stroke of a pen by expanding the eligibility of the jobkeeper payment. Scott Morrison must fix the gaping holes in his wage subsidy scheme, now.\u201d",

Seppelt, the director of clinical research for the Nepean hospital\u2019s department of intensive care medicine, said: \u201cThere have already been cases, for example, of clinical trials published prematurely, with profound impacts on practice, which have then been retracted after problems with the trials were identified. By sidestepping the usual scientific processes of scrutiny and review we risk making some very big mistakes.\u201d</p> \n<p>He cited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/australian-hydroxychloroquine-trials-continue-despite-studies-showing-no-benefit-to-coronavirus-patients\">hydroxychloroquine as an example, an anti-malarial drug widely hyped by some scientists</a> and the US president, Donald Trump, as being a potential treatment and preventative for Covid-19 despite a lack of evidence for it. The scientific paper that fuelled much of the initial excitement <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/hydroxychloroquine-trump-coronavirus-drug\">has since been retracted, full of spurious data</a>. Australian trials of the drug are under way, including an intensive care trial Seppelt is involved with. But he said he would never promote the drug as a treatment ahead of strong research.</p> \n<p>\u201cNone of these agents including hydroxychloroquine are magic, and many of the early reports are guilty of magical thinking,\u201d he said. \u201cBut all potential treatments need to be studied systematically and properly, in controlled trials. Anything in this space without a control group should go in the garbage bin straight way.\u201d</p> \n<p>In a well designed study, there is the experimental group who are given the drug or intervention, and the control group who are not. Ideally, neither the researcher nor patient will know whether they are being given the treatment or the placebo.</p> \n<p>This is known as a double-blind randomised control trial, and is often referred to as the gold standard of scientific study. These trials then undergo rigorous review and if they are published in a respected scientific journal are then reported on by media.</p> \n<p>But many of the hundreds of Covid-19 studies are nowhere near human trial stage. While randomised control trials aren\u2019t always possible due to ethical or practical reasons, there are still factors such as sample size and peer review that should be considered for all types of study before the results are promoted.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Email:</b>&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email?CMP=cvau_atom\">daily coronavirus newsletter</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>App:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_atom\">download it</a>&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Social:&nbsp;</b>follow us on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://facebook.com/theguardianaustralia\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardianaustralia/\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaus\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Podcast:</b>&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/full-story-coronavirus-updates/id1482061243\">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7GJod4EyoLywB1AW6zrSHh?si=LD1i9SJwRqSAcT3i4ZCI-w\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The World Health Organization [WHO] was forced to retract advice about ibuprofen after it <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30116-8/fulltext#articleInformation\">relied on a letter to a medical journal</a>, rather than a peer-reviewed study, to issue advice that Covid-19 patients should not take ibuprofen.

By sidestepping the usual scientific processes of scrutiny and review we risk making some very big mistakes.\u201d He cited hydroxychloroquine as an example, an anti-malarial drug widely hyped by some scientists and the US president, Donald Trump, as being a potential treatment and preventative for Covid-19 despite a lack of evidence for it. The scientific paper that fuelled much of the initial excitement has since been retracted, full of spurious data. Australian trials of the drug are under way, including an intensive care trial Seppelt is involved with. But he said he would never promote the drug as a treatment ahead of strong research. \u201cNone of these agents including hydroxychloroquine are magic, and many of the early reports are guilty of magical thinking,\u201d he said. \u201cBut all potential treatments need to be studied systematically and properly, in controlled trials. Anything in this space without a control group should go in the garbage bin straight way.\u201d In a well designed study, there is the experimental group who are given the drug or intervention, and the control group who are not. Ideally, neither the researcher nor patient will know whether they are being given the treatment or the placebo. This is known as a double-blind randomised control trial, and is often referred to as the gold standard of scientific study. These trials then undergo rigorous review and if they are published in a respected scientific journal are then reported on by media. But many of the hundreds of Covid-19 studies are nowhere near human trial stage. While randomised control trials aren\u2019t always possible due to ethical or practical reasons, there are still factors such as sample size and peer review that should be considered for all types of study before the results are promoted. The World Health Organization [WHO] was forced to retract advice about ibuprofen after it relied on a letter to a medical journal, rather than a peer-reviewed study, to issue advice that Covid-19 patients should not take ibuprofen. WHO backtracked on that advice one day later following pushback from scientists who said the letter lacked rigour. The associate professor of clinical pharmacy and paediatrics at the University of Southern California, Irving Steinberg, said the pace of Covid-19 science combined with panic about a lack of treatments was putting a strain on normal scientific safeguards. \u201cThere is also competition everywhere,\u201d Steinberg told Guardian Australia. \u201cEverybody is looking for the eureka moment, whether it\u2019s a research lab that\u2019s looking for more funding, whether you\u2019re a scientific publication wanting to get an edge on another publication. If people are attempting to bypass or speed up the peer review process, then we will encounter problems including some terrible science. \u201cIn the meantime the press has picked up on these studies and reports on them without context as if they\u2019ve gone through peer review.\u201d There would be a real risk to public health if the public or government relied on this science to inform decisions, he said. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re spinning out of control.\u201d",

He invited me to join the neighbourhood WhatsApp group and it\u2019s been great. Neighbours with a car picked up some furniture for me from a faraway Bunnings (I do not drive); others have done shopping runs for each other. We\u2019ll get messages when someone\u2019s strawberry patch or veggie garden is overflowing; there\u2019ll be offers of books or old furniture after a clean out. And twice a week, our house and others have been visited by \u201cthe Bread Batman\u201d: a neighbour who takes twice weekly orders for fresh, posh bread from a bakery in the nearby town of Trentham. The loaves are delivered warm to our door, but just as important is the chance to interact with another human we don\u2019t live with.</p> \n<p>And then there are the impromptu concerts. They used to happen most days at 2pm, and now they occur at random times \u2013 prompting a WhatsApp to the rest of the group: Luca is singing.</p> \n<p>We\u2019ll all stand socially distanced outside his house while he drags an amp and mic out and treats us all to a 30-minute performance of Italian classics. We dance. We sing. We no longer feel particularly isolated. <strong>\u2013 </strong><em><strong>Brigid Delaney, columnist</strong></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> \n <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-1NuzEjT0p/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "When Australia finally emerges from lockdown, what kind of world will we find ourselves in? According to these stories of neighbours pulling together in isolation \u2013 to help each other, to entertain each other, to simply share a wine together \u2013 we have good reason to hope it will be a friendlier one. If you\u2019ve got your own experience to share, please join us in the comments below. To help get you started, we asked Guardian staffers to nominate theirs. \u2018Shopping runs, home gardens and impromptu concerts\u2019 On the night before the lockdown was announced, I went to the pub and met a neighbour there for the first time. He invited me to join the neighbourhood WhatsApp group and it\u2019s been great. Neighbours with a car picked up some furniture for me from a faraway Bunnings (I do not drive); others have done shopping runs for each other. We\u2019ll get messages when someone\u2019s strawberry patch or veggie garden is overflowing; there\u2019ll be offers of books or old furniture after a clean out. And twice a week, our house and others have been visited by \u201cthe Bread Batman\u201d: a neighbour who takes twice weekly orders for fresh, posh bread from a bakery in the nearby town of Trentham. The loaves are delivered warm to our door, but just as important is the chance to interact with another human we don\u2019t live with. And then there are the impromptu concerts. They used to happen most days at 2pm, and now they occur at random times \u2013 prompting a WhatsApp to the rest of the group: Luca is singing. We\u2019ll all stand socially distanced outside his house while he drags an amp and mic out and treats us all to a 30-minute performance of Italian classics. We dance. We sing. We no longer feel particularly isolated. \u2013 Brigid Delaney, columnist \u2018On Saturday nights we chat away for hours\u2019 We share a backyard in the inner west with three men in their 20s who live underneath us in a share-household.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s been quite a six months for Boris Johnson. In rough chronological order \u2013 the prime minister\u2019s timelines have always had a tendency to get messy \u2013 he has won a general election, taken the UK out of the EU, acquired a dog, finalised a divorce, got engaged to Carrie Symonds, announced they were expecting a baby together, taken 10 days\u2019 holiday during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, been admitted to the intensive care unit at St Thomas\u2019 with Covid-19 and become a father again. Just how many children Boris now has is anyone\u2019s guess. </p> <p>Fair to say that the arrival of the latest baby boy caught everyone on the hop, as the official due date had been given as early summer less than a couple of months ago. Even Downing Street seemed wrongfooted by the news, having spent most of Tuesday afternoon and half of Wednesday morning refusing to say whether Boris was sufficiently recovered from his illness to take prime minister\u2019s questions. A straightforward, \u201cCarrie\u2019s having the baby\u201d would have been more than enough for most hacks.</p> <p>As it was, the birth took place amid levels of secrecy not even granted to the royal family.<strong> </strong>Just a short announcement that the mother and baby were both healthy and that Boris had been present throughout the birth. However, paternity leave may have to be put on hold indefinitely while the government tries to make a better fist of dealing with the pandemic than it has so far.</p> <p>So, after the obligatory expressions of good wishes towards Boris and Carrie, PMQs turned into a re-run of last week\u2019s encounter between the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, and the stand-in prime minister, Dominic Raab. With much the same result as last time. As you would expect when a top QC finds himself up against a rather out-of-his-depth country conveyancing solicitor.</p> <p>Starmer doesn\u2019t just beat his opponents with his forensic intelligence \u2013 it\u2019s always helpful to have a party leader who can hold more than one thought in his head at any one time \u2013 but with politeness. The nicer he is being to you, the more trouble you know you are in. Even a shouty, ranty Keir might have been difficult for Raab to see off, given the government\u2019s record on handling the coronavirus.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s been quite a six months for Boris Johnson. In rough chronological order \u2013 the prime minister\u2019s timelines have always had a tendency to get messy \u2013 he has won a general election, taken the UK out of the EU, acquired a dog, finalised a divorce, got engaged to Carrie Symonds, announced they were expecting a baby together, taken 10 days\u2019 holiday during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, been admitted to the intensive care unit at St Thomas\u2019 with Covid-19 and become a father again. Just how many children Boris now has is anyone\u2019s guess. Fair to say that the arrival of the latest baby boy caught everyone on the hop, as the official due date had been given as early summer less than a couple of months ago. Even Downing Street seemed wrongfooted by the news, having spent most of Tuesday afternoon and half of Wednesday morning refusing to say whether Boris was sufficiently recovered from his illness to take prime minister\u2019s questions. A straightforward, \u201cCarrie\u2019s having the baby\u201d would have been more than enough for most hacks. As it was, the birth took place amid levels of secrecy not even granted to the royal family. Just a short announcement that the mother and baby were both healthy and that Boris had been present throughout the birth. However, paternity leave may have to be put on hold indefinitely while the government tries to make a better fist of dealing with the pandemic than it has so far. So, after the obligatory expressions of good wishes towards Boris and Carrie, PMQs turned into a re-run of last week\u2019s encounter between the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, and the stand-in prime minister, Dominic Raab. With much the same result as last time. As you would expect when a top QC finds himself up against a rather out-of-his-depth country conveyancing solicitor. Starmer doesn\u2019t just beat his opponents with his forensic intelligence \u2013 it\u2019s always helpful to have a party leader who can hold more than one thought in his head at any one time \u2013 but with politeness. The nicer he is being to you, the more trouble you know you are in. Even a shouty, ranty Keir might have been difficult for Raab to see off, given the government\u2019s record on handling the coronavirus. But against a Keir who is the epitome of icy calm with the total mastery of his brief, he had no chance. First up, Dom was asked to explain Boris\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cour apparent success\u201d in his return to Downing Street statement on Monday. Our mortality rates had already cruised past the chief scientific adviser\u2019s hoped-for maximum of 20,000 deaths and the UK was still in lockdown from the first wave of the disease. By what criteria could that be judged an apparent success? A bead of sweat formed on Raab\u2019s forehead. It was bad enough having to deal with his own fuck-ups, let alone those made by his boss. So he just mumbled something about how things could have been worse \u2013 hell, we could all have died \u2013 and then made the classic error of insisting it was far too early to make international comparisons. If the UK had the death rates per head of population of Germany and South Korea we would be shouting about it from the rooftops on a daily basis. And rightly so. From there on, Dom was firmly on the back foot as time and again Keir killed him with kindness. Starmer so, so wanted to be supportive in a time of crisis but he was just struggling with one or two little things. Like why the differential between testing capacity and demand, when there so clearly was excess demand. No, he wasn\u2019t trying to score political points, he was merely echoing the concerns of the head of the Royal College of Physicians. And while he had Raab\u2019s attention, could he just follow the lead of almost every other country and give a hint \u2013 a little hintlet even \u2013 of what the government\u2019s exit strategy might be? Dom couldn\u2019t. This was all well above his pay grade. He shouldn\u2019t be carrying the can for all this. Next time Boris had a child someone else could take over.

This is both an infringement on liberty and an insult against a massive group of able-bodied, hard-working people who are making important contributions to society.

Usually because loss of their independence and premature admission to a care home for the rest of their life was not their choice. Or because funding to local authorities or places were just not available. Or there was dispute about a person\u2019s health condition.</p> <p>Come Covid-19, everything changes. Funding becomes instantly available. Everyone possible must be discharged as quickly as possible, with or without being tested for Covid-19 and the results known. Care homes are the obvious instant \u201csolution\u201d. So what happens? Discharged older people infect inadequately protected care home staff and existing residents. Both die.</p> <p>Was this not foreseeable? Did it not matter?

Usually because loss of their independence and premature admission to a care home for the rest of their life was not their choice. Or because funding to local authorities or places were just not available. Or there was dispute about a person\u2019s health condition. Come Covid-19, everything changes. Funding becomes instantly available. Everyone possible must be discharged as quickly as possible, with or without being tested for Covid-19 and the results known. Care homes are the obvious instant \u201csolution\u201d. So what happens? Discharged older people infect inadequately protected care home staff and existing residents. Both die. Was this not foreseeable? Did it not matter? Indeed, might it have been a policy consequence of a government interested only in avoiding NHS political embarrassment? Brian Parrott Former director of social services, Ipswich, Suffolk \u2022 I am 73. Until March, I had a business (paying tax on profits), now closed. I was active in my community. I cared for grandchildren. I am not unusual among my age group. Comfortable retirement at 55 or 60 is long gone. Policy has forced a \u201cpost-retirement\u201d age group to keep working, willing or not. Are we now to be viewed as a danger to society, our very existence a drag on the NHS? To be told to stay out of public view? Governments long ago washed their hands of citizens needing care due to disability, chronic illness or age-related decline. Is this group now widened to over all over-70s, or perhaps even over-65s (Older people could face extended coronavirus lockdown, Lords hears, 23 April)? This is not about protecting the over-70s. It is discarding us as useless and troublesome because we might need more NHS support than younger people. I for one would not obey any recommendation or legal injunction to stay indoors 24 hours a day. I will continue to use my judgment and intelligence \u2013 qualities which our prime minister so patently lacked in going to an international rugby match on 7 March and boasting of shaking hands at a coronavirus hospital a few days before.

      "body": "<p>With no live sport to watch or play, exercise has never been more precious. Those minutes of freedom, an uncurling away from bad posture on the sofa, lifting the spirits and boosting the heart rate. But, as you slurp your morning lungfuls of air, have your noticed a change? Think the sky has looked a more perfect cornflower, noticed the stars shining a little brighter?</p> <p>You would be right on all three, the falling levels of air pollution a tiny silver lining to our dreadful predicament. Yet air pollution also has a more sinister role in the coronavirus story.</p> <p>Some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/21/preliminary-study-links-air-pollution-to-coronavirus-deaths-in-england\" title=\"\">preliminary studies</a> in the US seem to suggest a link between a high death rate and high levels of pollution (a similar link was found during the Sars outbreak in 2003), with Covid-19 able to attach itself to particulate pollution. So improving air quality might be one of the ways out of this crisis, as well as helping the 4.2 million people who die annually from your bog\u2011standard air pollution. But where does sport fit in?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/10/cricket-climate-crisis\">The Spin | Cricket feels heat as climate crisis creates corridor of uncertainty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We know athletes are particularly at risk from poor air quality because of their higher respiratory rates during exercise \u2013 children in particular. And around the world athletes have started to complain: Novak Djokovic, who criticised pollution levels in China; the New South Wales spinner Steve O\u2019Keefe, who described the air quality during a Sheffield Shield game as fires burned outside Sydney as like \u201csmoking 80 cigarettes a day\u201d; the tennis player Dalila Jakupovic, who pulled out of her Australian Open game because she couldn\u2019t breathe.</p> <p>Not only that, but pollution also seems to impede performance. A fascinating <a href=\"https://sustainabilityreport.com/2020/04/23/air-pollution-tackling-sports-invisible-threat/\" title=\"\">essay by Matthew Campelli in the Sustainability Report</a> this week examines just that, revealing that early trials seem to show air pollution reducing the productivity rates of German footballers and impeding decision-making in chess players and baseball umpires.</p> <p>This dovetails alarmingly with the <a href=\"https://basis.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Hit-for-Six-The-Impact-of-Climate-Change-on-Cricket.pdf\" title=\"\">Hit for Six report</a> published last September, which described the effects of extreme heat not only on cricketers\u2019 ability to function physically but also their capacity, and umpires\u2019 capacity, to make decisions.</p> <p>Throw in the bushfires in Australia last year which threatened the cricket season, the cancellation of matches in the path of a super typhoon during the Rugby World Cup in Japan, cricketers vomiting on the pitch because of air pollution in Delhi, cricket stadiums being destroyed by hurricanes in the West Indies, the ski season literally melting away and rising sea levels threatening coastal infrastructure, and the picture of sport in a climate emergency starts to look less than rosy.</p> <p>Add our current crisis, with normal sporting relations unlikely to restart any time soon, and sport is looking at an extremely complicated situation. Maybe the Premier League can restart in a couple of months, but what about European football? Players may get special passports which mean they avoid quarantine at airports, but what about away supporters? In Japan, meanwhile, nervous voices are already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/29/tokyo-olympics-not-reliant-on-covid-19-vaccine-senior-ioc-member\" title=\"\">expressing doubt over the Tokyo Olympics</a> mark two, pencilled in for the summer of 2021.</p> <p>An existential problem then, and one that coincides with an enforced period of contemplation. Much like the rest of the world, sport has the opportunity to hit the reset button. It is going to have to work within a smaller framework, with a much emptier purse, in a world where air travel is expensive, and perceived as dangerous to human health as well as the planet, as the earth grows ever warmer \u2013 with 2020 already set to be the hottest year yet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26041a775be684677e6a615ba7ab2f0aed4ffbc9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26041a775be684677e6a615ba7ab2f0aed4ffbc9/0_371_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Novak Djokovic said he had experienced air quality issues in tournaments in China\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Novak Djokovic said he had experienced air quality issues in tournaments in China.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: TPN/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some might argue that with no gate receipts, no bar takings and a fixture list with more holes than games, sport is in no place to be gazing at its environmental soul. But if not now, when?</p> <p>On Wednesday the sports sector held its own version of the Petersberg climate dialogue, a Zoom meeting organised by Basis (the <a href=\"https://basis.org.uk/\" title=\"\">British Association for Sustainable Sport</a>) with the idea of bringing the sector together. The idea is to hold a similar meeting weekly for the foreseeable future, to try to hammer out a way for sport to move forward.</p> <p>Russell Seymour, chief executive of Basis, says: \u201cThis is not how we want to live our lives, locked down, insular.

      "bodyText": "With no live sport to watch or play, exercise has never been more precious. Those minutes of freedom, an uncurling away from bad posture on the sofa, lifting the spirits and boosting the heart rate. But, as you slurp your morning lungfuls of air, have your noticed a change? Think the sky has looked a more perfect cornflower, noticed the stars shining a little brighter? You would be right on all three, the falling levels of air pollution a tiny silver lining to our dreadful predicament. Yet air pollution also has a more sinister role in the coronavirus story. Some preliminary studies in the US seem to suggest a link between a high death rate and high levels of pollution (a similar link was found during the Sars outbreak in 2003), with Covid-19 able to attach itself to particulate pollution. So improving air quality might be one of the ways out of this crisis, as well as helping the 4.2 million people who die annually from your bog\u2011standard air pollution. But where does sport fit in? We know athletes are particularly at risk from poor air quality because of their higher respiratory rates during exercise \u2013 children in particular. And around the world athletes have started to complain: Novak Djokovic, who criticised pollution levels in China; the New South Wales spinner Steve O\u2019Keefe, who described the air quality during a Sheffield Shield game as fires burned outside Sydney as like \u201csmoking 80 cigarettes a day\u201d; the tennis player Dalila Jakupovic, who pulled out of her Australian Open game because she couldn\u2019t breathe. Not only that, but pollution also seems to impede performance. A fascinating essay by Matthew Campelli in the Sustainability Report this week examines just that, revealing that early trials seem to show air pollution reducing the productivity rates of German footballers and impeding decision-making in chess players and baseball umpires. This dovetails alarmingly with the Hit for Six report published last September, which described the effects of extreme heat not only on cricketers\u2019 ability to function physically but also their capacity, and umpires\u2019 capacity, to make decisions. Throw in the bushfires in Australia last year which threatened the cricket season, the cancellation of matches in the path of a super typhoon during the Rugby World Cup in Japan, cricketers vomiting on the pitch because of air pollution in Delhi, cricket stadiums being destroyed by hurricanes in the West Indies, the ski season literally melting away and rising sea levels threatening coastal infrastructure, and the picture of sport in a climate emergency starts to look less than rosy. Add our current crisis, with normal sporting relations unlikely to restart any time soon, and sport is looking at an extremely complicated situation. Maybe the Premier League can restart in a couple of months, but what about European football? Players may get special passports which mean they avoid quarantine at airports, but what about away supporters? In Japan, meanwhile, nervous voices are already expressing doubt over the Tokyo Olympics mark two, pencilled in for the summer of 2021. An existential problem then, and one that coincides with an enforced period of contemplation. Much like the rest of the world, sport has the opportunity to hit the reset button. It is going to have to work within a smaller framework, with a much emptier purse, in a world where air travel is expensive, and perceived as dangerous to human health as well as the planet, as the earth grows ever warmer \u2013 with 2020 already set to be the hottest year yet. Some might argue that with no gate receipts, no bar takings and a fixture list with more holes than games, sport is in no place to be gazing at its environmental soul. But if not now, when? On Wednesday the sports sector held its own version of the Petersberg climate dialogue, a Zoom meeting organised by Basis (the British Association for Sustainable Sport) with the idea of bringing the sector together. The idea is to hold a similar meeting weekly for the foreseeable future, to try to hammer out a way for sport to move forward. Russell Seymour, chief executive of Basis, says: \u201cThis is not how we want to live our lives, locked down, insular. But this is the moment, the opportunity for sport to reflect and decide to rebuild its operations in a more environmentally sustainable way. After the economic crash in 2008 people said: \u2018We clearly have to make a change, the current way we are living our lives isn\u2019t working.\u2019 Then global emissions jumped by 6% the following year. The current crisis has shown us that making changes can have a big impact and very quickly.\u201d This is sport\u2019s chance to evaluate properly its current plight \u2013 as some have already started to do. To embrace localism. Accept that less is more. Ask itself why. Why do the England cricket teams have to tour three countries in a winter? Why is the ICC planning to host T20 World Cups in consecutive years? Why on earth hold football\u2019s European Championship across 12 host cities?

It was the first time the daily death toll figures took into account deaths in care homes and the community as well as those in hospitals between 2 March and 28 April. It marked an increase of 3,811 on the previous figure. </li> \n   <li><strong>Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds announced the birth of a healthy baby boy </strong>at a London hospital on Wednesday morning. With offers of congratulations coming in from across the political spectrum and from world leaders, Downing Street confirmed the PM will take paternity leave later in the year, rather than now. He spoke with the Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer about the coronavirus response this afternoon. No 10 declined to say whether the baby was born prematurely nor to disclose any further details about the birth.</li> \n   <li><strong>The UK will fall behind other countries if it doesn\u2019t publish an exit plan soon</strong>, Sir Keir Starmer told Dominic Raab during PMQs. Starmer pointed to countries including France, Germany, New Zealand, Scotland and Wales, which deal with issues including reopening schools and some businesses. Starmer said that \u201cdelay risks not only falling behind other countries, but also the successful four-nation approach so far\u201d. <br></li> \n   <li><strong>Schools are expected to reopen \u201cin a phased manner\u201d</strong>, Gavin Williamson said. The education secretary said he could not give a date but told MPs that Sage is looking at how a phased reopening of schools could work in line with the scientific advice.</li> \n   <li><strong>More migrant health and care workers on the frontline will be automatically granted free visa extensions</strong>, the Home Office confirmed. As well as doctors, nurses and paramedics, the extension will now apply to midwives, radiographers, social workers and pharmacists. Family members and dependents of healthcare workers who die as a result of contracting the virus will also be offered immediate indefinite leave to remain.</li> \n   <li><strong>Air passenger numbers are down 99% compared with a year ago</strong>, the home secretary said. Priti Patel told MPs that testing was not taking place at the border, a decision based on advice from Sage, which maintained such measures would have \u201ca negligible impact\u201d. </li> \n   <li><strong>And the government insisted it was still aiming to achieve 100,000 tests per day</strong> by the end of Thursday (tomorrow). The PM\u2019s spokesman told the lobby briefing that<strong> </strong>43,563 coronavirus tests were provided in the 24 hours to 9am yesterday and that there was capacity for 73,400 tests to be carried out.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>As ever, thank you to everybody who got in touch throughout the day with a stories and suggestions, and to all of you reading along. </p> \n  <p>If you would like to continue to follow the Guardian\u2019s coverage of the pandemic, head over to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/29/coronavirus-live-news-brazil-deaths-exceed-known-china-toll-as-us-infections-pass-1-million\">global live blog</a> for the worldwide picture.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/29/coronavirus-live-news-brazil-deaths-exceed-known-china-toll-as-us-infections-pass-1-million\">Coronavirus live news: Paris 'exiles' told to return when lockdown ends, as Sweden passes 20,000 confirmed cases</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea9b3ff8f0882b206dcf7bb\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/andrewsparrow\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-29T17:34:10.686Z\">6.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Dominic Raab's press conference - Summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here are the main points from <strong>Dominic Raab</strong>\u2019s press conference.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, announced that the new system being used to produce headline coronavirus death figures for the UK showed an increase of 3,811 on the previous figure.</strong> That is because the government previously only announced figures for people who had died in hospital having tested positive for coronavirus. Now the figures include people who have died in any setting having tested positive for coronavirus. Today\u2019s figure is 26,097. The government dashboard, with the details, is <a href=\"https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/\">here.</a> But there are still good grounds for thinking that this figure massively understates the true extent of coronavirus deaths, because so many people are dying without being tested. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/29/uk-coronavirus-live-priti-patel-questions-response-covid-19-crisis-pmqs-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ea9b2038f0882b206dcf7a8#block-5ea9b2038f0882b206dcf7a8\">6.02pm.)</a> Announcing the figures Raab said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>From today, we are moving to an improved daily reporting system for deaths so that deaths in all settings are included wherever the individual has tested positive for Covid-19, rather than just those in hospitals.</p> \n   <p>Those figures show that up to yesterday on the new measure we have recorded an additional 3,811 deaths in total and I think it is just important to say that those additional deaths were spread over the period for March 2 to April 28 so they don\u2019t represent a sudden surge in the number of deaths.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Commenting on the new figures,<strong> Prof Yvonne Doyle</strong>, medical director at NHS England said the new overall figure was 20% higher than the previous headline total. She said it was \u201cgood news\u201d that a more comprehensive picture was now available.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Doyle said traffic levels on UK roads are now at their highest level since the coronavirus lockdown was introduced. </strong>The number of vehicles was 56% lower than in early February, but up three percentage points compared with the previous Monday. Presenting a slide with the data, Doyle said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There has been an uptick in motor vehicles, and the message here really is that we are still passing through this peak. This use of motor vehicles is the highest working day use since March 23.</p> \n   <p>We really have to be vigilant. Most people are making huge efforts to stay at home and save lives. This is slightly worrying, so please do stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives.

Gove is one of the ministers who attends the daily C-19 meeting in Downing Street, which is referred to by insiders as the coronavirus \u201cwar cabinet\u201d, and he chairs<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-government-structures-to-coordinate-response-to-coronavirus\"> a coronavirus implementation committee</a> in charge of \u201cpreparedness\u201d across much of the public sector and critical national infrastructure, excluding the NHS.</p> \n  <p>In an <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/28/exclusive-ministers-warned-nhs-could-not-cope-pandemic-three/\">exclusive report</a> on Exercise Cygnus published at the end of March, the Sunday Telegraph said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The NHS failed a major cross-government test of its ability to handle a severe pandemic but the \u201cterrifying\u201d results were kept secret from the public.</p> \n   <p>Ministers were informed three years ago that Britain would be quickly overwhelmed by a severe outbreak amid a shortage of critical care beds, morgue capacity and personal protective equipment (PPE), an investigation has discovered ... </p> \n   <p>Despite the failings exposed by Cygnus, the government never changed its strategic roadmap for a future pandemic, with the last update carried out in 2014. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Summarising <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/28/exercise-cygnus-uncovered-pandemic-warnings-buried-government/\">the conclusions from the exercise </a>in the Sunday Telegraph, <strong>Paul Nuki </strong>and <strong>Bill Gardner</strong> said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>But it was not the pandemic itself that was causing those gathered in Whitehall to grimace but the nation\u2019s woeful preparation. The peak of the epidemic had not yet arrived but local resilience forums, hospitals and mortuaries across the country were already being overwhelmed. </p> \n   <p>There was not enough personal protective equipment (PPE) for the nation\u2019s doctors and nurses. The NHS was about to \u201cfall over\u201d due to a shortage of ventilators and critical care beds. Morgues were set to overflow, and it had become terrifyingly evident that the government\u2019s emergency messaging was not getting traction with the public.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Gove told the committee he had read the report. But, when pressed by the committee\u2019s chairman <strong>William Wragg</strong> as to when he had read it, he said last week.</p> \n  <p>When Wragg expressed surprise about this, Gove said: \u201cSome of the product that flowed from that report I had read beforehand.\u201d Asked what he was referring to, Gove said he was referring to recommendations relating to the need for emergency legislation, to the risk of the NHS being overwhelmed and to the need to de-prioritise non-urgent operations.</p> \n  <p>Gove said the report had led to the development of an influenza pandemic stockpile. But Exercise Cygnus specifically covered a flu pandemic, and Gove said the fact that coronavirus was a different sort of virus meant that there was a need for \u201ca recalibration of our approach towards PPE [personal protective equipment]\u201d.

It was as if the two protagonists were trying to outbid each other in evidence-based discourse and common sensical decency. It is very likely to be the case that debates in cabinet ministerial committees get more unpleasant and abrasive than what we witnessed at PMQs today. If Raab was getting rattled, he only really let it show right at the end, when he sought to lecture Starmer (mildly) on being opportunistic. Ironically, this was probably the point at which Raab\u2019s argument - that an \u201cexit strategy\u201d of the kind published by the Scottish government at all isn\u2019t really an exit strategy, because it does not commit to policy - was at its strongest. Raab did not really have much of an answer to Starmer\u2019s question earlier about how the PPE problems were going to be fixed. Starmer probably had the better of the exchanges, although it did not sound like the convention PMQs \u201cwin\u201d, not least because his performance included gushing praise for the government\u2019s performance on boosting NHS capacity. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/29/uk-coronavirus-live-priti-patel-questions-response-covid-19-crisis-pmqs-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ea963518f08db9df42df808#block-5ea963518f08db9df42df808\">12.24pm.)</a></p> \n  <p>This might not be what people are used to at PMQs, but there is probably method in Starmer\u2019s approach. It was strongly reminiscent of what <strong>Tony Blair</strong> wrote about how to succeed at PMQs in his memoirs. Blair wrote:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I always tried to make [what he said at PMQs] telling. The aim was to get the non-politician nodding. I would wonder not what appealed to a Labour party conference in full throttle, but what would appeal to my old mates at the Bar, who wanted a reasonable case to be made; and who, if it were made, would rally ...</p> \n   <p>Yes, it\u2019s not like calling your opponent a liar, or a fraud, or a villain or a hypocrite, but the middle-ground floating voters kind of shrugs their shoulders at those claims. They don\u2019t chime. They\u2019re too over the top, too heavy, and they represent an insult, not an argument. Whereas the lesser charge, because it\u2019s more accurate and precisely because it\u2019s low-key, can stick.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea96f578f08db9df42df8b4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-29T12:18:00.535Z\">1.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Starmer says UK risks 'falling behind' if government does not publish exit plan</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here are quote from the final exchanges at PMQs between <strong>Dominic Raab</strong> and <strong>Sir Keir Starmer</strong>, where Starmer was claiming the UK would fall behind other countries if it did not publish an exit plan soon. Starmer said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>France, Germany, Spain, Belgium, New Zealand, Australia, Scotland and Wales have all published exit plans of one sort or another. [Raab] said, \u2018well what are the proposals, what should they cover?\u2019. If you look at those plans, as he\u2019s done and I\u2019ve done, it\u2019s clear that there are common issues such as schools reopening, business sectors reopening.</p> \n   <p>These are the issues that, if he wants me to put them on the table, I absolutely will.</p> \n   <p>Delay risks not only falling behind other countries, but also the successful four-nation approach so far.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Raab said it would be wrong to publish an exit plan before the scientific advice said it was safe to start relaxing the lockdown. And he said the Scottish government had not published one. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The Scottish government has not set out an exit strategy.

      "bodyText": "A total of 26,097 patients had died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK as of 5pm on Tuesday, Public Health England said. It was the first time the daily death toll figures took into account deaths in care homes and the community as well as those in hospitals between 2 March and 28 April. It marked an increase of 3,811 on the previous figure. Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds announced the birth of a healthy baby boy at a London hospital on Wednesday morning. With offers of congratulations coming in from across the political spectrum and from world leaders, Downing Street confirmed the PM will take paternity leave later in the year, rather than now. He spoke with the Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer about the coronavirus response this afternoon. No 10 declined to say whether the baby was born prematurely nor to disclose any further details about the birth. The UK will fall behind other countries if it doesn\u2019t publish an exit plan soon, Sir Keir Starmer told Dominic Raab during PMQs. Starmer pointed to countries including France, Germany, New Zealand, Scotland and Wales, which deal with issues including reopening schools and some businesses. Starmer said that \u201cdelay risks not only falling behind other countries, but also the successful four-nation approach so far\u201d. Schools are expected to reopen \u201cin a phased manner\u201d, Gavin Williamson said. The education secretary said he could not give a date but told MPs that Sage is looking at how a phased reopening of schools could work in line with the scientific advice. More migrant health and care workers on the frontline will be automatically granted free visa extensions, the Home Office confirmed. As well as doctors, nurses and paramedics, the extension will now apply to midwives, radiographers, social workers and pharmacists. Family members and dependents of healthcare workers who die as a result of contracting the virus will also be offered immediate indefinite leave to remain. Air passenger numbers are down 99% compared with a year ago, the home secretary said. Priti Patel told MPs that testing was not taking place at the border, a decision based on advice from Sage, which maintained such measures would have \u201ca negligible impact\u201d. And the government insisted it was still aiming to achieve 100,000 tests per day by the end of Thursday (tomorrow). The PM\u2019s spokesman told the lobby briefing that 43,563 coronavirus tests were provided in the 24 hours to 9am yesterday and that there was capacity for 73,400 tests to be carried out. As ever, thank you to everybody who got in touch throughout the day with a stories and suggestions, and to all of you reading along. If you would like to continue to follow the Guardian\u2019s coverage of the pandemic, head over to the global live blog for the worldwide picture. Here are the main points from Dominic Raab\u2019s press conference. Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, announced that the new system being used to produce headline coronavirus death figures for the UK showed an increase of 3,811 on the previous figure. That is because the government previously only announced figures for people who had died in hospital having tested positive for coronavirus. Now the figures include people who have died in any setting having tested positive for coronavirus. Today\u2019s figure is 26,097. The government dashboard, with the details, is here. But there are still good grounds for thinking that this figure massively understates the true extent of coronavirus deaths, because so many people are dying without being tested. (See 6.02pm.) Announcing the figures Raab said: From today, we are moving to an improved daily reporting system for deaths so that deaths in all settings are included wherever the individual has tested positive for Covid-19, rather than just those in hospitals. Those figures show that up to yesterday on the new measure we have recorded an additional 3,811 deaths in total and I think it is just important to say that those additional deaths were spread over the period for March 2 to April 28 so they don\u2019t represent a sudden surge in the number of deaths. Commenting on the new figures, Prof Yvonne Doyle, medical director at NHS England said the new overall figure was 20% higher than the previous headline total. She said it was \u201cgood news\u201d that a more comprehensive picture was now available. Doyle said traffic levels on UK roads are now at their highest level since the coronavirus lockdown was introduced. The number of vehicles was 56% lower than in early February, but up three percentage points compared with the previous Monday. Presenting a slide with the data, Doyle said: There has been an uptick in motor vehicles, and the message here really is that we are still passing through this peak. This use of motor vehicles is the highest working day use since March 23. We really have to be vigilant. Most people are making huge efforts to stay at home and save lives. This is slightly worrying, so please do stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives. Go out for the necessities. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, played down the prospect of social distancing measures being relaxed for outdoor activities like park runs, going to the beach or drinking in a beer garden. He said the virus was less likely to spreak outdoors. But he went on: These are complex and, at various different points, they might involve a congregation of individuals and one has to be very painstaking and very careful about thinking through some of these before we make the wrong move to relax measures. We have to be extremely sure-footed and extremely painstaking about this. This virus will absolutely come back. This is with us for quite some time, potentially for as long as until we get a vaccine, so from that perspective we have to be really careful and really sure-footed and I\u2019m not going to suggest for a moment that any of this should be rushed. Van-Tam said the government would have to be \u201cvery careful indeed\u201d about relaxing social distancing measures for schools. Asked if it would be possible to ensure pupils stay two metres apart, he said: I think that would be very difficult in a classroom of four or five-year-olds - I think that would be very tricky. I think we have to think through all those measures and how they might work. Raab said the government was considering the case for using Nightingale hospitals, which are mostly empty, to house care home residents who might be at risk because of coronavirus outbreaks in their homes. When a member of the public (one of two using the new slots available for non-journalistic questions) asked if this was an option, Raab replied: It is something that has been under constant discussion.It is certainly something that remains under review. Responding to the latest figures showing that more than 26,000 people have died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community across the UK after testing positive for Covid-19, Kate Allen, the director of Amnesty UK, said: These harrowing figures raise serious concerns over the failure of our government to effectively tackle the coronavirus pandemic. These figures are coming out far too late - it is three months since the first confirmed coronavirus case in the UK and public trust in the way the government has handled the provision of PPE remains low with the government\u2019s transparency still coming into question. We need to see an urgent escalation in protective equipment, testing and training for those on the frontline of this crisis. Any delay will only cost more lives. In addition, a poll of 2,000 people conducted by Opinium for Amnesty between 24-27 April found that: Two in three people in the UK believe the government has performed poorly in providing PPE for healthcare workers (60%) and for key workers (62%). And 78% felt that the government had not been fully transparent in its communication with the public so far with over a third (36%) saying the government has tended not to be or never been transparent in relation to its handling of the pandemic. Amnesty has been campaigning for the UK government to ensure the most vulnerable are adequately protected during the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 a petition to the UK government has now reached over 20,000 signatures. Wetherspoon\u2019s is starting to plan for a reopening of its pubs and hotels \u201cin or around June\u201d, the company has claimed, despite the UK remaining in government-mandated lockdown and no go-ahead as yet for easing physical distancing measures. In a statement, the business said: The company is likely to make some changes to its operating model, assuming increased social distancing, and anticipates a gradual recovery in customer numbers. Wetherspoon pubs are substantially larger than average, and most have outside facilities. The company believes these factors are likely to assist if social distancing measures apply. The pub chain\u2019s boss Tim Martin was forced to close all 900 pubs and furlough 40,000 workers before Britain went on lockdown on 23 March. But he sparked controversy and prompted calls for a boycott of the chain when he claimed closing pubs was \u201cover the top\u201d and that supermarkets posed a bigger risk of spreading coronavirus than bars. He later refused to pay workers until he received the appropriate government bailout and sparked further anger and accusations of hypocrisy when he told his workers to get jobs at Tesco instead. The founder said on Wednesday he will take a 50% voluntary pay cut, along with chief executive John Hutson, other directors have agreed to similar cuts. Here is the government\u2019s new dashboard, with the latest UK coronavirus death figures. Today it gives the total death toll as 26,097. However, it is important to stress that this count only includes deaths of people who tested positive for coronavirus. There will be many people who have died from coronavirus without having had a positive test. Yesterday one analysis, based on excess death figures, put the likely number of people to have died either directly or indirectly as a result of coronavirus at more than 45,000. Q: [From Bob] As there seems to be space in the Nightingale hospitals, why can\u2019t you put people from care homes there to keep them safe? Raab says the Nightingale hospitals are not just there for current cases. They need to be available for the future. He says their use is being kept under review. Doyle says the Nightingale hospitals are adaptable. They can be used in different ways. This would be one option. But you would have to consider whether this was a suitable option for frail hospitals. And that\u2019s it. The press conference is over. Raab now takes two questions from members of the public. He reads out the first: Why has the government not introduced quarantine for people arriving in the UK? Raab says the government has looked at this, but the scientific evidence so far has been that this would make very little difference. But it is being kept under review, he says. Doyle says this is being looked at as the situation changes. Q: How will social distancing work in a school setting? Will home education have to continue into next year? Van-Tam says he has two sons at home, aged 11 and 12. He knows the stress this is causing. But he is clear the closing schools was the right thing to do. There are multiple combinations about what you might do next. But he says he won\u2019t go into it, because the science is not settled yet. Q: Is it possible for groups of young people to stay two metres apart? Van-Tams says he thinks that would be very difficult. Q: There are still Britons stuck in India, particularly from the West Midlands. Will you increase the number of repatriation flights? Raab says the government has already chartered 58 flights, returning more than 12,000 people. More are planned, to get another 7,000 Britons home, he says. Q: Will the government consider pausing NRPF (no recourse to public funds) status for those migrants to whom it applies during the crisis? Raab says Priti Patel, the home secretary, is looking at this carefully. Q: If there had been more testing earlier, could some of these deaths have been avoided? Raab says there are always things to learn in a situation like this. But the government has acted on the basis of the best medical advice, he says. Doyle says there have always been interventions where there have been outbreaks in care homes. This disease predominantly affects the over-75s, she says. She says some older people might have died before they could even be tested. She says they are now looking at how the virus moves in a home. Genomics is providing good insights, she says. She says it is impossible to say if testing would have made a huge difference. Q: [From the Daily Mail] How helpful are private initiatives like the Daily Mail\u2019s Mail Force airlift? Raab says this has been fantastic. Q: How much evidence is there that the summer weather helps combat the virus? Van-Tam says being outdoors helps. He says the virus spreads less outside. In the summer people leave the doors and windows open, he says. Q: So is there some hope for garden centres, park runs, going to the beach and even pub gardens being allowed? Van-Tam says Sage is keeping all this evidence under review. He says these are complex decisions. These events could involve people congregating. They have to be extremely sure-footed, he says. This virus will be with us for quite some time. He says he does not want to suggest any of these decisions should be rushed. Q: How many of the five tests are you passing? Raab says he is going to wait until he gets advice from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) on this in early May. There are some encouraging signs, he says. But he will wait for the Sage evidence. Q: But the NHS has not been overwhelmed. Can\u2019t you at least say you pass test one? Raab says the NHS has not been overrun. But he says they need to be sure that, going ahead, that will remain the case. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, says the new death figures out today are an improvement. But ultimately the government will be able to look at excess death figures, which show all the excess deaths about average. There is a standardised European way of doing this, he says. (That might be a reference to the work done by EuroMOMO.) He says these figures will show, not just Covid-19 deaths, but deaths that might have occurred as a consequence of the crisis. I\u2019ve found the global deaths per head of population chart now, and I\u2019ve added it to the post at 5.27pm. You may need to refresh the page to get it to show up. Q: Hospices are being denies access to government stocks of PPE. They are having to buy their own supplies at inflated prices. They have told us [ITV] they could run out in days. Why aren\u2019t they getting access to government supplies? Raab says the government has been guided by the NHS as to where the shortfalls are. Doyle says it is useful to know. There are hotlines available for hospices that need PPE. Prof Yvonne Doyle, medical director at NHS England, is now presenting the daily slides. And here are the figures for all coronavirus deaths, based on day of death. Here is the global deaths comparison chart. Doyle says this chart is based on overall deaths. She ends with a slide showing global deaths on a country by country basis, measured according to deaths per head of population. In the first statement since changing the way figures are produced (see 5.02pm), Public Health England said the total number of deaths was around 17% higher than previous data showed. The body said it was reporting an additional 3,811 deaths since the start of the outbreak. A PHE spokesman said: Of these, around 70% were outside hospital settings and around 30% were in hospital. The additional hospital deaths have been identified through PHE\u2019s laboratory system and were not reported to NHSE. The latest figures have been revised retrospectively by PHE since the first coronavirus-related death to include additional data sources, reaching a total number of deaths in the UK of 26,097 between March 2 and April 28, including 765 deaths reported in the 24 hours to 5pm on Tuesday. Raab summarises the five tests that will have to be met before the lockdown can be eased. The fifth test is probably the most important, he says. He says in Germany there has been a rise in coronavirus cases since the lockdown was eased. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, is speaking at the daily press conference. He says from today the government is reporting coronavirus deaths in all settings, not just in hospitals. These figures cover people who have tested positive for coronavirus, he says. He says the new figures is 3,811 deaths more than the figure available yesterday. But he says this does not mean there has been a surge in deaths. He says the new deaths occurred between 2 March and 28 April. The increase on yesterday is 765, he says. A total of 26,097 patients had died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK as of 5pm on Tuesday, Public Health England said. In the latest episode of the Politics Weekly podcast, Jonathan Freedland and Rowena Mason break down another busy week in Westminster. Jonathan also talks to the new shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, and Jamie Grierson explains what\u2019s next for Priti Patel. Here are two more lines from Michael Gove\u2019s evidence to the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee. Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, said that although he favoured easing lockdown measures at the same pace everywhere across the UK, he could see the case for island communities being allowed to relax the rules more quickly. He said: My own personal view is that it is preferable if we do it [lift the lockdown] as one United Kingdom. But there is a specific scientific justification for saying that island communities can be areas where you could pilot some measures, contact tracing in particular, in order to combine that with relaxing measures at a progressively greater rate. That can help you judge what is right for the country overall. He said he was concerned that people might become more cavalier about risk if they are encouraged to wear masks. Asked about whether to change the advice on masks, he said: The scientific evidence so far says face coverings can have an effect in preventing an individual from spreading the disease to others if they have it and are asymptomatic. But there is also a worry that some people may think that wearing a mask protects themselves, as distinct to protecting others, and therefore they may behave in a manner that is slightly more cavalier. So it is a finely based judgment. That judgment is being made collectively, with respect by the analysis of the science, by the cabinet and I know it is a situation that is under review. Doctors should not be disciplined if they decide they cannot see a patient because they do not have the right protective gear, the Medical Protection Society (MPS) has said. The MPS said that if a doctor decides they cannot safely see a Covid-19 patient because they do not have adequate personal protective equipment, and the patient comes to harm, they could face disciplinary action. The medical protection organisation called for reassurance from the General Medical Council (GMC) and employers that doctors will not be subjected to regulatory or disciplinary action following a decision or outcome that is the result of poor PPE provision. Dr Rob Hendry, medical director at MPS, said: It is appalling enough that doctors are placed in the position of having to choose between treating patients and keeping themselves and their other patients safe - this stress should not be compounded by the prospect of being brought before a regulatory or disciplinary tribunal. Responding, the GMC said in a statement: This pandemic is an unprecedented challenge in which clinicians are balancing the imperative to provide care with concerns around their own safety and wellbeing. Doctors are making difficult decisions on a daily basis, and we trust them to continue to use their professional judgment to apply the principles in our guidance. If a concern was raised with us about a doctor\u2019s actions we would need to look at the specifics, as we would any other concern referred to us. We\u2019d also consider the context within which the doctor was working, including information about resources, guidelines or protocols in place at the time. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, has admitted that it was only last week that he read a confidential government report on the lessons learnt from a three-day exercise in 2016 modelling what would happen in a pandemic. Giving evidence to the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee, Gove said that he read the report from Exercise Cygnus last week - although he said he had read recommendations prompted by the report earlier. His admission is surprising because it has been claimed that Exercise Cygnus gave a prescient insight into the problems the UK is facing now with coronavirus - challenges for which the government has not seemed well prepared. Gove is one of the ministers who attends the daily C-19 meeting in Downing Street, which is referred to by insiders as the coronavirus \u201cwar cabinet\u201d, and he chairs a coronavirus implementation committee in charge of \u201cpreparedness\u201d across much of the public sector and critical national infrastructure, excluding the NHS. In an exclusive report on Exercise Cygnus published at the end of March, the Sunday Telegraph said: The NHS failed a major cross-government test of its ability to handle a severe pandemic but the \u201cterrifying\u201d results were kept secret from the public. Ministers were informed three years ago that Britain would be quickly overwhelmed by a severe outbreak amid a shortage of critical care beds, morgue capacity and personal protective equipment (PPE), an investigation has discovered ... Despite the failings exposed by Cygnus, the government never changed its strategic roadmap for a future pandemic, with the last update carried out in 2014. Summarising the conclusions from the exercise in the Sunday Telegraph, Paul Nuki and Bill Gardner said: But it was not the pandemic itself that was causing those gathered in Whitehall to grimace but the nation\u2019s woeful preparation. The peak of the epidemic had not yet arrived but local resilience forums, hospitals and mortuaries across the country were already being overwhelmed. There was not enough personal protective equipment (PPE) for the nation\u2019s doctors and nurses. The NHS was about to \u201cfall over\u201d due to a shortage of ventilators and critical care beds. Morgues were set to overflow, and it had become terrifyingly evident that the government\u2019s emergency messaging was not getting traction with the public. Gove told the committee he had read the report. But, when pressed by the committee\u2019s chairman William Wragg as to when he had read it, he said last week. When Wragg expressed surprise about this, Gove said: \u201cSome of the product that flowed from that report I had read beforehand.\u201d Asked what he was referring to, Gove said he was referring to recommendations relating to the need for emergency legislation, to the risk of the NHS being overwhelmed and to the need to de-prioritise non-urgent operations. Gove said the report had led to the development of an influenza pandemic stockpile. But Exercise Cygnus specifically covered a flu pandemic, and Gove said the fact that coronavirus was a different sort of virus meant that there was a need for \u201ca recalibration of our approach towards PPE [personal protective equipment]\u201d. Echoing what he told the Commons yesterday, Gove said that Nervtag (the new and emerging respiratory virus threats advisory group) was responsible for advising on this. Asked if he would be willing to publish the Exercise Cygnus report, Gove claimed that he had a \u201cgeneral disposition to share as much as possible\u201d but that he would have to consult with colleagues on this, and that it might not be possible to publish it, to protect the interests of the civil servants who wrote it. He said: I would have to ask the propriety and ethics team here in the Cabinet Office, because sometimes I\u2019m anxious to share things, but the point is made to me that this is advice that has been offered in confidence, by civil servants, and we have to respect their duty of candour and the safe space in which advice is offered. When councils were instructed to provide accommodation for their homeless population to protect them from coronavirus, Mike Matthews, owner of the Prince Rupert hotel in Shrewsbury, was one of the first to step in. The new residents, including a former employee, feel it has given them some dignity back and offered them a rare feeling of family and safety. They also know this cannot be a permanent change to their lives, so what happens next? In the latest episode of the Science Weekly podcast, the Guardian\u2019s science correspondent Hannah Devlin speaks to Prof Sabra Klein about why women are much less likely to become seriously ill or die from Covid-19, and what the implications of this knowledge for future treatments might be. The number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 within prisons continues to rise, a daily update from the Ministry of Justice shows. As of 5pm on Tuesday, there were 337 prisoners who had tested positive for the virus across 71 prisons, an increase of 1.5% in 24 hours. The number of prison staff infected rose by 6% to 337 workers across 63 prisons in the same period. Fifteen inmates have died directly or indirectly from Covid-19. There are 81,500 prisoners across 117 jails in England and Wales, and around 33,000 staff working in 104 public sector prisons. Downing Street has said that Boris Johnson had a \u201cconstructive\u201d conversation with Sir Keir Starmer this afternoon about the coronavirus crisis. A No 10 spokesman said: The prime minister spoke to Sir Keir Starmer on the phone this afternoon and updated him on the government\u2019s efforts to combat coronavirus. It was a constructive call and they agreed to continue speaking about the national effort to defeat the virus. There have been nine more coronavirus deaths in Northern Ireland, taking the total to 338, the health department in Northern Ireland has said. According to a report (pdf) published by Public Health England, around a third of all care homes in England have reported coronavirus outbreaks, new data from Public Health England shows. Some 4,516 homes have reported outbreaks since March 17 up until Monday this week. Here are the figures showing what percentage of care homes in each region of England that have reported an outbreak. East Midlands - 25% East of England - 27% London - 33% North East - 38% North West - 36% South East - 28% South West - 21% West Midlands - 30% Yorkshire and the Humber - 29% Journalists are seen to be doing a better job at holding the government coronavirus response to account than MPs and the Labour party, according to a new study from Ipsos Mori. In a new online survey, the British public said most likely to be seen to do a good job are journalists at the government\u2019s coronavirus daily briefings (43%), followed by TV and radio journalists (40%). Only 1 in 5 believe the Labour party has done a good job at holding the government to account so far (18%), this increases to a quarter (24%) who think Sir Keir Starmer has done a good job. However, Ipsos Mori said this could reflect that the Labour leader is \u201cstill something of an unknown entity with the general public so far\u201d. Ben Page, CEO of Ipsos MORI, said: Despite recent controversy about journalists challenging government spokespeople, by 43% to 28% the public say they are doing a good job in holding the government to account. They do rather better than the official Opposition - highlighting the challenge Keir Starmer has in connecting with the public during the crisis. It would \u201cnot be right\u201d for the government to stop companies paying dividends to their shareholders, even if they are seeking state support because of Covid-19, Jacob Rees-Mogg has said. The leader of the House said it was up to individual firms whether they awarded dividends this year. The shadow Commons leader, Valerie Vaz, challenged him on whether the government will adopt the approach taken by some countries, which have said companies that receive state aid cannot reward their shareholders. In response, Rees-Mogg said the rules on who could apply for Treasury support were \u201crelatively clear and well set out\u201d. He said: Companies who aren\u2019t contributing, or haven\u2019t contributed to this country, and don\u2019t have their operations in this country, won\u2019t particularly benefit but employment in this country will benefit. As regards to dividends, that in a way is a matter for companies. I notice BP is going to carry on paying its dividend to try and help pensioners and that\u2019s a decision for companies where I don\u2019t think it would be right for the government to intervene. The Queen has sent a private message of good wishes to Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds to congratulate them on the birth of their son, according to Buckingham Palace. At the post-PMQs Downing Street lobby briefing we learned almost nothing new about the circumstances around the birth of Boris Johnson\u2019s new baby son. The spokesman repeatedly refused to answer questions about whether the birth was premature. When it was first announced that Carrie Symonds was pregnant, a spokesperson said the baby was due \u201cin the early summer\u201d. Here are some of the main points on non-baby matters. Boris Johnson is due to make a media appearance later this week, according to his spokesman. That suggests he will appear at the daily government press conference either tomorrow or on Friday. He is not appearing at today\u2019s press conference, which will be led by Dominic Raab. The spokesman said the UK would study the situation in countries including Germany when it came to lifting lockdown. He said: We are watching how countries across the world respond to coronavirus and we are obviously studying steps which they are taking in relation to relaxing their own social distancing measures and the impact that\u2019s having. Exactly as you would expect, we want to base our own decision on the best available information and experience. The spokesman firmly denied that the government was relaxing one of the five tests that will be used to decide when it eases the lockdown. This claim was triggered by a change of wording to test five on the slide issued at the press conference yesterday, compared with the way test five was phrased in the slide issued the previous day. The Telegraph splashed on this claim this morning. But the spokesman said the wording had been changed just to better reflect what Raab actually said when he set out the five tests at a press conference on 16 April. The spokesman was right. This is what Raab said in his speech at the time: We need to be confident that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that overwhelm the NHS. Downing Street may have wanted to change the wording on the slide because the formula used on Monday implied any second peak of infections would be unacceptable. As Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, implied at the press conference on Monday, some sort of second peak is all but inevitable. The spokesman said 43,563 coronavirus tests were provided in the 24 hours to 9am yesterday. There was capacity for 73,400 tests to be carried out. The spokesman said 14,700 home testing kits were made available at 8am on Wednesday and had all been ordered by 9.30am. As of 9am, 33,000 people had booked in for tests at drive-through sites. The chief executive of Horse Racing Ireland has stepped into the debate over the staging of last month\u2019s Cheltenham Festival by suggesting that the event should \u201cprobably\u201d not have taken place due to growing concerns about the spread of coronavirus. Brian Kavanagh told Sport For Business: The irony is that while Cheltenham was going ahead and people were at the races, the pubs back in Ireland were packed with people watching Cheltenham, but it certainly couldn\u2019t have come at a worse week, it was unfortunate because it was the last major sporting event to take place. Should it have taken place? With hindsight, probably no but everyone\u2019s wise after the event. In recent days, figures showing that Gloucestershire hospitals NHS trust, which covers Cheltenham, has recorded more deaths from coronavirus than a number of neighbouring trusts led to calls for an inquiry into whether allowing the festival to go ahead was to blame. However, the raw data did not account for the relative sizes of the trusts, the social or age profiles of their catchment areas or their population densities. Museums and Galleries Edinburgh has just issued a callout for rainbow artwork, pyjamas worn all day indoors, and handwritten notes offering help to neighbours, as it begins a Covid-19 contemporary collecting drive. Launching an open call to the people of Edinburgh to contribute their own items and stories to reflect how life in the city has been affected by the global pandemic and lockdown, the City of Edinburgh council leader, Adam McVey, said: This is an extraordinary period in our history that in due course we will want to look back on. By collecting objects, photographs and first-hand experiences of citizens now, we\u2019re making sure we can capture this moment for future generations. The curatorial team leading the project wants to gather public contributions that reflect \u201cthose objects and stories which helped people cope and get through the many challenges and uncertainties presented by the pandemic\u201d. From Good Morning Britain. Boris Johnson is expected to take a short period of paternity leave later this year rather than now, a Downing Street spokesman has confirmed. The prime minister returned to work in No 10 following the birth, and spoke to Sir Keir Starmer for more than half an hour about the coronavirus response on Wednesday afternoon. The two agreed to have further discussions next week, a spokeswoman for the Labour leader added. The family were planning to live in their Downing Street flat along with their dog, Dilyn, the PM\u2019s spokesman said. Downing Street declined to say whether the baby was born prematurely, and the spokesman was unable to provide details of the weight, timing, nature or location of the birth. A further 73 people have died after testing positive for coronavirus in Wales, taking the total number of deaths there to 886, Public Health Wales has said. The daily figure takes into account 31 previous deaths from the Hywel Dda health board area which were not previously recorded. A further 117 people had tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 9,629. Emergency measures to alleviate pressure on the NHS during the coronavirus crisis that will allow pharmacists to dispense a range of super-strength medicines, including the heroin substitute methadone, without prescription are to come into effect on 30 April, the home secretary Priti Patel has said. But the regulations will only be used after this date in limited circumstances following an announcement by either the home secretary or health secretary, a written statement said. The changes proposed would allow pharmacists to provide substances controlled by the Misuse of Drugs Act without prescription, although only to patients who have been receiving the medicine as part of their treatment. Some of the substances covered by the proposals are highly addictive and include barbiturates and opiates, such as morphine, as well as medicines used for opioid substitution therapy (OST). The harm reduction initiative offers people who are dependent on opioids such as heroin an alternative, typically methadone or buprenorphine. The Advisory Council for Misuse of Drugs, which makes recommendations to the government on the control of dangerous drugs, supported the move but did caution that it could lead to a spike in drug misuse. A further 445 patients who tested positive for Covid-19 have died, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 19,746. The detailed figures are here (pdf). NHS England said the patients were aged between 14 and 101 years old. Twenty-seven of the 445 patients (aged between 14 and 94 years old) had no known underlying health condition. The number of deaths of patients with Covid-19 by region are as follows: East of England 55 London 129 Midlands 96 North East &amp; Yorkshire 72 North West 59 South East 57 South West 16 Total: 475 NHS England and NHS Improvement publish the number of patients who have died in hospital and tested positive for Covid-19 in England. From 28 April, NHS England and NHS Improvement also reports the number of patient deaths where there has been no Covid-19 positive test result, but where Covid-19 is documented as a direct or underlying cause of death on part 1 or part 2 of the death certification process. This change has been introduced for deaths that occurred on 24 April and subsequently. This means the NHS England and NHS Improvement data collection provides information on all coronavirus-related (suspected and confirmed) deaths in England hospitals. Today, 30 deaths are reported with no positive Covid-19 test result. The latest figures released from National Records of Scotland today (see 12.14) shows that the growth in the number of weekly Covid-19 deaths has slowed dramatically. There were just four more deaths in the week ending 26 April (656 deaths) than in the previous week (652 deaths) an increase of just 0.6% compared compared to a 7% increase in the week ending 20 April and 116% in the week ending 13 April. Mel Stride, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons treasury committee, told the World at One that hopes the UK economy would make a swift recovery after the coronavirus lockdown were fading sharply. He said: The idea that we will have this quick V-shaped bounce of a recovery is probably receding fairly quickly now. (Capital letters provide a useful but crude guide to economic recessions. With a V, the economy goes down but bounces straight back again. A U would be worse, because that would imply the economy going down and staying down before recovering. A W would involve the economy going down, up, down, then up again. Worst of all would be a L, which would imply no recovery at all.) Stride also implied that taxes might have to go up for the well-off. He told the programme: There will be very difficult choices, therefore, around spending on the one hand and taxation on the other. I think in the taxation debate there will be a very important debate to be had about who should bear the heaviest levels of additional taxation, especially when you think it is the lowest-paid and often the youngest people who have been most impacted ... I think there will need to be a debate around which parts of the economy have been impacted the hardest, who is in the best position to be able to shoulder the burden going forward but with a very strong emphasis on getting business back up on its feet and the economy growing again. Gordon Brown, the former Labour prime minister, has been invited to advise the Welsh government on its response to the coronavirus crisis, ITV Wales reports. Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, has welcomed the fact that Gavin Williamson, the eduction secretary (for England), told MPs this morning that schools would not re-open during the summer holidays. She said: We were relieved to hear confirmation from the education secretary that schools and colleges will not be returning during the summer holidays. Lockdown is not a holiday. All education staff are working extremely intensively for long days during lockdown and so the summer holiday dates must stay in place. During August, children and teenagers who have been inside for months are going to need activities like summer schemes and holiday clubs, if these can be safely re-opened by local authorities. With the election of Sir Keir Starmer as Labour leader, and Dominic Raab standing in for Boris Johnson, PMQs seems to have turned into a \u201cMr Reasonable UK\u201d competition. It was as if the two protagonists were trying to outbid each other in evidence-based discourse and common sensical decency. It is very likely to be the case that debates in cabinet ministerial committees get more unpleasant and abrasive than what we witnessed at PMQs today. If Raab was getting rattled, he only really let it show right at the end, when he sought to lecture Starmer (mildly) on being opportunistic. Ironically, this was probably the point at which Raab\u2019s argument - that an \u201cexit strategy\u201d of the kind published by the Scottish government at all isn\u2019t really an exit strategy, because it does not commit to policy - was at its strongest. Raab did not really have much of an answer to Starmer\u2019s question earlier about how the PPE problems were going to be fixed. Starmer probably had the better of the exchanges, although it did not sound like the convention PMQs \u201cwin\u201d, not least because his performance included gushing praise for the government\u2019s performance on boosting NHS capacity. (See 12.24pm.) This might not be what people are used to at PMQs, but there is probably method in Starmer\u2019s approach. It was strongly reminiscent of what Tony Blair wrote about how to succeed at PMQs in his memoirs. Blair wrote: I always tried to make [what he said at PMQs] telling. The aim was to get the non-politician nodding. I would wonder not what appealed to a Labour party conference in full throttle, but what would appeal to my old mates at the Bar, who wanted a reasonable case to be made; and who, if it were made, would rally ... Yes, it\u2019s not like calling your opponent a liar, or a fraud, or a villain or a hypocrite, but the middle-ground floating voters kind of shrugs their shoulders at those claims. They don\u2019t chime. They\u2019re too over the top, too heavy, and they represent an insult, not an argument. Whereas the lesser charge, because it\u2019s more accurate and precisely because it\u2019s low-key, can stick. Here are quote from the final exchanges at PMQs between Dominic Raab and Sir Keir Starmer, where Starmer was claiming the UK would fall behind other countries if it did not publish an exit plan soon. Starmer said: France, Germany, Spain, Belgium, New Zealand, Australia, Scotland and Wales have all published exit plans of one sort or another. [Raab] said, \u2018well what are the proposals, what should they cover?\u2019. If you look at those plans, as he\u2019s done and I\u2019ve done, it\u2019s clear that there are common issues such as schools reopening, business sectors reopening. These are the issues that, if he wants me to put them on the table, I absolutely will. Delay risks not only falling behind other countries, but also the successful four-nation approach so far. Raab said it would be wrong to publish an exit plan before the scientific advice said it was safe to start relaxing the lockdown. And he said the Scottish government had not published one. He said: The Scottish government has not set out an exit strategy. I read through very carefully their 25-page document, it was eminently sensible and it was grounded in the five tests that I set out on April 16. The home secretary was told the public will be \u201cabsolutely baffled\u201d by the border response to the coronavirus as she was unable to recall which countries had been subject to quarantine measures prior to the lockdown. Priti Patel was challenged by Stephen Doughty, the Labour MP for Cardiff South and Penarth, over the apparent shift in approach in mid-March that ended the of quarantining passengers from specific countries and regions such as the Chinese city of Wuhan. Prior to 23 March, while there was no testing, there were flights coming in and passengers were being quarantined. Patel said: I can\u2019t recall the locations they were coming in from, there were certain parts of the world, travellers coming in from, where they were being quarantined. That was prior to that lockdown and if memory serves me correctly that was some time in late February. To which Doughty said: \u201cI\u2019m surprised you can\u2019t recall where.\u201d He informed the home secretary that passengers from Wuhan were being quarantined but not northern Italy where deaths had already been recorded. She replied: At the time Wuhan was in the spotlight. Asked why this changed and passengers were no longer placed in quarantine, Patel said all decisions were based on advice from the scientific committee Sage and Public Health England. Doughty said: Many members of the public will find this absolutely baffling. Patel added: All decisions around borders and ongoing discussions around borders, this is constantly under review, has been based on the fact that passenger flows have fallen, but of course there was a changing pattern as the world was locking down it\u2019s been based on scientific advice provided by Sage and PHE. The number of Covid-19 deaths taking place in Scottish care homes was higher than in hospitals in the past week. More than half (52%) of deaths involving Covid-19 took place in care homes compared with 42% in hospitals in the week ending 26 April. A further 6% of deaths occurred at home or in other locations, according to new data from National Records of Scotland (NRS) (see 12.14). The total number of deaths recorded in Scotland which included Covid-19 on the death certificate now stands at 2,272, far higher than the daily death toll published by the Scottish government. The latter requires a patient to have tested positive before they died whereas the weekly NRS figures are based on the information recorded on death certificates. When all coronavirus deaths occurring since mid March are included 52% of Scottish coronavirus deaths occurred in hospitals, 39% in care homes and 9% in private homes and elsewhere. NRS recorded 743 more deaths in the week ending 26 April when compared with the five-year average, 85% of which (631) had an underlying cause of Covid-19. Social distancing will need to be introduced into every area of work from offices to construction sites to secure workplaces going forward in \u201cthe new normal\u201d, the home secretary has told MPs. Appearing before the home affairs select committee, Priti Patel was asked if there was an argument to ease lockdown restrictions based on the picture in specific regions, work sectors and based on individual risk profiles. Patel said assessments were taking place but she was \u201cnot at liberty to go into the detail of some of the discussions taking place\u201d. She added: But before people go back to work there is a job to do yet in terms of securing work places. The fact of the matter is we will not go back to how we were in early March. There will be new norms inevitably come off the way in which social distancing has dominated our lives and is affecting society. We would expect social distancing in every single work area whether its an office or a construction site, and social distancing on public transport going forward. These are all active things that we have to test and put through consideration. She added: The fact of the matter is to move into a new normal we will as a society have to operationalise new ways of working and of course they have to be tested. Employers have to embrace those, guidance will have to come from the government. We have to consider all of this in terms of then looking at how \u2013 because we can not remain in this situation indefinitely \u2013 how we move into that phase, calibrated approach. We will be leading that. We will be putting guidance out there to employers, trade unions and others. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader at Westminster, asks what the government is doing to ensure cancer patients and other patients can access the NHS treatment they need. Raab says this is an issue. He says the Nightingale hospitals have created capacity that will allow other NHS patients to get treated. And that\u2019s the end of PMQs. Cheryl Gillan, a Conservative, says even before the crisis two out of three autistic adults were not getting the help they need. She says the situation may have got worse. Can Raab ensure they will not lose out? And how many councils have used emergency powers to justify cutting back their provision? Raab says vulnerable people should get the help they need. He says he will get back to Gillan on her specific question. The SNP\u2019s Dave Doogan asks what advice Raab has for a constituent who has lost his job. He says the government should back a universal basic income. Raab says a UBI could not be targeted. David Mundell, a Conservative, says lorry drivers are key workers. But many of them have found it hard getting hot food when they are working, and access to toilet facilities. Will the government support them? Raab says the definition of key workers has changed as we have gone through this crisis. He says there is more appreciation of the work they do. He says this is an excellent point. He says facilities for lorry drivers should stay open where possible. The SNP\u2019s Alison Thewliss asks if the government will ensure that insurance companies have to pay out on business interruption policies. Raab says it would not be right to tell the companies what they must pay out on. But he says the government wants to support businesses. A total of 1,415 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus, up by 83 from 1,332 on Tuesday, the first minister Nicola Sturgeon said. The figures are lower than the 2,272 deaths given earlier by the National Records of Scotland (see 12.14) as they do not include suspected and probable coronavirus infections. Sturgeon said 11,034 people have now tested positive for the virus in Scotland, up by 313 from 10,721 the day before. There are 114 people in intensive care with coronavirus or coronavirus symptoms, a decrease of 12 on Tuesday, she added. There are 1,727 people in hospital with confirmed or suspected Covid-19, down from 1,754 yesterday. Six NHS staff and five members of the social care work force have died with coronavirus in Scotland since the start of the pandemic, Sturgeon also confirmed. She announced the figures at her daily briefing adding that the workers would not have necessarily contracted the virus in their workplace. The first minister also revealed that since 5 March, 2,521 patients who tested positive for the virus have been discharged from hospital. Mark Pritchard, a Conservative, asks for an assurance that garden centres and nurseries will be allowed to open in the first phase of relaxing the lockdown. (He is referring to nurseries that cultivate plants, not ones that look after toddlers.) Raab says Pritchard is the second MP to make this point. He says it has been registered. Labour\u2019s Geraint Davies asks Raab to say if the decision to opt out of the EU ventilator procurement scheme was a political decision or a commercial decision. Raab says the original decision was a \u201cfailure of communication\u201d. The UK did not get the invitation to tender. But not participating has not made a difference, he says. He says the UK is looking at participating in other schemes. Shailesh Vara, a Conservative, invites Raab to congratulate NHS staff. Raab says he has to read out the death toll at press conferences. He always walks away ashen-faced when he thinks of what those figures mean for families, he says. Labour\u2019s Wes Streeting praises the response of the emergency services who responded to the killing of two young children in his constituency at the weekend. More needs to be done to help people who are unsafe in their own homes, he says. Raab says he was appalled by this case. He passes on his condolences. And he says the police are there to protect people. Anyone who needs to should call 999. And there is a domestic abuse helpline. He says the lockdown has created specific problems, but the domestic abuse bill, which had its second reading yesterday, will help to address this problem. Labour\u2019s Zarah Sultana says the government should not be offering help to firms based in tax havens, and firms paying dividends or engaged in share buy-backs. She says the government should be helping the 99% instead. Raab criticises her for being partisan. He says the government is helping a wide range of businesses. Robert Courts, a Conservative, says the banks have to do their bit to help the coronavirus recovery. Raab says the government has stepped up to the plate. \u201cWe expect the banks to do the same too,\u201d he says. The SNP\u2019s Allan Dorans asks for an assurance that, when a vaccine becomes available, it will be distributed around the world on the basis of need, not on the basis of wealth. Raab says the government is contributing to international vaccination programmes. He says he agrees with what Dorans said. Rob Roberts, a Conservative, asks if the government remains committed to levelling up in schools after this crisis is over. Raab says the government remains committed to that. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader (who is participating by Zoom), says the UK is two months away from the point where it might walk away from Brexit trade deal talks. Why is the government risking a no deal outcome? Raab says he would not rely as much as Blackford does on the word of Michel Barnier for a guide to how the talks are going. He says the UK wants a deal. Blackford says the best way to remove uncertainty would be to allow more time for talks. He says 2m people risk losing their jobs in the UK. He says refusing to recognise the inevitability of extending the talks is a foolish gamble. He urges Raab to face down the hardliners in his party. Raab says extending the talks would increase uncertainty. Sir Desmond Swayne, a Conservative, asks if garden centres will open \u201cin short order\u201d. Raab says the current advice says no, but that this is being kept under review. Starmer says the problem with Raab\u2019s response is that the UK risks falling behind. Other European countries have published exit plans. He says it is clear what these must involve; eg opening schools. He says he wants the four nations of the UK to carry on working together. Will the government consult the opposition? Raab says it would be wrong to set out an exit strategy now. He says he has read the Scottish government\u2019s document. That does not set out an exit strategy. It explains principles, he says, in line with the five tests set out by Raab. Raab says Starmer has a reputation for following the evidence. He should not abandon that approach. Starmer says Raab asked him to acknowledge the success in increasing capacity. He says he is happy to do that. He says it has been an \u201camazing piece of work\u201d. On the lockdown, he says he is not asking for a timeframe, and not asking for detail of what will happen. But he wants the government to be open, he says. He says he would like to be able to support the government\u2019s strategy. Raab promised on Monday \u201cmaximum transparency\u201d. When will the government publish an exit strategy? Raab says when Sage last reviewed the lockdown, it advised against any change. He says Sage will review this again early next month. He says, if Starmer has any proposals, he should say what they are. He says it would be wrong to make proposals now, without knowing what Sage will recommend. Starmer says he does not base things on his own opinion. He tries to stick to the evidence. When he spoke about the situation for PPE getting worse, he was quoting he views of doctors. He says the government used to say the problem with testing was lack of demand. But now demand for testing has gone through the roof. And the 100,000 target was only a staging post. He says the PM talks about 250,000 tests a day being a target. Starmer says he agrees; that is what the government should be heading for. He asks if that is still a target, and when it might be hit. Raab says he understands the point about PPE, but he does not accept that that means overall things are getting worse. He says testing capacity has doubled since last week. The latest figures showed 43,563 tests being carried out daily. He says the 250,000 target is still a milestone. But he won\u2019t put deadline on it. Starmer says on Sunday Raab told the Marr programme that deaths in care homes were falling. Can he clarify if that is right? Starmer asks about PPE (personal protective equipment). He says he recognises that distributing this is difficult. But the situation seems to be getting worse. A survey on Monday said one in four doctors was not getting the equipment they needed. He says this is a plea from the frontline. What is going on, and how can it be fixed? Raab says there are some positive signs coming out of care homes, but they are \u201cwithin the margin of error\u201d. He says he does not accept Starmer\u2019s claim that the situation with PPE is getting worse not better. In relation to PPE, Raab says Starmer has to recognise that the UK faces a global supply shortage. Every country is facing this. The UK is \u201cthe international buyer of choice\u201d. He says flights are coming in from places like China, Turkey and Myanmar. A total of 2,272 people have died in Scotland with confirmed or suspected coronavirus, according to the National Records of Scotland (NRS). Of these: - 39% took place in care homes - 52% in hospitals - 9% in homes or non-institutional settings There were 656 deaths relating to Covid-19 registered between 20-26 April, a rise of four on the 652 registered between 13-19 April. The figures are announced weekly and account for all deaths registered in Scotland where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. They differ from the lab-confirmed coronavirus deaths announced daily by the Scottish government because they include suspected or probable cases of Covid-19. Starmer welcomes the fact that the government is producing a clearer breakdown of figures. And he welcomes the fact hospital deaths are falling. But care home deaths are rising, he says. He says MPs have heard \u201cexpressions of real anxiety\u201d from people in the care sector. Why is coronavirus spreading so quickly in that sector? And what are the latest figures for care home deaths? Raab says he has already given that figure. There is a challenge in care homes, he says. He says the government has made \u201cgood progress\u201d in reducing the level of community transmission, but there have been problems in hospitals and care homes. With care homes, the challenge is controlling the ebb and flow of people in and out. He says the sector is diverse. But there is a plan to address this, he says. Testing for care homes is being increased. This is a challenge. But it is a challenge we can grip and must grip. Sir Keir Starmer offers his congratulations to the PM and Carrie Symonds. He says they must have gone through great anxiety in recent weeks, and he says he is glad that they must be relieved. He says there are now at least 27,241 coronavirus deaths. But that is probably an understatement. He says the PM talked on Monday about the UK\u2019s apparent success on coronavirus. But this is not a success, he says. He says these figures are \u201ctruly dreadful\u201d. Raab says it is difficult to interpret the coronavirus death figures, because of the different ways they are recorded. This is a global pandemic, he says. The reality is that we know a lot more about the virus than we did. He says he shares the \u201cjoint horror\u201d at these deaths. But he says it is too early to make international comparisons. If they are to be done, they should be done on a per head basis, he says. James Cartlidge, a Conservative, asks what can be done to free up the NHS so that patients with cancer and other conditions can be treated. Dominic Raab offers his congratulations to the PM and his fiancee. He offers his condolences to the families and friends of the 85 NHS workers and 23 social care workers who have died with coronavirus. And he offers birthday wishes to the veteran NHS fundraiser Capt Tom Moore, who is 100 tomorrow. Turning to Cartlidge, he says the government is planning to ensure the NHS can treat more non-coronavirus patients. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons Speaker, opens PMQs by congratulating the prime minster and his partner. From the former prime minister David Cameron, who celebrated the birth of a baby while he was in No 10 You can see who is down to ask a question on PMQs on what is now called the \u201ccall list\u201d produced by Commons officials. PMQs is about to start. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, will be deputising for Boris Johnson, who won\u2019t be attending following the birth of his baby son earlier this morning. Shinzo Abe, the Japanese PM, has offered his congratulations to Boris Johnson. The Australian PM, Scott Morrison, has also offered his best wishes. And this is from Woody Johnson, the US ambassador to the UK. More offers of congratulations to the PM and Carrie Symonds. From Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon From the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan From Northern Ireland\u2019s first minister, Arlene Foster Congratulations in both Welsh and English from Wales\u2019s first minister Mark Drakeford More migrant health and care workers on the frontline of the fight against coronavirus will be automatically granted free visa extensions, the government has said. The Home Office previously announced that doctors, nurses and paramedics from overseas with visas due to expire before 1 October will receive an automatic one year extension free of charge. This list will now be expanded to include midwives, radiographers, social workers and pharmacists, Priti Patel announced. It will apply to those working both in the NHS and independent sector and include their family members. All will be exempt for the Immigration Health Surcharge for the duration of the extension. Those eligible for the extension will be identified by health and care employers across the UK. The home secretary added that family members and dependents of healthcare workers who die as a result of contracting the virus will be offered immediate indefinite leave to remain. Boris Johnson will be taking paternity leave not now but later this year, Sky News is reporting. With the government having to take quite momentous decision about whether and how to relax the lockdown between now and next Thursday, that won\u2019t come as a huge surprise. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons Speaker, has issued a statement congratulating the PM and his partner that includes a line that may be an entry for truism of the year. He says: On behalf of everyone in the House of Commons, may I say congratulations to the prime minister and Carrie Symonds on the birth of their son. Such happy news amid so much uncertainty \u2013 2020 is certainly a year they will never forget. People living in urban and the most deprived areas of the UK could be more exposed or vulnerable to coronavirus, the latest data from the Covid-19 Symptom Tracker app suggests. Scientists analysing the findings, which have yet to be peer-reviewed, have found that the virus is disproportionately more common and more severe in those located in urban areas and regions of higher poverty. Dr Cristina Menni, the lead researcher from King\u2019s College London, said previous research shows deprivation is closely linked with increased health issues and disease burden, and this seems to also be the case with Covid-19. She added: This could reflect that individuals in more deprived areas are more exposed or vulnerable to the virus. It may be that they work in jobs requiring work out of the home, where they are more likely to be exposed to circulating virus. Dr Claire Steves, joint senior author from King\u2019s College London, added: This finding is important for allocation of resources in this pandemic. Areas with higher rates of poverty will need greater supply of personal protective equipment and more hospital capacity. This is likely to continue to be important when the social distancing measures are eased. The analysis was based on more than 2 million people in the UK who used the app to log their daily health status over 24 days immediately after social distancing measures were introduced. The data also indicates that the number of cases and their severity have decreased since the lockdown began. Enforced quarantine and thermal screening are among possible measures being considered to prevent further spread of the coronavirus, Priti Patel, the home secretary, has told MPs, as she was challenged over the UK border policy during the pandemic. The chair of the home affairs committee, Yvette Cooper, said 130 countries had taken stricter approaches to the border than the UK, including Germany, New Zealand, South Korea, Italy, Singapore, Australia and Greece. Patel said the UK approach was informed by advice from Sage (the scientific advisory group for emergencies) but added that \u201ceverything is under review\u201d. She said: We are not similar to those countries, in terms of travellers and passenger flows. It\u2019s a fact that the UK has one of the largest numbers of international arrivals, very different flows to some of the countries mentioned. That is a key consideration of Sage. But the home secretary said discussions were ongoing, adding \u201cwe rule nothing out\u201d. She said: It would be based on the science. It would also be based on any changes outside of this country, as easing with lockdown may take place with other countries and more people may choose to travel, choose to fly. We still have to think about he impact of a second wave. Patel said if the infection rate domestically decreased, they would consider measures at the border that might help prevent a second wave. She went on: Look at the operational side of things, this isn\u2019t something that can just come in over night. We will have to think of the practical measures of this, how this would be delivered, which kind of ports of entry first and foremost, and how that would work on a practical basis. We rule nothing out. A lottery winner whose father died after contracting coronavirus has mowed an NHS logo and rainbow into his lawn in tribute to those who helped care for his dad. Barry Maddox\u2019s father, Frankie, died five weeks ago at the age of 86 after testing positive for Covid-19. He said: This bit of lawn mowing is our way of saying thank you to the NHS for all they have done for our family, and for so many other families. And in some ways, I also hope it\u2019s something for dad to look down at us and have a chuckle. His wife, Sue Richards, added: Alongside clapping and banging pans on a Thursday evening, staying home, staying safe and washing our hands, this is our thank you. At the education committee this morning Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, said he was \u201cvery open\u201d to proposals that could help disadvantaged pupils who may have been disproportionately affected by the lockdown. This is from Robert Halfon, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee. Some 50 MPs from the north of England have backed a call for secondary schools to get \u00a3700 for every pupil on free school meals to help those children catch up after the lockdown. And there is a separate proposal for graduate volunteers to be recruited to tutor these pupils to help ensure they do not fall behind. Good morning! I\u2019m Lucy Campbell, joining the blog for the rest of the day. We\u2019ll be bringing you all the latest updates on the coronavirus in the UK, so please feel free to get in touch to share any ideas and tips. Email: lucy.campbell@theguardian.com Twitter: @lucy_campbell_ Police figures reveal a sharp rise in requests to know about a partner\u2019s abusive past since lockdown measures came into force. Police Scotland say that requests under their domestic abuse disclosure scheme have increased by 18% since lockdown began. However, the majority of the requests are being made by police officers and other professionals, raising a concern about someone they think may be at risk of domestic abuse. Police Scotland can then make a decision about whether to reveal the information in the interests of safeguarding a person. Nearly 260 requests for disclosure were made between the start of lockdown on 23 March to 27 April 2020, compared to 219 in 2019. Assistant chief constable Duncan Sloan, lead for major crime and public protection at Police Scotland, said: \u201cDomestic abuse is an ongoing threat in our local communities and there remains an increased risk as people continue to observe isolation and physical distancing guidance. Police Scotland will not tolerate domestic abuse, tackling it and preventing it is a priority for us and that has not changed because of Covid-19.\u201d Pharmaceutical giant AstraZenenca has said it is assessing the use of two of its drugs to combat the effects of Covid-19. The UK-listed firm is evaluating Calquence - a drug used to treat chronic lymphocytic leukaemia - to suppress inflammation in the lungs and other organs in Covid-19 patients. And Farxiga \u2013 predominantly used for heart failure and kidney disease \u2013 is being assessed to see if it can potentially reduce organ failure. The firm\u2019s chief executive, Pascal Soriot, said: I could not be prouder of how the AstraZeneca team has responded to the challenges of Covid-19. We moved quickly to maintain continuity of care, contribute to society, and use our scientific expertise to fight the pandemic. We hope our efforts to protect organs from damage, mitigate the cytokine storm and the associated hyperinflammatory state, and target the virus prove to be successful. Air passengers coming into the UK are down 99% compared with a year ago, the home secretary has told MPs, as she defended the government\u2019s decision not to test individuals entering the country. The home secretary, Priti Patel, is giving evidence to a virtual session of the home affairs select committee on the Home Office response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Answering questions from the committee chair, Yvette Cooper, Patel said for the period 16 April to 22 April, air passenger numbers coming into the country are down 99% year on year, maritime passengers are down 88.7% and international rail travellers are down 94%. On Friday, a total of 9,906 people entered the country. Patel said around 63% of passengers are returning British nationals as repatriation flights continue to take place. But the home secretary said testing was not taking place at the border, a decision based on advice from the scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage). She said: Scientific advice has been very clear that any restrictions of measures would have a negligible impact on the progression of the virus on the border given the significant reduction of numbers coming in. Furloughed staff should be allowed to work reduced hours and the jobs scheme should be extended to at least the end of September, according to employers. A survey of more than 1,000 employers found support for the government\u2019s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme to be made more flexible. The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) warned that without changes, the scheme could prove to be a \u201cwaiting room\u201d for unemployment and fail to protect significant numbers of the jobs it set out to save. Around half of those questioned said they have furloughed staff, while another 10% plan to do so. Seven in 10 employers that have already used or are considering using the furlough scheme said that up to half of affected staff could potentially work reduced hours. Priti Patel, the home secretary, has started giving evidence to the home affairs committee about her department\u2019s response to the coronavirus crisis. There is a live feed at the top of the blog. At the start of the hearing Patel and Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the committee, both offered their congratulations to the PM and his partner. Friends and colleagues of a staff nurse who died after contracting coronavirus have paid tribute to him as a well-liked professional who worked constantly to help others. The United Lincolnshire hospitals NHS trust confirmed Anujkumar Kuttikkottu Pavithran, 44, died on April 27. In a statement, the trust chief executive, Andrew Morgan, said he was deeply saddened to share news of his colleague\u2019s death. The statement added: \u201cAnujkumar Kuttikkottu Pavithran, known as Kumar to his colleagues, was a staff nurse at Pilgrim hospital, Boston. He was a very well-liked, professional, respected member of the team and will be greatly missed. \u201cWe are all sending our heartfelt condolences to Kumar\u2019s family, friends and colleagues at this incredibly difficult time.\u201d A community group which supports the Pilgrim hospital said the nurse had paid a \u201cterrible price\u201d for putting patients first. More than \u00a326,000 has so far been donated to a fundraising appeal set up on Facebook to help the NHS worker\u2019s family. A statement inviting donations to the fundraising page said the nurse had worked for the NHS for the past nine years. I am putting together a list of all the health-worker staff who have died, please contribute by alerting me to any missed names. The archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has sent his congratulations to Boris Johnson and his partner, Carrie Symonds. And the archbishop of York, John Sentamu, has as well. For once political Twitter has found something it can agree on. Here is a selection of messages of congratulations to the PM coming from MPs. From Sajid Javid, the Tory former chancellor From Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland secretary From Sir Ed Davey, the acting Lib Dem leader From David Lammy, the shadow justice secretary From Tracy Brabin, the shadow culture secretary A former youth jail that was shut down after years of allegations of mistreatment of inmates by staff is to reopen to house adult prisoners as part of measures taken to limit the spread of the coronavirus. Medway Secure Training Centre (STC), which closed in March, will be temporarily reopened as an annex to nearby Rochester prison, housing up to 70 category D - that is, low risk - adult prisoners, the Ministry of Justice said. More than 300 temporary single-occupancy cells out of planned 500 have now been installed across nine prisons, the MoJ added. Temporary cells have now been installed to serve prisons at Highpoint and Hollesley Bay in Suffolk and North Sea Camp in Lincolnshire, while work continues at Askham Grange near York, Coldingley in Surrey, Hatfield in South Yorkshire, Lindholme in Doncaster, Littlehey in Cambridgeshire, Moorland near Doncaster and Wymott in Lancashire. When it closed, Medway STC was publicly-run but had previously been operated by the private company G4S, which was stripped of its contract in 2016 shortly after an undercover Panorama documentary alleged that staff at the centre were abusing inmates. A Guardian expos\u00e9 also revealed a history of abuse allegations at the centre. The latest modelling by Public Health England and the Prison Service showed the spread rates of infection and deaths caused by Covid-19 have been much lower than expected and said there was cause for \u201ccautious optimism though significant threats remain\u201d. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, has said he expects schools to reopen \u201cin a phased manner\u201d. Giving evidence to the parliamentary education committee, he said the government was giving \u201ca lot of consideration\u201d to how getting pupils back to school would be managed. Schools have been closed to all but the most vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers since 20 March. Asked by committee chair Robert Halfon whether the return of pupils to schools would be \u201cin stages\u201d, with pupils of some ages returning before others, Williamson said: This is obviously something that we are giving a great amount of thought to, and giving a lot of consideration. Just a couple of weeks ago I commissioned Sage to set up a sub-group to look at the particular issues of opening schools, making sure that when schools are open it\u2019s done in the best possible way with the very best scientific and medical advice. I am continuing on the live feed for the next hour. Please do get in touch with me if you want to share any comments or have news tips. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Just one in 10 people supports a government bailout for the airline industry without strings attached to tackle climate pollution, a survey suggests. Asked if airlines should get bailouts separate to existing support for businesses provided by the government, just over a quarter (26%) backed such a move, and 37% opposed it, the poll found. When it came to potential conditions for a bailout as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, only 11% said airlines should get cash from the government regardless of their climate change policies. More than a third (35%) said money should only go to airlines if they adhered to the UK\u2019s international climate change commitments, and 28% were convinced there should be no bailouts. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, was one of the first cabinet ministers to offer his congratulations to the PM. And Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, has offered his congratulations too. Downing Street played us all quite brilliantly. PA Media has just snapped this. A spokesman for Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds said: \u201cThe prime minister and Ms Symonds are thrilled to announce the birth of a healthy baby boy at a London hospital earlier this morning. Both mother and baby are doing very well. \u201cThe PM and Ms Symonds would like to thank the fantastic NHS maternity team.\u201d Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, will be taking PMQs instead of Boris Johnson, Labour sources have revealed. Labour has to get told so that Sir Keir Starmer can know who he will be facing. As reported earlier, this will be seen as confirmation that Johnson has (understandably) not fully recovered from his three days in intensive care - despite No 10 suggesting otherwise this week. (See 9.22am.) Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, has just started giving evidence to the Commons education committee. Robert Halfon, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, opened by saying the lockdown and school closures could increase the educational divide between rich and poor, generate safeguarding issues, and exacerbate the digital divide. He said there was a \u201cpotential cascade of mounting social injustice that could last a decade\u201d. Williamson said no one wanted to close schools. But, when asked if he had any data illustrating whether disadvantaged pupils were falling behind while working from home, Williamson said he did not have data on that. This is from Steve Back, a photographer who covers Downing Street extensively and who tweets as @PoliticalPics. Access to coronavirus home testing kits for UK essential workers ran out in just over an hour on Wednesday morning. Slots for millions more people, including those over 65 and those who live with them, were available to book on the government website from 8am. Tests at regional drive-through centres ran out in Wales almost immediately but were still available in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland as of 9.15am. PMQs is now less than three hours away, and Downing Street has still not said whether or not Boris Johnson will be appearing. As the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg reports, even Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, does not know who he will be facing. In his daily London Playbook briefing for Politico Europe, Jack Blanchard says the signs suggest Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, will be deputising for Johnson, as he did last week. Blanchard says: The silence out of No 10 was deafening last night as rumours swirled that the PM was not feeling up to a 30-minute Q&amp;A in the chamber, and that his deputy Dominic Raab will again be standing in at noon. One official told Playbook that Johnson\u2019s PMQs prep had been canceled yesterday; another said Raab\u2019s own Commons statement this afternoon has been handed to his deputy Nigel Adams to give Raab space to prepare. And an official tells the Telegraph Johnson is definitely \u201cnot well enough\u201d for PMQs and that \u201cthe deputy will be doing it, unless Boris changes his mind\u201d. Sounds like we may have to wait a little longer for the first Johnson v Starmer head-to-head. Watch this space. Given that it is less than three weeks since Johnson came out of intensive care, it is perfectly understandable that he may not feel well enough to face PMQs. But, if he does stay away, that will rather undermine the line from No 10 that we have been hearing all week that he was back to work full-time and operating as normal. All those briefings about how he was \u201craring to go\u201d will also also look as though they weren\u2019t giving us the full picture. Prof John Newton could not verify the idea that grandparents are safe to hug young grandchildren because they are unlikely to have the virus, adding this is a question \u201cfor the chief medical officer\u201d. Following reports Swiss scientists have said children under 10 pose no risk of infection from Covid-19 because they are rarely infected, Prof Newton said \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty\u201d. Speaking on the Today programme, he said: One of the challenges we have is that coronavirus is a new infection and people are discovering things about it all the time. There\u2019s a lot of uncertainty. We rely on advice from Sage and our chief medical officer ... I know Sage provides its best advice to the government and is constantly updating it. The environment secretary said airlines have had the opportunity to approach the Treasury for help after British Airways revealed plans to make 12,000 workers redundant. Eustice told Sky News: It\u2019s a very difficult situation for many parts of our economy, we recognise that, we\u2019ve not taken these decisions on lockdown lightly. Whole sectors such as catering, hospitality and, yes, airlines have suffered financial distress. We\u2019re very sad to hear this news about British Airways considering these redundancies. We put in place a very wide range of packages to support businesses through this time. If there\u2019s a specific case for a specific airline the Treasury has always been clear that they stand ready to look at any other individual case. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, joining the blog for the day. It\u2019s a relatively busy news day. Here are the main items coming up. 9.30am: Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, is giving evidence to the Commons education committee. 10.30am: Priti Patel, the home secretary, is giving evidence to the home affairs committee. 12pm: PMQs. As explained earlier (see 7.43am), No 10 has still not said whether or not Boris Johnson will be taking PMQs himself. 12.30pm: A Foreign Office minister is due to make a Commons statement on the repatriation of Britons. 2.30pm: Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, gives evidence to the public administration and constitutional affairs committee. 2.30pm: Stephen Barclay, the chief secretary to the Treasury, gives evidence to the Commons Treasury committee. 5pm: The government is expected to hold its daily press conference. This also may be the point where it gives out, for the first time, a daily coronavirus death figure including care home deaths and other non-hospital deaths. Until now the headline daily death figure announced has just covered hospital deaths. All the committee hearings are explicitly related to coronavirus except the Gove one, although in practice that is likely to be dominated by coronavirus too. Morning all, I am now moving into my last half an hour on the Guardian\u2019s UK live blog this morning. Please do get in touch with me if you want to share any comments or have news tips. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com The environment secretary, George Eustice, denied that care homes were \u201coverlooked\u201d in the government\u2019s response to coronavirus. He told Today: No, I don\u2019t accept it was overlooked, but obviously there was a real focus on our NHS because there were concerns that it might be overwhelmed and we wanted to make sure they had absolutely everything they needed. But in the case of care homes, we have always recognised that there was more vulnerability there. He denied that the government had watered down its fifth goal for reducing the lockdown. The environment secretary told Sky News: It has always been the case that we want to avoid that second peak because we want to avoid our NHS being overwhelmed. It was simply the case that on one slide last week that second part of the sentence was omitted and it was added back in on a slide yesterday. I think there\u2019s a sort of obsession about nothing over this, to be honest. Morning all, I am running the Guardian\u2019s UK live blog this morning. Please do get in touch with me if you want to share any comments or have news tips. They are always very much appreciated. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Wallace &amp; Gromit\u2019s creative director has urged teenagers to try crafts usually associated with younger children during lockdown. Taking up anything from Lego to painting can be a relief from the \u201cinward-looking\u201d pressures of social media, Morph director Merlin Crossingham said. \u201cBeing creative\u201d can help \u201cget out of your spiral\u201d or \u201cjust the mundane process of being at home all day\u201d, he said. \u201cLots of children are revisiting creative things they did in the past, whether it\u2019s painting or working with Lego, things they would have done at home,\u201d he told the PA Media news agency. Asked on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme whether the UK would end up with the highest death rate in Europe, Dr Margaret Harris, spokeswoman for the World Health Organization (WHO), said: We won\u2019t really know who had the highest rates, what really went on, until after this is over and we can analyse it properly. Clearly you are having a horrendous outbreak and making a tremendous effort to care for everybody but at this stage it wouldn\u2019t be fair to make a judgment one way or another. The environment secretary said he was confident that enough British crop-pickers would fill the gaps this summer. Eustice told Today: I think it is the case we will need a significant number of British people, in particular those who have been furloughed. I\u2019m confident, actually, that a lot of those furloughed staff will want to lend a hand in June. Airbus is being hit by \u201cthe gravest crisis the aerospace industry has ever known\u201d, its chief executive, Guillaume Faury, has warned. He made the comment as the European plane-maker revealed it lost \u20ac481m (\u00a3419m) in the first three months of the year. Revenues were down 15% compared with the same period in 2019, while commercial aircraft deliveries were down from 162 to 122. Demand for flights has collapsed due to the coronavirus pandemic, with airlines grounding the majority of their fleets and deferring the delivery of new planes. The coronavirus national testing coordinator, Prof John Newton, said the UK had been worse affected by the virus than Germany because of \u201cthe way it arrived in England\u201d. Speaking on LBC, Prof Newton compared Berlin with London, saying London is \u201cso connected to the rest of the world\u201d. \u201cThis is a very unpredictable virus ... it arrives slightly differently,\u201d he said. \u201cThe coronavirus really took hold in England because of the way it arrived. In Germany the virus has spread differently.\u201d Morning everyone, I am running the Guardian\u2019s UK live blog this morning.

Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Excellent article today by my colleague Amy Walker on the bus drivers who are working in Manchester. They tell of passengers\u2019 gratitude and tension over rising death toll. NHS England\u2019s cancer clinical director, Prof Peter Johnson, said \u201cwe\u2019re doing everything we can\u201d to avoid a spike in cancer deaths. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: They [cancer patients] should be in touch with their GP as they normally would. I completely understand that people are worried and frightened about leaving the house, about going to hospitals, about going to appointments, but we\u2019ve taken a huge amount of trouble to make sure that cancer services can be delivered in a safe and protected way. Of course the numbers of people coming forward have gone down and we\u2019re very worried about that, we\u2019re very worried about people being at home with cancers that need to be looked at. Asked about whether a rise in cancer deaths was coming, he said: We\u2019re doing everything we can to avoid that. We anticipated this problem and we expected we would have to deal with this. Dr Jane Goodall, an English primatologist and anthropologist, has said that humans need to reconsider their relationship with the animal world after the coronavirus pandemic. A tweet today to show the stories behind those who have died in the outbreak. The UK\u2019s coronavirus national testing coordinator, Prof John Newton, has said he expects a \u201csubstantial number\u201d of people living in care homes will have died, ahead of the government\u2019s release of the figures on Wednesday. Speaking on LBC, Prof Newton said: We have always known that a proportion of cases have been in care homes. Sadly coronavirus affects older people a lot more ... There will be a substantial number (of deaths). He added the government is \u201cmassively increasing\u201d the number of tests carried out on those living and working in care homes. Newton stressed those newly eligible for coronavirus tests should only apply for a test if they have symptoms. The government announced on Tuesday that millions more people, including all over-65s and those living with them, were now eligible for coronavirus testing. Newton said: \u201cThis is for people who are unwell with coronavirus symptoms, and their households ... it\u2019s not a screen.\u201d He added there are a \u201cnumber of ways\u201d people can access the test, including over 40 drive-in centres, and a limited number of postage tests sent directly to homes. \u201cIf you have symptoms, go on to gov.uk and there\u2019s a special link that tells you how to log on and get a test,\u201d he said. The environment secretary, George Eustice, said the aim is still to meet the 100,000-a-day testing target by the end of Thursday. He told BBC Breakfast: Yes that is his aim to get 100,000 tests being done but I think the critical thing here is [if there is] anybody there who needs a test that can\u2019t get one, which is why capacity also matters. That\u2019s why the first thing is to build the capacity and the second thing is to make sure that everybody knows they can get access to that test and we\u2019re now doing both of those things. He said the search for an effective antibody test was still under way. Eustice denied that the earlier introduction of wider testing at care homes would have saved lives. Asked if tests not being available earlier for care home workers had cost lives, he told BBC Breakfast: I don\u2019t think it is in that we\u2019ve been working very very closely with the care sector and they have had very clear protocols in place. Because those staff are dealing with obviously very vulnerable cohort, the elderly, sometimes people with other conditions, if they are showing any symptoms at all then they must not be at work. Obviously testing does help and we\u2019re now able to roll that testing out. Clinical trials on potential Covid-19 treatments could start within weeks. Six drugs will initially enter the programme being set up under the Accelerating Covid-19 Research &amp; Development (Accord) platform. It is part of a bid to fast-track new therapies to help tackle the disease. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said its aim is to accelerate the development of drugs for patients admitted to hospital with coronavirus and reduce the time it takes to set up clinical studies from months to just weeks. The DHSC said the first of the potential drugs is beginning phase 2 studies across the UK \u201cimminently\u201d, the point at which a clinical trial focuses on testing a drug on patients to assess its effectiveness and any side effects. Research by the National Youth Agency, which works with youth organisations and young people across the UK, and the children\u2019s commissioner, published on Wednesday, shows that there are now 3 million vulnerable young people in England who need support with family relationships, mental health, domestic abuse, or other needs. That\u2019s 2 million more vulnerable eight- to 19-year-olds needing help because of the pandemic. Passengers travelling with P&amp;O Cruises will be forced to pass \u201crigorous\u201d medical checks before being allowed to board ships once sailings resume, the company said. The UK\u2019s biggest cruise line told the PA Media news agency it is developing plans to introduce a series of \u201cstringent measures\u201d to ensure it obeys international health guidelines when it restarts operations once the coronavirus pandemic recedes. Other changes being considered include reducing the capacity of ships, scrapping self-service buffets and implementing one-way systems on board. Earlier this month, easyJet announced it expected to keep middle seats empty on its planes when it restarts flights to enable social distancing. P&amp;O Cruises president Paul Ludlow said the cruise line was working with authorities such as Public Health England to ensure sailings adhere to guidance \u201cwithout compromising enjoyment and experience\u201d. He continued: \u201cThese new stringent measures which may, no doubt, encompass rigorous pre-embarkation screening, changes to the onboard experience for guests and also working with our shore experience operators and ports of call, will be in place as soon as we reintroduce our ships. \u201cWe will then get used to them in the same way as we got used to airline hand luggage restrictions. \u201cThey will become the new normal and they will give us reassurance and peace of mind.\u201d P&amp;O Cruises confirmed last week that its sailings are suspended until at least the end of July. Below is a summary of the latest developments, please get in touch with news tips. Almost 18,000 more people with cancer in England could die after the coronavirus pandemic led hospitals to suspend treatment and deterred patients from seeking NHS care, research has found. Cancer experts claim that an extra 6,270 people in England who have been newly diagnosed with the disease could die from it over the next 12 months as a direct result of the disruption caused by coronavirus, and the additional toll taking into account all those living with cancer could be 17,915.That is an increase of 20% on the 89,576 deaths among cancer patients recorded annually in England, according to the latest available statistics. Ministers are split over whether to change government advice on wearing face masks, with Matt Hancock, the health secretary, stressing that the evidence for them was weak despite Scotland\u2019s decision to recommend cloth coverings in some public places. British Airways has set out plans to make up to 12,000 of its staff redundant because of the global collapse in air travel in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. The airline\u2019s chief executive, Alex Cruz, told BA\u2019s 42,000 staff on Tuesday night that the company \u201cmust act decisively now to ensure that British Airways has a strong future\u201d and that means more than one in four jobs must be cut. According to the Johns Hopkins researchers, at least 3,116,680 people have been infected worldwide and at least 217,168 have died since the outbreak began. The numbers are likely to be significant underestimates due to suspected underreporting and differing testing and recording systems around the world. US cases account for roughly a third of the known global total, at over 1 million. Films released on streaming platforms only will be eligible for Academy Awards next year because of the pandemic\u2019s disruption to the industry, the organisers of the Oscars have said. The change will only apply to films released this year. Previously, a film would have required a minimum seven-day theatrical run in a Los Angeles county commercial theatre in order to be considered. Now films that had a previously planned theatrical release but are made available through on-demand service may qualify for best picture and other categories.

Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Downing Street was unable to say on Tuesday night if Boris Johnson would face Keir Starmer at prime minister\u2019s questions on Wednesday. With less than 24 hours before the prime minister was due to appear in the House of Commons, Labour had not been informed whether Johnson would be fit enough to face Starmer, the new leader of the opposition, across the dispatch box. No 10 said it could not confirm whether Johnson would take part, after he returned to work in Downing Street full-time on Monday amid reports he was \u201craring to go\u201d. He was described on Tuesday by Downing Street as \u201cfine\u201d after he chaired the daily morning coronavirus meeting and then met the chancellor and cabinet secretary. He spent the rest of the day in meetings, reading papers and doing box work. The high-street giant Next has said that the impact of the coronavirus lockdown on trading has been \u201cfaster and steeper\u201d than expected and said sales would remain under pressure throughout 2020. Next, which reopened for online trading on 14 April, reported a 41% plunge in sales over its first quarter to 25 April, with high-street sales down 52% and online sales off 32%. It said it now believed full-year sales could fall by as much as 40%, with the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic expected to leave sales lower in every quarter, even after lockdown restrictions are lifted. Sales are expected to tumble by as much as 62% over its second quarter in the worst-case scenario. The home secretary, Priti Patel, will be grilled by MPs about how her department has responded to the coronavirus outbreak. Members of the Commons home affairs committee will question Patel during a virtual hearing on Wednesday morning. She will be joined by the department\u2019s permanent secretary, Matthew Rycroft, and second permanent secretary, Shona Dunn, to be questioned about crime, policing and immigration. In particular Patel is expected to be asked about NHS visa extensions, difficulties with the EU settlement scheme, the measures taken to help victims of domestic and child abuse as well as migrants and asylum seekers during the outbreak and the provision of personal protective equipment (PPE) for police.

      "body": "<p>As coronavirus tore through jails and prisons across the United States, California reduced bail for most low-level offenses to $0, allowing thousands of defendants<strong> </strong>to wait out their court dates at home instead of in custody.</p> <p>The response across the criminal justice system in the state has been disparate, echoing longstanding tensions about reform. Prosecutors in Tulare county have \u201cworked around the clock\u201d to oppose the early release of more than 1,000 defendants, according to the district attorney there.

Under $0 bail, Boudin said only in very rare cases \u2013 for example, if a defendant had a history of reoffending or if the crime was very serious \u2013 would his prosecutors seek a way to keep the person in custody.</p> <p>\u201cEvery level of government is saying we must reduce the prison population, and we must do it quickly and we must do it properly,\u201d Boudin said. \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable for any local jurisdiction to choose not to follow the law when that insubordination puts the health and wellbeing of everyone at risk.\u201d</p> <p>In Tulare county, a rural region in the heart of the Central Valley, Tim Ward, the district attorney, <a href=\"https://tulareda.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/4-13-20-Emergency-Bail-Order-PR.pdf\">called</a> the $0 bail \u201creckless\u201d and \u201ca disservice to victims of crime, business owners, and the community as a whole\u201d.

You can\u2019t have a zero bail warrant.\u201d</p> <p>But California prosecutors only have to file a complaint to ensure that they do not violate the statute of limitations on a case, and a Los Angeles county prosecutor, who asked not to be named out of fear of retaliation, said it\u2019s not necessary to file a dollar amount on an arrest warrant to file a complaint.</p> <p>\u201cRight now, with the coronavirus, there are a limited amount of people who are trying to get out of their criminal cases,\u201d Lacey said. \u201cWe\u2019re letting people out and putting cases over, but it\u2019s not our intent to let people off the hook for criminal behavior that should be addressed.\u201d</p> <h2>Frustrated officers</h2> <p>Since the start of the pandemic, overall crime and calls for services have gone down across California. The state\u2019s police unions have attributed the decline to the stay-at-home order \u2013 with more people indoors, there are fewer potential victims \u2013 and think it\u2019s only a matter of time before crime will pick back up, in part because of the $0 bail schedule.</p> <p>Some law enforcement departments have publicly aired their frustration with the new bail.<strong> </strong>\u201cDon Joseph was arrested for possession of a stolen vehicle and released from custody per the statewide $0 bail order,\u201d <a href=\"http://nixle.us/BS9E8\">said the Chino Hills </a><a href=\"http://nixle.us/BS9E8\">police </a><a href=\"http://nixle.us/BS9E8\">department</a>. \u201cReleased on court order zero bail \u2026 37 mins later he walked to Dublin (Bart station) and carjacked victim,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ACSOSheriffs/status/1252328587576750080?s=20\">tweeted</a> the Alameda county sheriff\u2019s department.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"415536d6710b1e15832ab8dbfde575931371450e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/415536d6710b1e15832ab8dbfde575931371450e/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Overall crime and calls for services have gone down across California since the start of the pandemic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Overall crime and calls for services have gone down across California since the start of the pandemic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sandy Huffaker/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cPeople are incarcerated because they did bad actions,\u201d said Craig Lally, the president of the Los Angeles Police Protective League, the LA police union. \u201cPeople who are in jail are most likely in jail because they did it more than once,\u201d he added, though<strong> </strong>many defendants held in jails have not yet been convicted, and are there because they can\u2019t afford bail.</p> <p>Police officers right now are frustrated, Lally said.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re trying to do their job, they\u2019re trying to protect people the best they can, and when they get the criminal elements, and they get the person they\u2019ve arrested before, who have been doing it pretty much their whole lives, you\u2019re never going to reform that person,\u201d Lally said. \u201cThat\u2019s the lifestyle that they chose probably since they were 16 years old.

People are dying. It\u2019s going to stay in the jail and spread in the jail and get sent back outside,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Raphling pointed out that making the jails safer from an outbreak went beyond reducing the numbers of detainees. Los Angeles county made huge strides in reducing its population from 17,076 to 11,883, but the facility was rated at capacity at 12,000. The county got the population down to just below what the jail was supposed to have at capacity, meaning there would be little room to create physical distancing and isolation and quarantine quarters.</p> <h2>\u2018It shouldn\u2019t take a global pandemic\u2019</h2> <p>From the response he\u2019s seen so far to the emergency bail schedule, Raphling feels a cautious sense of optimism about the future of bail reform in California.</p> <p>\u201cThere are a lot of things about this disease that have exposed the problems with our society, and mass incarceration, the jailing of people for fairly harmless behavior, that\u2019s a huge problem in this country and hopefully people are seeing that,\u201d he said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People are getting sick.

It\u2019s a matter of justice and public health, and I\u2019m confident that the data on the impact of these emergency measures will be on the side of meaningful reform,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact is that we shouldn\u2019t have so many people held in jails awaiting trial or court hearings,\u201d Kives continued. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t take a global pandemic to highlight the public health argument for decarceration, but that\u2019s where we are, and I hope it\u2019s a wake-up call.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "As coronavirus tore through jails and prisons across the United States, California reduced bail for most low-level offenses to $0, allowing thousands of defendants to wait out their court dates at home instead of in custody. The response across the criminal justice system in the state has been disparate, echoing longstanding tensions about reform. Prosecutors in Tulare county have \u201cworked around the clock\u201d to oppose the early release of more than 1,000 defendants, according to the district attorney there. In Los Angeles, leaked emails showed the district attorney\u2019s office instructing prosecutors to seek a loophole in the new bail schedule for some cases. And police unions in cities across California have argued the emergency schedule will lead to an uptick in crime. Hanging over the bail schedule debate is a referendum in November, when Californians will get to decide whether the state should eliminate its bail system moving forward. The success or failure of the emergency guideline, beyond the infection rate of the state\u2019s inmate population, has the very real possibility of becoming a talking point in all future debates for bail reform for years to come, criminal justice reform advocates say. \u201cI hope when this is said and done, we can all look back and radically rethink the criminal justice policies that exacerbated this public health crisis,\u201d said Lydia Kives, a staff attorney with the Bail Project, a not-for-profit that provides free bail assistance for thousands of low-income individuals each year. \u201cWe should never have had this many people at risk in jail just because they could not afford bail.\u201d \u2018Outdated, unsafe, unfair\u2019 The emergency bail schedule issued on 6 April by the state\u2019s judicial council, the policymaking body for California\u2019s courts, works in two parts: those held on bail pre-trial will be released from jail and any people arrested during the course of the pandemic for most misdemeanors and low-level felonies will be held on $0 bail, and thereby released. Serious and violent felonies such as murder, rape, robbery, assault with a deadly weapon and kidnapping are excluded from the emergency schedule, as well as domestic abuse, violating a protective order and driving under the influence. Judges also retain discretion to keep inmates detained before their trial for good cause, or to put conditions on their release, said Blaine Corren, the public affairs analyst with the judicial council. Behind the rollout was a sense of panicked urgency as jails and prisons across the country reported alarming clusters of infections among inmates. The top doctor at Rikers Island warned at the start of April that the notorious New York jail was a \u201cpublic health disaster unfolding before our own eyes\u201d. The Cook county jail in Chicago reported hundreds of infections among its inmates. But they also followed years of debate around America\u2019s money bail system, which advocates say has created a two-tier justice system that fuels mass incarceration. In California, more than 63% of inmates in the county jail system have not been convicted or pleaded guilty, meaning that the majority of the state\u2019s jail population is incarcerated while awaiting trial. While some may remain in custody due to the severity of the crime that they have been accused of, more remain simply because they cannot afford to pay the bail needed to guarantee their freedom. Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye, who chairs the judicial council, previously called the money bail system \u201coutdated, unsafe, and unfair\u201d. \u2018It\u2019s not our intent to let people off the hook\u2019 The response to the emergency guidelines has followed the fault lines that have long formed that debate: public defenders cheered it, police unions raised alarms about it.

Since 5 April, an estimated 3,174 inmates have been released from county jails across California for issues related to Covid, according to the Board of State and Community Corrections. The statewide adult inmate population has dropped from 72,437 in late February to 54,561 in mid April. Bookings into custody dropped from 17,140 to 6,880 during that same time period.

The county got the population down to just below what the jail was supposed to have at capacity, meaning there would be little room to create physical distancing and isolation and quarantine quarters. \u2018It shouldn\u2019t take a global pandemic\u2019 From the response he\u2019s seen so far to the emergency bail schedule, Raphling feels a cautious sense of optimism about the future of bail reform in California. \u201cThere are a lot of things about this disease that have exposed the problems with our society, and mass incarceration, the jailing of people for fairly harmless behavior, that\u2019s a huge problem in this country and hopefully people are seeing that,\u201d he said. Law enforcement was adamant that whatever occurs under the $0 bail schedule cannot be used in future bail reform discussions. \u201cIt\u2019s dishonest,\u201d said Kelly, the head of the San Jose police union. \u201cThese misguided judges and the professional apologists for criminals saw an opportunity to utilize Covid-19 to advance their dangerous views on incarceration.\u201d But Kives, the staff attorney with The Bail Project, emphasized the importance of collecting data right now. \u201cI hope those who question the need for bail reform will look at this dire situation, where cash bail is literally trapping people in overcrowded jails as this deadly virus spreads, and reconsider their position. It\u2019s a matter of justice and public health, and I\u2019m confident that the data on the impact of these emergency measures will be on the side of meaningful reform,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact is that we shouldn\u2019t have so many people held in jails awaiting trial or court hearings,\u201d Kives continued. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t take a global pandemic to highlight the public health argument for decarceration, but that\u2019s where we are, and I hope it\u2019s a wake-up call.\u201d",

Here are some answers.</p> \n<h2><strong>What is the UK\u2019s actual official death toll so far?</strong></h2> \n<p>The \u201cofficial\u201d death toll, if you go by what the UK government present to the public every day in Downing Street, is 26,097 deaths as of 5pm 28 April. Until Wednesday this figure focused solely on people who have died in hospital, however an additional 3,811 deaths in care homes and the community have now been included. Deaths in all settings where a positive Covid-19 test has been recorded by Public Health England will now be reflected in the figures each day, according to the government.</p> \n<p> However, even this doesn\u2019t appear to be entirely straightforward. Figures recorded by the <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/numberofdeathsincarehomesnotifiedtothecarequalitycommissionengland\">Office for National Statistics and the Care Quality Commission</a> show at least 4,996 deaths were recorded in care homes in the two weeks to 24 April \u2013 a toll which is clearly at odds with the government\u2019s latest figures, as many of the deceased will not have been tested. In addition to this, the key government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/why-what-we-think-we-know-about-the-uks-coronavirus-death-toll-is-wrong\">figure is lagging</a>, as it can take days or weeks for some deaths to be counted. Clearly this widely circulated figure, even when deaths in the community are included, is an undercount.</p> \n<p>It will take weeks to get to a proper sense of how many people have died. The final official figure will come from the statistical agencies of the four nations and is based on the number of death certificates which mention Covid-19. The number of Covid-19 fatalities exceeded 20,000 in England and Wales on 15 April, although the official figure released by the government only passed 20,000 on 25 April. We now know that as of 17 April the true total number of deaths was 55% higher than the official figure from the Department of Health and Social Care in England and Wales.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/apr/2020-04-28T10:59:40/embed.html\" data-alt=\"The number of Covid-19 deaths registered in England and Wales passed 20,000 on 15 April\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/apr/2020-04-28T10:59:40/embed.html\">The number of Covid-19 deaths registered in England and Wales passed 20,000 on 15 April</a> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Are care home deaths going to exceed hospital deaths, as some experts have suggested?</strong></h2> \n<p>The figures to date do not show deaths in care homes are exceeding those in hospitals in England and Wales but it\u2019s possible the impact of the virus is on different trajectories in different places.</p> \n<p>There are more than 15,000 care homes in England and 3,096 deaths were recorded in care homes in England and Wales as of 17 April.

      "bodyText": "The number of deaths from coronavirus in care homes may have to be revised upwards, a senior Public Health England official has admitted, as the government confirmed the total number of deaths from the pandemic has risen to more than 26,000. After indicating that deaths in care homes and in the community may still be rising, Yvonne Doyle, PHE\u2019s medical director, told Wednesday\u2019s daily Downing Street press briefing the figure for deaths may be revised again. \u201cIn due course those deaths sadly may occur on death certificates, so we may expect more than we are seeing at the moment, yes,\u201d she said. Doyle\u2019s words followed the announcement that 26,097 patients had died across the UK after testing positive for coronavirus. That was 3,811 deaths more than the figure available on Tuesday, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said. The jump followed a change in how the toll is calculated, with the number of deaths in care homes and the wider community included in the government\u2019s daily updates from now on. The total reached by the new method of reporting is around 17% higher than previous data showed and includes an additional 3,811 deaths recorded since the start of the outbreak. Of these extra fatalities, around 70% were outside hospital settings and around 30% were in hospital. Raab said: \u201cI think it is important to say that those additional deaths were spread over the period for 2 March to 28 April so they don\u2019t represent a sudden surge in the number of deaths.\u201d Separate data from PHE showed that more than 30% of all care homes in England have reported suspected or confirmed coronavirus outbreaks. While new data showed that hospital deaths were falling, Doyle said she could not yet say whether deaths in care homes were doing the same. \u201cWe should know that soon because the hospital curve has declined,\u201d she said. Doyle said the care home sector was \u201cmost complex\u201d with 16,000 homes and the need for local intelligence to identify where there were issues. \u201cThe scale and the speed of this epidemic is really in the last couple of weeks. \u201cThere is a huge national and local endeavour to not just test \u2013 which is very important \u2013 but also understand the measures that make a difference in care homes and to look at that in a very rapid way, looking at the evidence, so that we can put in place measures that protect people.\u201d Asked if deaths could have been avoided if there had been better testing and screening for care home residents, Raab said there was \u201calways learning in an unprecedented crisis like this that we will want to feed back in\u201d. \u201cThe key thing above all is to manage the ebb and flow of people into those care homes that might carry the virus, and that of course includes family members and friends, it includes people that are working in more than one care home setting, it includes NHS staff. \u201cSo on top of testing and PPE \u2026 I think that is probably the single most important aspect,\u201d Raab said. He acknowledged there had been a \u201cdistribution issue\u201d in getting tests for care home staff and residents. \u201cWe have expanded the eligibility. Eligibility now includes anyone in a care home whether resident or staff. \u201cWe have obviously had a distribution issue, there is no sugar coating the challenge we have had with that,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "And finally, Wall Street has closed at its highest level in seven weeks. Stocks were lifted by the Fed\u2019s commitment to act appropriately to protect the US economy from the Covid-19 recession, and by optimism that economies will recover as lockdowns are eased soon. The Dow has ended the day at 24,633 points, up 2.2% or 532 points. Goodnight. GW Here\u2019s some reaction to the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate decision, and Jay Powell\u2019s press conference. Seema Shah, Chief Strategist at Principal Global Investors, said: Powell acknowledged that the economic devastation has been a deliberate policy choice, and therefore the central bank must do whatever it takes to reduce the economic pain. \u201cCertainly, Powell made a convincing attempt to reassure financial markets that the Fed will not look to tighten financial conditions prematurely just because equities are rallying.... \u201cPowell\u2019s own statement provided a very sobering assessment of the economic impact, acknowledging that this will not just be a short, sharp shock but a more prolonged event that will continue to weigh heavily on the global economy over the medium term. Ronald Temple, Head of US equity, Lazard Asset Management: \u201cToday the Fed acknowledged that the devil is in the details when it comes to injecting massive liquidity into the corporate sector. In the three weeks since announcing $2.3 trillion of liquidity through seven facilities, the Fed has only lent $8 billion through one of them, the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility. Anna Stupnytska, head of global macro at Fidelity International: \u201cThe Fed\u2019s messaging makes it clear that while the Committee considers its current policy stance including the numerous lending programmes sufficient for now, they are ready to intervene further if needed. Given the extreme uncertainty about the outlook which largely depends on the virus trajectory with many moving parts - including any breakthroughs on therapeutic treatments, vaccines, testing and tracing technologies- it is hard to predict if or when the Fed will have to expand the scope of some of its programmes in the future. \u201cBut with the recovery likely to be sluggish and patchy, with social distancing measures potentially remaining in place for another 12-18 months, we think there will be a need for further action over the next few weeks - this would include increasing the size of some facilities, changing their terms as well as possibly creating new ones to provide assistance to specific sectors such as housing.\u201d And finally... Jerome Powell assure his audience that the Fed is in no hurry to raise interest rates, and will be very patient. Jerome Powell is then challenged about the \u2018moral hazard\u2019 issue -- isn\u2019t the Fed trying to keep asset prices up? Powell insists that the Fed just wants to ensure markets are functioning properly... rather than seizing up. [Fair enough...except markets only seem to be misfiring when asset prices start falling sharply...] On the other hand..... Fed chair Jerome Powell has brushed aside concerns that the US budget deficit is going to soar due to the cost of fighting the coronavirus pandemic. Powell stirringly insists that the priority is to use the \u201cgreat fiscal power of the United States\u201d to support the economy through the crisis. Then in time, perhaps \u201creasonably soon\u201d, policymakers can think about a long-term way to get America\u2019s fiscal house in order, he tells reporters. Jerome Powell cautions that there is even more uncertainty over the economic outlook than usual. But we do know some things. In the short term, the US faces a sharp contraction in economic activity, high unemployment, and lower consumer spending and business investment, he explains. But then the economy will start to recover. We don\u2019t know when that will happen, but it could be in the third quarter of 2020 and it could be a rapid bounceback - but probably not back to pre-crisis levels quickly. However, Powell also points to the risk of a second wave of infections, and is unwilling to speculate on exactly how the recovery would pay out. Looking ahead, Jerome Powell warns that it will take \u201csome time\u201d for US unemployment to return to more normal levels. So the Fed is not in any hurry to withdraw its current support for the economy, he insists. Here\u2019s a clip of Jerome Powell pledging to keep helping the US economy recover from the Covid-19 crisis. Jay Powell is then challenged for not taking enough risks to help the US economy. Q: Why is the Fed focusing its help on firms who they\u2019re confident can repay loans - surely they need help less? Under US law, the Fed can\u2019t lend to insolvent companies, Powell explains. Powell is now taking questions from America\u2019s economics reporters, on a video conference call. Q: What more can the Federal Reserve to support the economy? Powell says the Fed will act \u201cforcefully, proactively, and aggressively\u201d, and then declares that even more measures may be needed - on top of its new lending programmes, credit facilities and asset purchase schemes. It may well be the case that the economy will need more support from all of us, if the recovery is to be a robust one. Fed chair Jerome Powell also warns that the US economy will suffer an \u2018unprecedented\u2019 plunge in activity in the current quarter (having already shrunk by 4.8% per year in the last quarter). Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell is holding a press conference now, to explain why the Fed left interest rates on hold. He begins by focusing on the Covid-19 crisis and the \u201ctragic loss and tremendous hardship\u201d being suffered by victims of the virus in America and across the globe. Powell expresses the Federal Reserve\u2019s \u201csincere gratitude to those who put themselves at risk to help others\u201d. Turning to economics, he warns that the impact of the crisis is \u2018severe\u2019 - and not yet visible in the data. Next week\u2019s US labor market report will show that the jobless rate has jumped to double-digits, he predicts, up from 50 year lows two months ago. Here\u2019s the key line from the Federal Reserve tonight: The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term. In light of these developments, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals. Newsflash: America\u2019s central bank has voted to leave interest rates at their current record lows, and dropped a clear hint that they\u2019re not moving soon. The Federal Reserve left its headline Fed Funds rate at 0%-0.25% -- maintaining its emergency rate cut of Sunday 15th March. The Fed\u2019s FOMC committee says that rates will stay there until the economy has weathered recent events, and is on track to hit its employment and inflation goals. The FOMC also warns that America\u2019s public health crisis is weighing heavily on the economy, and poses a \u201csignificant risk\u201d to the outlook in the medium term. It warns: The coronavirus outbreak is causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. The virus and the measures taken to protect public health are inducing sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job losses. Weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices are holding down consumer price inflation. The disruptions to economic activity here and abroad have significantly affected financial conditions and have impaired the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. Here\u2019s our news story on today\u2019s markets rally: Over at the White House, health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci has told reporters that the latest tests of remdesivir on Covid-19 patience showed \u201cquite good news\u201d. Fauci said he was told data from the trial showed a \u201cclear cut positive effect in diminishing time to recover.\u201d CNBC reports: Fauci said patients taking the drug usually took 11 days to recover, compared to 15 days in the placebo group. He said the mortality benefit of remdesivir \u201chas not yet reached statistical significance.\u201d As flagged earlier, Gilead said those tests showed that half the severely ill patients treated with remdesivir recovered and were released from hospital within two weeks. However.... according to the AFP newswire, another test has not gone so well. This is from our main coronavirus liveblog: Treating coronavirus patients with the antiviral drug remdesivir showed no \u201csignificant clinical benefits\u201d in the first randomised trial of its kind, according to research released on Wednesday, AFP reports. In a study among more than 200 Covid-19 patients in Wuhan, China, published in The Lancet, doctors found no positive effects of administering the drug compared with a control group of adults. Bloomberg\u2019s John Authers has an interesting theory about the market rally. He suspects that investors are piling back into riskier assets because they\u2019re less worried that they\u2019ll catch Covid-19 themselves, rather than really thinking about the wider economic damage being caused. He writes: The rest of the week will have plenty of earnings announcements and central bank meetings to give rational reasons to buy or sell the market. Beyond that, the reduction in personal fear of the virus, and the unquestionable successes in holding it back, may have led to an irrational reduction in estimates of the economic damage. Scientists in China suggest that Covid-19 could become a recurring seasonal disease; Singapore has been hit by a second wave of infections after apparently fighting off a first successfully; Germany has started to reopen its economy and already faces concerns that it has done so too soon. Production might be able to return to normal reasonably swiftly over the next few months \u2014 but surely consumption cannot be anywhere close to normal again until there is a vaccine. Or maybe I am just saying that because I live in a community where the problem is still severe. I fear that the market rally has been driven by people for whom the virus seems less immediate and close, and who have moved from excessive fear to over-optimistic forecasts that the disease will now disappear. Here\u2019s the full piece- well worth a read. UK pub chain Wetherspoons has told the City tonight that it expects to keep its pubs closed until late June. It made the prediction as it announced a new equity placing to raise \u00a3140m, to tide it through the lockdown. Wetherspoons argued that it is relatively well-placed to handle social distancing rules, once restrictions are eased. The company is likely to make some changes to its operating model, assuming increased social distancing, and anticipates a gradual recovery in customer numbers. Wetherspoon pubs are substantially larger than average, and most have outside facilities. The company believes these factors are likely to assist if social distancing measures apply. However... the government hasn\u2019t yet said when it will start to lift the current lockdown, and many analysts suspect pubs will not be the first places to reopen either. A dozen European Union member states have called for a relaxation of air-passenger rights rules to help airlines deal with the economic fallout from coronavirus. France, Poland, the Netherlands and Ireland are among the 12 countries who have proposed amending EU rules, so airlines can reimburse cancelled tickets with vouchers, rather than cash. Air-France/KLM and Lufthansa are currently negotiating government bailouts, while British Airways has announced plans to make 12,000 employees redundant, as the virus has brought international travel to a near standstill, leaving planes grounded. The 12 member states argue the requirement of a 2004 EU regulation to reimburse cancelled flights in cash is adding to airlines\u2019 cash-flow problems. The joint statement calls on the European commission, which oversees EU law, to urgently amend the law, declaring: The goal shared by the European Union and its member states must now be to preserve the structure of the European air traffic market beyond the current crisis, while considering the interests and necessary protection of passengers. The EU\u2019s 27 transport ministers are holding a conference call to discuss an exit from current restrictions. So far the commission has declined to say publicly whether it backs the voucher plan. European commission vice president V\u0115ra Jourov\u00e1 told reporters earlier today. \u201cThe debate is ongoing so I am not now giving you the final word,\u201d But her colleague in charge of transport, Adina V\u0103lean, has previously said airlines can only offer vouchers if passengers can accept them. Ministers are also looking at what green strings should be attached to airline bailouts. France\u2019s transport minister \u00c9lisabeth Borne has said government aid for Air France would be linked to cutting pollution, including a 50% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2024 for domestic flights and fleet renewal to cut total emissions. The markets may be flying today, but the long-term cost of the pandemic will be very large.... something that is worrying politicians. Mel Stride, the Conservative MP who chairs parliament\u2019s influential Treasury Select Committee, has warned today that there needs to be debate about who should bear the heaviest levels of additional taxation to support the economy, once the country emerges from lockdown. Stride told the BBC\u2019s Radio 4 that: \u201cThe public finances will clearly be under significantly more pressure because there will be more debt that the economy is having to service and bear, there will be very difficult choices there around spending on the one hand and taxation on the other,\u201d Stride added that often younger people and the lowest paid have been most impacted by the disruption caused by the coronavirus crisis. Today\u2019s rally means the FTSE 100 has surged by over 20% since March 23, when it closed at just 4993 points. That means the blue-chip index is back in Bull Market territory (defined as a fifth above a recent low). That\u2019s a relief to large and small investors alike (anyone saving for a pension has been hit by this year\u2019s slump). But the FTSE 100 is still down 18% so far this year, so maybe hold back on the bunting.... Back on Wall Street, the Dow is up 2.3% or 549 points higher at 24,651 points. Boeing is the top riser, up 8%, after it revealed plans to cut 10% of its workforce (see earlier post) American Express and VISA are also leading the risers, up 5%, on hopes that consumer spending may recover soon if lockdown rules are eased. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has closed at a new seven-week high, lifted by optimism that the worst of the coronavirus crisis could be behind us soon. The blue-chip index has ended the day up 156 points, or 2.6%, at 6115 points. That\u2019s its highest level since Tuesday 10th March (the day after Crash Monday), and the biggest one-day rise since 17th April. Many recently-unloved stocks had a very strong day, with cruise operator Carnival jumping 16%, energy supplier Centrica gaining 15%, and budget airline easyJet up 12%. European markets also rallied hard, with Germany\u2019s DAX up almost 3%. David Madden of CMC Markets says Gilead\u2019s encouraging news about remdesivir\u2019s effects on Covid-19 patients helped drive the rally. European stock markets higher as traders are optimistic that lockdowns could be loosened. Some countries have reopened small parts of their respective economies, and there is a general feeling in the markets that we are likely to see more of this in the months ahead. Traders are also bullish on stocks due to a report that showed some progress had been made in relation to a possible treatment for Covid-19. It is understood that Gilead Science\u2019s antiviral drug, Remdesivir, showed \u2018positive data\u2019 in a trail. There has been some back and forth in relation to the drug in question, but for now the sentiment seems to be positive. The FTSE 100 and the DAX 30 both hit levels last seen in early March. Oil is rallying hard, after the latest inventory figures showed a smaller rise in crude stocks than expected. US crude oil inventories rose by 9 million barrels in the week to 24 April, the Energy Information Administration reports. Economists had expected a 10.6m rise. Gasoline stocks fell by 3.7m barrels, against forecasts of a 2.5m rise. This appears to be calming concerns that producers are running out of places to store energy stocks. In response, a barrel of US crude for June delivery now costs $16.26 per barrel - up $4, or 32%, today. Back in the UK, Royal Bank of Scotland is holding its AGM - virtually. Speaking by video call, CEO Alison Rose flagged up the impact of the coronavirus on the bank, and the economy: \u201cWe will shortly release our Results for Q1, so you will understand that I am restricted in how much I can say about our financial performance so far this year. It\u2019s widely expected that the coronavirus pandemic will continue to have a serious impact on the economy, and consequently impact our performance, especially over the short-to-medium term. Along with the Board, my executive team and I are actively managing against that disruption, ensuring we offer the support our customers need while maintaining a prudent approach to risk.\u201d Chairman Sir Howard Davies took a similar line, warning that Covid-19 will have a \u201cstark and long-lasting\u201d impact. Virtual AGMs aren\u2019t quite the same as the real thing -- no chance to grab the board for a chat, and no nibbles either! But on the upside, we get a glimpse at their impressive bookshelves: Gilead\u2019s shares are up 4.6% today at $82.30 per share, following its announcement. With the Nasdaq index now up 3%, Edward Moya of trading firm OANDA says traders are fixated on the remdesivir results. The US recession is beginning, but financial markets seem to only care about Gilead\u2019s Remdesivir. Risk appetite is roaring back on news that positive data came out of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases\u2019 (NIAID) study of the investigational antiviral remdesivir for the treatment of Covid-19. Today\u2019s main event was not the Fed policy decision, nor that the US economy shrank by 4.8%, the sharpest pace since the Great Recession, but news that Gilead\u2019s anti-viral drug Remdesivir met the primary endpoint of a government run study to treat the COVID-19. Astonishingly, America\u2019s slump into recession is partly due to a decline in heathcare spending - in the middle of a pandemic. That\u2019s because many operations and procedures can\u2019t take place, either because hospitals are dealing with Covid-19 patients, or because physical distancing rules mean medics must stay away. Economics professor Justin Wolfers shows that half of the drop in GDP can be attributed to healthcare: Jason Furman, formally economics advisor to Barack Obama, is surprised: It appears that Gilead &gt; GDP today. Stocks have jumped at the start of trading in New York. Investors are focusing on the positive trial news about remdesivir\u2019s effects on Covid-19 patients, rather than the dire US GDP figures. The Dow Jones industrial average has gained 401 points, or 1.6%, to 24,503 points, with the S&amp;P 500 up 1.9%. Markets are shrugging off the looming US recession, and grasping onto hopes of a medical breakthrough for Covid-19 treatments. US biopharmaceutical company Gilead has excited investors by announcing positive results from a trial of its antiviral drug remdesivir, to test if it could help severely ill COVID-19 patients. In a statement, Gilead said remdesivir had shown positive results when given to patients for either a five-day or 10-day course of treatment. Preliminary results showed that more than half of patients in both groups improved, and had been discharged from hospital by the 14th day after starting the treatment. Merdad Parsey, chief medical officer at Gilead Sciences, says there were similar results between those on the five and 10-day trial: These study results complement data from the placebo-controlled study of remdesivir conducted by the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases and help to determine the optimal duration of treatment with remdesivir. The study demonstrates the potential for some patients to be treated with a 5-day regimen, which could significantly expand the number of patients who could be treated with our current supply of remdesivir. This is particularly important in the setting of a pandemic, to help hospitals and healthcare workers treat more patients in urgent need of care.\u201d Gilead also reports that patients who received remdesivir earlier were more likely to be released from hospital faster: In an exploratory analysis, patients in the study who received remdesivir within 10 days of symptom onset had improved outcomes compared with those treated after more than 10 days of symptoms. Pooling data across treatment arms, by Day 14, 62 percent of patients treated early were able to be discharged from the hospital, compared with 49 percent of patients who were treated late. Investors have been watching Gilead\u2019s progress closely, on hopes that remdesivir could treat the symptoms of the coronavirus - which can caused organs to shut down in severe cases, as well as attacking the lungs. Markets had fallen back last week after reports that Remdesivir had failed a trial, so this feels like an encouraging development. Stocks are moving higher in London, with the FTSE 100 up 2% or 124 points at 6082. Bloomberg economist Michael McDonough has dug into the US GDP report: Here\u2019s our US business editor Dominic Rushe on today\u2019s US GDP report: The longest economic expansion in US history officially came to an end on Wednesday when the commerce department announced the economy shrank 4.8% in the first three months of the year. The economic slump, the steepest since the last recession in 2008, is just an early indicator of how severely the coronavirus pandemic has mauled the US economy. Much of the US economy shut down in March in an effort to contain the virus, which triggered 26 million people to file for unemployment benefits and wiped out a decade of jobs gains, at the end of the first quarter. The next set of figures from the commerce department will more accurately reflect the true scale of its impact. He also points out that the current slump could rival the economic collapse of the Great Depression. \u201cThe US economy is in recession right now,\u201d said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know how deep.\u201d More here: Robert Alster, Head of Investment Services at wealth manager Close Brothers Asset Management, says the White House will not like today\u2019s GDP figures. \u201cThe US economy was performing well at the start of the year, but the coronavirus crisis derailed it in spectacular fashion. While the impact will be better seen in the Q2 data, Q1 figures act as a useful outrider, helping us understand the magnitude of the challenge ahead. In the past few weeks, more than 26 million Americans have applied for unemployment relief, and even White House advisers are admitting that the jobless total could reach 16% in the coming weeks. This is not the economic record on which President Trump hoped to campaign for re-election. \u201cLike other governments across the world, the US is eager to ensure that the economy is ready to rebound at speed once the crisis passes. But securing that desired \u2018v-shaped\u2019 recovery relies on businesses receiving the necessary support to remain in hibernation as well as vastly improved consumer confidence. The White House will hope that the bombast of President Trump can help the latter, but the reality is that the longer the US economy is starved of oxygen, the longer it will take to get back to full strength.\u201d The instant reaction to today\u2019s growth report is that America\u2019s economy is suffering, and it\u2019s about to get a lot worse. Wall Street financier Steven Rattner fears that the slump will accelerate alarmingly in the current quarter, so that the economy shrinks at an annualised rate of 40%. Dan Primark, business editor of Axios, agrees that things are going to get worse: Investment strategist Callie Cox points out that US consumer spending plummeted (as people obeyed orders to stay home, and shops and restaurants closed) America\u2019s longest economic expanse in history is over! The contraction in the last quarter ends a record-breaking run of growth which began back in the summer of 2009. America\u2019s economy shrank so sharply in the last quarter because personal spending fell, exports declined, and companies slashed investment. The BEA explains: The decrease in real GDP in the first quarter reflected negative contributions from personal consumption expenditures (PCE), nonresidential fixed investment, exports, and private inventory investment that were partly offset by positive contributions from residential fixed investment, federal government spending, and state and local government spending. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, decreased (table 2). The decrease in PCE reflected decreases in services, led by health care, and goods, led by motor vehicles and parts. The decrease in nonresidential fixed investment primarily reflected a decrease in equipment, led by transportation equipment. The decrease in exports primarily reflected a decrease in services, led by travel. NEWSFLASH: America\u2019s economy is contracting at the fastest rate since the financial crisis a decade ago, as the coronavirus lockdown hits activity US GDP shrank at an annualised rate of -4.8% in January-March, new figures from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. That\u2019s worse than the 4.0% annualised contraction expected by economists. (That means GDP contracted by roughly 1.2% on a quarter-on-quarter basis). The BEA explains: The decline in first quarter GDP was, in part, due to the response to the spread of COVID-19, as governments issued \u201cstay-at-home\u201d orders in March. This led to rapid changes in demand, as businesses and schools switched to remote work or canceled operations, and consumers canceled, restricted, or redirected their spending. More details to follow.... Just in: Boeing has warned its staff that it plans to cut its headcount by 10%. In an email to staff, CEO Dave Calhoun said the Covid-19 crisis is having a serious impact on demand for its planes. It will use natural wastage, voluntary redundancies, and compulsory layoffs where necessary. With demand for commercial airline travel down very sharply, airlines are delaying purchases for new jets (a message also spelled out by Airbus this morning). Boeing also reported its second quarterly loss in a row, losing $641m in January-March due to the coronavirus pandemic and the ongoing 737 Max grounding. Goldman Sachs isn\u2019t convinced by the stock market rally. Its analysts have predicted that Wall Street will drop back towards last months lows, before rallying again later in the year. After an upbeat morning, the UK stock markets is still at a seven-week high as traders await the latest US GDP report in 90 minutes time. In London, cruise operator Carnival (+10%), Barclays bank (+6.6%) and energy firm Centrica (+5.9%) are the top risers. European markets are a little more subdued, though: FTSE 100: up 45 points or 0.75% at 6003 points, German DAX: up 36 points or 0.3% at 10,832 French CAC: down 8 points or 0.2% at 4,561 points AstraZeneca, Britain\u2019s biggest drugmaker, is involved in a number of initiatives to find a treatment for Covid-19. It is testing its diabetes drug Farxiga to treat hospitalised covid-19 patients at risk of serious complications to try and prevent heart or kidney failure. The firm has started enrolling 900 people in the UK, the rest of Europe and the US for a late-stage clinical trial and expects to have the first results in a couple of months. The firm also has two out of six medicines in the government\u2019s Accord programme to fast-track covid-19 treatments, and expects to dose the first patients in the next few days. One is the blood cancer drug Calquence, which is being tested to see if it can suppress the cytokine storm that inflames the lungs and other organs of some Covid-19 patients. It has already been given to some Covid-19 patients with advanced lung disease in the US, where researchers at the NIH\u2019s National Cancer Institute observed \u201csome clinical benefit\u201d. AstraZeneca has teamed up with fellow pharma giant GlaxoSmithKline and the University of Cambridge to set up a new coronavirus testing lab in Cambridge that should able to carry out 30,000 tests a day by early May. AstraZeneca has also donated nearly nine million face masks to healthcare workers around the world, including half a million in the UK. The drugmaker has benefited from clients stockpiling respiratory drugs such as Symbicort, which boosted sales by 16% to $6.4bn in the first three months of the year, but its chief executive Pascal Soriot said the overall impact of the Covid-19 crisis on AZ would be negative, as fewer people are going to the doctors and using medicines. He expects the crisis to last between three and six months. Shares in UK electricals chain Dixon Carphone have surged 20% this morning, after it showed it was getting to grips with the pandemic. Dixons reported that its online sales have grown by 166% in the last five weeks, under the lockdown, as customers flock to buy home computers, gaming consoles and kitchen gadgets. In April we have seen strong demand for home office equipment including computers and home networking as people work and communicate remotely. Gaming and TV sales have also been strong. In kitchen products, refrigeration and food preparation including bread makers have sold particularly well. This means Dixons has recovered around two-thirds of the \u00a3400m sales lost because its UK and Ireland shops are closed. It also reported strong trading at its Nordic stores (which are still open), where it has been learning how to operate under physical distancing rules. Shares have jumped to 81p, a one-month high. European airline manufacturer Airbus has struck a very cautious note today, saying the travel industry may not recover until 2025. Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury warned: \u201cWe are now in the midst of the gravest crisis the aerospace industry has ever known.\u201d He believes it could take \u201cthree to five years\u201d for passengers to be as willing to fly as before the crisis. Raffi Boyadjian, senior investment analyst at trading firm XM, says there is a \u201cmood of cautions optimism\u201d in the markets today. The rally in shares, and in oil, come as several countries began to ease their lockdown measures. Boyadjian says: Hopes that shuttered businesses will soon be able to reopen their doors has sparked a relief rally in risk assets. Just in: Economic confidence across the eurozone has suffered its worst ever fall -- quite a contrast with the recent stock market rally. The European Commission\u2019s economic sentiment index has slumped to just 67.0 points this month, down from 94.2 in March and 103.4 in February. The gloom is darkest in the service sector - where the confidence measure slumped to -35 points from -2.3 in March. The survey also showed the consumers are more worried about losing their jobs, and also expect prices in the shops to rise. The days of cramming thousands of bankers into skyscrapers may be numbered, due to Covid-19. The City of London and Canary Wharf are both pretty deserted right now, with financial services companies telling staff to work remotely where possible - either at remote sites, or from home. Barclays has a large tower block at the Wharf, but CEO Jes Staley is pondering whether it needs to pack its staff into one place. He told reporters that the Canary Wharf offices will open gradually, with just two people allowed in an elevator at once. And in the long term..... \u201cI think the notion of putting 7,000 people in a building may be a thing of the past. And we will find ways to operate with more distancing over a much longer period of time. Keeping staff two metres apart is pretty much impossible on a busy trading floor, unless you sharply reduce the number of people in the office at once. Bosses will also be very nervous about future disruption -- one Covid-19 case could force everyone to go home. Another factor: the City seems to have coped well with remote working. Staley says it is \u201cabsolutely remarkable\u201d that technology has allowed 70,000 staff to keep Barclays\u2019 operations running properly \u201cfrom their kitchens.\u201d But, there will be a knock-on impact if City workers stay home, as Neil Wilson of Markets.com explains: Working from home is clearly working rather well. Also, banks are no doubt looking at this and thinking they can cut costs by closing offices, call centres and branches. Nevertheless, it highlights how bosses and government have a very hard task in exiting lockdown. Moreover, what about the Pret or the pub that depends on lunch trade from the City workers filling up these offices every day? The impact on the economy will be permanent. The oil price is recovering this morning too, helping to nudge stocks higher. Brent crude has gained 3% to $21.07 per barrel, while US crude has gained 13% to $13.94 per barrel. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, explains: The FTSE 100 is outperforming its equivalents in Continental Europe thanks to a move higher in energy, banking and mining stocks. The rebound in the oil market has helped Royal Dutch Shell plus BP. Well received earnings releases from a couple of big banks has boosted sentiment in London \u2013 the FTSE hit its highest level since early March. The rest of Europe is showing modest gains as dealers remain hopeful about the prospect of a further easing of social distancing guidelines. Hitting 6,000 points again is a \u201csignificant milestone\u201d in FTSE 100\u2019s recovery from the pandemic-inspired stock market slump, says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. He gives some of the credit to Barclays, where decent investment bank trading made up for growing problems in the UK economy. \u201dAlthough Barclays has attracted flak for its commitment to investment banking, this part of the business is actually performing well at a time when the retail bank is facing a significant increase in bad debts. \u201cThe \u00a32.1bn provision for this risk in the company\u2019s first quarter update reflects the fragility of the UK economy amid the lockdown, while big falls in revenue at advertising giant WPP offer an insight into the impact globally. Standard Chartered, the emerging markets-focused bank, has also reassured investors today despite reporting falling profits. The FTSE 100-listed lender told the City that it sees signs of recovery in its key markets in Asia, predicting: \u201cWe expect a gradual recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic ... before the global economy moves out of recession in the latter part of 2020, most likely led and driven by markets in our footprint.\u201d Standard Chartered is also setting aside more money to cover bad loans, with a credit impairment of $956m for the last quarter. Today\u2019s rally follows encouraging results from Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, last night. Alphabet posted higher revenues in the last quarter than expected, despite a \u201csignificant and sudden slowdown in advertising\u201d in March. CFO Ruth Porat also reported \u201csome early signs\u201d that customers are returning to more normal behaviour - helping to lift shares by 7% in pre-market trading.... Roughly two-thirds of the companies on the FTSE 100 are up this morning, pushign the index over 6,000 points. The rally is being led by energy companies (+2.1%), telecoms firms (+1.5%), financial stocks (+1%) and miners (+0.95%). Boom! Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index has just pushed over the 6,000 points mark for the first time since 11 March. That means it has clawed back all the losses since the stomach-churning crash on 12 March (the worst day since 1987). Here are the top risers, and fallers, as investors continue to grasp hopes that Covid-19 lockdowns will end soon, helping the world economy to rebound. UK clothing and homeware group Next has reported that sales plunged over 40% in the last quarter, due to the lockdown. Next told the City that the drop in sales has been \u201cfaster and steeper\u201d than anticipated in its March stress test. It now expects lower sales for both the first and second half of the year. It told shareholders this morning that customers had already voted with their feet before the lockdown: We believe that the threat of a pandemic did not significantly affect retail sales until the beginning of March, we saw a material impact in the second week of March and declines accelerated as each day went by. In the three days before stores closed on Monday 23rd March, Retail sales were down -86%. In reality, the majority of our customers had decided to stop shopping in retail stores before the order came to close them. Although Next\u2019s stores are still closed, it began partially reopening its internet shopping offering two weeks ago. It says 70% of ranges are now available, with operations rejigged to comply with physical distancing rules. It is also limiting daily orders, and will shut down until the next morning when this is hit. The coronavirus crisis is bad news for the advertising industry too. Advertising giant WPP has reported that revenues fell 4.9% in the last quarter, including a 7.9% tumble in March, as companies began to slash their marketing programmes. WPP expects more pain ahead (understandably - you can hardly expect travel firms and restaurant groups to do much advertising right now). CEO Mark Read told Reuters: \u201cThe second quarter is going to be tough and logic would tell you that we had a partial impact in March and we\u2019ll start to see the full impact around the world in the second quarter.\u201d The rising economic cost of Covid-19 has hit profits at UK bank Barclays. Barclays is setting aside \u00a32.1bn to cover a surge in bad debts, anticipating that its business and consumer customers will struggle to repay their loans. This dragged profits for the first quarter of 2020 down to \u00a3923m, some 38% less than a year ago, and lower than hoped. CEO Jes Staley pinned the blame firmly on the coronavirus: The impact of COVID-19 came late in what was until that point a good quarter. Statutory profit before tax was \u00a30.9bn and profit before tax excluding credit impairment charges was \u00a33.0bn. We have taken a \u00a32.1bn credit impairment charge which reflects our initial estimates of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Staley also warned of tough times ahead: \u201cGiven the uncertainty around the developing economic downturn and low interest rate environment, 2020 is expected to be challenging,\u201d Shares in Barclays are up 5% this morning, though - as its Investment Bank reported a \u201cparticularly strong Markets performance\u201d. IAG are the top faller in London, down almost 6%, after its British Airways division announced it would eliminate one in four jobs. Job cuts often go down well in the City (they\u2019re a pragmatic lot). Not today, though. Traders are alarmed that IAG also announced that it made a loss of \u20ac535m in the last quarter, with revenues down 13%, with worse to come. CEO Alex Cruz told staff he was acting \u201cdecisively\u201dto ensure that British Airways has a strong future. Unions, though, are furious that IAG is slashing staff rather than seeking government help. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets comments: One thing seems certain, while last night\u2019s actions by IAG have attracted some significant criticism in terms of their timing, they also point to the challenges facing the travel sector in the weeks and months ahead. Will demand have picked up again, and if not, will airlines have to reconfigure cabins so that passengers aren\u2019t crammed in on top of each other. Will air fares become more expensive, as a result of lower capacity, and will package holidays be less popular as a result. The FTSE 100 has hit a new seven-week high at the start of trading in London. The blue-chip index has gained 30 points to reach 5989 points, for the first time since Wednesday 11 March. Cruise operator Carnival are the top riser, up 7.4%, suggesting traders are anticipating the end of coronavirus restrictions. April has been a good month for Wall Street. With two days to go, stocks are up 10% - their best performance for many a year (after a torrid March). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we learn how badly America\u2019s economic growth was hit by the first phase of the Covid-19 crisis, and what its central bank will do to fight it. GDP figures for the first quarter of 2020 are expected to show that the US economy shrank in January-March, at an annualised rate of around 4%. That would reflect the early impact of the global pandemic, as lockdowns spread from Asia to Europe and then America. The threat of a deep recession has already spurred America\u2019s Federal Reserve into a series of massive stimulus programmes. The Fed holds a policy meeting today, but isn\u2019t expected to change monetary policy -- having already slashed borrowing costs to nearly zero. Instead, investors will be looking for signals that the Fed will continue to generously support the economy -- and thus asset prices -- until the Covid-19 pandemic is over. It has already pledged more than $2 trillion of loan guarantees and other financial help. Optimism that policymakers will keep doing Whatever It Takes have lifted the markets to their highest levels in seven weeks. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is only a whisker below the 6,000 point mark, having fallen through 5,000 points last month. Stocks have rallied in Asia too, with MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gaining 0.7% to its highest since 12 March. Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200 index rose by 1.5%, while China\u2019s CSI 300 inched up by 0.3%. The FTSE 100 index has gained 5% in April, cutting its losses during 2020 to a mere 21%. That reflects a lot of optimism that coronavirus lockdowns will ease, economies will return to something like normality, and a deep depression will be avoided. But given so many companies are reporting falling sales and profits, and suspending their dividends, does this rally have firm foundations? Last night, British Airways laid out plans to cut 12,000 jobs -- as it responds to the collapse in the travel business. The big fear is that Covid-19 infections spike again once governments start to reopen offices, factories and schools. Fiona Cincotta of City Index explains: There are still many unknowns, perhaps too many to justify the return to a bull markets for many bourses across the globe. The true scale of the economic impact of the coronavirus is still unknown. Whilst people returning to work and economies reopening is a good thing, there is a good chance that the rally will start to stall over the coming weeks, as investors are faced with the stark reality of the hard data whilst also waiting to see if the gradual reopening are working. Investors face the same conundrum as governments; will the reopening prove successful or lead back to a second wave of infections?

Once adjudicated by the Ocean Rowing Society, Walters was expected to claim the Guinness World Record for the oldest solo Atlantic rower, currently held by Gerard Marie of France who completed the solo challenge in 2015, aged 66. After what Walters dubbed his \u201clast voyage\u201d, he plans to leave the George Geary in a museum in Antigua. \u201cIt sounds like a sad occasion but I would say grand finale might be nearer the point, for me and for the boat,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me it\u2019s to show life has not passed me by.\u201d",

Top stories Kevin Rudd has accused Scott Morrison of hypocrisy over his calls for a beefed-up World Health Organisation, just months after Morrison railed against bureaucratic organisations such as the United Nations becoming too powerful. Morrison had warned of the dangers of elevating \u201cglobal institutions above the authority of nation-states\u201d in a recent speech, which relegated his latest comments to little more than a \u201cthought bubble\u201d, according to Rudd. The former prime minister also attacked Morrison\u2019s decision to commission a government review into Australia\u2019s engagement with global bodies as following a \u201cTrumpian playbook\u201d, \u201cwith a preconceived and quite cynically driven political agenda\u201d. The UK now has Europe\u2019s second-highest Covid-19 death toll after revised figures included an additional 4,419 victims, lifting its tally past Spain to 26,097. The US passed one million positive infections overnight, but a trial of the antiviral drug remdesivir has reportedly showed \u201ca clear cut, significant, positive effect\u201d for patients, in news that buoyed global stock markets. It comes against a stark warning from the International Labour Organisation however that 1.6bn workers globally \u2013 nearly half the international workforce \u2013 are in \u201cimmediate danger of having their livelihoods destroyed\u201d by the economic fallout from the coronavirus. Australia\u2019s chief scientist has warned against claims of breakthroughs or sudden cures to the Covid-19 pandemic, urging instead for the public to rely on evidence-based reports. An Australian Institute of Criminology report has found more than 200 listings for purported coronavirus vaccines, personal protective gear and antiviral drugs for sale on the darknet, with some products selling for as much as $24,598. And a major rental affordability study has found that just nine of 69,960 properties surveyed would be affordable by single jobseekers if the boosted Covid-19-related welfare payments were to be ceased. Australia Creditors for Virgin Australia could be facing steep losses of almost $2bn, with some predictions suggesting major backers such as the Anglican Church could receive as little as 7c in the dollar for millions invested as recently as last year. Barack Obama\u2019s team watched Julia Gillard\u2019s misogyny speech whenever they were \u201creally annoyed\u201d with Tony Abbott, one of the president\u2019s senior advisers has revealed. Ben Rhodes, the former deputy national security adviser, has also described how Obama \u201cwent way off the script\u201d to blast the Abbott government for climate inaction.

Union representatives have called on the government to \u201cfix the faults in the jobkeeper scheme\u201d. An independent report recommending a ban on fracking in the environmentally sensitive Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre Basin was kept quiet by the Queensland government. Gas company Santos has been granted exploratory rights in the region. The world Spain and Germany have dampened hopes of a tourism-driven revival post Covid-19, with Spain ruling out the early reopening of its tourism sector and Germany extending its travel warning outside of the country until mid-June.

A separate set of results published by the Lancet medical journal on Wednesday of a trial conducted in moderately ill patients in China concluded remdesivir failed to improve patients\u2019 condition.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has said the federal government will not be extending its coronavirus social distancing guidelines once they expire on Thursday, even as the number of Americans who have died of coronavirus surpassed 60,000. The country has recorded 60,207 deaths from coronavirus, and 1,030,487 cases of the virus have been confirmed in the US according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The US accounts for around one-third of all confirmed cases worldwide. The US has now lost more people to coronavirus than the Vietnam war. Over the country\u2019s nearly two decades of involvement in Vietnam, 58,220 Americans were killed. The death toll will continue to climb in the coming weeks, and data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates the current death toll may represent an undercount. Putting a positive face on the latest grim numbers, Trump delivered his daily upbeat update and his son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, described the administration\u2019s much-criticized response to the pandemic as \u201ca great success story\u201d. Trump also talked up hopeful preliminary results for the experimental drug remdesivir as a possible Covid-19 treatment, news of which saw financial markets soar. That came on the same day the government announced dismal new economic numbers. The figures revealed the US economy shrank at a 4.8% annual rate in the first quarter of the year \u2013 a precursor to far grimmer reports that are expected this summer from the severe recession triggered by the pandemic. The White House has been trying to pivot to a new stage of the crisis, focused on efforts to reopen the nation\u2019s economy state-by-state amid concerns that lifting restrictions too quickly and without sufficient testing and contact tracing will spur a resurgence. As part of that effort, Trump, who has both threatened to force states to reopen and said decisions will be left to them, said the White House will not be extending its \u201c30 Days to Slow the Spread\u201d guidelines when they expire on Thursday. \u201cThey\u2019ll be fading out because now the governors are doing it,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office as he met with John Bel Edwards, the Democratic governor of Louisiana. Those guidelines \u2013 which were originally supposed to last 15 days and were then extended an additional 30 \u2013 encouraged Americans to work from home and avoid restaurants and discretionary travel and advised older Americans and those with serious underlying health conditions to isolate themselves. Vice-President Mike Pence said the guidelines have been incorporated into the new guidance issued by the White House earlier this month that lays out how states can gradually ease restrictions and begin to reopen as the rate of new cases slows. Edwards, who recently extended Louisiana\u2019s stay-at-home order through 15 May, is currently under fire from Republican lawmakers in his state after he extended the order . But Trump commended Edwards on the job he has done after New Orleans became one of the nation\u2019s coronavirus hotspots. \u201cI just wanted to congratulate you,\u201d Trump said. The White House on Wednesday was also pointing to remdesivir, which proved effective against the virus in a new preliminary study run by the National Institutes of Health, which found that it shortened the time it took for coronavirus patients to recover by four days on average. Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious diseases expert, said the drug reduced the time it takes patients to recover by 31% \u2013 11 days on average versus 15 days for those just given usual care. Fauci warned the results of the study still need to be properly peer-reviewed, but expressed unusual optimism, saying that remdesivir would become \u201cthe standard of care\u201d for Covid-19 patients. \u201cIt\u2019s highly significant,\u201d said the usually cautious doctor. \u201cWhat it has proven is that a drug can block this virus.\u201d A Chinese trial had previously demonstrated no \u201csignificant clinical benefits\u201d to administering the antiviral drug remdesivir to Covid-19 patients. Fauci said the Chinese test, which had to be halted early for a lack of subjects, was \u201cnot an adequate study\u201d. The US-led trial is the largest to investigate remdesivir. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which Fauci leads, is expected to release a detailed summary of the results soon. While it is not yet possible to quantify the drug\u2019s effectiveness, the trial would represent the first time any medication has been shown to improve outcomes. Despite the positive messaging from the White House, a new poll indicated most Americans are still not ready to reopen the country. The PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll showed large majorities are uncomfortable with reopening schools or restaurants unless coronavirus testing is significantly expanded. The US has dramatically increased its testing after a slow and rocky start, many health experts say the country still must do more \u2013 as many as 5m a day \u2013 to safely reopen the economy. Otherwise, they warn, cases will rise sharply as Americans return to work, creating another deadly spike. Trump has dismissed that recommended number, calling it unnecessary and a \u201cmedia trap\u201d. Meanwhile Kushner, who has been helping with the effort to get medical supplies to states that need them, suggested in an interview with Fox &amp; Friends that the federal government has accomplished its mission. \u201cWe\u2019re on the other side of the medical aspect of this. And I think that we\u2019ve achieved all the different milestones that are needed. So the federal government rose to the challenge, and this is a great success story,\u201d he said. The administration, he added, is preparing the country to \u201cget as close back to normal as possible as quickly as possible\u201d, and said that by July the country would be \u201creally rocking again\u201d.

It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was \u2013 and always will be \u2013 central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 2014/15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.</p>\n    <p>Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.</p>\n    <p>It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure \u2013 originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.</p>\n    <p>South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine.</p>\n    <p>Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far.

The swab tests can be booked online and carried out at drive-through test centres or using home kits. NHS Providers said in a report released on Wednesday: \u201cNHS trust leaders believe they have done all they can to support the national testing effort so far but are increasingly frustrated with the lack of clarity on how the testing regime will be developed for this next phase. \u201cAt the moment they feel they are on the end of a series of frequent tactical announcements extending the testing criteria to new groups with no visibility on any longer term strategy, and are being expected at the drop of a hat to accommodate these changes with no advance notice or planning.\u201d Chris Hopson, its chief executive, added that the 100,000 target may have a \u201cgalvanising effect\u201d but \u201cwhat matters most is an updated strategy to take us through the exit from lockdown\u201d.

PHE said that originally people with symptoms would have a swab test of the back of the mouth and another one of the nose, but now there is a move to obtaining just one sample. That might mean a greater likelihood of retesting. The government is not keeping a record of the number of inconclusive tests but, according to a departmental spokesperson, these are rare. As of 9am on 29 April 818,539 tests had been carried out on 632,794 individuals, meaning 23% of all tests carried out to that date were retests. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said that some people are tested more than once for clinical reasons. \u201cThe number of people tested is the number of new people tested each day,\u201d he said. \u201cThe number of overall tests could include the same person tested multiple times, hence the widening gap.\u201d",

The centenarian will become the figurehead for the Army Foundation College in Harrogate, which trains 16- and 17-year-olds, on a birthday that will be celebrated with more than a hundred thousand birthday cards \u2013 and two special flypasts. Two helicopters are due to fly over Moore\u2019s home in Bedfordshire in the afternoon, while the flight of a wartime Spitfire and a Hurricane will be broadcast live on BBC at 8.20am, to avoid large numbers of people trying to travel and see it. The veteran said it was \u201cquite extraordinary\u201d that he was turning 100. \u201cIt is even more extraordinary that I am doing so with this many well-wishers and I am in awe at the response my walking has had\u201d.

The events cap a heady period in which Moore first captured the nation\u2019s imagination by raising millions by meeting a promise to walk the length of his 25m garden 100 times before his birthday to raise money for NHS charities. The veteran originally set out to raise \u00a31,000 but donations wildly exceeded that, and he completed his efforts in the middle of the month, surrounded by a guard of honour.

He went on to record a cover of You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone with Michael Ball, which went straight to No 1, making him the oldest artist to have a chart-topping record in the UK. The Royal Mail said it would paint a mailbox near his home NHS blue and the postal service has already been stamping all mail with a special postmark to celebrate the veteran\u2019s 100th birthday.

So far the March coronavirus appeal has generated $1bn.</p> \n  <p>The extra money would be used to help with testing, basic aid as well as the easing the logistics of continuing the delivery of aid in a pandemic. OCHA expects the biggest impact may be economic due to collapse in commodity prices, fall in trade flows, elimination of tourism and ending of remittances home.</p> \n  <p>Mark Lowcock, the head of the agency, is predicting for the first time in 20 years the proportion of people living in poverty will rise. One reason will be that the numbers classified as one step away from famine and dependent on food aid will rise from 130m to 260m. He is arguing with wealthy countries that unless they respond there will be a spate of famines, and problems stored up for as long as a decade, including migration and terrorism.</p> \n  <p>Overall OCHA has proposed $90bn could protect the poor with two thirds dedicated to social protection programs coming from the strengthened balance sheets of international financial institutions. The remaining third - $30bn \u2013 may will have to be delivered by humanitarian agencies funded by an increase in official development assistance.</p> \n  <p>Novel forms of protection are being experimented in low income countries, including open air education, less frequent food distributions, an increase in cash distribution through text messaging and on line education of health workers</p> \n  <p>The increased appeal comes despite a slower than expected spread of the virus than previously foreseen, but OCHA admits information on the spread of virus is still primitive in some countries such as Afghanistan and Yemen.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea9bd138f087455863180d6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/lorenzo-tondo\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-29T17:51:22.528Z\">6.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A video emerged on Wednesday of an illegal horse race in Palermo, <strong>Italy</strong>, that went ahead in defiance of the coronavirus lockdown, writes <strong>Lorenzo Tondo</strong>, who is based in the city. </p> \n  <p>The clips show dozens of scooters, surrounding the horses that are running in a street near the University of Palermo.

The country has recorded 60,207 deaths from coronavirus, and 1,030,487 cases of the virus have been confirmed in the US according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The US accounts for around one third of all confirmed cases worldwide. Here are the most important recent developments from around the world: The official global death toll exceeded 225,000, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University researchers, with the official toll at 226,771. At least 3,187,919 people have been infected worldwide. Half world\u2019s workers \u2018at risk of unemployment\u2019. The International Labour Organisation has warned that almost half the global workforce \u2013 1.6 billion people \u2013 are in \u201cimmediate danger of having their livelihoods destroyed\u201d by the economic impact of Covid-19, Philip Inman, a Guardian economics writer, reports. More cases of \u2018Covid-linked\u2019 syndrome in children. Doctors around the world have reported more cases of a rare but potentially lethal inflammatory syndrome in children that appears to be linked to coronavirus infections. Nearly 100 cases of the unusual illness have emerged in at least six countries, with doctors in Britain, the US, France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland now reported to be investigating the condition. Official UK death toll up by 4,419, after the government included deaths outside hospital for the first time. As of 5pm on Tuesday, total of 26,097 patients had died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK, according to Public Health England. Brazil sees record increase in cases. Brazil has reported a record increase in cases, with its ministry of health confirming 6,276 more infections in a 24-hour period, taking the country\u2019s total to 78,162. Ireland looks set to extend its lockdown, despite growing calls to ease restrictions and salvage the economy.The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said on Wednesday that new cases of Covid-19 infections, deaths and intensive care admissions appeared too high to start relaxing rules that are to expire on 5 May. Swiss government extends ban on large public events. The Swiss government has extended its ban on public events exceeding 1000 people until the end of August, even as it announced the easing of some other restrictions on sporting events, shops, restaurants and museums. Sweden passes 20,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus. The total number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Sweden rose past the 20,000 mark on Wednesday, after the Nordic country reported another 681 infections. Five coronavirus cases have been reported in Aden, southern Yemen, by the country\u2019s internationally recognised government, raising the prospect that the war-ravaged country will soon also have an outbreak of the new disease. China\u2019s parliament is to hold its annual meeting from 22 May - more than two months later than planned. Conditions for holding the meeting have been met as the coronavirus situation has improved, decision makers said. Russia\u2019s coronavirus case tally neared the 100,000 milestone, after the country reported 5,841 new cases of the coronavirus on Wednesday, bringing its overall nationwide tally to 99,399, Reuters reports. UK government is still aiming for 100,000 daily tests by tomorrow, according to the environment secretary, George Eustice. He said the search for an effective antibody test was still under way and denied that earlier introduction of testing at care homes would have saved lives. The coronavirus outbreak needs to be contained before 2021 Olympics can go ahead, the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said. \u201cThe Olympic Games must be held in a way that shows the world has won its battle against the coronavirus pandemic.\u201d The UK prime minister Boris Johnson and his partner Carrie Symonds announced the birth of a baby boy. Johnson returned to frontline work on Monday after falling ill with coronavirus and spending time in intensive care. Air passenger numbers are down 99% in the UK, the home secretary told MPs, as she defended the government\u2019s decision not to test individuals entering the country. On Friday, a total of 9,906 people entered the country. Now, first things first, there is a new Olive and Mabel video: Hi, Helen Sullivan with you now and for the next few hours.

Trump has said his administration will soon release a plan to help US oil companies, which the treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said could include adding millions of barrels of oil to already-teeming national reserves. We\u2019re also exploring potentially having the ability to store another several hundred million barrels, so we\u2019re looking at lots of different options. And, as oil-producing nations try to deal with the pandemic-driven fall in prices, Norway has agreed to slash its output from June to December, marking the first time in 18 years western Europe\u2019s principal producer of oil has joined up with other major nations to shore up prices. Its oil minister Tina Bru has said: We will cut Norwegian production by 250,000 barrels per day in June and by 134,000 barrels per day in the second half of 2020. In addition, the start-up of production of several fields will be delayed until 2021. Consequently, the total Norwegian production in December 2020 will be 300,000 barrels less per day than originally planned by the companies. The regulation will cease by the end of the year. In Washington, the US president Donald Trump has suggested a vaccine may not be needed as part of a recovery from the pandemic. If you don\u2019t have a vaccine, if the virus is gone, you\u2019re like where we were before. At least 89 vaccines are in development, according to the World Health Organization. But even the most promising options still need to undergo rigorous safety testing, which could take a year to 18 months. But without a vaccine, why does Trump think the pandemic will just go away? He dodged the question. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna go, it\u2019s gonna leave,\u201d Trump said, without explaining his thinking. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be eradicated.\u201d Brazil\u2019s new health minister Nelson Teich has said he does not know when the epidemic will peak in Brazil and that a \u201csecond wave\u201d is a very real possibility. According to the O Globo newspaper, Teich said a \u201ccritical point\u201d is a lack of ventilators in the country, adding: \u201cWe\u2019ve never had so many big problems at the same time.\u201d In the Amazon city of Manaus, where the overloaded health system has collapsed, reports from Yahoo News said many people were dying at home without being tested and others in ambulances as they drove around the city looking for beds in intensive care. Relatives of some victims were even opening the sealed coffins of relatives being buried in mass graves to ensure they were really inside. Talking privately, one Manaus doctor working in the public health sector said there are about 100 people on the waiting list for intensive care beds. Hospitals are also struggling to remove bodies. There\u2019s no room and nowhere to put them. The refrigerated containers fill up occasionally. In Rio de Janeiro, a doctor also speaking anonymously said one hospital was running out of sedatives and neuromuscular blockers used for intubating and managing intubated patients. Local media has published photos of the vertical structures cemeteries are building to stack coffins up to eight high. Brazil has reported a record increase in cases, with its ministry of health confirming 6,276 more infections in a 24-hour period, taking the country\u2019s total to 78,162. It has also suffered another 449 deaths in that time, raising its toll to at least 5,466 people since the outbreak began. Health specialists believe the real numbers are much higher. Brazil\u2019s far-right president Jair Bolsonaro has dismissed the rising death toll and, in recent weeks, has insisted the virus was \u201cgoing away\u201d. He shrugged off Tuesday\u2019s news that the official Brazilian total had surpassed the WHO-reported death toll in China, saying: \u201cSo what? I\u2019m sorry. What do you want me to do?\u201d Now, he has sought to blame state governors and mayors for the deaths \u2013 even though they have introduced social distancing measures against his orders while he repeatedly mingled with supporters and other Brazilians. He argued that they should be asked why they \u201ctook such restrictive measures and people kept dying\u201d and told reporters: \u201cYou won\u2019t put that bill on my lap.\u201d Asked what responsibility he held for rising deaths, he replied: \u201cThe question is so idiotic I\u2019m not going to reply.\u201d Another 31 people have died in Ireland and 376 more cases have been diagnosed, the country\u2019s chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan has said. One of the deaths reported on Wednesday involved a person in the 15-24 age group, the second in this category. Dr Holohan warned the number in intensive care units was too high as the prospect of a rapid easing of movement restrictions dwindles. That is simply too high and we need to get that down further not only because it is about protecting occupancy but the lower the figure is it is a reflection of better protection of the public and lower levels of spread of the infection. Bolivia will extend its lockdown against the pandemic until 10 May, the government has announced, though it is planning to relax rules in less affected parts of the country from the following day. The president Jeanine \u00c1\u00f1ez has said Bolivia will move to a \u201cdynamic\u201d or \u201cless rigid\u201d quarantine on 11 May, allowing some people to return to work. Future policy will hinge on the country\u2019s success at containing the pandemic, which has killed 55 Bolivians so far with a total 1,053 cases confirmed. Opening the quarantine a little or closing it completely will depend on how the pandemic is being controlled in each region. The Ministry of Health will evaluate every seven days how the pandemic evolves in each region. On that basis, decisions will be taken to relax or harden the quarantine. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported a total of 1,005,147 cases; an increase of 23,901 from its previous count. The number of deaths in the US has risen by 2,247 to 57,505. The CDC figures do not necessarily reflect cases reported by individual states. Slovenia is to lift a restriction prohibiting citizens from traveling outside their local community, the prime minister Janez Jan\u0161a has said. The country has confirmed 1,418 cases and 89 deaths. Jan\u0161a thanked citizens for following restrictions that have been imposed from the middle of March and told them: Thanks to you Slovenia is the most successful (in curbing the virus) among all neighbours of the focal country Italy. He claimed that Slovenia is also among countries that have suffered less economic and social damage than most due to the government\u2019s quick response, which included financial help of about \u20ac3bn (\u00a32.6bn) or some 6% of GDP to companies and citizens hurt by the epidemics. He said more restrictions will be lifted on Monday but gave no details. The government said earlier hairdressers and beauty parlours, as well as outdoor bars and restaurants and a number of shops, will be able to open from Monday. Libraries and museums are also expected to open on Monday. South Africa\u2019s health department has reported another 354 cases; the greatest number in one day, which brings the country\u2019s total to 5,350. Venezuela is asking the Bank of England to sell part of the South American nation\u2019s gold reserves held in its coffers and send the proceeds to the United Nations to help with the country\u2019s pandemic efforts, Reuters is reporting. The agency cites two sources with knowledge of the situation. For decades, Venezuela has stored gold that makes up part of its central bank reserves in the vaults of foreign financial institutions. That included the Bank of England, which provides gold custodian services to many developing countries. But, since 2018, the Bank has refused to transfer the 31 tonnes of gold to the government of the president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, whom the UK has refused to recognise as the country\u2019s legitimate leader after his disputed 2018 re-election. Reuters reports that the effort signals Maduro is desperately seeking financial resources around the world as the country\u2019s economy struggles under low oil prices, crippling U.S. sanctions and a paralysing quarantine. Bosnia has reported its sharpest daily rise in new infections after its two autonomous regions gradually began to ease lockdowns. There were 93 new infections and two deaths in the previous 24 hours, compared with 20 new infections a day earlier and 49 the day before that, officials have said. The total number of infected people rose to 1,677 with 65 deaths, while 29,130 have been tested. The reproduction number for the virus in Germany has dropped to 0.75, according to Wednesday\u2019s daily report by the Robert Koch Institute, the German government\u2019s disease control agency. The basic reproduction rate, which indicates how many people become newly infected on average per already infected person, had been announced as edging up to one in Monday\u2019s report \u2013 causing concern as it seemed to suggest the spread of the virus was gaining momentum again. Already, politicians around the globe defending themselves against calls to relax their lockdowns had begun to cite Germany\u2019s case as an example to heed. But, while Angela Merkel has identified the reproduction number as a key indicator of whether states can allow to relax social distancing measures, it is also always an estimate. And some mathematicians have questioned the method by which the Robert Koch Institute arrives at the number. It attempts to take into account the time lag in data gathering by ignoring data from the last three days and back-dating known cases to their likely day of infection around a week earlier. The reproduction number announced on Tuesday was therefore always only able to give a definitive indication of the pandemic\u2019s development at a point about a week and a half ago, when a relaxation of social distancing measures had been announced by Merkel but not yet come into effect. We reported earlier that a Chinese trial had demonstrated no \u201csignificant clinical benefits\u201d to administering the antiviral drug remdesivir to Covid-19 patients. But a separate trial in the US has shown a \u201cclear-cut\u201d effect, according to the head of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr Anthony Fauci. He hailed it as proof a drug can block the coronavirus shortly after the medicine\u2019s maker, Gilead Sciences, revealed it had met its primary goals. Fauci said the \u201cdata shows that remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery\u201d, adding that it proves \u201cthat a drug can block this virus\u201d. The institute he leads is expected to release a detailed summary of the results soon. While it is not yet possible to quantify the drug\u2019s effectiveness, the trial would represent the first time any medication has been shown to improve outcomes. Dr Fauci said the Chinese test, which had to be halted early for a lack of subjects, was \u201cnot an adequate study\u201d. The US-led trial is the largest to investigate remdesivir. Hungary\u2019s far-right prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n has announced an easing of population movement restrictions outside Budapest, which has reported the most cases, saying shops will be allowed to reopen without time limits. However, the wearing of masks covering the face will be mandatory in shops and on public transport, Orb\u00e1n said. He added that the easing of restrictions will be reviewed every two weeks. Doctors around the world have reported more cases of a rare but potentially lethal inflammatory syndrome in children that appears to be linked to coronavirus infections, Ian Sample and Denis Campbell report. Nearly 100 cases of the unusual illness have emerged in at least six countries, with doctors in Britain, the US, France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland now reported to be investigating the condition. The first cases came to light this week when the NHS issued an alert to paediatricians about a number of children admitted to intensive care units with a mix of toxic shock and a condition known as Kawasaki disease, an inflammatory disorder that affects the blood vessel, heart and other organs. So far 19 children have been affected in the UK and none have died. The French health minister, Olivier Veran, said on Wednesday that the country had more than a dozen children with inflammation around the heart, and while there was insufficient evidence to prove a link with coronavirus, he said the cases were being taken \u201cvery seriously.\u201d Veran told Franceinfo news radio he had received an alert from Paris concerning \u201cabout 15 children of all ages\u201d, adding that other cases had been reported in Spain, Italy and Switzerland. He listed the symptoms as fever, digestive problems and vascular inflammation. At least three children in the US aged six months to eight years are being treated for a similar condition. Mark Gorelik, a specialist treating the patients at Columbia University Medical Center in New York, said all had fever and inflammation of the heart and gut. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re at the very beginning of trying to understand what that represents,\u201d he told Reuters. Gorelik believes the cases are not Kawasaki disease but a similar condition that shares a common cause, namely an infectious agent that triggers an immune response. The UN humanitarian aid agency is set to ask for substantially more than $2bn it requested in March to fight coronavirus, in the face of evidence that the virus is impacting more countries than previously sought and may take three to six months to reach its peak in the poorest parts of the world, writes Patrick Wintour, the Guardian\u2019s diplomatic editor. The Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs fears that as many as 250 million people will be left on the brink of starvation, a rise of more than 130 million on the current figure. The opening UN humanitarian appeal for $2bn to fight coronavirus was made on 25 March and a substantially increased updated appeal will be made on 7 May incorporating an extra 10 countries, and taking the total number of countries closer to 50. So far the March coronavirus appeal has generated $1bn. The extra money would be used to help with testing, basic aid as well as the easing the logistics of continuing the delivery of aid in a pandemic. OCHA expects the biggest impact may be economic due to collapse in commodity prices, fall in trade flows, elimination of tourism and ending of remittances home. Mark Lowcock, the head of the agency, is predicting for the first time in 20 years the proportion of people living in poverty will rise. One reason will be that the numbers classified as one step away from famine and dependent on food aid will rise from 130m to 260m. He is arguing with wealthy countries that unless they respond there will be a spate of famines, and problems stored up for as long as a decade, including migration and terrorism. Overall OCHA has proposed $90bn could protect the poor with two thirds dedicated to social protection programs coming from the strengthened balance sheets of international financial institutions. The remaining third - $30bn \u2013 may will have to be delivered by humanitarian agencies funded by an increase in official development assistance. Novel forms of protection are being experimented in low income countries, including open air education, less frequent food distributions, an increase in cash distribution through text messaging and on line education of health workers The increased appeal comes despite a slower than expected spread of the virus than previously foreseen, but OCHA admits information on the spread of virus is still primitive in some countries such as Afghanistan and Yemen. A video emerged on Wednesday of an illegal horse race in Palermo, Italy, that went ahead in defiance of the coronavirus lockdown, writes Lorenzo Tondo, who is based in the city. The clips show dozens of scooters, surrounding the horses that are running in a street near the University of Palermo. Some of the motorcyclists, accompanying the race, wore masks. A military police car that was refuelling in a petrol station immediately gave pursuit. The authorities have launched an investigation to identify those responsible for the illegal race, which allegedly occurred on Monday at around 6am. Illegal horse races are a very common phenomenon in Sicily, where, as the sun rises over Palermo, Messina and Catania, stretches of asphalt are transformed into racetracks. For years, illegal horse racing has been the prize business of the ruthless Sicilian mafia, the Cosa Nostra. The value of a single bet ranges from 50 euros to 5,000, with sweepstakes of up to 20,000. Riders on scooters and motorbikes pursue the horses, goading them to the finish line by sounding their horns and shouting. Races are held on an uphill slope to avoid injuries to horses that have already had their foot nerves surgically severed so they feel no pain racing fast on hard asphalt. Cyprus is also poised to ease lockdown restrictions with the island\u2019s Greek Cypriot president due to announce the time-frame in which the measures will be reversed this evening, writes Helena Smith, the Guardian\u2019s Athens correspondent. The war-split island\u2019s internationally recognised Greek-run south has been under strict lockdown since early March with precautionary policies including a nightly curfew. So far the tough measures have paid off: Greek Cypriot authorities have recorded 15 deaths and 837 confirmed coronavirus cases in a population of some 800,000 \u2013 one of the lowest infection rates in the EU. But speaking earlier on Wednesday finance minister Constantinos Petrides warned the Mediterranean island was also entering \u201cthe most difficult and dangerous [phase]\u201d \u2013 one that could prove catastrophic if handled badly. Petrides was quoted as telling an online economic summit: This where our success in achieving the recovery of the economy will be judged. We are taking a step forward but if we don\u2019t observe the rules of this second, difficult phase, then we could take two steps back. Two steps back would be catastrophic for our health and the economy. The island\u2019s breakaway Turkish-run north has recorded 108 coronavirus cases and four deaths. No new cases have been registered in the statelet for the past ten days, it\u2019s health minister Ali Pilli told Turkey\u2019s Anadolu news agency on Tuesday. Five more patients have died from Covid-19 in Serbia, and 227 more people have been found to be infected with the coronavirus, Telegraf reports. The latest figures bring the total death toll in the country to 173, while 1,292 people have recovered, out of a total of 8,724 confirmed cases. They come as anger begins to boil over at containment measures in the Balkan country, with a second night of noisy protests reverberating through Belgrade and other cities as Serbians bang pots and pans, beat drums and blow whistles and horns from their homes while stuck under curfew, Reuters reports. The government has begun to lift stringent measures - including a state of emergency, closure of borders, daily curfew, and total lockdowns all weekend - but said that a lockdown during the Labour Day holiday on May 1, a important celebration in Serbia, should remain in place. Reuters reports that at the balcony of his apartment in Belgrade\u2019s Vracar neighbourhood, Dragan Djilas, the head of the opposition Alliance for Serbia, and a former leader of the student protests of the 1990s, used a wooden spoon to bang a pot. \u201cThis energy (from the 1990s) has re-emerged as the people cannot endure any longer ... these lockdowns, these 80-hour incarcerations,\u201d Djilas told Reuters. A surge in coronavirus infections on Ireland\u2019s border with Northern Ireland has prompted concern about a possible spillover between the two jurisdictions, writes Rory Carroll, the Guardian\u2019s Dublin correspondent. Seven of the eight counties in Ireland with the highest incidence of cases are now clustered in the north-east, epidemiological reports from Ireland\u2019s Health Service Executive showed this week. Cavan, a largely rural landscape, has overtaken Dublin as the county with the highest rate of infection, with an incidence of 753.5 per 100,000 people compared with Dublin\u2019s 684.6. Cavan has a 43-mile border with the county of Fermanagh in Northern Ireland, which has a looser lockdown than the republic. Infection rates have also increased sharply in Monaghan, which has an incidence of 570.2, and Louth, with 463.2. Five coronavirus cases have been reported in Aden, southern Yemen, by the country\u2019s internationally recognised government, raising the prospect that the war-ravaged country will soon also have an outbreak of the new disease. The country, already declared \u201cthe world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis\u201d by the UN, had so far apparently avoided a mass epidemic, with just a single case reported in early April in the southern government-controlled province of Hadramawt. But five new cases were reported in the southern city of Aden, the interim capital of the internationally-recognised government, the committee monitoring the outbreak said in a Twitter post. Over the past six years, tens of thousands of people, mostly civilians, have been killed in waged by a Saudi-led coalition, armed with billions of dollars\u2019 of high-tech British and American weapons, on Houthi rebels backed by Iran. Humanitarian agencies recently warned that only half of the country\u2019s medical centres are operational. According to the UN more than 24 million Yemenis - more than two thirds of the population - need aid to survive. UNHCR spokeswoman Shabia Mantoo told a virtual news briefing in Geneva Yemen is already considered to be the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crisis. The country is now also facing the overlapping threat of the coronavirus pandemic, and the impact of recent torrential rain and flooding. Deaths from the Covid-19 epidemic in Italy increased by 323 on Wednesday, compared to 382 the day before, the Civil Protection Agency said, while the daily tally of new infections stood at 2,086, broadly stable from 2,091 on Tuesday, Reuters reports. The total death toll since the outbreak came to light on 21 February now stands at 27,682, the agency said, the second highest in the world after that of the US. The number of officially confirmed cases, which includes those who have died and recovered, amounts to 203,591, the third highest global tally behind those of the US and Spain. The UK now has Europe\u2019s second-highest official Covid-19 death toll after Italy, after revised figures were published including deaths from the virus outside hospitals. With 27,359 deaths, Italy remains Europe\u2019s worst-affected country; Spain is now in third place with 24,275 deaths; France is fourth with 23,660. As reported below, the official death toll in the UK is now 26,097. With high numbers of deaths still being reported, it seems set to overtake Italy\u2019s toll soon. The official UK Covid-19 death toll has increased by 4,419 after the government included deaths outside hospital for the first time. As of 5pm on Tuesday, total of 26,097 patients had died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK, according to Public Health England. The figures have been revised retrospectively by PHE since the first death on 2 March 2020. They include 765 deaths reported in the 24 hours to 5pm on 28 April. The change comes after weeks of criticism of the way that the UK had been reporting its coronavirus death toll, which made effective comparisons with other European countries impossible. Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director at PHE, said: \u201cEvery death from COVID-19 is a tragedy. Tracking the daily death count is vital to help us understand the impact of the disease. \u201cThese more complete data will give us a fuller and more up to date picture of deaths in England and will inform the government\u2019s approach as we continue to protect the public.\u201d Treating coronavirus patients with the antiviral drug remdesivir showed no \u201csignificant clinical benefits\u201d in the first randomised trial of its kind, according to research released on Wednesday, AFP reports. In a study among more than 200 Covid-19 patients in Wuhan, China, published in The Lancet, doctors found no positive effects of administering the drug compared with a control group of adults. The findings were released after US pharmaceutical giant Gilead, which makes remdesivir, said a separate large-scale trial with the drug had showed positive results. \u201cUnfortunately, our trial found that while safe and adequately tolerated, remdesivir did not provide significant benefits over placebo,\u201d said Bin Cao from China-Japan Friendship Hospital and Capital Medical University in China, who led the research. \u201cThis is not the outcome we hoped for.\u201d Poland\u2019s prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Wednesday that his government wants a presidential election due in May to go ahead by postal ballot, despite widespread criticism that it will be neither free, fair, legal nor safe. It was unclear on Wednesday whether Morawiecki\u2019s governing right-wing Law and Justice (PiS) party would scrape together enough votes to pass legislation allowing the postal ballot at a 7 May sitting of parliament. Polls show that PiS-allied incumbent President Andrzej Duda could receive 50 percent of the vote for a likely round one victory. But only one in four voters want the election to go ahead as scheduled on 10 May, according to a fresh opinion poll. Liberal opposition leaders have called on voters to boycott the election, should it go ahead as scheduled. Poland will reopen hotels, shopping centres and childcare facilities next week, Morawiecki said as he outlined steps to ease the country\u2019s coronavirus lockdown. Hotels, malls and some museums will reopen on 4 May, while childcare facilities will resume work two days later, he said. Wearing masks outdoors and social distancing would still be mandatory, he added, appealing for \u201csocial discipline\u201d on the \u201cbumpy road to flattening the curve\u201d of infection and death. \u201cWe\u2019re opening up the economy significantly, but we\u2019re not loosening safety rules by an inch,\u201d Morawiecki said, adding that stores would continue to allow only one person per 15 square meters (yards). \u201cWe can\u2019t be irresponsible, I ask you to maintain social discipline,\u201d he said. Poles have been required to stay home since last month. The country reported 197 new cases and 10 new deaths on Wednesday, bringing its total death toll to 624 out of 12,640 cases, while 3,025 patients have been recorded as having fully recovered. Germany has extended its global travel warning until 14 June, and has said it will review the situation once again then, Kate Connolly, the Guardian\u2019s Berlin correspondent, reports. But with German summer holidays, which are staggered across the country, already due to start in some regions on 22 June, some have been calling on the government to make a more definitive call as to whether summer is on or off. Many Germans are already gearing themselves up for a staycation, or \u2018Heimaturlaub\u2019 as it\u2019s being dubbed here, though even that is uncertain, as the government message remains \u201cstay at home\u201d. A decision on domestic travel - currently restricted to anything but essential journeys - is due to be announced on 6 May. Heiko Maas, the foreign minister, said the travel warning was in line with the many other countries in the world which have entry bans and stay at home orders, and airlines who have drastically reduced flights, meaning that even if the German government allowed people to travel they risked getting stuck abroad. The government recently spent several weeks and millions of euros bringing home 240,000 Germans stranded abroad due to the coronavirus. Maas said: \u201cWe will not be repeating anything similar in the coming summer\u201d. He said he still had hopes that the travel restrictions could be lifted in June, \u201ctowards which everyone can do their bit, by sticking to the rules still in place,\u201d he said, meaning first and foremost physical distancing. \u201cWe are simply not yet there in fighting this pandemic, where we would like to be,\u201d Maas said. By Wednesday afternoon, Germany had 160,553 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 6,451 people had died. The government\u2019s disease control agency, the Robert Koch Institute said yesterday the country\u2019s reproduction rate is currently at 1, which means every person with the illness is passing it on to one other person. This slight rise - from 0.7 two weeks ago - is not, as has sometimes been reported, attributable to an easing of lockdown conditions, as they only happened a week ago. The figures to watch will be those next Wednesday, as the virus\u2019 incubation period is up to two weeks. A dozen European Union member states have called for a relaxation of air-passenger rights rules to help airlines deal with the economic fallout from coronavirus, writes Jennifer Rankin, the Guardian\u2019s Brussels correspondent. France, Poland, the Netherlands and Ireland are among the 12 countries who have proposed amending EU rules, so airlines can reimburse cancelled tickets with vouchers, rather than cash. Air-France/KLM and Lufthansa are currently negotiating government bailouts, while British Airways has announced plans to make 12,000 employees redundant, as the virus has brought international travel to a near standstill, leaving planes grounded. The 12 member states argue the requirement of a 2004 EU regulation to reimburse cancelled flights in cash is adding to airlines\u2019 cash-flow problems. The joint statement calls on the European commission, which oversees EU law, to urgently amend the law. The goal shared by the European Union and its member states must now be to preserve the structure of the European air traffic market beyond the current crisis, while considering the interests and necessary protection of passengers. The EU\u2019s 27 transport ministers are holding a conference call to discuss an exit from current restrictions. So far the commission has declined to say publicly whether it backs the voucher plan. \u201cThe debate is ongoing so I am not now giving you the final word,\u201d European commission vice president V\u0115ra Jourov\u00e1 told reporters earlier today. But her colleague in charge of transport, Adina V\u0103lean, has previously said airlines can only offer vouchers if passengers can accept them. Ministers are also looking at what green strings should be attached to airline bailouts. France\u2019s transport minister \u00c9lisabeth Borne has said government aid for Air France would be linked to cutting pollution, including a 50% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2024 for domestic flights and fleet renewal to cut total emissions. The World Health Organization head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus is outlining what happened before his declaration of a worldwide public health emergency three months ago. There have been continual questions raised - most prominently by the US - about the actions of the WHO in raising the alarm over the virus, so Ghebreyesus\u2019s statement today is probably to some extent a defence of its decisions. Here are the latest coronavirus statistics from Somalia. Today\u2019s World Health Organization press briefing is just beginning. You can tune in live in the player at the top of the blog. In South Africa more than 6 million people have been screened for Covid-19 and 200,000 tests have been carried out, says health minister Zweli Mkhize. The country is yet to publish its coronavirus statistics for today. Online demand for the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine surged by more than 1,000% after Donald Trump endorsed it as a potential treatment for Covid-19 without providing evidence it worked, a new study has found, writes Guardian US reporter Jessica Glenza in New York. There are no proven prescription therapies to treat Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Despite the lack of evidence, the presidential endorsement drove up online searches for buying hydroxychloroquine, and its chemical cousin chloroquine, by 1,389% and 442% respectively. Internet searches remained high, researchers said, even after NBC News reported an American couple had accidentally poisoned themselves by taking a liquid containing chloroquine meant to treat parasites in fish tanks, following a Trump press briefing in which he promoted the drug. Michael Liu, a graduate student at Oxford University and the study\u2019s first author, said in a statement: We know that high-profile endorsements matter in advertising, so it stands to reason that these endorsements could spur people to seek out these medications. The research was published as a letter in the Journal of the American Medical Association Internal Medicine. The UK home secretary has said she is considering enforced quarantine and thermal screening at the border, among possible measures to prevent further spread of coronavirus, as she was challenged by MPs over the UK border policy during the pandemic, reports Jamie Grierson, the Guardian\u2019s home affairs correspondent. Many other countries have implemented some kind of border screening regime to ensure they are not importing new cases of the disease. Some even closed their borders entirely. Appearing before an online session of the home affairs select committee, Priti Patel said the UK\u2019s approach was being informed by advice from the scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) but added that \u201ceverything is under review\u201d. Patel was told 130 countries had taken stricter approaches at the border than the UK, including Germany, New Zealand, South Korea, Italy, Singapore, Australia and Greece. She said: We are not similar to those countries, in terms of travellers and passenger flows. It\u2019s a fact that the UK has one of the largest numbers of international arrivals, very different flows to some of the countries mentioned that is a key consideration of Sage. But the home secretary said discussions were ongoing, adding: \u201cWe rule nothing out.\u201d Several hundred small business owners protested in Kiev, Ukraine, on Wednesday, demanding the authorities ease anti-virus restrictions to save them from bankruptcy, AFP reports. Wearing surgical masks, demonstrators briefly blocked traffic outside a government building in the centre of the capital in defiance of rules against public gatherings, an AFP journalist reported. \u201cOne more day of your protection and we will disappear!\u201d read one slogan. Ukraine reported 456 new cases and 11 new deaths on Wednesday, bringing the total number of infections to 9,866 coronavirus cases and the death toll to 250. The country has been under lockdown since March, when authorities ordered all non-essential businesses to close - with only grocery stores and pharmacies permitted to remain open. Public transport has been reserved for employees of essential services, including police and hospital staff. Venezuela has said it is ready to accept humanitarian assistance from anywhere in the world to deal with its coronavirus outbreak, after US officials apparently said it had refused help. In an announcement on the government website, Venezuela\u2019s president, Nicolas Maduro, said: We are ready to receive any humanitarian aid or donation from any country wants today. We have very clear priorities. The situation in Venezuela was discussed on Tuesday at the UN security council, with EU members warning after the meeting that the coronavirus pandemic risks inflicting \u201ca devastating human impact in a country grappling with an already grave economic, social and humanitarian situation.\u201d In a statement, members of the group said: The EU members of the Security Council call for the depoliticization of humanitarian assistance and for safe and unhindered humanitarian access throughout the country. The EU members of the Security Council reiterate that EU sanctions in Venezuela are targeted against individuals responsible for grave human rights violations and explicitly designed not to affect the population. Therefore the sanctions do not impede humanitarian or medical assistance in any way. The EU is the largest donor to the Venezuelan humanitarian crisis, providing more than half of all funding. We call for more efforts to respond to the underfunded relief efforts for this complex humanitarian emergency. Egypt is the African country with the most coronavirus infections, according to a daily round up reported by the World Health Organization\u2019s regional office for the continent. With 5,042 infections, according to the update posted earlier today, Egypt is slightly ahead of South Africa, which has 4,996 confirmed cases. The country which has recorded the most deaths so far is Algeria. The WHO has repeatedly warned that the outbreak in Africa is in its early stages and could prove devastating, although many African countries have acted fast to impose lockdowns to curb the spread of the virus. Some point to a low overall level of testing on the continent as a reason why there are comparatively few confirmed cases among its 1.3bn people. US plane manufacturer Boeing plans to axe 16,000 jobs \u2013 one in 10 of its global workforce \u2013 in a drastic round of cost cutting in response to the coronavirus pandemic and the grounding of its 737 Max plane, Jasper Jolly reports. The job losses come after the US manufacturer made a core operating loss of $1.7bn during the first three months of the year during an unprecedented crisis for the global aerospace and aviation industries. It has also increased estimates of the 737 Max costs to $5bn in total. The manufacturer has been bleeding money after two fatal crashes in two years prompted the worldwide grounding of the 737 Max, while the coronavirus pandemic has wiped out global demand for air travel. Boeing\u2019s airline customers have cut thousands of jobs to adjust to lower demand, such as British Airways\u2019 plan to make 12,000 workers redundant. Boeing\u2019s chief executive, Dave Calhoun, said the crisis was putting \u201cunprecedented pressure\u201d on the company, but said it was \u201cprogressing toward the safe return to service of the 737 Max\u201d. It had already suspended 737 Max production in December as it awaited regulatory approval to fly again. The airline manufacturer is seeking a bailout worth tens of billions of dollars from the US government as it tries to survive. Germany faces its worst recession since the second world war, with its GDP predicted to shrink by a record 6.3%, the government said on Wednesday. AFP reported the economy minister Peter Altmaier as saying: We will experience the worst recession in the history of the federal republic. The effects of the coronavirus pandemic will push our economy into a recession after 10 years of growth. Germany in particular will feel the pain from disruptions to supply chains and lower demand for made-in-Germany goods from abroad, with exports expected to plunge 11.6%, Altmaier said. The government offered a glimmer of hope however, predicting that the economy would bounce back in 2021 and grow by 5.2 % as the virus impact wanes and businesses reopen. The International Labour Organisation has warned that almost half the global workforce \u2013 1.6 billion people \u2013 are in \u201cimmediate danger of having their livelihoods destroyed\u201d by the economic impact of Covid-19, Philip Inman, a Guardian economics writer, reports. Of the total global working population of 3.3 billion, about 2 billion work in the \u201cinformal economy\u201d, often on short-term contracts or self-employment, and suffered a 60% collapse in their wages in the first month of the crisis. Of these, 1.6 billion face losing their livelihoods, the ILO warned on Wednesday. \u201cIt shows I think in the starkest possible terms that the jobs employment crisis and all of its consequences is deepening by comparison with our estimates of three weeks ago,\u201d the UN agency\u2019s director general, Guy Ryder, told a briefing, foreseeing a \u201cmassive\u201d poverty impact. For millions of workers, no income means no food, no security and no future. Millions of businesses around the world are barely breathing They have no savings or access to credit. These are the real faces of the world of work. If we don\u2019t help them now, they will simply perish. Measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus in jails should not lead to impunity for prisoners convicted of serious violations of human rights, genocide or other crimes against humanity, a UN expert has said. Fabi\u00e1n Salvioli, the UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence, has published guidelines for governments in dealing with such serious criminals. In the first instance, Salvioli says, they should be relocated to prisons where they can be detained in safe and healthy conditions. Only if this is impossible should they be placed under temporary house arrest. Under no circumstances should they be pardoned or otherwise become exempt from their criminal liability. In the guidelines, published on Wednesday in English and Spanish, he added: These individuals usually enjoy conditions of detention - established for security reasons - that avoid mass contact (for example, through detention in special establishments and/or in individual or two or three person cells), which places them at an advantage in terms of safety and health compared to other persons deprived of their liberty. Earlier this month, the Guardian reported that former Chilean military agents convicted of serious human rights violations under the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet could be freed by a ruling that sought to halt the spread of the coronavirus among the country\u2019s prison population. Some government senators had argued that it should also apply to inmates at the infamous Punta Peuco prison \u2013 a comfortable facility housing about 70 inmates convicted of dictatorship-era human rights violations. More than 5,000 people in Brazil have lost their lives to the coronavirus \u2013 even more people than in China, if its official statistics are to be believed. But, writes Tom Phillips in Rio de Janeiro, on Tuesday night Brazil\u2019s president shrugged off the news. \u201cSo what?\u201d Jair Bolsonaro told reporters when asked about the record 474 deaths that day. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. What do you want me to do?\u201d Bolsonaro\u2019s 11-word response \u2013 the latest in a series of remarks belittling the pandemic \u2013 sparked immediate fury. One newspaper, the Estado de Minas, stamped the president\u2019s words on to a black front page beside Brazil\u2019s death toll: 5,017. \u201cBolsonaro isn\u2019t just an awful politician and a bad president, he\u2019s a despicable human being,\u201d tweeted Marcelo Freixo, a leftwing opponent. A wave of disgust swept over social media as word of the president\u2019s comments spread. \u201cA sociopath,\u201d tweeted the musician Nando Moura. \u201cWhat a tragedy,\u201d wrote the journalist S\u00f4nia Bridi. \u201cIt\u2019s a mockery. An insult. It is intolerable,\u201d tweeted Mariliz Pereira Jorge, a scriptwriter and commentator. Damien Gayle back at the controls now after my break.

The Japanese government are planning to extend the state of emergency due to the coronavirus pandemic by about one month for the entire country, the Nikkei business daily reported on Wednesday. The government will make a final decision after hearing from experts at a meeting on Friday, the Nikkei said. The state of emergency is currently scheduled to end on 6 May. A fruit and vegetable seller waits for customers after street markets were reopened in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil amid the coronavirus pandemic. Guinea-Bissau\u2019s Prime Minister Nuno Gomes Nabiam has tested positive coronavirus alongside three members of his cabinet, AP reports. Nabiam, Interior Minister Botche Cande and two other ministers were diagnosed on Tuesday and have been quarantined at a hotel in the capital Bissau, Health Minister Antonio Deuna told journalists. He did not provide details of the officials\u2019 condition or treatment, but warned the country\u2019s rate of infection could rise. The West African nation has so far confirmed more than 70 cases and one death - a senior police commissioner. The Swiss government has extended its ban on public events exceeding 1000 people until the end of August, even as it announced the easing of some other restrictions on sporting events, shops, restaurants and museums. Some border restrictions will also begin being eased from May 11, it said. Moreover, professional sports teams can resume play on June 8, the government added, though without spectators. It will decide on events of less than 1,000 people on May 27. At this stage, gatherings are limited to five people. This is Gregory Robinson, taking over the live blog for the next hour. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter to share insight or to send tips, I\u2019m on @Gregoryjourno or send me an email at gregory.robinson@guardian.co.uk Here is the latest coronavirus update from Kenya\u2019s Ministry of Health. The total number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Sweden rose past the 20,000 mark on Wednesday, after the Nordic country reported another 681 infections. The latest update from Sweden\u2019s Public Health Agency showed there were now 20,302 cases of coronavirus in the country, which has held back from the kinds of strict lockdowns seen elsewhere in the world. Another 107 deaths were reported, bringing the Swedish Covid-19 death toll to 2,462, while 1,005 patients have so far recovered. India\u2019s confirmed coronavirus death toll passed 1,000 on Wednesday following its highest daily increase, but the numbers remain low compared with Europe and the United States in a phenomenon that is puzzling experts, AFP reports. With massive slums and a shaky healthcare system, there were fears India would be ravaged by the pandemic that has killed more than 214,000 people worldwide. The latest daily toll of 73 deaths was India\u2019s highest, offering a warning that the giant South Asian nation was not yet in the clear. A lack of testing and many other factors mean that India\u2019s official toll of 1,007 deaths could be far below the real number of coronavirus victims. Virologist T. Jacob John told AFP: We see low numbers but we do not know how to validate those numbers or rates ... Governments desire under-reporting and ... we are flying blind for true rates and numbers. Throughout this outbreak we have been gripped by the Johns Hopkins University world map showing the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. Now the Manchester-based Omega Research Foundation has published another kind of coronavirus map, plotting the spread of coronavirus-related civil rights abuses. The researchers say: In recent months many states have created emergency powers to slow the spread of coronavirus. Law enforcement agencies have frequently been tasked with enforcing lockdowns, quarantine and social distancing measures. During this time a large number of allegations of excessive force in implementing such measures have emerged. \u2026 This map seeks to gather together instances of alleged excessive use of force that have occurred in the context of coronavirus measure or protests arising from coronavirus-related concerns. Due to the sheer number of cases the map does not include all incidents reported; instead it seeks to provide a barometer of the nature and geographic spread of such cases. Ireland looks set to extend its lockdown despite growing calls to ease restrictions and salvage the economy, reports Rory Carroll in Dublin. The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said on Wednesday that new cases of Covid-19 infections, deaths and intensive care admissions appeared too high to start relaxing rules that are to expire on 5 May. We\u2019ll be getting new advice from the chief medical officer on Friday as to when we should start that process of reopening the economy and the country. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be out of school by saying that those numbers just aren\u2019t good enough yet. Maybe it will change significantly by Friday, but as things stand I don\u2019t think we\u2019re there yet. Delays in ramping up testing, which are at only half the promised rate of 15,000 tests a day, are another reason the lockdown may be extended. Speaking during a visit with health officials to a community assessment hub in Dublin, Varadkar said the government would this week outline an \u201cexit strategy\u201d to reopening the country. Compliance with restrictions remains high but some business leaders, politicians and commentators are demanding more clarity and urgency about restoring economic activity. Varadkar was photographed on Monday wearing scrubs and a face mask while helping with Covid-19 testing at a Traveller site in his west Dublin constituency. A medical doctor before becoming a full-time politician, he re-registered last month to do one shift a week. Another 145 people have died from Covid-19 in the Netherlands, the highest daily reported number in more than a week, bringing the country\u2019s total reported death toll from the virus to 4,711. According to the latest update from the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), 386 more people have been found to be infected with the coronavirus - more than double the number reported on Tuesday, when the lowest number for several weeks was recorded. So far the country has recorded 38,802 confirmed cases. Of those, 10,685 have been treated in hospital, with a further 76 Covid-19-related admissions reported on Wednesday. Not all of the reported hospital admissions or deaths occurred within the last 24 hours, RIVM said. Euronews correspondent Oliver Mio\u010di\u0107 has discovered that a dozen EU countries are to ask the EU commission for a temporary suspension of passengers\u2019 rights to a refund for flights cancelled due to the coronavirus outbreak. It comes as the airline industry is on its knees from a collapse in international travel as a result of the outbreak. The World Bank has allocated $195m to 64 poor countries to help finance their efforts to contain the coronavirus pandemic. According to a press release from the bank, which provides loans and grants to poorer countries for capital projects, the money is to go towards medical equipment, therapeutics and medicines, and to support health workers. Annette Dixon, Vice President for Human Development at the World Bank, said: This funding is in addition to the World Bank Group\u2019s commitment of up to US$160 billion to fight COVID-19. PEF funding will supplement the critical emergency support operations underway to help save lives, detect, prevent and respond to coronavirus in poor countries. The funding was on Wednesday welcomed by Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization. Russia has extended an entry ban for foreigners to slow the spread of coronavirus. The decree barring foreigners from entering the country, which was introduced in mid-March, was set to expire Wednesday. But instead prime minister Mikhail Mishustin extended it apparently until further notice. According to a report on AFP, Mishustin told officials meeting to discuss Russia\u2019s response to the pandemic: I have signed a government resolution on extending it until the fight against the infection is over and the epidemic situation has improved. Russia reported 5,841 new cases of the coronavirus on Wednesday, bringing its overall nationwide case tally to 99,399. The official nationwide death toll reached 972 on Wednesday after 108 more deaths were announced. President Vladimir Putin warned on Tuesday that Russia had not yet reached the peak of coronavirus infections and extended lockdown measures in the country for two weeks. Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: The official global death toll exceeded 217,000, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University researchers. They said at least 3,116,680 people have been infected worldwide and at least 217,168 have died since the outbreak began. China\u2019s parliament is to hold its annual meeting from 22 May - more than two months later than planned. Conditions for holding the meeting have been met as the coronavirus situation has improved, decision makers said. Russia\u2019s coronavirus case tally neared the 100,000 milestone after the country reported 5,841 new cases of the coronavirus on Wednesday, bringing its overall nationwide tally to 99,399, Reuters reports. UK government is still aiming for 100,000 daily tests by tomorrow, according to the environment secretary, George Eustice. He said the search for an effective antibody test was still under way and denied that earlier introduction of testing at care homes would have saved lives. The coronavirus outbreak needs to be contained before 2021 Olympics can go ahead, the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said. \u201cThe Olympic Games must be held in a way that shows the world has won its battle against the coronavirus pandemic.\u201d The UK prime minister Boris Johnson and his partner Carrie Symonds announced the birth of a baby boy. Johnson returned to frontline work on Monday after falling ill with coronavirus and spending time in intensive care. Air passenger numbers are down 99% in the UK, the home secretary told MPs, as she defended the government\u2019s decision not to test individuals entering the country. On Friday, a total of 9,906 people entered the country. A group of major Portuguese authors have found a way to keep themselves and their readers busy during the lockdown: they\u2019re writing a serial novel, with each writer given 24 hours to respond to the previous chapter, writes Guardian books reporter Alison Flood. Portugal\u2019s literary version of the exquisite corpse game was dreamed up by the award-winning author Ana Margarida de Carvalho, who challenged her fellow writers to join her in writing a collective, serial novel with her as Portugal went into lockdown. More than 40 responded, their story opening with a group of scientists trying to find a cure for a virus that has caused a global pandemic. Describing the project, De Carvalho said: For us, writers, it is normal and it may even be a good condition to be closed and focused to write our books. But when we are compelled to do so, when we find ourselves under a catastrophe of such an overwhelming scale, I think that what could be an ideal time to write turns into extremely suffocating conditions. So, instead of dedicating myself to my own book and making a quarantine diary, describing trips around my room as Xavier de Maistre, I thought it might be more interesting to break the walls around us through literature, and bypass the social isolation. Schools in Turkey will remain shut until the end of May, education minister Ziya Selcuk has said, in keeping with growing indications the country will try to reopen after the Eid al-Fitr holiday marking the end of Ramadan, reports Bethan McKernan, the Guardian\u2019s Turkey and Middle East correspondent, in Istanbul. Schools were initially closed on 12 March, after Turkey confirmed its first case of Covid-19. Officials have since instigated wide-reaching measures to slow the spread of the virus, but resisted calls to shut down the economy completely, fearing that a second recession in as many years will further damage the ruling Justice and Development (AKP) party\u2019s already waning popularity. Turkey is one of the worst affected countries in the world with nearly 115,000 cases and a death toll of nearly 3,000, although doctors\u2019 unions say infections are underreported. There has been a fall in newly reported deaths over the last eight days. Both international and domestic Turkish Airlines flights will stay grounded until 28 May, the national carrier said in a statement on Tuesday. Earlier this week, President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan promised forthcoming details on a timeframe for reviving both the public and private sectors. As France prepares to end its lockdown on 11 May, the government has published a number of key dates for the gradual reopening of public life, Kim Willsher, the Guardian\u2019s Paris correspondent, reports. All will depend on the spread of the virus. If there are still too many cases, the lockdown restrictions will not be eased. In any case, decisions on where to ease restrictions will be taken in consultation with local authorities and will differ in different regions. 30 April: the head of the health authority, French Public Health J\u00e9r\u00f4me Salomon will begin giving data on the virus in each French department in his evening coronavirus figures. This data will be used to decide where lockdown restrictions will be eased and where some may continue. 7 May: Depending on where the virus is \u201ccirculating\u201d, each department will be designated \u201cgreen\u201d, where restrictions will be lifted on 11 May, or \u201cred\u201d where they may not. 11 May: Masks will be available for the general public. Shops - excluding shopping malls and centres - and businesses will reopen. Public transport will be up and running but masks will be obligatory and half the seats on trains, metros, trams and buses will be left empty to maintain social distancing. Nursery and primary school staff will return to work to prepare for the reopening of establishments. Places of worship can reopen but no services to be held. Some parks will open in areas designated \u201cgreen\u201d. 12 May: Nurseries and primary school school classes reopen. Children in groups no bigger than 10 with no contact between them. 18 May: The two lowest secondary school (coll\u00e8ge in French) years open. These are 6\u00e8me - ages 11-12 and 5\u00e8me (12-13). Classes of 15 pupils maximum, masks mandatory for pupils and professors, and hand gel to be widely available in schools. May/June: Decision to be made on when bars, caf\u00e9s, restaurants, cinemas and cultural establishments can reopen. 2 June: Further easing or tightening of restrictions will be introduced depending on the presence and spread of the coronavirus in the previous three weeks. Paris coronavirus \u201cexiles\u201d should return to the city at the end of lockdown in France on 11 May, but not all at once, transport minister Jean-Baptiste Djebbari has said, Kim Willsher, the Guardian\u2019s Paris correspondent, reports. The exodus of city-dwellers in the hours before the strict lockdown came into effect at noon on 17 March was hugely controversial. Those who left the capital were accused of spreading the virus to rural areas where they had holiday homes, and it also served the highlight the inequalities of Covid-19 dividing Parisiens into those lucky enough to have second homes who could flee Paris, and those confined in small flats often with no gardens, terraces or balconies who had no choice but to stay. Those returning to the city by train must reserve their seats, which will be limited to half the number of passengers they would normally carry to avoid crowding. Prime Minister \u00c9douard Philippe has warned non-essential long distance travel - journeys more than 100km - will be strongly discouraged even after 11 May. There are several bank holidays in May in France, but Philippe said the population should not even think about \u201cgoing away for the weekend\u201d. As Europe and the US grapple with coronavirus outbreaks, agonising over plans to exit economically devastating lockdowns, one small south east Asian country has all but beaten the outbreak. Vietnam has now gone five days straight without reporting any new confirmed cases of coronavirus, and nearly two weeks without any domestic transmission, with its prime minister saying on Tuesday that his country had \u201cbasically put the pandemic under control.\u201d By Wednesday, the country had recorded a total of just 270 cases, of whom 222 had been announced to have recovered, and zero deaths. However, of those who still had active coronavirus infections, 11 had already tested negative at least once before relapsing, ch\u00e0ohanoi reported. According to the news site, Vietnam had conducted more than 210,000 coronavirus tests, without recording any domestic transmission for 13 days. On Friday, Vietnam began easing some of its strict lockdown conditions, but it remains to be seen how it can continue its remarkable record without remaining effectively cut off from the rest of the world. Many other countries have since abandoned efforts to contain the disease, with some, such as the Netherlands and Sweden, now saying their strategy is to allow for a controlled spread through their populations to eventually achieve \u201cherd immunity\u201d. Two new cases confirmed last Friday were Vietnamese patients who had recently returned from Japan. In India, where there are now upwards of 25,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus, misinformation and attacks on both the living who have caught the virus, and the dead, are becoming widespread, Hannah Ellis-Petersen, the Guardian\u2019s south Asia correspondent, reports. Digging the grave was slow, harrowing work. As Dr Pradeep Kumar and his two assistants shared only a single shovel between them, they took to using their hands, desperately and hurriedly grabbing fistfuls of mud, looking fearfully around every few minutes. At about six metres deep they stopped. Kumar, convulsing with sorrow, rolled the wrapped body of his colleague, Dr Simon Hercules, into the grave, then quickly covered it over with earth. Under the cover of midnight darkness, the three men ran for their lives out of the cemetery. \u201cWhat happened to Dr Simon made me lose my faith in humanity,\u201d said Kumar. \u201cIt should never happen to anyone ever, ever again.\u201d Another 325 people died of Covid-19 in Spain , in a slight increase in the daily figure that pushed the overall toll in the country past 24,000, the government said Wednesday, AFP reports. Despite the rise from Tuesday\u2019s figure of 301, it was the sixth consecutive day that the number has been below 400 in Spain, which has now lost 24,275 lives as a result of the coronavirus. The number of people who have recovered from the virus rose by 6,399 over the past 24 hours in what was a record daily high since the start of the epidemic, raising the overall number to 108,947. The latest figures show Spain has so far counted 212,917 cases of COVID-19, the second-highest figure in the world, although the health ministry only registers cases confirmed by testing. Until late last week, the government was also including the numbers of those shown to have developed antibodies. Spain has suffered the third-highest death toll in the world after the US and Italy. Covid-related slaughterhouse shutdowns in the US are leading to fears of meat shortages and price rises, while farmers are being forced to consider \u201cdepopulating\u201d their animals, reports Sophie Kevany for the Guardian\u2019s Animals Farmed project. More than 20 slaughterhouses have been forced to close, although some have subsequently reopened. On Tuesday President Trump issued an executive order to keep slaughterhouses open which would, he said, help solve liability problems for meat companies. At least two million animals have already reportedly been culled on farm, and that number is expected to rise. Approved methods for slaughtering poultry include slow suffocation by covering them with foam, or by shutting off the ventilation into the barns. A nationwide advisory issued last Friday by the US Department of Agriculture and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said state veterinarians and government officials would be ready to assist with culls, or \u201cdepopulation\u201d, if alternatives could not be found. Germany on Wednesday reported 1,304 more cases of the novel coronavirus and 202 more deaths, according to data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases. The numbers, reported by Reuters, were a slight increase on the 1,154 new cases and 188 deaths announced on Tuesday. Europe\u2019s most populous country now has a total of 157,641 confirmed cases and 6,115 deaths, according to the tally. From today in Germany, masks will be needed to enter shops, which began to open last week after the government declared its outbreak under control. Nose and mouth coverings are already compulsory on buses, trains and trams. Earlier, German MEP Dr Peter Liese said he agreed with his country\u2019s decision to implement new rules legally requiring most people to wear face masks on public transport, long-distance trains and in shops.

I look forward to hearing from you. Israelis celebrated their Independence Day at home Wednesday amid a nationwide lockdown aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. The Associated Press reports that the the national holiday is usually a festive occasion with people heading to the beach, hosting barbecues and watching fireworks, but that was not possible this year because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Israeli air force devoted its annual fly-by to health workers, with planes crisscrossing the nation and performing aerial acrobatics over hospitals and medical centers. Other events were to be broadcast online, with no live audience. Iran\u2019s death toll from the coronavirus has reached 5,957, according to a report by Reuters. A health ministry official said the total number of coronavirus cases has reached 93,657. Indonesia confirmed 260 new coronavirus infections on Wednesday, taking the total in the south-east Asian nation to 9,771, Reuters reports. Health ministry official Achmad Yurianto said there was 11 new deaths, taking the total number of fatalities to 784, while 1,391 people have recovered. More than 67,700 people have been tested. Demonstrators chanted pro-democracy slogans in a luxury mall in Hong Kong on Wednesday, the latest in a string of small but determined protests as the city\u2019s coronavirus outbreak slows, AP reports. More than 100 protesters gathered at lunchtime in the Landmark Atrium mall in Central, a prestigious business and retail district, despite social distancing rules that prohibit public gatherings of more than four. Malaysia reported 94 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday with no new deaths, the health ministry said. Reuters reports the country has so far recorded a total of 5,945 infections, with 100 fatalities. In Afghanistan, the health ministry has warned that the country is heading toward the peak of coronavirus as Kabul recorded its biggest one-day rise of new infections amid a war raging across the country. The health ministry confirmed 110 new Covid-19 over past 24 hours, pushing total number of infections to 1,939. This was triggered by biggest one-day rise of infections in Kabul and continued surge of transmission in Kandahar. There were 58 confirmed cases in the capital Kabul, which has so far been country\u2019s worst affected area with 555 confirmed cases. The city of six million is under a lockdown in a bid to contain spread of the virus. Three patients died in Herat on Tuesday, Abdul Hakim Tamanna, the head of Herat\u2019s health department, said, bringing the number of deaths to 61. The number of new infections continued to surge in Kandahar on Wednesday as 15 new patients tested positive for Covid-19, Kandahar has so far recorded 249 cases. President Ashraf Ghani has issued a decree Monday to release 12,399 prisoners convicted for different crimes to contain spread of virus in prisons. This is in addition to 10,000 already in the process to be released. Wahidullah Mayar, a health ministry spokesman, said on Wednesday that the peak of the virus is yet to come and said a \u201cnumber of new infections are rising daily so we\u2019re heading toward the peak and I ask people to stay at home\u201d. Meanwhile, at least three civilians were killed and eight others were wounded in a suicide attack this morning in Kabul. The Afghan Commandos Special Unit said that the victims have been transferred to the hospital by Afghan commandos. No group has claimed responsibility. Banks set on fire in Lebanon during deadly riots Protests against growing economic hardship erupted in Tripoli and spread to other Lebanese cities, as the shutdown to fight the new coronavirus made matters worse for the economy Banks were set ablaze as violence boiled over into a second night. One demonstrator was killed in riots, as a collapse in the currency, soaring inflation and spiralling unemployment convulse Lebanon, a country in deep financial crisis since October. The Philippines\u2019 health ministry said on Wednesday that confirmed cases of the new coronavirus in the country have risen to more than 8,000, according to Reuters. The health ministry recorded 254 new infections and 28 additional deaths. The total coronavirus cases has reached 8,212, while deaths have hit 558. Guardian reporter Febriana Firdaus has written about the fear and illness that\u2019s been stalking Indonesia\u2019s packed jails as prisoners hope for early release as part of the Covid-19 pardon programme. Russia reported 5,841 new cases of the coronavirus on Wednesday, bringing its overall nationwide case tally to 99,399. Reuters reports that the official nationwide death toll reached 972 on Wednesday after 108 people with the virus died in the last 24 hours. Singapore\u2019s health ministry confirmed 690 more coronavirus infections on Wednesday, taking total cases to 15,641. Most of the new cases are among migrant workers living in dormitories in the city-state, which has among the highest number of coronavirus infections in Asia, according to a report by Reuters. It will be difficult to host the Tokyo Olympic Games in 2021 unless the coronavirus pandemic is contained, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Wednesday. The Tokyo Olympic games were postponed until next year following the rapid spread of the coronavirus. But Abe appeared doubtful about whether that could go ahead if the coronavirus remained a global issue. Reuters reports when asked by an opposition lawmaker whether Tokyo could host the Games next year, Abe told parliament: \u201cThe Olympic Games must be held in a way that shows the world has won its battle against the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cOtherwise, it will be hard to hold the Games.\u201d President Donald Trump response has come under fire - again. This time, the criticism comes from Hu Xijin, the editor of the Chinese state-backed English-language paper, the Global Times. German MEP Dr Peter Liese said he agrees with his country\u2019s decision to implement new rules legally requiring most people to wear face masks on public transport, long-distance trains and in shops. Liese also told Kay Burley on Sky News this morning that he was glad the UK was in the European research programme despite Brexit. He said: I think it\u2019s a good decision when you are in a shop or public transport to wear a mask. You should still keep the distance, especially on public transport. There may be occasions where you can\u2019t your distance and then the mask will help to reduce risk. I\u2019m happy the United Kingdom is still attributed to work with us in the European research programme. Even though we had Brexit and a transition period, we need to work together in developing therapy and vaccine in the United Kingdom, in the European Union, and in cooperation with other partners. Vaccinations for up to 12 million children to prevent the spread of polio in Africa will be delayed, in a major redeployment of polio eradication resources to fight the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. Polio prevention campaigns, which are vital to avert outbreaks, will be suspended until at least the second half of 2020, said Dr Pascal Mkanda, the head of polio for World Health Organization Africa. The decision will inevitably lead to a rise in polio cases. \u201cWe took the difficult decision to suspend these plans and considered it would have a significant impact on preventing the spread of new outbreaks,\u201d he said. \u201cNew outbreaks of polio will appear because we will not be able to administer the vaccines in time.\u201d The move is the \u201cright decision\u201d, Mkanda said, \u201cbecause we need to tackle Covid-19 and because the process of administering vaccinations can actually increase the spread of the virus\u201d.

According to the Johns Hopkins researchers, at least 3,116,680 people have been infected worldwide and at least 217,168 have died since the outbreak began. The numbers are likely to be significant underestimates due to suspected underreporting and differing testing and recording systems around the world. US cases account for roughly a third of the known global total, at over 1 million. China\u2019s parliament will start its annual meeting on 22 May. China is set to hold its annual parliamentary meeting on 22 May, two months later than originally planned. China\u2019s top political consultative body, the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference, has also proposed to start its annual session on 21 May. It\u2019s not clear yet how long the meetings will last. More than 5,000 delegates traditionally descend on Beijing from all over China for at least 10 days. China warns relationship with Australia could be damaged \u2018beyond repair\u2019. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, has defied China and defended the \u201centirely reasonable and sensible\u201d call for an investigation into the origins of Covid-19, as the international political fallout over the pandemic deepened. Three US children with coronavirus are being treated for rare inflammatory syndrome. Three US children infected with the coronavirus are being treated for a rare inflammatory syndrome that appears similar to one that has raised concerns by doctors in Britain, Italy and Spain, Reuters reports. Nearly 70 residents have died at a Massachusetts home for ageing veterans. Sixty-eight veteran residents at the state-run Holyoke Soldiers\u2019 Home who tested positive for the virus have died and it\u2019s not known whether another person who died had Covid-19.

The change will only apply to films released this year. Hotels in Poland will be open for summer holidays, government spokesman Piotr Muller told state radio on Wednesday, while adding that the novel coronavirus infections were still on the rise in the country, Reuters reports. On Wednesday, the Polish government is set to announce its decision with regards to reopening some businesses closed until now due to the pandemic. Summer holidays are traditionally held over July and August in Poland, but it is not entirely clear if that will be the case this year. The government has just extended school closures until 24 May. Extend coronavirus wage subsidies or risk delayed redundancies, firms warn The UK government\u2019s plan to subsidise the wages of workers affected by the Covid-19 lockdown should be extended until at least autumn to prevent it from becoming a \u201cwaiting room\u201d for redundancy, employers groups have argued. Demanding the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, make urgent changes to protect workers, firms and the wider economy, the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) said the Treasury\u2019s multibillion-pound coronavirus job retention scheme needed to be made more flexible to allow furloughed staff to work reduced hours. It also said the scheme should run until at least the end of September to help firms through continuing lockdown measures or the gradual easing of tough controls on social and business activity across Britain. BBC could quarantine actors and crews on dramas to aid filming The BBC could put actors and directors in quarantine and remove the studio audience from Strictly Come Dancing under plans to help restart television production after the coronavirus pandemic shut down much of the industry. The proposals, which could affect everything from EastEnders to light entertainment and high-end dramas, are being considered as broadcasters face up to the prospect of enormous gaps in their schedules after much of British television production was stopped dead in mid-March. China bristles at call by Australia to investigate Covid-19 origin The Guardian\u2019s Paul Karp and Helen Davidson report: The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, has defied China and defended the \u201centirely reasonable and sensible\u201d call for an investigation into the origins of Covid-19, as the international political fallout over the pandemic deepened. China has been pushing back against criticism from other governments about how it handled the outbreak of coronavirus, which is believed to have started in Wuhan and which has now infected 3 million people worldwide and killed 200,000. Donald Trump\u2019s accusation at the weekend that Beijing could have done more to prevent the deadly spread of the disease was met with fierce criticism from China\u2019s state media. While Australia has eschewed the more strident approach of the US, which has stopped funding to the World Health Organisation (WHO), it has urged its allies to back an overhaul of the WHO and suggested recruiting independent investigators akin to \u201cweapons inspectors\u201d to determine the source of major disease outbreaks. On Wednesday Morrison said his government \u201cwill of course continue to pursue what is a very reasonable and sensible course of action\u201d. Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. Podcast: why are women less likely to die from Covid-19?

The head of Germany\u2019s Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases called on people to stay at home as much as possible as new figures show the country\u2019s infection rate has increased. France began outlining the schedule for the end of the lockdown. The prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe said: \u201cWho could have envisaged a France where schools, universities, cafes, restaurants, the majority of businesses, libraries \u2026 beaches, stadiums \u2026 would be closed?\u201d \u2018Take your time over a sandwich\u2019: lessons for lockdown from two years of bedrest In 2016 Australian woman Kathryn Wilson was diagnosed with a rare and advanced tumour, which meant she spent two years confined to hospital beds, or her recovery bed at home. She offers some lockdown advice out of her two years of bedrest. \u201cFirstly, you need to make your world smaller,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cYou need to learn to value things and people that are in your immediate field more highly than things that are inaccessible for you right now, so surround yourself with things you care about \u2013 that is your bubble.\u201d For Wilson, that list included houseplants, the full Dwayne \u201cthe Rock\u201d Johnson back catalogue and working out which two-minute noodle was superior. For the majority of people, home is where we are going to be spending all our time until lockdown restrictions are eased, which is why you need to make it somewhere you want to be, she advises. \u201cPut up artwork you like; if you hate your old sheets buy crisp new ones. I\u2019m not saying you can shop your way out of this, but you\u2019re going to be clocking a lot of time on your bed so upgrade anything you use daily that irks you.\u201d You need to readjust your thinking: you don\u2019t want to save time, you want to fill it. When you don\u2019t have anywhere to be you might as well take your time over a sandwich. Don\u2019t be utilitarian about your lunch, apply relishes, make your own mayo. Meals are an important way of marking the passage of the day so make them something to look forward to. At least five of Mexico City\u2019s largest private hospitals have filled up with coronavirus patients and have no room for new ones, doctors and hospital workers said on Tuesday, though more than 100 other medical centres have available beds, Reuters reports. The ABC medical centre, Medica Sur, Hospital Espa\u00f1ol and two of the Angeles group of hospitals were no longer receiving patients with Covid-19, the disease transmitted by the novel coronavirus. Mexico has confirmed 16,752 coronavirus cases and 1,569 deaths, with the capital accounting for 4,400 of the cases and 348 of the deaths, the most of anywhere in the country. The government has said the real number of infected people is significantly higher than the tally of confirmed cases. Overall, Mexico City still had 42% of its general hospital beds available and 67% of beds with respirators, the Mexican government\u2019s head of epidemiology, Jose Luis Alomia, told a news conference late on Tuesday. \u201cThe National Health System still has beds available to be able to attend these type of patients,\u201d said Alomia. \u201cBut, as the cases increase ... we may see a decrease in the availability of beds.\u201d The UN Security Council took no action after discussing the humanitarian situation in Venezuela behind closed doors on Tuesday but its European Union members said the coronavirus pandemic risks having a devastating human impact in a country grappling with an already grave economic, social and humanitarian situation, AP reports. A statement by France, Germany, Belgium, Estonia and former council member Poland reiterated EU concerns about the sharply deteriorating crisis in Venezuela and its destabilizing effects across the region, including its severe humanitarian consequences. The members said the European Union is the largest donor to Venezuelas humanitarian crisis, providing more than half of all funding, and they called for stepped up efforts to respond to the countrys underfunded humanitarian emergency. Kim Jong-un could be sheltering from Covid-19 pandemic, say US and Seoul Kim Jong-un is not ill and could be sheltering from the coronavirus pandemic, according to South Korean and US officials, in the latest possible explanation for the North Korean leader\u2019s recent absence from public life. North Korea insists it has yet to identify a single case of Covid-19, despite sharing a border with China, where the outbreak is believed to have started. Despite recent reports claiming that Kim had missed a key anniversary event after undergoing heart surgery, the South Korean unification minister, Kim Yeon-chul, said it was reasonable to assume that he had decided not to attend as a precaution. Kim was absent from a 15 April ceremony to mark the anniversary of the birth of his grandfather \u2013 and North Korea\u2019s founder \u2013 Kim Il-sung. \u201cWe have intelligence capacity that allows us to say confidently that there are no unusual signs [in North Korea],\u201d Kim Yeon-chul told a parliamentary hearing. New Zealand looks on Australia\u2019s loose lockdown with envy - and horror Looking across the Tasman at their nearest neighbour\u2019s Covid-19 elimination measures during their own strict lockdown of the past month, New Zealanders were torn: some complained that Australians were allowed to buy takeaway coffees and get haircuts under some more permissive lockdown measures. Others shuddered at pictures on social media of Sydney beachfronts thronged with people, saying the images made them \u201cstressed\u201d and \u201canxious\u201d. Either way, the topic of Australia\u2019s more relaxed lockdown \u2013 and whether it would prove an economic saviour or a breeding ground for the virus \u2013 has never been far from the lips of opposition politicians, commentators, or New Zealanders stuck at home. Both countries have been lauded internationally for their efforts to squash the coronarvirus curve, with a similar number of cases per capita \u2013 Australia\u2019s is very slightly lower, with higher hospitalisation rates. New Zealand\u2019s death toll from the virus is 19 compared with Australia\u2019s 88, but it has a fifth of its neighbour\u2019s population of 25m. Mexico\u2019s Interior Department urged towns and states Tuesday to stop putting up roadblocks and curfews to stem the spread of the new coronavirus, as hundreds have done. The department said in a statement that such measures violate constitutional rights like the right to free movement, and argued that local governments don\u2019t have the authority to enact them, AP reports. The department said in a report that almost 20% percent of Mexican municipal governments, about 340, have put up checkpoints or filters to limit peoples movements. Most were concentrated along the country\u2019s coasts, where many beach towns have tried to exclude travellers who might spread the coronavirus. Dozens of towns have enacted curfews and at least three of the country\u2019s 31 states have threatened to arrest people who don\u2019t obey social distancing measures. The department said the measures involving the use of force are not proportional, they encourage the abuse of authority, and they can have serious effects on supplies of food and medicine. Mexico has about 16,750 confirmed coronavirus cases and 1,569 deaths. Coronavirus could cause \u2018unprecedented\u2019 backlog of court cases in the UK The coronavirus outbreak could lead to court case delays of up to six months and record prisoner numbers once the lockdown has been lifted, according to a leading Whitehall thinktank. Pressure on the criminal justice system from the pandemic combined with an anticipated rise in suspects facing charges could cause an \u201cunprecedented\u201d backlog of court proceedings in England and Wales, the Institute for Government (IfG) said. Working alongside the Chartered Institute for Public Finance and Accountancy (Cipfa), researchers said waiting times to hear cases could increase by more than 70% after a six-month lockdown, with many defendants and victims forced to wait more than half a year for crown court trials. This could result in the highest average waiting time ever recorded, the IfG said. A recap of recent news from Australia: A national mental health program will be rolled out to ensure any gaps in access are closed. Some 800,000 people have had their claims for unemployment benefits processed. So far 2.8 million people have downloaded the Australian government\u2019s Covid-19 tracing app. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has linked the app\u2019s take-up to restrictions being relaxed. New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern received a phone call from the Queen. Scott Morrison has heard from Prince Charles. In China, it\u2019s not clear yet how long parliament\u2019s annual meeting and the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference will last, Reuters reports. The gatherings traditionally see more than 5,000 delegates descend on Beijing from all over China for at least 10 days, but the capital\u2019s local government has imposed stringent quarantine rules for anyone entering the city from elsewhere and policymakers are wary of a possible resurgence. China\u2019s parliament will start its annual meeting on 22 May, the official Xinhua news agency reported on Wednesday, more than two months later than originally planned due to the fallout from the coronavirus outbreak. Conditions for holding the annual meeting of parliament have been met as the coronavirus epidemic situation has improved in the country, Xinhua quoted the top decision-making body of the Chinese parliament as saying. China\u2019s top political consultative body, the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference, has also proposed to start its annual session on 21 May. Podcast: Where is the kit to protect NHS workers? As medics and carers report widespread shortages of protective equipment, the government is facing pressure to explain why it appears the UK went into a pandemic under-resourced. Daniel Boffey and Rob Davies unpick the strategy and its failures: Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, says international travel and mass gatherings will not be resuming \u2018anytime soon\u2019. On lifting restrictions, Scott Morrison says don\u2019t get your hopes up for a return to normal as we knew it. Not until there is a vaccine (and even then, things will continue to be different. We are not going back to what we knew before): Putting the protections in place for a Covid-safe Australia, which means we can get an economic growth occurring again, and move on to what Australians like doing again. It won\u2019t be exactly like it was before. I can\u2019t see international travel occurring anytime soon. Can\u2019t see that. The risks there are obvious. The only exception to that, as I have flagged, is potentially with New Zealand, and we have had some good discussions about that. But outside of that, that is unlikely. The Guardian\u2019s Denis Campbell and Caroline Bannock report: Almost 18,000 more people with cancer in England could die after the coronavirus pandemic led hospitals to suspend treatment and deterred patients from seeking NHS care, research has found. Cancer experts claim that an extra 6,270 people in England who have been newly diagnosed with the disease could die from it over the next 12 months as a direct result of the disruption caused by coronavirus, and the additional toll taking into account all those living with cancer could be 17,915. That is an increase of 20% on the 89,576 deaths among cancer patients recorded annually in England, according to the latest available statistics. US President Donald Trump said Tuesday his administration is considering requiring travelers on certain incoming international flights to undergo temperature and virus checks to help stop the spread of the coronavirus, AP reports. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at doing it on the international flights coming out of areas that are heavily infected,\u201d Trump said at the White House. We will be looking into that in the very near future.\u201d Trump said it has not been determined yet whether the federal government or the airlines would conduct the testing. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a combination of both,\u201d he said. Trump\u2019s comments came during an event showcasing a loan program designed to help small businesses weather the coronavirus pandemic, the Paycheck Protection Program. He said the Small Business Administration has processed more loans in 14 days than it has in the previous 14 years. Fitch said Tuesday it was downgrading Italy\u2019s rating to BBB- due to the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, AFP reports. Italy is the European country most affected by Covid-19 and trails only the United States in the number of deaths. The government has said it expects the country\u2019s economic output to shrink by 8% this year and has launched a host of stimulus measures. \u201cThe downgrade reflects the significant impact of the global Covid-19 pandemic on Italy\u2019s economy and the sovereign\u2019s fiscal position,\u201d the Fitch ratings agency said in a statement. Italy\u2019s finance ministry responded by saying that \u201cthe fundamentals of the Italian economy and public finances are solid.\u201d \u201cThe other rating agencies have adopted a more cautious attitude,\u201d the ministry said in a statement. Here\u2019s the full story on the deadliest known outbreak at a US long-term care facility, which left 68 veterans dead: Lebanese protesters confronted soldiers for a second day Tuesday as anger over a spiraling economic crisis re-energised a months-old anti-government movement despite a coronavirus lockdown, AFP reports. Lebanon has 717 confirmed coronavirus cases, according to Johns Hopkins University figures, and 24 people have died. Tuesday\u2019s confrontations were the latest in a string of anti-government protests fuelled by unprecedented inflation and a plummeting Lebanese pound. The Lebanese pound has lost more than half of its value against the dollar on the black market, hitting record lows of 4,000 pounds to the dollar this week. Economy Minister Raoul Nehme on Tuesday said that prices have risen by 55%, while the government estimates that 45% of the population now lives below the poverty line. In the city of Tripoli, protesters hurled rocks at security forces, who responded with tear gas and rubber bullets. The violence came after a protester died on Tuesday from a bullet wound he had sustained during overnight confrontations between troops and hundreds of demonstrators in Tripoli. Following the funeral of 26-year-old Fawaz al-Samman in the city\u2019s central Al-Nour Square, demonstrators torched and vandalised banks and military vehicles.

Speaking of award-winning camerawork, here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s Andrew Wheeler on what we know about the Oscars making streamed films eligible for the awards (gasp!) : The Academy Awards will for the first time allow films that debuted on a streaming service without a theatrical run to be eligible for nominations, a break with tradition in direct response to the coronavirus pandemic. The Academy announced the new criteria for the Oscars in a statement on Tuesday. The change is not permanent, however, and will only apply to films released this year. The Academy also said it will condense the two sound categories into one, and, in an effort to become more carbon neutral, prohibit DVD screeners for 2022\u2019s 94th Oscars. Previously, a film would have required a minimum seven-day theatrical run in a Los Angeles county commercial theater in order to be considered for the Academy\u2019s highest honor. Now films that had a previously planned theatrical release but are made available through on-demand service may qualify for best picture and other categories. The story of an unlikely self-isolation cooking hero from Australia now, from the author Jenny Valentish: Nat\u2019s What I Reckon: the sweary, ranty YouTuber who\u2019s become an isolation cooking sensation \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Iso-Lords?\u201d he says, introducing his latest clip, The Crowd Goes Mild Curry. \u201cWe\u2019re back in the kitchen, saying no to jar sauce.\u201d Behind a sparkling-clean counter laden with fresh vegetables, spices and herbs stands Nat: black band T-shirt, hair halfway down his torso, arms and neck covered in tattoos. He walks us through the ingredients before getting stuck into the methodology. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got one of these cheeky bastards, use this. It\u2019s called a microplane. I know it sounds like a small aircraft, but it\u2019s just a pretentious name for a fine grater. If you don\u2019t have one of these pratty things you can just use a normal grater, and if you don\u2019t think you\u2019ve got one of these, you\u2019re wrong. You\u2019ve got four of them and they\u2019re buried behind the other three.\u201d Navy sailors who have been quarantined on Guam for weeks will begin moving back to the USS Theodore Roosevelt Tuesday night, US officials said. A coronavirus outbreak sidelined the aircraft carrier in late March, AP reports. Hundreds of sailors are expected to reboard the ship over the next several days, after spending about a month in gyms, hotels and other facilities while the ship was cleaned, officials said. The sailors were expected to begin moving back during the late evening and overnight Eastern time, which would be Wednesday in Guam. Officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss events ahead of the announcement. The ship gained attention when it was forced to dock in Guam because of the virus outbreak. The ship\u2019s commander, Navy Captain Brett Crozier, was fired for sending an email pleading with commanders to take faster action to address the virus. As of Tuesday, 940 sailors have tested positive for the virus, and 29 have recovered. The European Union\u2019s Ambassador for the Pacific, Sujiro Seam, has tweeted a short video of a plane carrying 88 British and European passengers departing Nadi International Airport in Fiji. China has reported zero new deaths as of the end of 28 April. There were 26 new asymptomatic cases, down from 40 the day before, but 21 new imported cases, compared to three a day earlier, and 22 cases in the mainland, compared to six the day before, Reuters reports. The total number of cases stands at 82,858 and 4633 people have died. Trump offers rosy predictions for coronavirus testing as US passes 1m cases Donald Trump has predicted a \u201cgreat\u201d economic rebound in the fall and claimed the country would soon be performing 5m coronavirus diagnostic tests a day, as the number of confirmed cases in the US surpassed a million. Some health experts have suggested that the US would have to carry out 5m tests a day by June to reopen its economy safely. Others have suggested as many as 20m tests a day would ultimately be needed. The US daily rate is currently 200,000. Addressing a news conference on aid to small businesses on Tuesday, Trump appeared unaware of the current figures, suggesting \u201cit could be that we\u2019re getting very close\u201d to 5m daily tests. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be there very soon,\u201d he said. The US has carried out 5.6m tests over the past two months, which as Trump pointed out was far more than any other country, but represented about 1.6% of the population, a higher percentage than most countries, though significantly below Italy. Trump was also bullish on the prospects for economic recovery in the fall. In what looks almost certain to become another hostage to fortune, the president implied that the pandemic would be largely cleared by the fourth quarter of the year. The number of US deaths from the novel coronavirus has surpassed the toll of Americans killed in the Vietnam War, the Johns Hopkins University tracker showed Tuesday. The pandemic has killed 58,365 people in the United States, the Baltimore-based university said. According to the National Archives, 58,220 Americans were killed in combat and from other causes such as accidents during years of war in Southeast Asia. The US death toll and number of cases - in excess of one million - far exceeds that of any other country. Vietnam, a neighbour of China, has recorded 270 cases and no deaths, according to Johns Hopkins. The false belief that toxic methanol cures the coronavirus has seen over 700 people killed in Iran, an official said Monday. That represents a higher death toll than so far released by the Iranian Health Ministry, The Associated Press reports. An adviser to the ministry, Hossein Hassanian, said that the difference in death tallies is because some alcohol poisoning victims died outside of hospital. Some 200 people died outside of hospitals, Hassanian told AP. The national coroner\u2019s authority said that alcohol poisoning killed 728 Iranians between 20 February and 7 April. Last year there were only 66 deaths from alcohol poisoning, according to the report. Separately, the Iranian health ministry spokesman, Kianoush Jahanpour said that 525 people have died from swallowing toxic methanol alcohol since 20 February, state TV reported on Monday. Jahanpour said that a total of 5,011 people had been poisoned from methanol alcohol. He added that some 90 people have lost their eye sight or are suffering eye damage from the alcohol poisoning. Hassanian also said the final tally of people who lost their eye sight could be much higher. Iran is facing the worst coronavirus outbreak in the Middle East with 5,806 deaths and more than 91,000 confirmed case. Nearly 70 residents infected with coronavirus have died at a Massachusetts home for ageing veterans, as state and federal officials try to figure out what went wrong in the deadliest known outbreak at a long-term care facility in the US, AP reports. While the death toll at the state-run Holyoke Soldiers\u2019 Home continues to climb, federal officials are investigating whether residents were denied proper medical care and the state\u2019s top prosecutor is deciding whether to bring legal action. Sixty-eight veteran residents who tested positive for the virus have died, officials said Tuesday, and it\u2019s not known whether another person who died had Covid-19. Another 82 residents and 81 employees have tested positive. The home\u2019s superintendent, who\u2019s been placed on administrative leave, has defended his response and accused state officials of falsely claiming they were unaware of the scope of the problem there. The superintendent, Bennett Walsh, said earlier this month state officials knew that the home was in crisis mode when it came to staffing shortages and were notified early and often about the contagion at the facility. There were nearly 230 residents living at the home in late March and only about 100 remained on Monday, The Boston Globe reported. Three US children infected with the coronavirus are being treated for a rare inflammatory syndrome that appears similar to one that has raised concerns by doctors in Britain, Italy and Spain, Reuters reports. All three children - who range in age from 6 months to 8 years - have undergone treatment at Columbia University Medical Centre in New York, and all had fever and inflammation of the heart and the gut. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re at the very beginning of trying to understand what that represents,\u201d Columbia\u2019s Dr Mark Gorelik told Reuters. Italian and British medical experts are investigating a possible link between the coronavirus pandemic and clusters of Kawasaki disease, a severe inflammatory disease among infants arriving in hospitals with high fevers and swollen arteries.The syndrome has been largely undetected in the United States, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Gorelik said he believes the cases are likely not Kawasaki disease, but a similar process that shares an underlying mechanism with Kawasaki, which is thought to be triggered by an infectious agent that sparks an immune response. Hello and welcome to today\u2019s live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic from around the world. I\u2019m Helen Sullivan and I\u2019ll be with you for the next few hours.

The number of deaths in Brazil has now passed 5,000, more than China\u2019s official toll, with confirmed cases at 71,886. Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro has been notoriously dismissive of the coronavirus pandemic, sparking outrage across the political spectrum and pot-banging protests. Meanwhile, cases in the US have passed 1 million, accounting for roughly a third of the global total, which currently stands at over 3.1 million. Known global death toll exceeds 215,000. According to the Johns Hopkins researchers, at least 3,110,219 people have been infected worldwide and at least 216,808 have died since the outbreak began. The numbers are likely to be significant underestimates due to suspected underreporting and differing testing and recording systems around the world. Brazil\u2019s total number of confirmed deaths has now overtaken the WHO\u2019s figure for China as cases accelerate in Latin America\u2019s biggest country. The number of deaths in Brazil has now passed 5,000. US confirmed coronavirus cases pass one million mark, accounting for a third of cases worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The US death toll is now over 57,000 people. Streamed films to be eligible for Oscars. Films released on streaming platforms only will be eligible for Academy Awards next year because of the pandemic\u2019s disruption to the industry, the organisers of the Oscars have said. The head of Germany\u2019s Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases called on people to stay at home as much as possible as new figures show the country\u2019s infection rate has increased. Vladimir Putin extended a non-working period in Russia until 11 May, as he warned the rate of infection in the country has not yet peaked. The Russian president made the announcement during a meeting with senior officials and regional heads. France began outlining the schedule for the end of the lockdown. The prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe said: \u201cWho could have envisaged a France where schools, universities, cafes, restaurants, the majority of businesses, libraries \u2026 beaches, stadiums \u2026 would be closed?\u201d The number of confirmed cases in Saudia Arabia passed 20,000 as its health authorities reported 1,266 new infections. The kingdom reported eight deaths, bringing its total death toll to 152. The UK said it would begin including deaths in care homes in its daily reports, as official figures show they account for almost a quarter of the total death toll in England and Wales, with yet more occurring in private homes, hospices or elsewhere. Britain also expanded the list of those eligible for coronavirus tests to asymptomatic NHS and care staff, over-65s and those who travel to work will now qualify.",

      "bodyText": "NHS staff from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds will be given different roles away from the frontline under plans to reduce their disproportionately high death rate from Covid-19. BAME personnel should be \u201crisk-assessed\u201d and reassigned to duties that leave them at lesser risk of contracting coronavirus, under guidance set out by NHS bosses in England. The move was unveiled in a letter sent on Wednesday to hospital trusts, providers of mental health care, ambulance services and organisations providing community-based healthcare. It makes clear that the new guidance was prompted by growing evidence that people of BAME origin are more at risk from Covid-19, and by the need to save lives. The nine-page letter, from NHS improvement\u2019s chief operating officer, Amanda Pritchard, was sent to those running NHS care organisations across England. It said: \u201cEmerging UK and international data suggest that people from black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds are also being disproportionately affected by Covid-19.\u201d It references the fact that the Department of Health and Social Care has already asked Public Health England to investigate and report back on the unusually high number of BAME people, including workers in the NHS, who are falling ill and dying from the disease It then tells local NHS leaders: \u201cIn advance of their report and guidance, on a precautionary basis we recommend employers should risk-assess staff at potentially greater risk and make appropriate arrangements accordingly.\u201d It does not outline what specific measures they should take to protect the safety of their BAME staff, but it is understood that the new drive to reduce the BAME death toll would allow such personnel to be redeployed to areas or services where they would have less chance of becoming infected.
