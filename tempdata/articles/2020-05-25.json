      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for now. Thanks as always for following along and be sure to check out the match report here. Mickelson splits the fairway with a gorgeous drive off the Tiger tees on the 433-yard 18th hole while Brady sends his tee shot somewhere toward Alabama. Manning doesn\u2019t do much better with his offering while Woods, who\u2019s been so in-form all day long, crushes his drive into the fairway. The quarterbacks pick up the pros\u2019 the second shots. The rain has subsided but the wind has not and visibility is poor. Brady steps up and sends his approach shot about six yards short of the green while Manning calmly deposits his attempt on to the surface. Advantage: Woods/Manning. Mickelson chips to within a couple feet from the cup, giving Woods and Manning two chances for the whole enchilada. Woods is first and his putt comes within inches. Mickelson and Brady graciously concede and that\u2019s the match! 1UP Woods/Manning v Mickelson/Brady (17) Tiger and Phil find the green to set up birdie putts for Manning and Brady. A big moment. Peyton\u2019s up first and his attempt drifts right of the pin. That gives Brady a putt to make it all square going to 18. And he pushes it. Poor! They\u2019ll head to the final hole with Tiger and Peyton nursing a slim advantage. 1UP Woods/Manning v Mickelson/Brady (16) Mickelson makes yet another positively clutch putt on the 16th to halve a hole and keep his team within touching distance as the rain continues and darkness encroaches. 1UP Woods/Manning v Mickelson/Brady (15) Mickelson saves par with a heart-stopping putt to halve the hole and keep things interesting. Three holes to win one. 1UP Woods/Manning v Mickelson/Brady (14) Oof! Manning misses a gimme (after Brady misses a short one of his own) and the Mickelson/Brady team are only one down after wins on the 11th and 14th. The comeback is on! Sundown is 8.06pm and Phil seems aware of the time crunch as he hops into his cart: \u201cIt\u2019s 7:30, we have to hurry.\u201d 2UP Woods/Manning v Mickelson/Brady (13) Amid a torrential downpour, Manning misses a 10-foot putt for par and leaves the door open for Mickelson from eight feet. But the five-time major champion misses and the bogey results in another halved hole. 2UP Woods/Manning v Mickelson/Brady (12) Brady rims out a birdie putt that would have narrowed it to 1UP and the skies have opened up once again over Medalist Golf Club. \u201cWhen\u2019s the heavy stuff supposed to come down?\u201d Brady asks. 2UP Woods/Manning v Mickelson/Brady (11) Brady rolls in a long-distance putt for eagle (set up by a gorgeous bomb off the tee by Phil), his second good shot of the day, then punctuates it with a socially distanced high-five. It\u2019s the first hole the Mickelson/Brady team have won today. 3UP Woods/Manning v Mickelson/Brady (10) Another hole is halved after Woods misses a birdie putt from the fringe. Eight holes to go and Mickelson and Brady have quite a bit of work to do. 3UP Woods/Manning v Mickelson/Brady (9) Tiger and Phil get up and down for pars to halve the par-four 9th and the Woods/Manning outfit are 3UP making the turn. We now switch to a modified alternate shot format for the back nine. All four players will tee off with each team picking their preferred shot and alternating from there. 3UP Woods/Manning v Mickelson/Brady (8) Brady changes his pants ahead of the par-three 8th after splitting his first pair in all of the excitement on the 7th. Manning, who is owed a stroke per his handicap, misses a birdie chance before tapping in for 3-for-2. Mickelson then faces a high-stress birdie putt to keep within touching distance ... and he drains it to halve the hole. 3UP Woods/Manning v Mickelson/Brady (7) Tom Brady spent two hours looking like it was his first time holding a golf cluh. As he endures yet another playful ribbing from Barkley in the commentary booth, the six-time Super Bowl champion manages to hole out from 100 yards away on the fairway. \u201cShut your mouth, Chuck,\u201d he says. Alas, Woods quietly lips out for eagle and the hole is halved. 3UP Woods/Manning v Mickelson/Brady (6) Woods and Manning are 3UP after six holes with Manning responsible for two of the winners after he gets it close off the tee and calmly sinks the short birdie putt. In related news: there is no way in hell Tom Brady is an eight handicap. 2UP Woods/Manning v Mickelson/Brady (5) Futures in TB12 immunity blend supplements are bottoming right now after Brady sends his tee shot off the par-four 5th into the pond. For the pros, this is a one-hole challenge meaning they must play the entire hole with the same club. Mickelson settles for bogey with 4-iron after a poor tee shot, opening the door for his opponents. Woods, using a 6-iron, has a par putt for 3UP but it rims out. 2UP Woods/Manning v Mickelson/Brady (4) It\u2019s Peyton who drains a 30-foot birdie putt the par-three 4th and the Woods/Manning outfit goes 2UP. Earlier, Barkley turned the screw on the struggling Brady, offering $50,000 to charity if the Tampa Bay Bucs quarterback can hit the green. Brady does not hit the green. Says Barkley: \u201cI should\u2019ve just said if you can keep it on the planet.\u201d 1UP Woods/Manning v Mickelson/Brady (3) We\u2019re off to the par-five 3rd where Manning and Brady, both presumably thankful for the best-ball format after a pair of abysmal tee shots, will each get a stroke per their handicaps. This hole comes with a long-drive challenge for charity, which Woods wins after Mickelson slices into to the trees. Unsurprisingly, it again comes down to Tiger and Phil and it\u2019s Woods who birdies to get his team on the board. Woods/Manning A/S Mickelson/Brady (2) The rain has picked back up again and it\u2019s miserable out there. Peyton zooms up the fairway after smashing a perfect drive and second shot, explaining to match commentator Charles Barkley that he\u2019s not in red and black because he didn\u2019t want to wear University of Georgia colors and wind up on their social media feed. Brady, meanwhile, is having a bad time, sending his tee shot into a bunker and his second into the hazard before taking a drop. Mickelson gives a short oral dissertation explaining his chip shot before hitting it stone cold, an early highlight. He\u2019s in with a four to bail out a deflated-looking Brady, then Manning has a long birdie put to win the hole but shorts it to the left. Now Woods has a long birdie putt for the win but shorts it as well. Mickelson concedes and they halve the second. Woods/Manning A/S Mickelson/Brady (1) The skies have mostly cleared and they\u2019re going to give it a go after a 50-minute delay. Remember: the first nine holes are a fourball format with Brady and Manning each getting a one stroke on the three most difficult holes \u2013 No 3, No 6 and No 8 \u2013 in accordance with their handicaps. Whoever of the four scores the lowest wins the hole for their team. Tiger is introduced by Samuel L Jackson and smashes a 3-wood down the middle of the fairway, while while Mickelson, Brady and Manning follow with lesser tee shots. Mickelson recovers, however, and a mostly uneventful first hole is halved after Tiger and Phil grind over four-footers to make par while Brady struggles to get his microphone working. The bantz is already in full swing. \u201cThat was a little shaky, for me,\u201d Mickelson says. \u201cNow let\u2019s go freakin\u2019 play.\u201d Today\u2019s match has been delayed until at least 3.45pm ET/8.45pm BST due to the inclement weather. It\u2019s absolutely pouring out there. Play on I says; a little rain never hurt anyone. Otherwise the current forecast doesn\u2019t look overly promising for live golf today. \u2018Member sports? Well between the Bundesliga, something called Fight Island and today\u2019s made-for-TV golf exhibition pitting Tiger Woods and Peyton Manning against Phil Mickelson and Tom Brady, they\u2019re all but back to normal. It\u2019s called The Match, not to be confused with the $9m winner-take-all showdown between Tiger and Phil over Thanksgiving weekend in 2018, which also was called The Match, which come to think of it is about as creative a title as Fight Island. Anyhow, the purpose today is to raise $10m or more for Covid-19 relief efforts, which is something everybody can get behind. The venue is Medalist Golf Club in Hobe Sound, Florida \u2013 which is Woods\u2019 home course \u2013 and they\u2019re due to tee off in about 20 minutes. That\u2019s if the weather complies, as a flood warning is in effect until quarter after the hour. Bryan will be here shortly, with the match due to start at 3pm ET/8pm BST. In the meantime, here\u2019s a few details on today\u2019s round from the Associated Press: It\u2019s the second edition of a match between Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson, the dominant players of their generation and rivals by name, but not necessarily by record. Woods has 82 career victories to 44 for Mickelson, leads 15-5 in major championships and 11-0 in winning PGA Tour player of the year. Mickelson won their first made-for-TV match over Thanksgiving weekend in 2018, a pay-per-view event that ran into technical problems and was free for all.

Woods, however, captured the streak that mattered, holding off Mickelson in the final group at the Masters in 2001 to hold all four professional majors at the same time. The banter was lacking in Las Vegas, and perhaps having NFL stars Peyton Manning and Tom Brady will change the dynamics. The broadcast includes Charles Barkley providing commentary and Justin Thomas, whom Woods has embraced, on the course as a reporter in his television debut. After this exhibition, golf has two weeks before the PGA Tour is set to return at Colonial in Fort Worth, Texas. Mickelson plans to play. Woods has not said when he will return.",

You know, it could be false accusations. I know all about false accusations. I\u2019ve been falsely charged numerous times. And there is such a thing.\u201d</p> <p>Then, speaking on Fox News\u2019s Fox &amp; Friends, usually a comfort zone, he again declined to go for Biden\u2019s jugular. \u201cLook, he\u2019s got to fight that battle,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had battles, too, where I\u2019ve had false accusations, many times. I\u2019ve had many false accusations made, I can tell you that. Many. And maybe it is a false accusation. Frankly, I hope it is, for his sake.\u201d</p> <p>The first and most obvious explanation for the president\u2019s reticence is that he himself has been accused of assault and unwanted touching <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/assault-allegations-donald-trump-recapped\">by a long list of women,</a> some far more recently than Reade\u2019s account. He also denies the allegations. On the other hand, Trump has never allowed perceived double standards to get in the way of his scorched earth tactics in the past.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/09/donald-trump-women-bill-clinton-sex-scandal-hillary-debate\">Monika McDermott,</a> a political science professor at Fordham University in New York, said: \u201cIt\u2019s surprising in a way because usually Trump doesn\u2019t pull back on things even when they do seem hypocritical or ironic or choose your adjective. Yet he is in this particular instance. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s waiting for something to happen or whether he\u2019s waiting to see how it plays out before he does anything. He seems to be finding what seem to him more fruitful attack routes against Obama and other things and people than against Biden right now.\u201d</p> <p>In 2016 Trump\u2019s campaign was rocked by the release of an Access Hollywood tape in which he could heard bragging about using his fame to grab women\u2019s private parts. Instead of quitting, he went on the offensive against his rival Hillary Clinton by highlighting sexual assault allegations against her husband, former president Bill Clinton, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/09/donald-trump-women-bill-clinton-sex-scandal-hillary-debate\">even inviting those accusers</a> to a press conference before a presidential debate.</p> <p>But this November will witness the first presidential election since the rise of the #<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\">MeToo movement, </a>which has encouraged women to come forward with allegations of sexual assault against prominent men in politics, show business and other industries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a08419f25771c1d33a7c3923efc31d0d7706410c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a08419f25771c1d33a7c3923efc31d0d7706410c/0_83_4252_2551/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A screen grab of Joe Biden and Dr Jill Biden hosting a family town hall on the Covid-19 pandemic from their home in Wilmington, Delaware, last month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A screen grab of Joe Biden and Dr Jill Biden hosting a family town hall on the Covid-19 pandemic from their home in Wilmington, Delaware, last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Cahn/Zuma Wire/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Biden has committed to picking a woman as his running mate and frequently cites his work as lead sponsor of the Violence Against Women Act. Both candidates are keenly aware that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/15/democrats-2020-election-suburbs-battle\">suburban women</a> could be a pivotal demographic in the final vote.</p> <p>While Trump remains taciturn, Republicans have instead focused much of their response on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/brett-kavanaugh\">Brett Kavanaugh,</a> the supreme court justice whose nomination was nearly derailed by sexual misconduct allegations. The Trump campaign pointed to statements made by Democrats during the Kavanaugh episode to portray them as hypocritical.</p> <p>Erin Perrine, principal deputy communications director at the Trump campaign, <a href=\"https://donaldtrumpcampaign.cmail19.com/t/ViewEmail/r/557A83AF845DEDEA2540EF23F30FEDED/078D62617DE962F44FB5D4CAE8F50064\">said:</a> \u201cDuring Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s hearings, Biden made clear that all women should be believed when they come forward with allegations of sexual assault. Biden\u2019s own work during the Obama administration lowered standards for such accusations on college campuses as to effectively institute a presumption of guilt. In a dramatic shift, Biden now says \u2018believe women\u2019 doesn\u2019t actually mean \u2018believe women.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Trump himself, however, has preferred to take aim at other targets, seeking to implicate Biden in a so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/12/what-is-obamagate-and-why-is-trump-so-worked-up-about-it\">\u201cObamagate\u201d conspiracy</a> that many seen as an attempt to deflect attention from the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 likely to prove a more significant issue in November.</p> <p>Amid Democratic alarm that the Reade allegation could dent Biden\u2019s support among women, the former vice-president vehemently denied it in an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/01/joe-biden-denies-sexual-assault-allegation-tara-reade-statement\">interview on the MSNBC network</a> on 1 May and repeated that position in a series of media appearances.</p> <p>The story has faded from prominence in recent days, especially after <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-74-former-biden-staffers-think-about-tara-reades-allegations\">the PBS NewsHour interviewed</a> 74 former Biden staffers, of whom 62 were women, and found none said that they had experienced sexual harassment, assault or misconduct by Biden, nor ever heard rumors or allegations to that effect.</p> <p> By pushing the case, Trump may have more to lose than to gain. <a href=\"https://www.mullings.com/\">Rich Galen,</a> a former Republican strategist, said: \u201cThe case against Biden keeps getting thinner and thinner so I\u2019m not sure that there\u2019s much there. And all the people who\u2019s accused Trump, it would be like listing the names of the people who died in Vietnam every night.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelSteele?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Michael Steele,</a> former chairman of the Republican National Committee, added: \u201cTrump, if nothing else, knows how to read his audience: \u2018No, they\u2019re not going to buy anything I sell on this point.\u2019 There\u2019s no need to even open that Pandora\u2019s box because it\u2019s a Pandora\u2019s box for him, not Joe Biden. I think that\u2019s why the president has largely decided not to engage at that level.</p> <p>\u201cMy sense is right now, despite what others in the campaign may want to do, there is no energy from the president himself to open up that door and go through it.\u201d</p>",

You know, it could be false accusations. I know all about false accusations. I\u2019ve been falsely charged numerous times. And there is such a thing.\u201d Then, speaking on Fox News\u2019s Fox &amp; Friends, usually a comfort zone, he again declined to go for Biden\u2019s jugular. \u201cLook, he\u2019s got to fight that battle,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had battles, too, where I\u2019ve had false accusations, many times. I\u2019ve had many false accusations made, I can tell you that. Many. And maybe it is a false accusation. Frankly, I hope it is, for his sake.\u201d The first and most obvious explanation for the president\u2019s reticence is that he himself has been accused of assault and unwanted touching by a long list of women, some far more recently than Reade\u2019s account. He also denies the allegations. On the other hand, Trump has never allowed perceived double standards to get in the way of his scorched earth tactics in the past. Monika McDermott, a political science professor at Fordham University in New York, said: \u201cIt\u2019s surprising in a way because usually Trump doesn\u2019t pull back on things even when they do seem hypocritical or ironic or choose your adjective. Yet he is in this particular instance. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s waiting for something to happen or whether he\u2019s waiting to see how it plays out before he does anything. He seems to be finding what seem to him more fruitful attack routes against Obama and other things and people than against Biden right now.\u201d In 2016 Trump\u2019s campaign was rocked by the release of an Access Hollywood tape in which he could heard bragging about using his fame to grab women\u2019s private parts. Instead of quitting, he went on the offensive against his rival Hillary Clinton by highlighting sexual assault allegations against her husband, former president Bill Clinton, and even inviting those accusers to a press conference before a presidential debate. But this November will witness the first presidential election since the rise of the #MeToo movement, which has encouraged women to come forward with allegations of sexual assault against prominent men in politics, show business and other industries. Biden has committed to picking a woman as his running mate and frequently cites his work as lead sponsor of the Violence Against Women Act. Both candidates are keenly aware that suburban women could be a pivotal demographic in the final vote. While Trump remains taciturn, Republicans have instead focused much of their response on Brett Kavanaugh, the supreme court justice whose nomination was nearly derailed by sexual misconduct allegations. The Trump campaign pointed to statements made by Democrats during the Kavanaugh episode to portray them as hypocritical. Erin Perrine, principal deputy communications director at the Trump campaign, said: \u201cDuring Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s hearings, Biden made clear that all women should be believed when they come forward with allegations of sexual assault. Biden\u2019s own work during the Obama administration lowered standards for such accusations on college campuses as to effectively institute a presumption of guilt. In a dramatic shift, Biden now says \u2018believe women\u2019 doesn\u2019t actually mean \u2018believe women.\u2019\u201d Trump himself, however, has preferred to take aim at other targets, seeking to implicate Biden in a so-called \u201cObamagate\u201d conspiracy that many seen as an attempt to deflect attention from the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 likely to prove a more significant issue in November. Amid Democratic alarm that the Reade allegation could dent Biden\u2019s support among women, the former vice-president vehemently denied it in an interview on the MSNBC network on 1 May and repeated that position in a series of media appearances. The story has faded from prominence in recent days, especially after the PBS NewsHour interviewed 74 former Biden staffers, of whom 62 were women, and found none said that they had experienced sexual harassment, assault or misconduct by Biden, nor ever heard rumors or allegations to that effect. By pushing the case, Trump may have more to lose than to gain. Rich Galen, a former Republican strategist, said: \u201cThe case against Biden keeps getting thinner and thinner so I\u2019m not sure that there\u2019s much there. And all the people who\u2019s accused Trump, it would be like listing the names of the people who died in Vietnam every night.\u201d Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, added: \u201cTrump, if nothing else, knows how to read his audience: \u2018No, they\u2019re not going to buy anything I sell on this point.\u2019 There\u2019s no need to even open that Pandora\u2019s box because it\u2019s a Pandora\u2019s box for him, not Joe Biden. I think that\u2019s why the president has largely decided not to engage at that level. \u201cMy sense is right now, despite what others in the campaign may want to do, there is no energy from the president himself to open up that door and go through it.\u201d",

It is not possible to verify their accounts: there is a virtual ban on foreign media in Rakhine state, local journalists face harassment, and the internet has been blocked in some areas for almost a year, hampering the documentation of abuses. However, satellite imagery provided by Planet Labs Inc and analysed by Human Rights Watch confirms about 140 buildings were affected by fire in Tin Ma, probably on the dates described. Further analysis confirms about 180 buildings were affected by fire in another village, Pyaing Taing, also in Kyauktaw township, also likely in March. The Guardian is aware of 19 other reports where civilian homes in Rakhine and Chin states were apparently damaged by fighter jets or artillery or burned since January. Responding to allegations relating to Tin Ma, Brig Gen Zaw Min Tun said he was aware homes had been burned but did not comment on who was responsible. The military has previously denied the reports, and said in April that security forces inspected Tin Ma and found it to be intact. Zaw Min Tun said some allegations against the military were being made by \u201cso-called villagers who are members of Arakan army\u201d.

The Arakan army has also been accused of abuses, including kidnapping local officials. Tha Lun Zaung Htet, the editor-in-chief of the Khit Thit news agency is among several senior journalists forced into hiding. His home was raided at night on 31 March. \u201cMy son, a three-year-old boy, cried all the time when he saw a group of people with hardest faces at midnight. My son was so frightened,\u201d he said, speaking through an intermediary for security reasons. \u201cThey watch my home and follow my wife all the time.\u201d He added that despite the threats, he would continue his journalism. A UK government-funded analysis seen by the Guardian predicts an expansion of the conflict \u201cin intensity and geographic scope\u201d that would produce long-term food insecurity. Displacement and \u201cabuses of all civilians\u201d would also increase. The Myanmar government was not reachable for comment, but a spokesman has previously rejected recent allegations of war crimes. He accused outgoing UN envoy Lee of bias, and blamed rebels for violence. Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar\u2019s civilian leader, has not commented on the claims but, in a statement in April, paid tribute to members of the military who she said had \u201cdischarged their duties with courage and dedication, and sacrificed their lives\u201d to defend civilians from the Arakan army. She accused the group of \u201cdestructive activities\u201d and said casualties and their families would be given support. Myanmar has seemed immune to international pressure over its treatment of the Rohingya; despite pledges to improve conditions, the group\u2019s experiences are virtually unchanged. The Rohingya are still subject to vast restrictions on their basic rights. People from Tin Ma want the atrocities inflicted on their village to also be placed under the global spotlight. They urged the international community to visit and witness what was happening. They are now exiled to makeshift camps in Kyauktaw town, sleeping on the floors of schools and monasteries. It is stiflingly hot, cramped and noisy. With no internet, there are few ways to access information about coronavirus. \u201cWe have been driven out of the world,\u201d said Moe Naing*. * Names have been changed",

      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s largest pharmaceutical companies rejected an EU proposal three years ago to work on fast-tracking vaccines for pathogens like coronavirus to allow them to be developed before an outbreak, the Guardian can reveal. The plan to speed up the development and approval of vaccines was put forward by European commission representatives sitting on the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) \u2013 a public-private partnership whose function is to back cutting-edge research in Europe \u2013 but it was rejected by industry partners on the body. The commission\u2019s argument had been that the research could \u201cfacilitate the development and regulatory approval of vaccines against priority pathogens, to the extent possible before an actual outbreak occurs\u201d. The pharmaceutical companies on the IMI, however, did not take up the idea. The revelation is contained in a report published by the Corporate Observatory Europe (COE), a Brussels-based research centre, examining decisions made by the IMI, which has a budget of \u20ac5bn (\u00a34.5bn), made up of EU funding and in-kind contributions from private and other bodies. The IMI\u2019s governing board is made up of commission officials and representatives of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries (EFPIA), whose members include some of the biggest names in the sector, among them GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, Pfizer, Lilly and Johnson &amp; Johnson. A global lack of preparedness for the coronavirus pandemic has already led to accusations in recent weeks that the pharmaceutical industry has failed to prioritise treatments for infectious diseases because they are less profitable than chronic medical conditions. The world\u2019s 20 largest pharmaceutical companies undertook around 400 new research projects in the past year, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Around half were focused on treating cancer, compared with 65 on infectious diseases. There are eight potential vaccines for coronavirus in clinical trials, but there is no guarantee of success. One of the most promising, being developed at Oxford University, is said to have only a 50% chance of being approved for use. The COE report says that rather than \u201ccompensating for market failures\u201d by speeding up the development of innovative medicines, as per its remit, the IMI has been \u201cmore about business-as-usual market priorities\u201d. The report\u2019s authors cite a comment posted on the EFPIA\u2019s website, since removed, selling the advantages of the initiative to big pharma as offering \u201ctremendous cost savings, as the IMI projects replicate work that individual companies would have had to do anyway\u201d. The European commission\u2019s \u201cbiopreparedness\u201d funding proposal in 2017 would have involved refining computer simulations, known as in silico modelling, and improved analysis of animal testing models to give regulators greater confidence in approving vaccines. Minutes of a meeting of the IMI\u2019s governing board from December 2018 reveal that the proposal was not accepted. The IMI also decided against funding projects with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, a foundation seeking to tackle so-called blueprint priority diseases such as Mers and Sars, both of them coronaviruses. \u201cWhile the scope of a regulatory topic as proposed by the commission was not supported by EFPIA industries, the theme of regulatory modernisation is considered very important by industries, and will be further discussed,\u201d the minutes record. \u201cInteraction with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) continues but no immediate co-investment is expected.\u201d In response to the report, a spokeswoman for the IMI said infectious diseases and vaccines had been a priority from the outset. She highlighted a \u20ac20m project known as Zapi launched in 2015 following the Ebola pandemic and which focuses on biopreparedness. The IMI launched funding for \u201cinnovations to accelerate vaccine development and manufacture\u201d in January. The spokeswoman said the topic had been competing with other priorities at the time of the 2017 proposal, including research into tuberculosis, auto-immune diseases and digital health. \u201cThe report seems to suggest the IMI has failed in its mission to protect the European citizen by letting pass an opportunity to prepare society for the current Covid pandemic,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is misleading in two ways: the research proposed by the EC in the biopreparedness topic was small in scope, and focused on revisiting animal models and developing in silico models to better define/anticipate the type and level of immune response elicited in animals and humans in order to increase regulators\u2019 confidence in the evidence base for alternative licensing procedures. \u201cIMI\u2019s projects have contributed, directly or indirectly, to better prepare the research community for the current crisis, eg the Ebola+ programme or the Zapi project.\u201d The COE report says the directing influence of big pharma on the IMI\u2019s research agenda has led it to becoming dominated by industry priorities, and sidelining poverty-related and neglected diseases, including coronaviruses. The thinktank points to official evaluations that found the IMI had enabled competing global companies to work together with small and medium-sized businesses and academia, but that it was difficult to identify positive socioeconomic outcomes. The most recent evaluation in 2017 questioned whether the European pharmaceutical industry should continue to be the \u201cmain driver\u201d on the future of medicine. The COE also says that as a result of the industry\u2019s domination of the IMI, there are significant gaps in funding for diseases pinpointed by the World Health Organization (WHO) Report on Priority Medicines for Europe and the World as of public health importance, for which pharmaceutical treatments either do not exist or are inadequate. Seven of the 25 priority areas the WHO identified have no IMI projects, including neonatal conditions and postpartum haemorrhage, according to the report. Seventeen IMI projects relate to Alzheimer\u2019s disease, 12 to diabetes and 10 to cancer. As important as these diseases are, there is no lack of wider interest in providing treatments, leading the report to question whether EU money has been appropriately spent. \u201cClearly, these disease areas are not suffering from a market failure, as the global pharmaceutical industry is investing heavily in them already, which is not surprising, given the large market potential for new treatments,\u201d the CEO writes. An IMI spokeswoman said that about a third of the IMI budget was spent on infectious diseases, including antimicrobial resistance, vaccines, Ebola and tuberculosis, and that other funds went on cross-cutting issues in drug development.",

Here, we\u2019ve brought together all the figures in one place, along with comparisons with other countries. Guardian Australia has gone through every state and territory press release to construct and maintain an up-to-date database of coronavirus cases, as well as maintaining live data feeds from other groups collating data, such as Johns Hopkins University. This is necessary to get a broader picture of how Covid-19 is affecting Australians and to track the impact of government measures. National view This chart shows the \u201cepidemic curve\u201d for Australia with a timeline of measures introduced by the federal government. It aims to track our progress in \u201cflattening the curve\u201d, and the measures we have introduced to do so. According to experts, the growth in new coronavirus cases in Australia is slowing, likely due to the decrease in travel-related cases. However there is still a long way to go in controlling the spread of Covid-19, and particular attention needs to be paid to the rate of community transmission. The following chart shows the percent growth in cases, with a trend line based on a five-day average. Generally, we want both lines to be heading downwards towards zero: Here, you can see the cumulative total of confirmed cases, with the contribution of each state and territory: State and territory breakdowns Here is the daily count of confirmed cases \u2013 the epidemic curve \u2013 for each state and territory. The most recent day will usually be an incomplete total: This table has the number of deaths for each state and territory, as well as the number of patients requiring hospital treatment. It also includes the number of patients currently in intensive care, or requiring ventilators. Source of infections This chart shows the daily new case count by the source of infection to compare overseas v local cases. It\u2019s important to also note that a large number of cases are under investigation at any point in time, and so these figures can change retrospectively with further updates. Maps of confirmed cases in four states Only four states are currently reporting cases by location \u2013 NSW, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia. Here\u2019s the geographic distribution of cases within New South Wales. The map shows the outbreak is concentrated in metropolitan Sydney, in areas with dense populations and large numbers of overseas travellers. And here\u2019s the map showing location of cases in Victoria. Again, most cases are clustered around the cities: And here\u2019s the map for Queensland, mapped by hospital and health service regions: The Western Australian health department has recently started releasing location data, now allowing us to map WA cases: Testing rates Here, you can see the testing rate per million people for each state and territory: You can see an earlier rough comparison of these rates with other countries here. International comparisons This chart uses a log scale and re-indexes the time to the first day since cases were above 50 to make the trajectory of the pandemic in selected countries directly comparable: This chart uses a similar view to compare the trend in deaths for the same countries: Updates 29 April 2020: Added chart showing source of infection for new daily cases About the data This database is available for reuse under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Australia (CC BY 3.0 AU) licence, which means it is OK to re-use, but please provide attribution and a link to Guardian Australia. The data is available in Google sheets here or as a JSON feed here. We assign cases to the date on which they were reported by the given health department, and deaths are assigned to the date they occurred. Extended data on testing and demographics varies between each state and territory so may not always be available. Please contact nick.evershed@theguardian.com if you spot an error in the data or to make a suggestion. Due to the nature of collating data daily under time pressure and differences in how data is collected, we recommend cross-checking with other data sources where possible. It is quite likely these figures will vary from other figures due to differences in data collection methods. Here are a few other websites doing similar work: covid19data ABC News coronavirus data Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 cases Our World in Data Due to the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the coronavirus outbreak, this article is being regularly updated to ensure that it reflects the current situation at the date of publication.

The death toll stands at 345,060. Both figures are likely to be higher, due to differing test rates, definitions and deliberate underreporting.</p> <h2><strong>US bars travellers who have been in Brazil in last two weeks</strong></h2> <p>The White House has announced it is prohibiting foreigners from traveling to the US if they had been in Brazil in the last two weeks, two days after the South American nation became the world\u2019s second-worst affected country in terms of coronavirus cases.

The gates of the capital\u2019s parks will also be reopened, and major museums will be able to receive a limited number of visitors.</p> <h2><strong>Australian children return to school</strong></h2> <p>Australia\u2019s most populous state, New South Wales, on Monday deployed hundreds of crowd control staff to enforce social distancing on public transport amid an expected commuter surge as schools and offices reopened and coronavirus cases fell. Australia has reported just over 7,100 Covid-19 infections, including 102 deaths, well below figures reported by other developed countries.</p> <h2>Chile\u2019s healthcare system \u2018very close to the limit\u2019</h2> <p>Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said on Sunday that the country\u2019s healthcare system is under strain and \u201cvery close to the limit\u201d, as the number of confirmed novel coronavirus infections approached 70,000, after a rapid increase in recent days.

      "bodyText": "Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: Global cases pass 5.4m There are currently 5,407,701 confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The death toll stands at 345,060. Both figures are likely to be higher, due to differing test rates, definitions and deliberate underreporting. US bars travellers who have been in Brazil in last two weeks The White House has announced it is prohibiting foreigners from traveling to the US if they had been in Brazil in the last two weeks, two days after the South American nation became the world\u2019s second-worst affected country in terms of coronavirus cases. Brazil meanwhile registered 15,813 new cases and 653 new deaths in 24 hours, taking the total number of fatalities to 22,666, and cases to 363,211 confirmed cases, the Health Ministry said. White House official likens China\u2019s handling of coronavirus to Chernobyl cover-up A top White House official on Sunday likened China\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak to the Soviet Union\u2019s cover-up of the meltdown at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in 1986. Robert O\u2019Brien, Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser, accused China of a cover-up that will \u201cgo down in history along with Chernobyl\u201d, ramping up efforts to deflect attention from a Covid-19 death toll in the US fast closing on 100,000. China says virus pushing US ties to brink of \u2018Cold War\u2019 Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Sunday that Washington seemed infected by a \u201cpolitical virus\u201d but that Beijing would nevertheless be open to an international effort to find the coronavirus source.\u201cSome political forces in the US are taking China-US relations hostage and pushing our two countries to the brink of a new Cold War,\u201d Wang said. Dominic Cummings reported to police over lockdown breach Boris Johnson\u2019s chief advisor is facing a possible police investigation under health laws over a claim that he breached self-isolation rules in north-east England, after a weekend of mounting pressure on the prime minister to sack his chief adviser. Boris Johnson described Cummings as acting \u201cresponsibly, legally and with integrity\u201d. First Spanish beaches to reopen as lockdown eases Coronavirus lockdown measures will finally be eased for people in Madrid and Barcelona from Monday, while elsewhere in Spain the first beaches are due to reopen, AFP reports. Residents in the two cities can now meet in groups of up to 10 people in their homes or on the terraces of bars and restaurants. The gates of the capital\u2019s parks will also be reopened, and major museums will be able to receive a limited number of visitors. Australian children return to school Australia\u2019s most populous state, New South Wales, on Monday deployed hundreds of crowd control staff to enforce social distancing on public transport amid an expected commuter surge as schools and offices reopened and coronavirus cases fell. Australia has reported just over 7,100 Covid-19 infections, including 102 deaths, well below figures reported by other developed countries. Chile\u2019s healthcare system \u2018very close to the limit\u2019 Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said on Sunday that the country\u2019s healthcare system is under strain and \u201cvery close to the limit\u201d, as the number of confirmed novel coronavirus infections approached 70,000, after a rapid increase in recent days. The Ministry of Health reported 3,709 new cases in the last day, bringing the total to 69,102. The death toll is at 718. India resumes domestic flights despite record spike in new cases Domestic flights will resume across India on Monday, the federal civil aviation minister has said, despite a 24-hour record increase in new cases on Sunday. The announcement follows a day of \u201chard negotiations\u201d, the minister said, after some states sought to limit the number of flights. South Africa announces further easing of lockdown South Africa will further relax coronavirus lockdown restrictions from 1 June, President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced, allowing large areas of the economy to fully reopen. \u201cCabinet has determined that the alert level for the whole country should be lowered from level four to level three,\u201d he said in an address broadcast on television, describing the move as a significant shift in approach to the pandemic.",

Boris Johnson will face renewed pressure today to sack Dominic Cummings despite his attempts to defend his aide, who has been widely condemned for driving 260 miles to his parents\u2019 home in March in an apparent breach of lockdown rules. The prime minister tried to quell the mounting storm triggered by the Guardian\u2019s story on Saturday by saying yesterday that Cummings had acted with \u201cintegrity\u201d. But with government scientific advisers expressing dismay at the aide\u2019s flouting of the rules and nine Tory MPs calling for Cummings\u2019s head, Johnson has not silenced the critics. A post on the official civil service Twitter account appearing to take aim at Johnson and Cummings, who has made many enemies in Whitehall with his combative style, was deleted after being widely shared on Sunday. Find out what the papers have to say here, including our columnist Martin Kettle, who savages Johnson\u2019s response, calling it a \u201cself-centred, self-indulgent signal to the public that the rules no longer really matter\u201d. At an unscheduled press conference appearance on Sunday, Johnson said some aspects of the story about Cummings were \u201cpalpably false\u201d, but he did not say which and ignored some direct questions. Cummings is facing a possible police investigation after a witness complained to police that he saw Cummings in Durham in a second breach of lockdown in April. Retired chemistry teacher Richard Lees noted the number of a car which he said Cummings was driving in Barnard Castle on 12 April. Read what we know so far about Cummings\u2019s movements. The affair placed other developments in the coronavirus story in the shade over the weekend although the PM was forced yesterday to acknowledge that some primary schools will need more time to prepare before pupils can return. He had hoped all primaries would reopen next Monday.

The study also suggests that the figures could be even higher as many cases are withdrawn before they reach tribunals. * * * Bank holiday bonus \u2013 An extra bank holiday in October this year could boost the economy by \u00a3500m, according to an economics thinktank.

      "bodyText": "More than $85m that retirees have poured into a fund controlled by Dunk Island owner Mayfair 101 is at risk, after receivers were appointed over more than a dozen companies in the group. The Victorian supreme court appointed Nicholas Giasoumi and Hamish MacKinnon, of Dye &amp; Co, as receivers of the companies on Friday after Mayfair 101 failed to make $3m in loan repayments to the IPO Wealth Fund. There have been complaints from residents in Mission Beach, on the Queensland mainland near Mayfair 101\u2019s flagship Dunk Island project, that the group had indefinitely stalled on dozens of contracts to purchase their properties. There is also an ongoing investigation into its affairs by the corporate watchdog. The move is a major blow for Mayfair 101 and its high-profile founder James Mawhinney, who have been racing against time and the coronavirus pandemic to buy more than $200m worth of property in the Mission Beach area as part of an ambitious plan to turn the region into a tourism hub. In March, Mayfair 101 began to delay up to 60 scheduled property settlements at Mission Beach, in some cases with less than 24 hours\u2019 notice. The company cited a \u201cmaterially adverse event\u201d clause in property sale contracts that allowed it to stall on settlements indefinitely. Letters to property owners from a lawyer representing Mayfair said the pandemic had \u201cimpacted the ability of my client to fulfil its obligations under the contract\u201d. Giasoumi and MacKinnon will now investigate whether there has been any misconduct at the companies they now control and try to determine the value of a string of investments including cryptocurrencies, apps and an Indian stock exchange. Giasoumi told Guardian Australia he did not know where Mayfair 101 founder and director Mawhinney was. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make contact with the director and haven\u2019t been successful yet,\u201d he said. He said his staff would visit the Mayfair 101 office on Monday and an investigation into the operation of the companies was under way. There is no allegation Mawhinney has done anything wrong. He could not be reached through his public relations agent, Joanne Painter of Icon Agency. Giasoumi said he didn\u2019t believe IPO Wealth members had any rights over the property at Dunk Island, which Mayfair 101 bought in September for more than $30m. In a letter sent to fund members on Friday, Vasco Trustees said it also had not been able to speak to Mayfair 101 since the group failed to pay the $3m the previous week, \u201cdespite a number of attempts to contact them\u201d. The IPO Wealth Fund is one of a number of ways the Mayfair 101 group has raised money from investors it has spruiked its wares to through full-page advertisements in newspapers and websites. As of June last year investors had tipped $95m into the fund, of which $86m had been loaned to a company called IPO Wealth Holdings, which trades as Mayfair 101 Holdings. This was the fund\u2019s only investment. Giasoumi said IPO Wealth Holdings then lent the money to 15 other investment vehicles, over which he has also been appointed receiver. It is understood the Australian Securities and Investments Commission has previously had concerns about the operation of the IPO Wealth fund. \u201cWe are aware the independent responsible entity, Vasco, is taking steps to protect investors and we are monitoring the situation,\u201d an Asic spokesman said. Asic is currently in court with Mayfair over comparisons it has made of two other products to term deposits which the regulator alleges are misleading and deceptive. Mayfair has previously said it has \u201ccooperated with all Asic\u2019s information requests\u201d and has already added additional information to its website and materials to further ensure investors are fully informed about the risks and rewards of its investment products. The receivers are due back in court on Friday.",

The playwright James Graham last week said on BBC One\u2019s Question Time that a support package should be seen not as a bailout, but as an investment. \u201cThe money we need to cover the shortfall until we can properly reopen open is almost instantly paid back in the annual tax revenue and the VAT. In London alone, tourists bring in \u00a32bn of cash every year specifically for London theatre,\u201d he said. The arts sector plays an important part in the nation\u2019s psychological health, spirit and morale, he said, but in order to do that, \u201cit needs to be saved in the interim\u201d.",

The moves by Markerstudy Group, which employs around 3,000 staff, raise questions as to whether the company has followed UK employment rules by cutting pay for around 3% of staff who refused to agree to the deductions. The group provides insurance services as well as owning the windscreen repair and replacement firm, which is perhaps best known as the sponsor of English football\u2019s League One and League Two cup competition for five years until 2000. Having furloughed around 900 staff in March, the company asked its remaining employees on 9 April to take a temporary wage cut, backdated to 1 April, and give up sick pay. In a question and answer document sent to staff about the proposals, Markerstudy suggested that redundancies would be possible if the wage cut was not accepted, and added: \u201cIf anyone refuses [to accept the pay cut], it will be dealt with on an individual basis\u201d. Some staff have told the Guardian they received calls from managers telling them to sign the document or they would be made redundant. At the end of last month Markerstudy told employees that 97% of them had accepted the proposals, although it is understood that some staff say they only signed under duress and some have begun grievance processes.

      "body": "<p>And so it is that we reach a watershed point in the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis, manifested in a tangle of stories all unified by vivid themes: power concentrated at the centre, a lack of meaningful checks and balances, and the exposure by incompetence and arrogance of the mess beneath. Primary schools are meant to partly reopen next Monday, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/government-rows-back-on-1-june-english-primary-schools-reopening-plan\">many are in no position to do so</a>; a test-and-tracing regime that should have materialised weeks ago is still frantically being assembled. And then along come the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/23/new-witnesses-cast-doubt-on-dominic-cummingss-lockdown-claims\">revelations</a> of Dominic Cummings\u2019s wanderings \u2013 ostensibly a tale of one man\u2019s self-importance, but really the story of an unelected courtier whose influence and reputation speak volumes about how broken our system of government now is.</p> <p>One recurrent spectacle has defined the last couple of months: ministers, presumably egged on by their advisers, grandly issuing their edicts, only for people to insist that they simply do not match the reality on the ground. The schools story is one example; another was the shambolic and arrogant way that Boris Johnson announced the shift from \u201cstay at home\u201d to \u201cstay alert\u201d, and his call for droves of people to return to work. Watching the leaders of Wales and Scotland insist they had no input into the government\u2019s change of message and then stick to their existing lockdowns was a stark reminder that the UK is continuing to fragment. In England, meanwhile, the council leaders and mayors who were suddenly faced with huge consequences for transport and public health had been caught on the hop. \u201cNo one in government thought it important to tell the cities who\u2019d have to cope,\u201d said the Greater Manchester mayor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/16/are-we-all-in-this-together-it-doesnt-look-like-it-from-the-regions\">Andy Burnham</a>. Nick Forbes, the leader of Newcastle city council, told me last week: \u201cThe first I knew about it was when I saw it on TV.\u201d</p> <p>For the opening phase of the crisis, Forbes explained, he had joined a weekly conference call of council leaders and chief executives, addressed by Robert Jenrick, the communities and local government secretary. He is not the only figure from local government who has told me that the calls are now handled by more junior ministers, and are no longer weekly. A few days ago, I spoke to another city leader who said that long-awaited government guidance on arrangements for social care and help for businesses had finally arrived last Friday, ahead of the bank holiday weekend. He also expressed huge frustration about the issue that arguably highlights the shortcomings of our top-down system most glaringly: the supposed arrival of a <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-world-beating-track-and-trace-system-ready-for-schools-to-reopen-pm-promises-11991606\">\u201cworld-beating\u201d testing and tracing system by next Monday</a>, and the ongoing saga of how it will work and who will run it.</p> <p>On testing, rather than following the kind of devolved, pluralistic model that has worked so well in Germany, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, has so far stuck to the usual centralised script, something exemplified by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/28/concerns-over-delays-and-errors-at-uk-drive-in-coronavirus-test-centres\">drive-through testing centres</a> contracted at speed to such private companies as Deloitte, Sodexo and Boots, and often situated in inappropriate locations. On its hobbling progress towards a system of contact tracing, the government at first followed much the same logic, attempting a centralised system of call centres involving such private companies as the outsourcing giant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/20/serco-accidentally-shares-contact-tracers-email-addresses-covid-19\">Serco</a>, staffed by new recruits who had apparently been given the most <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/no-one-had-any-idea-contact-tracers-lack-knowledge-about-covid-19-job\">cursory training</a>.</p> <p>The councils who have the kind of forensic local knowledge and experience any tracing efforts will depend on were at first left in the dark. Then, less than three weeks before the system was meant to be in place, it was announced that the chief executive of Leeds city council had been made \u201c<a href=\"https://www.lgcplus.com/politics/coronavirus/boost-to-local-government-role-in-covid-tracing-as-riordan-named-national-lead-13-05-2020/\">national lead on tracing</a>\u201d, and that councils and their public health directors were to have a role after all. Throughout last week, senior people in city and local government were still telling me that though this sounded positive, they had no clear idea of what they were going to be asked to do. But on Friday afternoon, the government announced that councils would be working with Whitehall <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/300-million-additional-funding-for-local-authorities-to-support-new-test-and-trace-service\">\u201cto support test and trace services in their local communities</a>\u201d and \u201cdevelop tailored outbreak control plans\u201d.</p> <p>As one city leader told me, the announcement came at \u201cone minute to midnight\u201d. The \u00a3300m that was now allocated to English councils for the work was, he said, \u201ccompletely pitiful\u201d. The thinking at work was plain: seemingly in a fit of panic, the people who run cities, counties and boroughs had been belatedly tacked on to a plan that should have had them at its core all along. Perhaps the most painful thing was that this mistreatment was hardly a surprise: if councils are suddenly being praised by ministers, it hardly makes up for a decade of savage cuts to basic local services, an aspect of the Covid-19 crisis that is still overlooked.</p> <p>Which brings us to the subject too often obscured by the government\u2019s convulsions: money. Two weeks ago, the <a href=\"https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/politics/yorkshire-councils-could-declare-themselves-bankrupt-months-due-pandemic-2846622\">Yorkshire Post reported</a> on the prospect of \u201cmany of the 22 local authorities in the Yorkshire and the Humber region making a choreographed joint declaration that they have run out of money\u201d. In Newcastle, Forbes told me the city council now faced an in-year financial gap of \u00a345.5m. When ministers and their cheerleaders announce this or that funding boost and insist there will be no return to austerity, it is worth bearing in mind that austerity is still an ongoing reality for large chunks of the country.</p> <p>Just about every aspect of our current national impasse proves that the old centralised game is up, and that England needs a new constitutional settlement. This does not strike me as a left/right issue, unless you are the kind of Tory who thinks that the neglect and outright destruction of local government ought to be a necessary part of your politics. Power needs to be taken from the centre and dispersed: the future needs to be founded on a huge boost to councils\u2019 share of the tax take, the devolution of everything from health to transport, and fully localised responses to any future emergencies. If we do not begin this revolution soon, we will carry on bumbling from one crisis to the next, as Whitehall and Westminster fall into more scandal and disgrace and the commands barked from on high continue to fade into white noise.</p> <p>\u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist</p>",

He is not the only figure from local government who has told me that the calls are now handled by more junior ministers, and are no longer weekly. A few days ago, I spoke to another city leader who said that long-awaited government guidance on arrangements for social care and help for businesses had finally arrived last Friday, ahead of the bank holiday weekend. He also expressed huge frustration about the issue that arguably highlights the shortcomings of our top-down system most glaringly: the supposed arrival of a \u201cworld-beating\u201d testing and tracing system by next Monday, and the ongoing saga of how it will work and who will run it. On testing, rather than following the kind of devolved, pluralistic model that has worked so well in Germany, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, has so far stuck to the usual centralised script, something exemplified by the drive-through testing centres contracted at speed to such private companies as Deloitte, Sodexo and Boots, and often situated in inappropriate locations. On its hobbling progress towards a system of contact tracing, the government at first followed much the same logic, attempting a centralised system of call centres involving such private companies as the outsourcing giant Serco, staffed by new recruits who had apparently been given the most cursory training. The councils who have the kind of forensic local knowledge and experience any tracing efforts will depend on were at first left in the dark. Then, less than three weeks before the system was meant to be in place, it was announced that the chief executive of Leeds city council had been made \u201cnational lead on tracing\u201d, and that councils and their public health directors were to have a role after all. Throughout last week, senior people in city and local government were still telling me that though this sounded positive, they had no clear idea of what they were going to be asked to do. But on Friday afternoon, the government announced that councils would be working with Whitehall \u201cto support test and trace services in their local communities\u201d and \u201cdevelop tailored outbreak control plans\u201d. As one city leader told me, the announcement came at \u201cone minute to midnight\u201d. The \u00a3300m that was now allocated to English councils for the work was, he said, \u201ccompletely pitiful\u201d. The thinking at work was plain: seemingly in a fit of panic, the people who run cities, counties and boroughs had been belatedly tacked on to a plan that should have had them at its core all along. Perhaps the most painful thing was that this mistreatment was hardly a surprise: if councils are suddenly being praised by ministers, it hardly makes up for a decade of savage cuts to basic local services, an aspect of the Covid-19 crisis that is still overlooked. Which brings us to the subject too often obscured by the government\u2019s convulsions: money. Two weeks ago, the Yorkshire Post reported on the prospect of \u201cmany of the 22 local authorities in the Yorkshire and the Humber region making a choreographed joint declaration that they have run out of money\u201d. In Newcastle, Forbes told me the city council now faced an in-year financial gap of \u00a345.5m. When ministers and their cheerleaders announce this or that funding boost and insist there will be no return to austerity, it is worth bearing in mind that austerity is still an ongoing reality for large chunks of the country. Just about every aspect of our current national impasse proves that the old centralised game is up, and that England needs a new constitutional settlement. This does not strike me as a left/right issue, unless you are the kind of Tory who thinks that the neglect and outright destruction of local government ought to be a necessary part of your politics. Power needs to be taken from the centre and dispersed: the future needs to be founded on a huge boost to councils\u2019 share of the tax take, the devolution of everything from health to transport, and fully localised responses to any future emergencies. If we do not begin this revolution soon, we will carry on bumbling from one crisis to the next, as Whitehall and Westminster fall into more scandal and disgrace and the commands barked from on high continue to fade into white noise. \u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist",

Dean, the editor of the conservative Spectator Australia magazine, began the interview by asking Pompeo whether \u201cthe coronavirus unwittingly exposed the real face of Chinese communism\u201d. The focus soon shifted to a proposal by the Victorian state government to explore opportunities to cooperate with Beijing\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative \u2013 an emerging partnership that has attracted domestic political criticism, and is viewed warily in Australian national security circles. In response to Dean\u2019s question, Pompeo urged the citizens of Australia to scrutinise any proposals \u201cincredibly closely\u201d as the scheme carried significant risks. Pompeo said while the US would continue to work with \u201cgreat partners like Australia\u201d, his country \u201cwill not take any risk to our telecommunications infrastructure, any risk to the national security elements of what we need to do with our Five Eyes partners\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t know the nature of those projects precisely, but to the extent they have an adverse impact on our ability to protect telecommunications from our private citizens, or security networks for our defence and intelligence communities, we will simply disconnect, we will simply separate. We\u2019re going to preserve trust in networks for important information. We hope our friends and partners and allies across the world, especially our Five Eyes partners like Australia, will do the same.\u201d Pompeo\u2019s comments raised eyebrows in Canberra because the Australian government had moved early to block Chinese-owned Huawei and ZTE from Australia\u2019s 5G network in response to security advice \u2013 a decision, made in 2018 and welcomed by the US, that Beijing still cites as a source of ongoing diplomatic tension. Unfortunately, Dean did not follow up with a question to his guest seeking more detail on the likelihood or implications of this possible \u201cdisconnection\u201d from Australia. Instead, Dean moved on to his next question which began with \u201cPresident Donald Trump \u2013 I love his tweets; they\u2019re brilliant, great sense of humour \u2026\u201d Before long, headlines appeared across the Australian media that highlighted the possibility of the US cutting off communication channels. The Australian, a News Corp paper which has been critical of Victoria\u2019s Belt and Road position, featured the news on its live blog that Pompeo had \u201cthreatened the United States will \u2018simply disconnect\u2019 from Australia if Victoria\u2019s Belt and Road agreement with China affects US telecommunications\u201d. Prof Rory Medcalf, the head of the national security college at the Australian National University, describes the Pompeo intervention as \u201ccrude, ill-informed and bad for the health of the Australia-US alliance\u201d. \u201cHe may have been referring to a remote hypothetical but there was thus no need to speculate about \u2018cutting off\u2019 Australia \u2013 just the kind of language that alliance critics will seize on,\u201d he tells the Guardian. \u201cAmid the awful economic coercion Australia is dealing with from the Chinese Communist party, the last thing the alliance needs is even the impression of coercion from our ally.\u201d The Victorian Labor government responded quickly, with a spokesperson saying the state would not agree to telecommunications projects under Belt and Road and pointing out telecommunications regulation was a federal responsibility. Before the day was out, the US ambassador to Australia, Arthur Culvahouse Jr, had issued a statement to \u201cset the record straight\u201d after seeing the headlines stemming from Pompeo\u2019s interview. Culvahouse commended Australia\u2019s leadership on the issue of 5G network security, and said the US was \u201cnot aware that Victoria has engaged in any concrete projects under BRI, let alone projects impinging on telecommunications networks, which we understand are a federal matter\u201d. While the US would have to examine any future initiatives that risked the integrity of networks, that was \u201ca very remote hypothetical\u201d, and the US had \u201cevery confidence that Australia, as a close ally and Five Eyes partner, would take every measure necessary to ensure the security of its telecommunications networks\u201d. Anthony Byrne, the deputy chair of parliament\u2019s powerful intelligence and security committee, says the ambassador\u2019s clarification is welcome. \u201cI thank him for his comments; it cleared up any misapprehension about this matter,\u201d says Byrne, an opposition Labor MP. Medcalf says of the clarification by the ambassador: \u201cClearly the US embassy read the mood in Australia \u2013 with even some of the most pro-alliance voices speaking out \u2013 and took action to stem the damage.\u201c The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, did not weigh in on Pompeo\u2019s intervention when asked on Sunday, saying only that the federal government had never supported Victoria\u2019s Belt and Road involvement. Australian states should \u201crespect and recognise the role of the federal government in setting foreign policy\u201d. Morrison didn\u2019t say anything about the United States.

They didn\u2019t wait for the government to act, they stepped in and stepped up right from the start. The masks were just an add-on to some programmes they already had in place, such as food distribution or help for vulnerable women.\u201d In India, where the northeast border meets Myanmar, an organisation training women from the marginalised Chandel district in weaving and tailoring has moved to masks instead of the usual export-ready shawls, sarongs and table runners. The Weaker Sections Development Council employs about 20 weavers and 15 tailors. Using organic cotton fibres naturally dyed with turmeric at the WSDC centre and then delivered to the weavers\u2019 homes, the threads are woven into masks on looms. Sold locally for 50 rupees (50p) and more widely for 100 rupees, WSDC\u2019s Angdawnsaang Khaling says the pandemic has not yet reached Chandel, but has affected the nearest city, Imphal, 50km (31 miles) away. \u201cFrom an outsider\u2019s perspective, 50km may seem very close, but considering it\u2019s lockdown, we feel safe,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are no masks provided by authorities to the public, but people are informed. So far we have made 2,000 masks and the central government [in Delhi] is interested and has asked us to send over samples [for a large tender]. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many other [organisations] making organic masks with eco-friendly dyes, so fingers crossed the tender goes through. It would be amazing for the weavers.\u201d Additional reporting by Liz Kalaugher and Anne Pinto-Rodrigues",

      "bodyText": "What if it had just fizzled out? What if leading Chinese scientist Zhong Nanshan had gone on state television on 20 January and delivered news that the unusual virus detected in Wuhan was not spreading between people, instead of what he really said that night: that human-to-human transmission was certain? The infection might have been traced to animal carcasses piled in a seafood market\u2019s lanes, and after they were destroyed \u2013 and experts issued their usual warnings that a more serious outbreak was inevitable \u2013 the coronavirus story might have ended. What would we be talking about instead? What stories would have defined 2020 so far? Even before the worst pandemic in a century, tectonic shifts were already under way. The news felt exhausting. But the world is still turning, despite the movements of half of humanity being restricted in some way. Even apart from Covid-19, it has been a year of significant developments. Iran after Qassem Suleimani In the middle of the night in Baghdad, on 3 January, a US drone fired the most consequential shot in the Middle East in a generation, killing 10 people including Qassem Suleimani, leader of the expeditionary force of Iran\u2019s Revolution Guards. The 62-year-old general had been a thorn in the side of the American-led occupation of Iraq, overseeing the Islamic republic\u2019s campaign in Syria and nurturing proxies that turned Iran into a regional player. He was thought to be untouchable. Donald Trump marked his killing with a wordless tweet of a grainy American flag. The chaotic days following the killing involved a deadly crush at one of the general\u2019s public funerals, Iran\u2019s first ever missile strikes on US troops, the accidental shooting down of a passenger jet over Tehran \u2013 killing all 176 aboard \u2013 and an outburst of anti-regime protests in Iranian cities. The reverberations may be felt for years: nearly all the regional projects Suleimani was overseeing when he died have faltered, the Observer reported this month, and the al-Quds force is struggling to manage its network of proxies without his giant presence. The other plague The largest swarms of locusts in decades have descended on farms in parts of Africa, south Asia and the Arabian peninsula this year, posing \u201can extremely alarming and unprecedented threat to food security and livelihoods\u201d, according to the UN. The pests form vast, destructive clouds that can travel about 55 miles (90km) in 24 hours. A swarm about a square kilometre large can consume the same quantity of food in a day as 35,000 people. The risk of second waves is said to still be critical, including in Yemen, where food security is already dire amid the ongoing civil war. Riots in Delhi Hostility towards Indian Muslims has crept further into the Indian mainstream in the past five years since the country\u2019s Hindu nationalist prime minister, Narendra Modi, was elected. In February, it boiled over during a state visit by Donald Trump, culminating in the country\u2019s worst religious violence in decades. The catalyst was widely acknowledged to be a ruling party leader, Kapil Mishra, who on 23 February issued a public ultimatum that if the police did not clear the streets of mostly Muslim protesters, his supporters would be \u201cforced to hit the streets\u201d. At least 50 were killed in the ensuing violence between Hindu and Muslim mobs, amid allegations that the Delhi police stood back to allow Hindus to commit violence while beating to death some of the Muslim men in their custody. The riots and killings contributed to growing unease about the kind of India that may emerge from Modi\u2019s years in power. The US retreats from its longest war After nearly 19 years, more than 43,000 civilian casualties and three US presidents, the Trump administration signed a peace deal with the Taliban on a Saturday afternoon in late February. It was a good deal for the Taliban: they managed to exclude elected officials in Kabul and deal with the Americans directly. On paper, US troops could be gone from the country by spring 2021. The Taliban have promised to sit down with their Afghan government counterparts and make a separate peace deal later, but there is no guarantee they will do so, and their attacks on the Afghan army and police continue. The US says the ongoing violence means their troops may stay, but it is clear, not least to the Taliban, that Washington is desperate to get out of the war. It\u2019s Biden For a few days after Bernie Sanders swept the Las Vegas Democratic primary, it appeared that a self-described \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d was going to win the nomination of a major American party. Instead, the Democratic establishment rallied behind former vice-president Joe Biden, the campaign\u2019s standard-bearer for the liberalism of the Obama and Clinton eras. Biden cleaned up on Super Tuesday and soon after clinched the nomination, but there was no victory tour, nor conciliatory rallies with his opponents. Instead, the 77-year-old appeared to vanish from view as the scale of the coronavirus emergency finally broke through to policymakers and the public. He is currently campaigning from the basement of his Delaware home. Antarctica\u2019s longest heatwave ever On 6 February, an Argentine weather station on Antarctica\u2019s northern tip recorded a temperature of 18.4C (65.1F) \u2013 roughly the same as Los Angeles that day, Nasa noted. It was part of the longest stretch of warm weather ever recorded on the continent, a nine-day heatwave that melted 20% of one island\u2019s snow cover. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen melt ponds develop this quickly in Antarctica,\u201d Mauri Pelto, a glaciologist at Nichols College, told Nasa\u2019s Earth Observatory. \u201cYou see these kinds of melt events in Alaska and Greenland, but not usually in Antarctica.\u201d The freak temperatures were attributed to the confluence of warmer than average sea surfaces, a high pressure system over South America and a warming phenomenon known as the foehn effect. They come against a backdrop of another looming crisis: an almost 3C temperature increase on the Antarctic peninsula over the past 50 years, part of a pattern of unusual weather events associated with global heating, including Australia\u2019s catastrophic bushfire season. Sudan bans FGM A legislative change in Sudan could improve the lives of millions of women. About 87% of girls and women in the country have undergone female genital mutilation (FGM), according to the UN. Most are cut between the ages of five and 14. Campaigners in April hailed the passage of a new law that makes the practice punishable by up to three years in prison, but were sober about its impact. The practice is entrenched in Sudanese culture and will take time to be eradicated entirely. \u201cThere is so much work to be done. This is a start, a good start,\u201d Fatma Naib, a Unicef communication officer in Sudan, told the Guardian. An alleged genocidaire in custody A dawn raid in a Paris suburb in May snared one of the world\u2019s most wanted men. F\u00e9licien Kabuga, a wealthy Rwandan businessman, is accused of creating and funding the notorious Interahamwe militia that carried out the 1994 killings of about 800,000 people in less than three months. His radio station, the Radio-T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Libre des Mille Collines, allegedly helped lay the groundwork for the genocide with its relentless dehumanisation of the Tutsi population. \u201cYou have missed some of the enemies,\u201d it said in one notorious broadcast during the killings. \u201cYou must go back there and finish them off. The graves are not yet full.\u201d A 2003 attempt to capture Kabuga in Nairobi ended with the mysterious death of the man who was supposed to give up his location. French police said the 84-year-old had also spent time in Germany, Belgium and Switzerland. He is yet to enter a plea in a French or international court, but his lawyers said last week that he had the right to be presumed innocent. Ahmaud Arbery The fatal shooting of Ahmaud Arbery, a 26-year-old African American, as he jogged in a coastal city in the US state of Georgia in February, initially received little national attention. The two men accused of killing him claimed they did so in self-defence. Police and prosecutors showed little enthusiasm for pursuing the case. That changed with the 5 May release of a video depicting Arbery\u2019s last moments. The man is trailed slowly by a car as he jogs on quiet street. He reaches another vehicle and two armed men appear. A struggle ensues with one and several gunshots go off. The last scene shows Arbery dying in the street. The shocking footage led to the arrest of the three men present at the shooting, and has rekindled popular rage at the dangers black men can face in predominantly white communities, and the impunity and inaction that regularly follows their deaths. The end of the two-state solution? Once a fringe notion espoused by Israel\u2019s far right, the idea the Jewish state would simply declare swaths of the Palestinian territories \u2013 where its settlements have been proliferating for decades \u2013 its own territory has over the past year marched into the mainstream. It may soon become Israeli law. The new governing alliance of Benjamin Netanyahu and his former election rival Benny Gantz, plans to advance legislation in the next few months aimed at eventually declaring about 30% of the occupied West Bank to be Israeli territory, in line with the \u201cpeace plan\u201d released by Trump in January \u2013 and roundly rejected by Palestinian leaders. The Trump plan calls for the annexation to take place in consultation with Palestinian leaders, but it is unclear what conditions \u2013 if any \u2013 the White House would impose on the Netanyahu-Gantz government. The annexation was \u201can Israeli decision\u201d, Mike Pompeo said recently. European leaders, the UN and scores of retired Israeli generals and security officials have voiced their objection to the plan, arguing that it would isolate Israel and pour petrol on the volatile region. It would also signal the death of the two-state solution, the 1994 outline for peace between the Israelis and Palestinians that has been the framework for all subsequent negotiations, but which many analysts argue has been on its deathbed for years. Other stories from this year Movie mogul Harvey Weinstein was convicted of sexual assault in a landmark trial. Amazon boss Jeff Bezos\u2019s phone was hacked after he received a WhatsApp message sent by the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, according to digital forensics experts. A man described as \u201cBritain\u2019s most prolific rapist\u201d was convicted in January. The court heard that Reynhard Sinaga may have assaulted at least 159 men over several years by luring them to his house and drugging them. Warring leaders in the world\u2019s newest country, South Sudan, signed a fragile peace deal in February. The UK formally left the European Union on 31 January.",

I am happier now than I have been in years \u2026 I am happy to be getting the money, but I also am thinking I\u2019m going to need to stockpile it because, well, there\u2019s the possibility there won\u2019t be any restaurant work for me when we open back up.\u201d</p> \n<p>Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), said the $600 was \u201ca small step in the right direction\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut we also need to think bigger than boosting one particular benefit,\u201d Henry said. \u201cHow are we going to make sure this level of crisis never happens again? How can we enact an equitable recovery plan that addresses the needs of all communities, especially communities of color?\u201d</p> \n<p>That includes helping those who don\u2019t benefit from the unemployment boost \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/strikes-erupt-us-essential-workers-demand-better-protection-amid-pandemic\">essential</a> workers keeping grocery stores and factories running on the frontlines of the pandemic.</p> \n<p>\u201cAs we reckon with what a post-Covid world looks like, we cannot forget who kept our country running in our moment of need,\u201d Henry said. \u201cOur healthcare workers, food-service workers and janitors, who are overwhelmingly black and brown workers, women and immigrants, deserve more than praise. They deserve nothing less than family-sustaining wages of at least $15 an hour and the right to form a union to lift up individuals and communities \u2013 both now and in the post-pandemic world.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>James\u2019s and Mark\u2019s last names were changed at their request</em></p>",

Boloco has been able to keep paying 120 staff \u2013 who have received an additional $2 an hour in hazard pay since March \u2013 with help from the PPP loan. That money runs out after eight weeks, which for Pepper is early June. He said he has never felt as unstable as he does right now. But he said that uncertainty puts him, and other restaurant owners, in a similar position to the one low-wage employees have been living for years. \u201cAll of a sudden, for the first time in many business owners\u2019 lives, they were day-to-day, they were literally one day at a time in March, when this thing started coming in,\u201d Pepper said. \u201cI thought to myself: \u2018Welcome to the world of your employees.\u2019\u201d Thinking bigger than $600 The tensions around paying low wage workers more reflects the broader problem of inequality in the US. The extra $600 works out to $15 an hour for a 40-hour work week \u2013 the same figure labor activists have been pushing to be the national minimum wage. The people who stand to benefit the most from the boost are those in the hardest-hit industries, such as hospitality, where wages were already low. These are also people facing uncertainty about when, and how many, jobs will be available. Justin Wafer went from making about $550 a week as a bartender in Portland, Oregon, to about $1,000 a week on unemployment. He said he would be fine without the boost because of his partner\u2019s income \u2013 though he is using the extra money to pay off existing debts. \u201cI\u2019m 36 years old, I\u2019m tired of being behind a bar, so I have this complex feeling about it. I am happier now than I have been in years \u2026 I am happy to be getting the money, but I also am thinking I\u2019m going to need to stockpile it because, well, there\u2019s the possibility there won\u2019t be any restaurant work for me when we open back up.\u201d Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), said the $600 was \u201ca small step in the right direction\u201d. \u201cBut we also need to think bigger than boosting one particular benefit,\u201d Henry said. \u201cHow are we going to make sure this level of crisis never happens again? How can we enact an equitable recovery plan that addresses the needs of all communities, especially communities of color?\u201d That includes helping those who don\u2019t benefit from the unemployment boost \u2013 essential workers keeping grocery stores and factories running on the frontlines of the pandemic. \u201cAs we reckon with what a post-Covid world looks like, we cannot forget who kept our country running in our moment of need,\u201d Henry said. \u201cOur healthcare workers, food-service workers and janitors, who are overwhelmingly black and brown workers, women and immigrants, deserve more than praise. They deserve nothing less than family-sustaining wages of at least $15 an hour and the right to form a union to lift up individuals and communities \u2013 both now and in the post-pandemic world.\u201d James\u2019s and Mark\u2019s last names were changed at their request",

      "bodyText": "Church of England bishops have fired a volley of unprecedented criticism at Boris Johnson over his defence of actions taken by his chief aide, Dominic Cummings. One suggested the church could decline to work with the government during the coronavirus crisis \u201cunless we see clear repentance, including the sacking of Cummings\u201d. More than a dozen bishops questioned the integrity of the prime minister following his press conference on Sunday, in which he refused to acknowledge that Cummings had breached lockdown rules when he travelled with his infected wife and their child to Durham. The bishops said Johnson\u2019s defence was \u201crisible\u201d, that he had \u201cno respect for the people\u201d, \u201clacked integrity\u201d, and risked undermining the trust of the public. Pete Broadbent, the bishop of Willesden, tweeted: \u201cJohnson has now gone the full Trump.\u201d The first bishop to go public in criticising the prime minister was Nick Baines, the bishop of Leeds, who told the Observer: \u201cPeople across the country have sacrificed hugely in order to obey both the spirit and word of government advice. People have missed being with family members who have died. But, now we learn that there is one rule for the people and another for No 10 and the elite.\u201d After Johnson\u2019s comments on Sunday, Baines tweeted: \u201cThe question now is: do we accept being lied to, patronised and treated by a PM as mugs? The moral question is not for Cummings \u2013 it is for PM and ministers/MPs who find this behaviour acceptable. What are we to teach our children? (I ask as a responsible father.)\u201d The Church of England could decide to review its work with the government during the pandemic, said David Walker, the bishop of Manchester. \u201cUnless very soon we see clear repentance, including the sacking of Cummings, I no longer know how we can trust what ministers say sufficiently for @churchofengland to work together with them on the pandemic.\u201d The bishop of Durham, Paul Butler, whose diocese covers the Cummings family farm, said: \u201cThere will be those in Durham who defend #Boris for his standing by #DominicCummngs. But most who have worked so hard to abide by the rules and guidance of the past weeks will feel hurt, angry, &amp; let down. Trust has been broken. For the nation\u2019s sake rebuild it quickly.\u201d John Inge, the bishop of Worcester, said: \u201cThe PM\u2019s risible defence of Cummings is an insult to all those who have made such sacrifices to ensure the safety of others.\u201d Vivienne Faull, the bishop of Bristol, tweeted: \u201cDay 61 #livingdifferently in a nation where the PM has no respect for the people.

Despite some parents expressing concern, the NSW education department reported an 86% attendance rate. The state\u2019s average is about 92%.<br></li> \n   <li>NSW and Victoria recorded three new cases of Covid-19 each. Western Australia recorded four new cases \u2013 all of them were within the same family who flew in from Doha last week.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s where I\u2019ll leave you for tonight. Thanks for reading, and I hope you\u2019re hunkering down somewhere dry. Here\u2019s what we learned today: Students returned to school full-time in New South Wales and Queensland after months of online learning. Despite some parents expressing concern, the NSW education department reported an 86% attendance rate. The state\u2019s average is about 92%. NSW and Victoria recorded three new cases of Covid-19 each. Western Australia recorded four new cases \u2013 all of them were within the same family who flew in from Doha last week. Queensland, the ACT, the Northern Territory and South Australia saw no new cases. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, announced an additional $20m for mental health funding. WA premier Mark McGowan announced travel within all regions of the state would be allowed by the weekend, but the border closure with the rest of Australia will remain in place. In SA, premier Steven Marshall announced that from Monday up to 80 patrons will be allowed at restaurants, cafes and pubs at any one time, provided they are split across 20 \u201cdiscrete rooms or areas\u201d of the venue. Cinemas, theatres, galleries, museums, beauty salons, and gyms will also be allowed to open from Monday. Shares on the Australian stock market have soared 2.2% to reach their highest level since 11 March. Labor continued to revel in the government\u2019s jobkeeper accounting mistake. Shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers called it \u201cthe biggest blunder that any government\u2019s made in any budget at any point in the history of this commonwealth\u201d. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said that despite the extra money now sitting in the government\u2019s coffers as a result of the error, there would be no \u201cwholesale changes\u201d to the jobkeeper program. My colleague Naaman Zhou reports that four of Australia\u2019s private universities have been made eligible for jobkeeper, while three more public universities have rejected a deal negotiated by the tertiary sector union to save jobs in exchange for pay cuts. I know this isn\u2019t strictly coronavirus-related, but comedian Celeste Barber has just issued a statement on today\u2019s New South Wales supreme court ruling that the more than $51.3m she raised for bushfire recovery can only go to the NSW Rural Fire Service. Barber said: I had hoped, because it was such a big and \u2018unprecedented\u2019 amount, that it could have been distributed to other states and charities \u2013 turns out that studying acting at university does not make me a lawmaker. Full statement below. Good evening, blog readers. I\u2019m coming to you live from underneath my doona. I know Scott Morrison keeps telling us we have to get out from under it, but it\u2019s cold in Sydney. As my colleague Elias Visontay mentioned earlier, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners has taken a swipe at radio broadcasters Kyle and Jackie O for their interview with Pete Evans today. Evans, we know, has some, erm, non-mainstream views about, well, a lot of things. But the (former?) celebrity chef isn\u2019t so high and mighty that he\u2019ll only appear on the big commercial radio stations. Dia Beltran, an anti-abortion, far-right personality with links to former United Patriots Front members Neil Erikson and Blair Cottrell, is also spruiking an interview with him this coming Wednesday. According to Beltran, Evans will appear on her show on the same day as the hard-right Russian nationalist Alexander Dugin. We can only assume that Evans plans to denounce the far-right and offer some tips on avocado preparation, but still, it\u2019s quite a line-up. (Thanks to Cam Smith for the heads-up on this). And with that, I\u2019ll pass you over to my colleague Michael McGowan, whose steady hands will guide this ship for the next little while. Shares on the Australian stock market have soared 2.2% to reach their highest level since 11 March. AAP is reporting the local bourse closed at an 11-week high after climbing more than 2 per cent, with gains across the board. The S&amp;P/ASX200 benchmark finished Monday up 118.6 points, or 2.16%, at 5,615.6 points, while the All Ordinaries index was up 121.1 points, or 2.16% higher, at 5,729.9. The Australian dollar was buying 65.28 US cents, up from 65.15 US cents at the close of trade on Friday. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) has accused Sydney radio shock jock Kyle Sandilands and his co-host Jackie O of compromising public health for failing to challenge \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d about vaccination raised during an interview with controversial former TV chef Pete Evans on Monday. RACGP President Dr Harry Nespolon said: \u201cIt is extremely disappointing that two very popular and prominent commercial radio hosts have given Pete Evans 20 minutes of unfettered air time to air his anti-vaxxer stance.\u201d Mr Evans may consider himself \u2018pro-choice for medical freedom\u2019 but the fact that his assertions were by all accounts barely challenged by the radio hosts makes this interview particularly problematic. I think that all television networks, radio stations and publications have a responsibility to self-regulate and not provide platforms to people spreading dangerous and misleading information that can harm public health. If they do interview such individuals they need to at least challenge conspiracy theories and \u2018advice\u2019 contrary to expert medical opinion. Instead of listening to Pete Evans on commercial radio, consult with your GP \u2013 we are there for you and have your best interest at heart. Now more than ever, expert advice matters. Earlier this month, Channel 7 announced they had parted ways with the My Kitchen Rules host, weeks after the Therapeutic Goods Administration fined him $25,200 for spruiking a $15,000 light machine to fight coronavirus. He also came under fire this month for urging his Instagram followers to watch an interview with a controversial British conspiracy theorist who simultaneously claimed Covid-19 is \u201ca fake pandemic with no virus\u201d and links infections to 5G antenna installations. In announcing the byelection date, speaker of the House of Representatives Tony Smith has explained the 4 July date \u2013 the first weekend of the school holidays \u2013 was chosen to allow for sufficient sanitisation of polling booths at schools throughout the electorate before term three returns on 21 July. In normal circumstances, the Australian Electoral Commission advises that it is preferable not to have elections during school holidays. With the current challenges created by the coronavirus pandemic, the advice is different on this occasion. The AEC has undertaken extensive consultations, including with the New South Wales Department of Education, because a significant number of polling places are located at schools. As a result, the AEC has advised me that it is preferable to have a polling date where students and staff do not return to school on the very next Monday. This will then enable a thorough sanitising after the completion of voting and counting at polling booths at New South Wales schools. In some significant non-coronavirus news, the Eden-Monaro byelection is set to be held on 4 July. It comes as the Liberal Party preselected Fiona Kotvojs as their candidate, some weeks after Labor\u2019s announced Kristy McBain, the former Bega Valley mayor, as the opposition\u2019s candidate. The byelection was triggered when current Labor MP Mike Kelly announced his retirement from politics in April. Another important message for all South Australians: you will be able to go to a pub and order a drink without a meal from Monday. But you will need to drink it seated. South Australia is bringing forward its stage two restrictions easing phase by four days to 1 June, while also significantly increasing venue and attendance limit as part of the plan. From Monday, up to 80 patrons will be allowed at South Australian restaurants, cafes and pubs at any one time, provided they are split across 20 \u201cdiscrete rooms or areas\u201d of the venue. Cinemas, theatres, galleries, museums, beauty salons, and gyms will also be allowed to open from Monday. SA premier Steven Marshall said the greater easing of restrictions was possible because of the state\u2019s \u201cprinciples-based approach\u201d. In stage one the important number was 10 (people). For stage two, the important number is 20 ... 20 is the critical number here. Because we have this principles based approach, we can announce today venues will be able to go up to a maximum of 80 provided they can have 20 in discrete rooms or areas within their establishment. So a massive increase on what was originally envisaged for stage two. Marshall also announced up to 50 guests will be allowed to attend funerals from Monday. On that note, I will hand you over to Elias Visontay for the next few hours. The prime minister will address the national press club tomorrow, and I\u2019ll be back to cover that for you. Thank you for all the birthday wishes \u2013 they have been much appreciated by this Queenslander on this chilly Canberra day. Catch you tomorrow, and take care of you. WA health minister Roger Cook says there have been four new cases of Covid-19 diagnosed in the past 24 hours, all within the same family who flew in from Doha last week. They are from Victoria and will stay in quarantine in WA until they are recovered. That makes six active cases of Covid-19 in WA. Mark McGowan: I\u2019d like to thank everyone for their patience throughout this pandemic and I urge everyone who can travel to do just that. Now is the time to get out there and see Western Australia and support local businesses in the process. We know Western Australia is the best and most beautiful place on Earth. For now, we have it all to ourselves so let\u2019s make the most of it. So go out and wander around our great state. Local businesses and tourism operators have been through hell. They need our support more than anytime before. Mark McGowan: From Friday, travel around WA will be permitted everywhere except the areas bounded by the Commonwealth by security determination and remote Aboriginal communities. This means people will be free to travel to all regions except the Kimberley and the biosecurity zones from this Friday. We are working closely with the federal government on a way forward to remove the Commonwealth biosecurity areas from Friday, 5 June. Mark McGowan says he is pulling down the internal borders for WA \u2013 phase three is coming by the end of the week/the weekend \u2013 which means that travel within WA will be allowed. But the border with the east, will remain. On a travel \u201cbubble\u201d with New Zealand (these sorts of bubbles are considered the \u2018good\u2019 bubbles, as opposed to the \u2018Canberra bubble\u2019 which is for any issue the government doesn\u2019t want to talk about, and is therefore a bad bubble): In terms of [travel with] New Zealand, that offers prospect and hope for people on both sides of the ditch. It\u2019s a really important thing, that, if we can have, greater international movement, that is safe, we do that, the prime minister has flagged that, the New Zealand prime minister was part of the national cabinet, quite a historic step and precedent. As to the timing I will leave that to the AHPCC, they will look at when they think that is safe. On the state border issue, and the deputy chief medical officer, Professor Paul Kelly\u2019s comments that there is no medical reason to keep the borders closed, Greg Hunt says: The DCMO was reflecting the views of what\u2019s called the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee or the Medical Expert Panel. They have not made any recommendations as a matter of fact in terms of state borders, nor has the national cabinet. These are matters that are discussed through the national cabinet process and the medical expert panel. There have a been no commonwealth recommendations in favour. There have been no national cabinet recommendations in favour. And there has been no medical expert panels in favour of state border closures and indeed the national cabinet\u2019s three-step plan for recovery also included the progressive restriction, the progressive movement and lifting of state border restrictions. The Australian Council of Social Services also has some ideas on how the $60bn over-estimation for jobkeeper could be spent: \u2022 Immediately extending jobkeeper, jobseeker and Medicare to temporary migrants. \u2022 Continuing the new jobseeker payment of $560 per week until a social security system is put in place that keeps everyone out of poverty. Dr Ruth Vine, the new deputy chief medical officer for mental health, says there has been no \u201cdiscernible increase in suicides\u201d as part of the pandemic in Australia, but that it is something authorities are keeping a close eye on. One of the investments recently has been to improve the timeliness of data about suicide because there\u2019s a delay because it\u2019s determined by coroner. Our data is becoming more timely. To the best of my knowledge there\u2019s not been a discernible increase to suicides. That\u2019s not to say we shouldn\u2019t be constantly striving to lower that number but there\u2019s not been a discernible increase but I think it\u2019s something we need to continue to watch. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. Other international suicide helplines can be found at befrienders.org. Greg Hunt has announced an additional $20m for mental health funding. Josh Frydenberg says he won\u2019t be appearing at the Senate Covid committee, because his invitation is \u201cjust a Labor political stunt\u201d adding that many Labor ministers did not attend Senate committees, including Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd. But it\u2019s not just Labor which wants government ministers to face their Senate colleagues for questioning. My Collingwood drought will be broken. Obviously, this is the best news you will hear all week. Tony Burke is also pushing the fund the arts and entertainment workers case: On ABC radio today finance minister Mathias Cormann made the ridiculous and insulting claim that arts and entertainment workers were missing out on jobkeeper because they \u201ccan\u2019t demonstrate that they\u2019ve had relevant falls in their revenue\u201d. Earth to the minister: the arts and entertainment industry has been shut down. These workers watched their incomes evaporate and job opportunities disappear as gigs were cancelled, shows were scrapped, galleries were closed down and productions were halted in the early days of this crisis. They\u2019re not missing out because they can\u2019t demonstrate a drop in revenue. They\u2019re missing out because the government designed jobkeeper in a way that deliberately excludes them. A huge number of people in the arts and entertainment sector work gig to gig, as freelancers or as casuals on short-term contracts \u2013 so they miss out on the wage subsidy. And it isn\u2019t just the artists themselves who have missed out. It\u2019s the worker holds the spotlight; who operates the camera; who builds the set; who cleans the venue. These are all workers who rely on the arts and entertainment sector and who also worked gig to gig. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg can fix this with the stroke of a pen. But even now, after admitting they\u2019re spending $60bn less on supporting Australian workers through this crisis than they said they would, the government is still doing nothing for this sector. This was the hypothetical Michael Sukkar wasn\u2019t happy to be reminded of. Greg Hunt will join deputy chief medical officer Dr Ruth Vine for an update at 1.30pm. Michael Sukkar is getting a little cranky with Tom Connell, as the Sky host hits the assistance treasurer with his previous claim that if the jobkeeper program was helping less people, there would be room to expand it. Sukkar says he is on the program and can be asked questions directly, rather than be hit with \u201cold transcripts\u201d. That is because the hypothetical Sukkar floated previously, which was jobkeeper helping just three million workers, has actually proved reality. But the government doesn\u2019t want to expand the program and from all indications is planning on just not borrowing that $60bn which was to go to jobkeeper, but is not needed. So Sukkar is now walking back his previous hypothetical, by drawing new lines. Footy is *almost* back, but as AAP reports, it\u2019ll take some time before there are crowds: The New South Wales and Queensland governments are open to working with the NRL on a return to crowds in July, but say it might be too soon to consider the plan. ARL commission chair Peter V\u2019landys has indicated he would like to have some capped crowds back for matches by the start of July. Under the plan, some members would be able to attend games, while still observing social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic. If possible, it would make rugby league one of the few sports in the world to be operating with spectators. But the push for fans might not be easy. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has warned the return of crowds is not part of any plan the government is looking at. \u201cWe\u2019re not in that space yet,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s up to organisations to consider their options but certainly we\u2019re not in that space yet.\u201d Sarah Hanson-Young has called a round table today with representatives from the arts and entertainment industry to address the lack of economic support during the pandemic: The arts and entertainment sector was the first to be hit by Covid-19 and despite a quarter of all workers losing their jobs the government has until now refused to help. Now, there is no excuse. The government should fix their $60bn bungle by funding an industry specific package for the arts and creative sector, before even more jobs are lost. I\u2019ve convened an emergency meeting today of representatives of the arts sector because it\u2019s clear the government won\u2019t act unless they are made to. It was disappointing to hear the finance minister this morning on ABC radio showing such ignorance towards the sector and a lack of understanding of how the industry works. We need better support for the arts and entertainment industry if we are to rebuild both tourism and hospitality as well. Either government ministers don\u2019t grasp the impacts, or they are wilfully ignoring the desperation of hundreds of thousands of Australians who have lost their jobs and livelihoods. Either way it\u2019s not good enough. And now with $60bn leftover not helping these workers would be cruel and mean spirited. The government\u2019s badly targeted jobkeeper program locks many workers from the arts out because of the nature of their short-term contract and gig-to-gig employment. The restrictions mean the industry will be the last sector to be back up and running. The looming September deadline for jobseeker and jobkeeper payments makes the situation even worse. AAP has the latest on Australia\u2019s export situation: Australia\u2019s exports and imports both pared down in April, preliminary figures for the month from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed on Monday. Exports of goods and services fell $4bn or 12% from March\u2019s record high to $31.44bn. The decrease was led by a $1.7bn decrease in exports of non-monetary gold following significant trade last month. While overall mineral exports remained strong there were small decreases in commodities including iron ore, coal, gas and petroleum. Imports of goods and services fell 5% from the previous month to $23.12bn. This was mainly due to decreases in imports of petroleum, aircraft, non-monetary gold, and road vehicles. April saw imports from China continue to recover from decreases observed earlier in 2020. Imports of laptop computers from China remained strong during the month, in line with increased demand during the lockdown period. There were also increases in imports of commodities associated with the detection and prevention of Covid-19, including testing kits and personal protective equipment. The final April monthly estimates will be published on 4 June. New Zealand has recorded no new cases, again, which is a great result. Also: The first round of the public hearings for the royal commission into national natural disaster arrangements have begun in Canberra via video link. This week the focus is on climate, and the first witness, the Bureau of Meteorology\u2019s head of climate modelling Dr Karl Braganza, delivered a powerpoint presentation filled with many disturbing graphs about Australia\u2019s worsening bushfire conditions. The start of the fire season has been pushed back three months from November to August in Victoria and even July in parts of south-east Queensland and New South Wales. Climate change is exacerbating underlying weather events, causing even more extreme temperatures and drier conditions. Droughts are getting much hotter. Braganza says the 2019-2020 fires were not a \u201cone off event\u201d: Really since the Canberra 2003 fires every jurisdiction in Australia have seen some really significant fire events that have challenged what we do to respond to them and have really challenged what we through fire weather looked like preceding this period. The frequency of these events, if we look at the historical record, seems to be increasing. These large fire events when you look back over the 19th and 20th century were not as frequent as they were this century. The royal commission has received more than 1,700 submissions. So far it has received more than 16,000 documents on discovery, amounting to about 200,000 pages and 159 requests to produce documents \u2013 including many from state and territory governments \u2013 have been acknowledged but documents have not yet been produced. The royal commission is still planning to produce its final report and recommendations in August. Which, as was reinforced today, is when the fire season begins. Jim Chalmers also says to \u2018watch this space\u2019 (essentially) on the Queensland border closures. Annastacia Palaszczuk said September was looking more likely for a border reopening but that the decision would be reviewed at the end of each month. Chief medical officer Dr Jeannette Young said don\u2019t expect any reopening ahead of July. Chalmers says people keep missing a key point: Well one of the things that\u2019s been missed in all of this, is that the premier has said that the border closures are under constant review. And that means, that if the medical advice changes, or circumstances change or there is, you know, an extra level of confidence that we can contain the virus, even with the borders open, then obviously she will consider all of that. All around Australia, premiers are making the best decisions they can about very complex, consequential matters based on the advice they have all received. That is what premier Palaszczuk is doing, she is being supported in that by a number of the mayors around Queensland. I think all she has done there is she has been careful in managing the expectations of the public, at the same time, she is pointing out the matter is under constant review, so I am sure if she can open the borders earlier, she will take that on board. Jim Chalmers is holding his press conference in his Queensland electorate \u2013 he says the prime minister\u2019s speech to the press club tomorrow is a chance to \u2018reset\u2019 the jobkeeper scheme and include workers who have been missed. Stephen Jones will be holding a doorstop at 1.25pm to talk about the ATO revelations that more than 50% of the applicants for the early super release, are under 35 \u2013 more than 33% are under 30. That means quite a lot of young workers would have drained their accounts and will be starting from scratch. There is another withdrawal allowed in the next financial year. Gladys Berejiklian is being a little bit more quiet about it than Victoria is, but NSW is also encouraging people to keep working from home, if they are able, to ensure the public transport network is not overwhelmed. Dan Andrews has just straight-up said he wants people to keep working from home, if possible, to cut down on mass movement. Berejiklian, who is attempting to walk a \u2018it\u2019s time to reopen while not spreading a highly contagious virus to where there is another shutdown\u2019 tightrope is putting her trust in people to make that decision themselves. Well, I think where we stand on that point is where we have stood on this point for a number of weeks now. We are confident that workplaces are taking very informed decisions. We give our best advice and workplaces are responding. And I think where possible people are still working from home, and I anecdotally know that many businesses are considering some staff coming back and some working from home on a rostered basis. That has been going on. But I am very pleased that the system hasn\u2019t been overwhelmed to date, that people are listening, making informed decisions, and that is the way we would like it to continue. And as the weeks progressed and we keep on top of the data and see what the increased activity does on the number of cases, we will be able to provide further updates. Gladys o\u2019clock has been moved from 8am to 11am and my whole world has been rocked. Gladys Berejiklian says there were three new cases diagnosed in the 24 hours to 8pm last night. Chief medical officer Dr Kerry Chant says NSW will be changing the way it reports its test numbers: Previously, we have been reporting people tested, and into the future, because we are actually asking for people to come forward repeatedly, as the premier indicated, repeatedly throughout the year ahead, we are now moving to report the number of tests. We won\u2019t be reporting test numbers once someone becomes positive, because we wanted to reflect those people that are being tested to confirm Covid. So those details will be changed on our website, and that will mean that our testing numbers actually are increased. This is in line with the national reporting requirements. Non-Covid, but about to become very relevant: the Eden-Monaro byelection campaign is officially on, with the Liberals selecting Fiona Kotvojs to run against Labor\u2019s Kristy McBain. It\u2019s going to be a messy fight. As it revs up, this op-ed Kotvojs wrote for the Fin last year has popped back up \u2013 along with her dismissal of the impacts of climate change. Apparently it is impossible to deal with health impacts and climate change at the same time, in Kotvojs\u2019s world. We are told that climate change will lead to countries such as Tuvalu, Kiribati and Tokelau drowning under a rising ocean. But the reality is that research consistently shows that the land area in these countries has increased over the past 40 years. This is to be expected since these islands largely comprise coral and shell debris eroded from the surrounding reef, which is thrown onshore by waves and moved inland during storm surge events and by wind. Provided the rate of coral growth continues to balance sea level rise, these islands will continue to grow. Despite the evidence, many people continue to propagate the position that these islands will drown. The myth that cyclones are increasing due to climate change continues to be perpetuated despite the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) stating that there is no evidence for this claim. These myths have created unwarranted fear and adversely affected national investment decisions. The real threats to the long-term viability of these low-lying Pacific islands include increased urbanisation and health issues. Joel Fitzgibbon has spent the last couple of days backing himself in over his China comments (he accused the Coalition of \u201cdemonising\u201d China, which is a lot further than what Labor as a whole has been saying) and dodging calls from David Littleproud to quit or be sacked. Speaking to ABC radio this morning, Fitzgibbon said he was making headlines because he was catching the National party out at failing its constituents: Michael McCormack and the agriculture minister David Littleproud are making these comments because they have been found out. They\u2019re taking calls from farmers \u2013 I suspect the same farmers and farm groups I\u2019m hearing from \u2013 who are asking them what are they doing to defend their interests, to make sure they have a business in China, and to ensure that they can continue not only to earn a livelihood from themselves but to employ people. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m getting under the skin of government ministers. They have been found wanting. Of course they consider that agriculture their natural constituency, and of course their natural constituency is very angry that it\u2019s allowed this situation to occur in the first place, and to progress. They need to be able to pick up the phone to Beijing and fix these problems. ... Even the most conservative commentators, those closest to Scott Morrison, admit and concede that there\u2019s been some pretty intemperate language used by first Malcolm Turnbull then Scott Morrison, people like George Christiansen and Andrew Hastie. They\u2019ve all been at it, demonising China, which happens to be our biggest export customer. Now we don\u2019t need to in any way, be less than absolutely robust in defence of our national interest, but it\u2019s also absolutely in our national interest that we maintain good working relationships with China and our other customers. And sadly, this government hasn\u2019t maintained a good working relationship indeed in this time of crisis. our ministers are unable to get their counterparts in China to even pick up the phone. When you\u2019re unable to get them to pick up a phone you know we\u2019ve got a problem. Some students in NSW couldn\u2019t wait to get through the gates this morning as public schools returned to full-time learning. Sydney\u2019s main public transport terminals have been relatively quiet this morning, despite fears that buses and trains would struggle to ensure social distancing as students return to school full-time today. Kamen, a professional opera singer, who was navigating the trains from Kings Cross to Newtown with his young son, Xander, said he was \u201cnot thrilled\u201d about having to take public transport again. \u201cI don\u2019t think that anything has changed in terms of safety. It\u2019s not like the disease has been cured,\u201d Kamen said, offering hand sanitiser to Xander. \u201cThe research on the whole disease is so new. They are coming out with new research about symptoms and repercussions. I feel like the government shifted from \u2018we have to protect our vulnerable\u2019 to \u2018we have to protect the economy\u2019 overnight.\u201d Xander, on the other hand, said he felt quite safe. \u201cI\u2019m good at social distancing,\u201d he said. Rebecca, 20, who was making the journey from Wollongong to her workplace in Glebe for the first time in months, said while there were only three people in her usually packed train carriage this morning, \u201cgive it a few weeks and it will be back to normal\u201d. Rebecca\u2019s workplace has introduced flexible start times to allow employees to avoid peak times, but she said \u201cit\u2019s hard to say [how safe I feel on public transport] at the moment\u201d. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been any hand sanitiser provided at the stations I\u2019ve been at like they said there would. I just try to keep my distance.\u201d One platform worker at Sydney\u2019s Central Station told Guardian Australia that while the platforms have been unusually quiet, they have seen a spike in the number of travellers at outer-suburb stations travelling into the city. Labor\u2019s shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, by contrast, sounded a lot more chirpy when speaking to ABC radio this morning: It\u2019s not probably the worst stuff-up in our history; it\u2019s factually, objectively, the biggest blunder that any government\u2019s made in any budget at any point in the history of this commonwealth. It\u2019s a massive error that\u2019s been made here. What it goes to is that the jobkeeper program is a good idea but it\u2019s been really badly implemented, been badly communicated and now it\u2019s been badly budgeted for as well. That has consequences for real people and real communities. Hundreds of thousands of Australian workers have been excluded from jobkeeper payments on the basis that the program was full and now we are three million workers short. If a company makes someone redundant, then Josh Frydenberg tells Ray Hadley they have to explain, to the public, why they aren\u2019t keeping their staff members in a job. \u201cBusinesses right around the country, should be endeavouring to keep their staff on, if they are eligible under jobkeeper, then they would be paying those $1,500 payments directly to the staff member,\u201d Frydenberg, who sounds a little impatient at this stage, says. \u201cI can not see why a business would seek to make somebody redundant who was eligible under jobkeeper.\u201d The jobkeeper program was designed to keep people in a relationship with their employers, even if the business had to shutter during the lockdown. Which made a lot of people think they would be safe from redundancies, if their employer had signed up to the wage subsidy program. Actually, says Josh Frydenberg, you can be made redundant. Businesses who receive jobkeeper have to pass on the $1,500-a-fortnight payment to their staff. But if they make their staff redundant, they are the ones who have to inform the ATO of the change. We\u2019ve never said they can\u2019t make them [redundant] but they have to meet those [Fair Work] obligations to make them redundant. What their obligations are to the government, is if they receive the jobkeeper payment from the government, that they have made that payment to their staff member. That has always been the clear case. ... If they have received a jobkeeper payment from the government on behalf of their employees, they need to have paid those employees that $1,500-a-fortnight amount. ... If they have made people redundant, they are not entitled to get further payments under jobkeeper from the government.\u201d Josh Frydenberg points to the government just saving the $60bn, rather than extending it, in this interview with Ray Hadley. This is all borrowed money. And that means future generations, children and grandchildren of your listeners will have to pay it back and it will take years to pay back. We make no apologies for spending to support the economy during a crisis, but if a demand-driven program is supporting three and a half million people and costing $70bn, instead of $130bn, then that means less money we have to borrow, and it\u2019s just foolish for the Labour party to think otherwise. Josh Frydenberg is having a chat to Ray Hadley. The treasurer says the \u201cexplanation\u201d for the jobkeeper stuff up is \u201cvery clear\u201d. Now, it is not a stuff-up to have forecast for a bigger hole than what happened. A better than predicted health response is very good news. But to blame the form is ridiculous. The form mistakes reinforced the forecast, which is why it wasn\u2019t picked up as quickly as it may have should have been. But even that isn\u2019t the stuff-up. The stuff-up comes from the government having predicated the coming economic recovery on the figures, which have proven rubbery \u2013 and not telling people what they will be doing with the $60bn shortfall. This is absolutely worth keeping an eye on. If you are looking for international news, you will find it all here. Pauline Hanson is still pushing forward with her Queensland needs to open its borders legal case because the premier \u201cneeds to be held to account\u201d. Which is weird, because what I heard was \u2018there is an election coming up and I need ways to stay relevant and receive publicity\u2019, but there you go. NSW has recorded three new cases in that same period. Victoria has three. Queensland has recorded no new cases of Covid-19 in the last 24 hour. All state school students have returned to on-site learning from today. The Minerals Council has some ideas for the Morrison government on how to stimulate the economy. You will not be surprised to learn that it mostly contains suggestions on cutting down on regulations. Stephen Jones, Labor\u2019s spokesman on financial services, wants people to take a closer look at the superannuation withdrawal scheme. So far, $13.2bn has been withdrawn from retirement funds, which is about equal to the released jobkeeper and jobseeker payments combined The ATO has provided some new data: \u00b7 There is a 1,600% increase in hardship claims in the last month compared with the entire 2018 -19 financial year. \u00b7 More than 50% of applicants were 35 or under. \u00b7 More than 33% of applicants were 30 or under. \u00b7 Under the ATO\u2019s self-assessment automated approval system, nobody has been rejected for not being eligible. \u00b7 More than 50% of applicants for the scheme withdrew the maximum possible, suggesting where the maximum amount was not taken it is likely that they were only limited by not having $10,000 in their super account. Jones: It is alarming that the Liberal\u2019s robo-release early access super scheme has seen so many Australians resorting to accessing their retirement savings, instead of receiving timely Government support. With 450,000 people under 30 forced to draw down on their super, young people continue to bear the brunt of this crisis. Just something to keep in mind as we watch the government dig in over not including certain industries within jobkeeper, despite no longer needing the whole forecast $130bn. All of the economic forecasts for Australia, from the RBA to ratings agencies, have included a $130bn stimulus spend. If it suddenly becomes a $70bn or so stimulus spend, then that changes things \u2013 if the economy doesn\u2019t have that $60bn floating around it, then that makes a pretty huge difference to the economic recovery. In that it\u2019s worse. We have already heard calls from within the government \u2013 cough Jason Falinski, cough \u2013 who want the government to not borrow the funds. To save the budget bottom line. The next few months are going to have impacts we\u2019ll be feeling for years. But will the government be extending jobkeeper? Don\u2019t count on it. When it comes to jobkeeper, we\u2019ll be undertaking a review in the month of June, and we\u2019ll look at how it\u2019s been implemented, what\u2019s happening in various sectors. The tourism sector could be one sector in need of further support. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll look at in the context of the economic situation at the time. You\u2019ll continue to see our international borders closed for some time. It\u2019s estimated some 850,000 people will be back in work as a result of those 3 stages of restrictions being lifted. That\u2019s the way to get people back into a job. Josh Frydenberg says he takes responsibility for the bungle but also any fallout is the fault of Labor trying to score political points: Of course I take responsibility for the estimates variation. I\u2019m accountable in the House of Representatives for my department and for my portfolio. I continue to have great confidence in the work that\u2019s done by my wonderful department. You have to understand we\u2019re facing a once-in-a-century pandemic and the ability to forecast accurately the number of people that were taking up the jobkeeper program was inherently difficult and that is something that the Labor party knows full well, that it\u2019s obviously seeking to make a political point. Josh Frydenberg this morning was still explaining what happened with the $60bn jobkeeper bungle. He told the ABC: Two things happened, Treasury in the midst of the height of the pandemic, forecast that 6.5 million Australians would be covered by the jobkeeper program, at a cost of $130bn, but we had great success in flattening out the curve, and we went from having a rise in the number of daily cases to now having 35 days straight when the number of new cases has increased by less than 0.5%. That health miracle had a real economic benefit, hence the lower number of people to use the jobkeeper program. The second thing happened, when around 1,000 businesses of nearly 1m businesses that formally enrolled for jobkeeper, they incorrectly filled in a form, where they were supposed to be the number of eligible employees, they put the dollar amount they would be getting for the jobkeeper program. The jobkeeper issue is going to continue in this direction for quite some time. Also from AAP: Meanwhile, beauty salons in NSW will be able to open for business in one week as the state government further eases Covid-19 restrictions. \u201cA big day for women in our community, a big day for everybody in the community \u2013 beauty salons are open, tanning salons, nail salons, waxing salons \u2013 how good is this Sunday?,\u201d NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said. Beauty salons will be allowed to begin treatments from June 1 but strict new rules will apply. Before reopening, businesses will require a Covid-19 safe plan which includes removing books and magazines from waiting areas, stepping up hygiene protocols and keeping a record of attendance. No more than 10 clients will be allowed inside salons at any one time and four square metres of space must be allowed per person. It comes as NSW on Sunday recorded one new coronavirus case \u2013 a returned traveller from the United Kingdom \u2013 from more than 6,800 tests. NSW treasurer Dominic Perrottet on Sunday announced zoos, reptile parks and aquariums would also be reopening from June 1. Extra safety measures will be in place including enhanced cleaning and limited visitor numbers so that four square metres of space is allowed per person. The Berejiklian government also announced a $50m package to support art and cultural organisations during the Covid-19 pandemic. The funds will be delivered in two stages, with the first stage to support not-for-profit art and cultural organisations to hibernate temporarily, with the second stage to help them restart operations in the coming months. Schools are back to full time on-site learning in ACT, NSW and Queensland, so if you are getting kids to school today, have fun! AAP has this story on the NSW situation: Hundreds of extra security and marshalling officers are out in force across the Sydney transport network as students return to public schools full-time and more people go back to work. The extra staff will be monitoring social distancing of 1.5 metres and overcrowding as commuters try to get to their destinations on Monday. Under coronavirus prevention measures, Sydney buses can carry 12 people, train carriages can have 32 passengers and a single Manly ferry can transport 245 people. NSW transport minister Andrew Constance warned train stations could be temporarily closed if there\u2019s overcrowding. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 1.2 million kids on the move,\u201d he told Nine\u2019s Today Show on Monday. \u201cWe have got green dots everywhere on the transport network ... we just need everyone to be patient.\u201d Constance said if parents can drive their children to school they should and if people can work from home they shouldn\u2019t go to work, or avoid travelling at peak times if they do. Asked if public transport was safe, Constance said it was safe \u201cif people stay 1.5 metres away from each other\u201d. The return to the classrooms full-time comes two months after COVID-19 restrictions forced around 800,000 public school children to study remotely. Some independent and Catholic schools will also return full-time on Monday while others are working towards a 1 June return date. The US ambassador to Australia has tried to iron out a diplomatic wrinkle after Mike Pompeo appeared to imply sensitive information-sharing between the two countries may be at risk over Victorian participation in China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative. The ambassador, Arthur Culvahouse Jr, said in a statement issued late yesterday that he wanted to \u201cset the record straight\u201d after seeing the headlines that arose after the secretary of state\u2019s interview on Sunday morning. Culvahouse said the US had \u201cabsolute confidence in the Australian government\u2019s ability to protect the security of its telecommunications networks and those of its Five Eyes partners\u201d and it commended Australia\u2019s leadership on the issue of 5G network security. Insisting Pompeo had been answering questions about a hypothetical, the ambassador said the notion that Australia would pursue initiatives risking the integrity of networks was \u201ca very remote hypothetical\u201d. The diplomatic clean-up stems from an interview Pompeo gave to Sky News Australia\u2019s self-styled Outsiders program early yesterday (notwithstanding the fact the US secretary of state would arguably fit the very definition of an insider). When asked about the Victorian state government\u2019s participation in Xi Jinping\u2019s signature infrastructure scheme, Pompeo urged the citizens of Australia to scrutinise any proposals \u201cincredibly closely\u201d, saying while the US would continue to work with \u201cgreat partners like Australia\u201d, his country \u201cwill not take any risk to our telecommunications infrastructure, any risk to the national security elements of what we need to do with our Five Eyes partners\u201d: I don\u2019t know the nature of those projects precisely, but to the extent they have an adverse impact on our ability to protect telecommunications from our private citizens, or security networks for our defence and intelligence communities, we will simply disconnect, we will simply separate. We\u2019re going to preserve trust in networks for important information. We hope our friends and partners and allies across the world, especially our Five Eyes partners like Australia, will do the same. (Unfortunately the interviewer, Rowan Dean, did not follow up with a question to check the likelihood of the US \u201csimply disconnecting\u201d with Australia as Dean had to move on to his next question, which began with: \u201cPresident Donald Trump \u2013 I love his tweets, they\u2019re brilliant, great sense of humour ... \u201d) Pompeo\u2019s comments raised eyebrows in Canberra because the Australian government has already blocked the Chinese-owned Huawei and ZTE from Australia\u2019s 5G network in response to security advice \u2013 a decision, made in 2018 and backed by the US, that Beijing still cites as a source on ongoing diplomatic tension, as Amy reported earlier this year. The comments also raised questions in Victoria, given the state government\u2019s agreement to explore areas of cooperation with China over infrastructure investment is in its early stages and no particular projects have been locked in. A Victorian government spokesperson said yesterday the state would not agree to telecommunications projects under the Belt and Road Initiative \u2013 and noted telecommunications regulation was a federal responsibility. For his part, Scott Morrison told reporters at a press conference yesterday the federal government had never supported Victoria\u2019s BRI decision, and it was \u201cthe usual practice for states to respect and recognise the role of the federal government in setting foreign policy\u201d. Josh Frydenberg turned up on ABC News Breakfast this morning. He was asked if he would accept the Covid select Senate committee invitation, as requested by the non-government MPs, and appear for a special hearing into the $60bn jobkeeper screw-up. Frydenberg doesn\u2019t look overly impressed. \u201cYou know this is just a political stunt from the Labor party,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they were last in government, they accepted a convention which is House of Representative ministers do not appear in front of Senate committees ... Julia Gillard, Greg Combet, Peter Garrett and Kevin Rudd did not appear before Senate committees, so this is again, just a Labor stunt.\u201d Oh, and there will be no \u201cwholesales changes\u201d to the jobkeeper program, even though the \u201cline\u201d the government drew was under a different forecast model, which, thanks to the successful health campaign, has not proved to be reality. Public school students in several states and territories are returning to face-to-face teaching today. In NSW and Queensland, students of all ages are returning to the classroom full time. Tasmanian kindergarten to year 6 students, along with year 11 and 12, will also resume learning at school on Monday, as will students in years 3, 4 and 10 in the ACT. Only four new cases of Covid-19 were confirmed nationwide on Sunday, AAP reports, as the Victoria and NSW governments announced further easing of restrictions introduced in March to curb the spread of the disease. This included the news Victorians will be allowed gatherings of up to 20 people at home and outdoors from 1 June, along with overnight stays in hotels and campgrounds. People in NSW will be able to get back into beauty salons, including tanning studios and nail parlours, if the businesses roll out Covid-19 safety plans. The NSW government also announced a $50m package to support art and cultural organisations to be delivered in two stages, with the first stage to support not-for-profit art and cultural organisations to hibernate temporarily and the second stage to help them restart operations in the coming months.

If the NBA were to restart the season, they would want to limit the number of people involved. The ideal spot would be a controlled, centralized environment in order to lower the risk of outside infection. As the NBA\u2019s announcement notes, Disney World would provide its own housing accommodation for players and staff in the form of hotels, as well as basketball courts that could handle both practices and official games.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/24/michael-jordan-was-years-ahead-of-his-game-the-last-dance-showed-that-he-still-is\">Michael Jordan was years ahead of his game.

For starters, it isn\u2019t yet known whether the league could make up all of the regular season games that have yet to be played. Even if all goes to plan, we could end up with a shortened season.

You can\u2019t pull someone aside and mention your favorite bill, but you still get face time with the candidates and that\u2019s ultimately the attraction of in-person events.</p> <p>\u201cSo I think a lot of the draw is still there.\u201d</p> <p>According to a set of fundraising invitations for Biden\u2019s campaign, obtained by the Guardian, upcoming fundraisers featuring him or high-profile surrogates still include the fundraising levels one would expect for physical high-dollar gatherings.</p> <p>A Biden campaign event featuring the presumptive Democratic party nominee himself and moderated by the Sacramento mayor, Darrell Steinberg, and former California treasurer Phil Angelides starts out at the guest level of $500 and goes all the way up to a co-chair level at $41,100. A virtual reception on 27 May featuring the former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg starts out at $1,000 to be an \u201cadvocate\u201d, and goes up to $50,000 to be a co-chair.</p> <p>Events are still spotted with celebrities too. A \u201cRock out on a night in with Joe Biden\u201d virtual fundraising event on 28 May includes performances by Sheryl Crow, Rufus Wainwright, David Crosby and Joe Walsh. Donations for that event start at $250 and go all the way to $100,000.</p> <p>The events are lucrative. Hillary Clinton is scheduled to headline at least two events between mid-May and June for Biden and the Democratic National Committee. The first event on Tuesday <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/20/hillary-clinton-biden-fundraising-272060\">raised</a> $2m.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just the Biden campaign and Democrats, though, or even just presidential candidates.

The hefty price tags of what can be tens of thousands of dollars that donors are charged for glorified Zoom meet-ups, or even one-on-one video chats with the candidate himself or his powerful surrogates. \ufeff\u201cYou don\u2019t get to go drink wine and eat cheap cheese, but the campaigns are still able to provide access to the candidate,\u201d said Democratic strategist Connor Farrell, a veteran Democratic fundraising consultant. \u201cThe campaigns are still able to provide access to the candidate in a different format. You can\u2019t pull someone aside and mention your favorite bill, but you still get face time with the candidates and that\u2019s ultimately the attraction of in-person events. \u201cSo I think a lot of the draw is still there.\u201d According to a set of fundraising invitations for Biden\u2019s campaign, obtained by the Guardian, upcoming fundraisers featuring him or high-profile surrogates still include the fundraising levels one would expect for physical high-dollar gatherings. A Biden campaign event featuring the presumptive Democratic party nominee himself and moderated by the Sacramento mayor, Darrell Steinberg, and former California treasurer Phil Angelides starts out at the guest level of $500 and goes all the way up to a co-chair level at $41,100. A virtual reception on 27 May featuring the former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg starts out at $1,000 to be an \u201cadvocate\u201d, and goes up to $50,000 to be a co-chair. Events are still spotted with celebrities too. A \u201cRock out on a night in with Joe Biden\u201d virtual fundraising event on 28 May includes performances by Sheryl Crow, Rufus Wainwright, David Crosby and Joe Walsh. Donations for that event start at $250 and go all the way to $100,000. The events are lucrative. Hillary Clinton is scheduled to headline at least two events between mid-May and June for Biden and the Democratic National Committee. The first event on Tuesday raised $2m. It\u2019s not just the Biden campaign and Democrats, though, or even just presidential candidates. In Iowa, an invitation for a fundraiser for the Republican senator Joni Ernst on 3 June has fundraising levels ranging from $500 to $5,000. The invitation, reported by Politico, is not contingent on being in person or virtual. \u201cIf it is not possible to gather in person for this event, we will host a virtual meeting and plan an in-person gathering at a later date,\u201d the invitation read. A fundraising invite for a 14 May event for the New Hampshire Republican congressional candidate Matt Mowers featuring the former New Jersey governor Chris Christie starts at $250 for the \u201cindividual\u201d level and goes all the way to $1,000 for the chair level. \u201cA web link for this exclusive video conference will be emailed prior to the event,\u201d the invitation read.",

Ben Phi, the managing director of class action firm Phi Finney McDonald, said the move was \u201ccompletely to be expected from a government with a strong and improving track record of cronyism\u201d. \u201cThe Morrison government has used a public health crisis to secure emergency powers, which they are now using to serve the interests of their big business mates,\u201d he said.

Frydenberg made the change using regulations under emergency powers granted by parliament to deal with the coronavirus emergency that will last for six months. They change the existing requirement that a director needs to act reasonably to avoid liability for misleading the market to a new test where they will have to have acted with \u201cknowledge, recklessness or negligence\u201d to be in breach. Varghese said the change was not necessary because existing rules already had exemptions for when information was uncertain. \u201cThe risk is that this change allows companies to hide bad news that has nothing to do with Covid-19,\u201d he said. \u201cThere should be no green light for company directors to hide information from the people who actually own a company.\u201d Phi said responsible companies had responded to the coronavirus crisis by withdrawing their profit guidance \u2013 a move that in some cases prompted their share prices to plunge. \u201cNone of those price falls have resulted in class actions,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are the consequence of a company complying with its disclosure obligations rather than breaching them.\u201d Frydenberg\u2019s move, announced in a seven-paragraph press release issued at about 4.45pm on Monday, caught class action lawyers by surprise. It followed the treasurer\u2019s decision on Friday to force litigation funders to hold financial services licenses \u2013 something opposed by the corporate regulator. The attorney general, Christian Porter, has also announced a parliamentary inquiry into class actions and litigation funders. Company directors and industry groups have been campaigning fiercely against class actions since late last year. The business peak body, Ai Group, has raised concerns about both shareholder class actions and ones mounted by workers under the Fair Work Act, with chief executive Innes Willox claiming in October that claims in the previous financial year totalled more than $10bn. In December, the Australian Institute of Company Directors complained that it was too hard for directors to defend their decisions in class action cases because no proof of \u201cintention, recklessness or negligence\u201d was required. \u201cThe heightened level of uncertainty around companies\u2019 future prospects as a result of the crisis also exposes companies to the threat of opportunistic class actions for allegedly falling foul of their continuous disclosure obligations if their forecasts are found to be inaccurate,\u201d Frydenberg said on Monday. \u201cIn response, companies may hold back from making forecasts of future earnings or other forward-looking estimates, limiting the amount of information available to investors during this period. \u201cThe changes announced today will make it harder to bring such actions against companies and officers\u2019 during the coronavirus crisis and while allowing the market to continue to stay informed and function effectively.\u201d Guardian Australia is not aware of any coronavirus-related shareholder class actions that have been lodged in Australia since the crisis began. However, Qantas staff have mulled a class action against the airline for allegedly failing to protect them against Covid-19.",

Weston general hospital in Weston-super-Mare stopped taking admissions, including into its A&amp;E department, from 8am on Monday \u201cto maintain patient and staff safety\u201d. The decision was a \u201cclinically led\u201d one that had been taken at a time when the hospital had a high number of patients with coronavirus, according to a statement. The hospital provides clinical services to residents in north Somerset \u2013 a population of about 212,000 people. The hospital had experienced a \u201cspike\u201d in infections and was being closed to new patients so a deep clean could take place, according to John Penrose, the MP for Weston-super-Mare, who tweeted that he had spoken to local health chiefs. University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS foundation trust said the measure was precautionary and the situation would be kept under review. The trust said there were arrangements in place for new patients to access treatment and care \u201cin other appropriate healthcare settings in the area should they need it\u201d.

Cummings, the former Brexit guru, \u201cseems to have become the voice that whispers advice on how to act in the face of the devastating virus crisis\u201d, the paper said. \u201cAnd for the time being, at least, Johnson is not prepared to keep him two metres away - nor to maintain the safe political distance from his adviser that many of his Conservative fellow believers are now demanding.\u201d Le Monde confirmed the prime minister\u2019s \u201cpreferential treatment\u201d of Cummings was \u201cvery risky: with what credibility will his government emerge from this episode as it approaching a crucial new phase of the country\u2019s exit from lockdown?\u201d Continuing to defend his adviser \u201cexposes Johnson to considerable political damage\u201d, it said. In Germany, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said whether Johnson should fire his chief advisor had \u201csuperseded over all other coronavirus questions, bringing politics back to centre stage\u201d. Cummings is \u201cmore than a consultant\u201d, the paper said. \u201cHe is a symbolic figure whose loss would hit the prime minister and his agenda hard.\u201d In a dispatch published by several German papers including the Suddeutsche Zeitung, the dpa news agency said the government\u2019s credibility \u201ccould have been seriously damaged by the generous interpretation of the lockdown rules in Cummings\u2019 favour\u201d. Denmark\u2019s Politiken said Johnson had \u201cso far dodged all questions about specific critical issues\u201d, such as whether Cummings had indeed visited Barnard Castle while in self-isolation in Durham. \u201cThe question remains whether special rules apply to the prime minister\u2019s top adviser \u2013 rules that ordinary Britons cannot invoke,\u201d it said. The New York Times said Johnson had now \u201clatched himself\u201d to his chief adviser, underlining \u201chis deep reliance on Cummings, the architect of his election victory last year and the driving force behind his ambitious post-Brexit agenda. But it is unlikely to defuse the uproar over Cummings\u2019s actions, which critics say send a signal that Britain\u2019s leaders can ignore the rules they impose on others.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "After admitting to shredding his buttock muscles while gardening earlier this month, Brian May has revealed further details of an incident that led to a small heart attack and the discovery of three blocked arteries that left the Queen guitarist \u201cvery near death\u201d. In a series of posts on his Instagram account, the 72-year-old said that a week after he was sent home after sustaining the gardening injury, he was still in such agony that he \u201cwanted to jump at some points\u201d. He was readmitted to hospital for an MRI scan, which discovered a severely compressed sciatic nerve \u2013 the product, he concluded, of 50 years as a guitarist. \u201cThat\u2019s why I had this feeling that someone was putting a screwdriver in my back,\u201d he said. During the \u201cwhole saga of the painful backside\u201d, May said he experienced 40 minutes of chest pain and tightness that turned out to be a small heart attack. He was readmitted to hospital for an angiogram, which found three blocked arteries. May said he was pressured by some parties to have open-heart surgery, but took alternative advice to have three stents implanted. May said he was shocked by the discovery of the blocked arteries, considering himself to be generally healthy. \u201cEveryone says, \u2018You\u2019ve got great blood pressure, great heart rate\u2019, I keep fit on my bike, good diet, not too much fat.\u201d He suggested that everyone over the age of 60 should have an angiogram. \u201cWe\u2019ve all got to really look at ourselves as we get to the autumn years,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat seems to be a healthy heart may not be.\u201d May said he had come off painkillers for the leg pain caused by the sciatic compression, which was now \u201cliveable\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison warns that government support measures are only a temporary form of \u201cmedication\u201d for a sick economy and microeconomic reforms in skills development and industrial relations will be needed to spur growth. In an address to the National Press Club on Tuesday, Morrison will announce a push to add conditions to $1.5bn in federal funding given to the states for skills and outline a cooperative process with unions and business to identify productivity-boosting changes to industrial relations. The industrial relations minister, Christian Porter, has already set the scene by stating controversial union penalty legislation is on pause as the government now seeks union support to improve productivity without stoking a fierce WorkChoices-style backlash. In excerpts of the speech, seen by Guardian Australia, Morrison puts households and businesses expecting further taxpayer support and the states \u2013 who he accuses of dropping investment in skills \u2013 on notice. Morrison says Australia faces \u201carguably the most challenging environment this country has ever faced, outside of wartime\u201d with unemployment set to top 10%, trade down one third and foreign direct investment to drop by up to 40%. \u201cBut we should remember that these difficult times are not the product of economic failure, but a global health pandemic,\u201d he says. \u201cThe problem was not the economy.\u201d After the revelation the jobkeeper wage subsidy will cost $60bn less than forecast, Morrison says that government economic supports are now expected to cost $150bn over six months. In an ominous sign for the future of the $1,500 fortnightly jobkeeper wage subsidy and $550 coronavirus supplement on unemployment benefits, Morrison warns that demand stimulus can boost the economy \u201cin the short term\u201d. \u201cAnd that is why we have supported this as an emergency response,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it can only be temporary. At some point you\u2019ve got to get your economy out of ICU. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get it off the medication before it becomes too accustomed to it. We must enable our businesses to earn our way out of this crisis.\u201d In the speech, Morrison argues the government can assist businesses by providing affordable energy, markets to connect to, infrastructure; and changes to skills policy, the amount of regulation and \u201cthe amount and the efficiency of the taxes they must pay, in particular whether such taxes encourage them to invest and employ\u201d. Morrison outlines principles for the government\u2019s so-called \u201cjobmaker\u201d plan, including that Australia will be an \u201copen and sovereign trading economy\u201d, \u201ccare for country\u201d, \u201cbuild on our strengths\u201d, create opportunity and reward effort. Despite signals the government wants greater sovereign manufacturing capability, Morrison says this will be achieved by ensuring businesses are \u201chighly competitive\u201d and warns Australia \u201cwill not retreat into the downward spiral of protectionism\u201d. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Morrison makes an analogy between government debt and intergenerational care for the environment \u2013 arguing that in both spheres \u201cwe must not borrow from future generations what we cannot return to them\u201d. On skills, Morrison says the federal government would focus on \u201cthe complexity of a system that is clunky and unresponsive to skills demands\u201d; \u201cthe lack of clear information about what those skills needs are\u201d; and \u201ca funding system marred by inconsistencies and incoherence, with little accountability back to outcomes\u201d. The National Skills Commission, lead by Adam Boyton, will provide detailed labour market analysis, including an annual report each year setting out the skill needs of Australia, replacing the existing lists for apprenticeships and skilled migration. Morrison notes the commonwealth gives $1.5bn to states and territories for skills and workforce development, with \u201cno line of sight\u201d on how it is used, and merely aspirational targets with no consequences. He argues the agreement with the states has been \u201cineffective in maintaining levels of investment\u201d with all except Tasmania reducing funding to vocational education on a working-age-per-capita basis by 25% on average. Morrison proposes better linking government funding to the needs of business and better coordination of subsidies and loans \u201cbased on principles of return on investment, to make the most of the support that is being provided\u201d. Morrison calls for a reduction in \u201cdistortions\u201d in incentives \u2013 such as lower or higher rates of subsidy for vocational courses in some states \u2013 by achieving greater consistency across jurisdictions, and between the VET and higher education sectors. He also calls for more transparency and performance monitoring, citing the national hospital agreement as a model. \u201cIncorporating national efficient pricing for training and activity-based funding models would be a real step forward. \u201cThat is a system my government would be prepared to invest more in.\u201d In April 2019 a review of the sector by a former New Zealand skills minister, Steven Joyce, called for the National Skills Commission to achieve a \u201cnationally-consistent funding model based on a shared understanding of skills needs\u201d. In the 2019 budget, the Morrison government announced a $525m skills package \u2013 including measures to create 80,000 new apprenticeships \u2013 but it contained just $55m of new money and reallocated $463m from the Skilling Australians Fund.",

This is now happening in front of our eyes,\u201d Josep Borrell told a group of German diplomats on Monday, adding that the coronavirus pandemic could be seen as a turning point and that the \u201cpressure to choose sides is growing\u201d.</p> <p>In remarks that appear to confirm that the European Union will speed up a shift to a more independent and aggressive posture towards Beijing, he said the 27-nation bloc \u201cshould follow our own interests and values and avoid being instrumentalised by one or the other\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe need a more robust strategy for China, which also requires better relations with the rest of democratic Asia,\u201d he added.</p> <p>The EU has been reluctant to side with Donald Trump\u2019s confrontational stance towards China, but Beijing\u2019s assault on the independence of Hong Kong, its growing willingness to side with Europe\u2019s populists and its refusal to open its markets has led to a change of heart, according to analysts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/20/post-coronavirus-uk-alliances-stand-up-china-us\">Post-coronavirus, the UK must find some friends to stand up to China | Martin Kettle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition commissioner and a key figure in how Europe will handle China in the future, has recently noted what she describes as a lack of reciprocity. \u201cIn the part of west Norway in which I grew up, we were taught that if you invite a guest to dinner and they do not invite you back, you stop inviting them,\u201d she explained. She said Europe needed \u201cto be more assertive and confident about who we are\u201d.</p> <p>Borrell has previously admitted the EU has been naive about aspects of China, but said this was now coming to an end. In an article published this month in many European newspapers, he urged more collective discipline towards China.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f808ab5baeb3e285ed580dbf58e3e5940a8fb907\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f808ab5baeb3e285ed580dbf58e3e5940a8fb907/0_175_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Riot police detain an anti-government protester in Sheung Shui, a border town in Hong Kong\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Riot police detain an anti-government protester in Sheung Shui, Hong Kong.

Daily EU imports from China amount to \u20ac1bn (\u00a3895m), but economists say there are already signs that some trade is not returning.</p> <p>On issues ranging from supply chains to telecoms security, diversification has become the watchword. Borrell has spoken of his surprise at discovering that all of Europe\u2019s supplies of paracetamol derive from China. The German cabinet has already approved new laws to prevent foreign takeovers of medical companies. The French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, has said \u201csome companies are vulnerable, some technologies are fragile and could be bought by foreign competitors at a low cost.

      "bodyText": "The Asian century may have arrived marking the end of a US-led global system, the EU\u2019s foreign affairs chief has said amid a growing discussion in Europe on how to weave a path between China and the US. \u201cAnalysts have long talked about the end of an American-led system and the arrival of an Asian century. This is now happening in front of our eyes,\u201d Josep Borrell told a group of German diplomats on Monday, adding that the coronavirus pandemic could be seen as a turning point and that the \u201cpressure to choose sides is growing\u201d. In remarks that appear to confirm that the European Union will speed up a shift to a more independent and aggressive posture towards Beijing, he said the 27-nation bloc \u201cshould follow our own interests and values and avoid being instrumentalised by one or the other\u201d. \u201cWe need a more robust strategy for China, which also requires better relations with the rest of democratic Asia,\u201d he added. The EU has been reluctant to side with Donald Trump\u2019s confrontational stance towards China, but Beijing\u2019s assault on the independence of Hong Kong, its growing willingness to side with Europe\u2019s populists and its refusal to open its markets has led to a change of heart, according to analysts. Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition commissioner and a key figure in how Europe will handle China in the future, has recently noted what she describes as a lack of reciprocity. \u201cIn the part of west Norway in which I grew up, we were taught that if you invite a guest to dinner and they do not invite you back, you stop inviting them,\u201d she explained. She said Europe needed \u201cto be more assertive and confident about who we are\u201d. Borrell has previously admitted the EU has been naive about aspects of China, but said this was now coming to an end. In an article published this month in many European newspapers, he urged more collective discipline towards China. Already a raft of senior politicians in France and Germany are becoming more vocal in their criticism of China, seeing echoes of Russian efforts to divide the bloc through a mixture of disinformation or pandering to rightwing populists who ideologically should be anathema to Chinese communists. No one knows yet how far this \u201cnew realism\u201d will take the EU in altering its economic relationship to China. Daily EU imports from China amount to \u20ac1bn (\u00a3895m), but economists say there are already signs that some trade is not returning. On issues ranging from supply chains to telecoms security, diversification has become the watchword. Borrell has spoken of his surprise at discovering that all of Europe\u2019s supplies of paracetamol derive from China. The German cabinet has already approved new laws to prevent foreign takeovers of medical companies. The French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, has said \u201csome companies are vulnerable, some technologies are fragile and could be bought by foreign competitors at a low cost. I won\u2019t let it happen.\u201d Sweden\u2019s relations with China are close to breakdown. Andrew Small, an associate senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations thinktank, said Beijing had been able until recently to hide behind EU suspicions of Russia. He wrote: \u201cIt benefited from the contrast that many Europeans drew between China and Russia.

It did not join Russia in becoming part of Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit chorus and it avoided support for Russia over Ukraine.

      "bodyText": "When the Guardian/Observer and Mirror published fresh claims on Saturday night about Dominic Cummings potentially breaching lockdown rules, Downing Street refused to respond in detail and instead dismissed the outlets as politically motivated \u201ccampaigning newspapers\u201d. It is less clear whether No 10 holds the same dismissive view about the Conservative-supporting Daily Mail, which on Monday used a front-page editorial to demand Cummings is sacked and ran the story across 10 pages of furious coverage. Under the headline \u201cWhat planet are they on?\u201d, the newspaper\u2019s editorial said Cummings \u201cviolated the spirit and letter of the lockdown ... giving every selfish person a licence to play fast and loose with public health\u201d. Just months after enthusiastically cheering Boris Johnson to victory in the general election, the Mail directly attacked the prime minister for sticking by his chief aide: \u201cNeither man has displayed a scintilla of contrition for this breach of trust. Do they think we are fools? For the good of the government and the nation, Mr Cummings must resign. Or the prime minister must sack him. No ifs, no buts.\u201d In the process the newspaper set up a test of its power in the face of a government that has repeatedly made clear its disdain for traditional media outlets.

Macron\u2019s decision to single out the Puy du Fou for particular treatment \u2013 after weeks of pressure from De Villiers, according to French reports \u2013 has led to accusations of double standards, populism and favouritism. Critics said the decision jarred with a ban until September on all cultural and sporting events attracting more than 5,000 people, even those taking place outdoors, citing the cancellation of the Avignon theatre festival and other major annual artistic and musical gatherings. Many parks, gardens and beaches remain closed because of fears of the further spread of Covid-19 and the French government has refused repeated requests from Paris\u2019s Socialist mayor, Anne Hidalgo, to reopen parks and gardens to city-dwellers who spent the eight-week lockdown cooped up in apartments without terraces or balconies. Rapha\u00ebl Glucksmann, a writer, journalist and MEP for the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, accused Macron of acting like a prince: \u201cPity the Avignon festival director isn\u2019t a rightwing friend of His Majesty,\u201d he wrote. Aur\u00e9lie Filippetti, a former socialist culture minister, was also angered by the decision, describing it as handing De Villiers a \u201cmonstrous pass key\u201d and said the decision was \u201cshameful\u201d. Bastien Lachaud, of the hard-left La France Insoumise, tweeted: \u201cFor #Macron thousands of restaurant and hotel owners can wait, but not the Puy du Fou belonging to his friend Philippe de Villiers.\u201d Unlike the Paris region, which is still red on France\u2019s Covid-19 map, suggesting the virus is still actively circulating and hospitals are under pressure, the Vend\u00e9e is green. Maryline Martin, the owner of the Gu\u00e9delon medieval site, a popular tourist attraction in Burgundy where a 13th-century castle is being built from scratch, said the row was \u201cridiculous\u201d. \u201cI am part of the tourism ministry\u2019s commission and we\u2019ve all been talking about heading towards opening again. It\u2019s an economic decision not a political one,\u201d she said. \u201cLa Puy du Fou is in a green area and everyone knew it was going to be allowed to open along with certain ch\u00e2teaux and gardens, so I don\u2019t understand what the fuss is about or why the Puy du Fou needed to make such a song and dance about it.\u201d Martin said Gu\u00e9delon, which attracts more than 300,000 visitors a year, will open on 11 June. \u201cWe are adapting our site to take into account the necessary health measures. I suppose I could stay closed and let the state pay me and the staff, but that\u2019s not the way I think.\u201d Disneyland Paris and Parc Ast\u00e9rix, both in the red-flagged \u00cele de France departement, will remain closed until further notice. Both hope to open in July at the latest.",

In the four-minute <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_Kw0w_AlNo&amp;feature=emb_title\">Dad</a>, Michael Sheen\u2019s character recalls an eerie encounter on a country lane while his father is in hospital. In the more expansive <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TooP1tSvzFc&amp;feature=emb_title\">Mum</a>, Lynn Hunter\u2019s character remembers the feeling of life being upended when you are young, her father\u2019s struggle to feel settled on his farm and her bond with her first pony. The actors are superb; the words both entrancing and devastating.

Like Hines, Watkins grew up in Barnsley. The book\u2019s hero, Billy Casper, finds escape through aviculture; Watkins found it through ballet. \u201cI feel dance is really great at painting that picture, where someone goes from being restricted by their environment to opening up through an emotional, physical journey,\u201d he told the Guardian. A film version by director Ross MacGibbon, with Chester Hayes as Casper and puppetry design by Rachael Canning, has been made available by <a href=\"https://www.thespace.org/\">The Space</a> for free online until 18 June.</p> <h2>The Wedding</h2> <p>Amit Lahav\u2019s company, <a href=\"https://www.geckotheatre.com/\">Gecko</a>, make such visually stunning, almost hypnotic, physical theatre that some scenes from their shows can burrow into your brain and stay with you for years.

It\u2019s eight and a half minutes of pure joy and just as mischievously macabre as the original book. The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF7q37SfF4w\">sequel</a>, This Is Not My Hat, also staged on top of a wooden dresser and told with music by Jim Whitcher, is a kind of Grand Theft Aqua in which a tiddler has stolen a handsome green bowler from a much bigger fish who reclaims it while enjoying a snack. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-8y3a7gqGw\">We Found a Hat</a> completes a triumphant tabletop trilogy, with Nicholson giving a particularly expressive performance as two rod-puppet tortoises stumble across a stylish hat and things get a little bit cosmic. All three films will be online until 7 June. The Little Angel\u2019s presentation of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1b5hwVpvcg\">Toby Oli\u00e9\u2019s puppet version of the Ross Collins book What Does an Anteater Eat?</a> is online until 1 September.</p> <h2>Sea Wall</h2> <p>\u201cShe had us, both of us, absolutely round her finger\u2026\u201d From that first line, Andrew Scott will have you hooked in this half-hour monologue by Simon Stephens that captures truths about family life, art, nature and much else besides. Scott performed the play at the Bush in 2008 and it was a hot ticket when he reprised it at the Old Vic 10 years later. This version was shot in a single take in 2011. Directed by Stephens and Andrew Porter, it is free to watch on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j01kVmBoJW0\">YouTube</a> until 25 May and available to rent after that date.

Thompson steps in and out of his version of Hermann Hesse\u2019s fairytale Faldum, riffing with the young audience and spinning a handful of jazz LPs. I Wish I Was a Mountain embraces big questions about time and contentment. This is a short but profound show, directed by Lee Lyford, hatched by the Egg theatre\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theatreroyal.org.uk/take-part/artist-development/about/\">Incubator</a> development programme and cleverly designed by Anisha Fields. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/sep/24/i-wish-i-was-a-mountain-review-toby-thompson-hermann-hesse-the-egg-bath\">Read the full review</a>.</p> <h2>Hamilton</h2> <p>Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s phenomenal, Pulitzer prize-winning musical about the \u201c10-dollar founding father without a father\u201d was filmed in New York back in 2016 with the original Broadway cast. It was slated for a 2021 cinema release but has now been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/may/12/disney-fast-tracks-hamilton-film-for-july-lin-manuel-miranda\">fast-tracked for release</a> on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/mar/21/disney-plus-streaming\">Disney+ streaming service</a> on 3 July. It\u2019s directed by Thomas Kail, who staged the musical, and according to Miranda gives \u201ceveryone the best seat in the house\u201d for a show that has been one of the most wanted on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"346fd190f76cbd1b38022b160a33388a98945d73\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/346fd190f76cbd1b38022b160a33388a98945d73/0_153_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kika\u2019s Birthday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Delightful \u2026 Danyah Miller in Kika\u2019s Birthday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Other Richard/Richard Davenport</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Kika\u2019s Birthday</h2> <p>A kids\u2019 show that captures the magic of cookery, this tale of mice planning a birthday celebration under the nose of a watchful cat is delightfully told by Danyah Miller. The puppets are appealing in their ingenuity: not least the colander cat. This is a show to celebrate \u2013 and it\u2019s possibly the only time you\u2019ll be delighted to find a mouse peeping its nose out of a bag of flour. Available to watch from <a href=\"https://www.watfordpalacetheatre.co.uk/whats-on/digital/kikas-birthday/\">Watford Palace</a>, 15-29 May. Miller also has a <a href=\"http://www.wizardpresents.co.uk/project/birthdays/\">series of other events</a> online.</p> <h2>The Unknown Island</h2> <p>For her opening production as the Gate\u2019s artistic director, Ellen McDougall staged an intimate, hour-long adaptation of a Jos\u00e9 Saramago short story, which famously saw the cast sharing bread, olives and wine with the audience. You\u2019ll have to supply the snacks yourself but this is a great chance to experience the bewitching 2017 production. The Gate\u2019s staging of Suzy Storck by Magali Mougel, directed by Jean-Pierre Baro, is also available. <a href=\"https://www.gatetheatre.co.uk/from-our-archive/\">Both can be streamed until 30 June</a>.</p> <h2>Caretaker</h2> <p>The Royal Court, like all UK theatres, is closed due to the lockdown. But you can visit it virtually in this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/may/11/the-royal-court-caretaker-theatre-coronavirus-lockdown\">intriguing installation</a> by Hester Chillingworth. The stage is still set for EV Crowe\u2019s play Shoe Lady, as seen from Chillingworth\u2019s static camera in the balcony. Occasionally it is cloaked in darkness and occasionally we hear messages of hope. Principally, the installation becomes a space to savour the importance of theatregoing until the Court invites audiences back to sit on those comfy leather chairs again.</p> <h2>Spymonkey</h2> <p>The anarchic physical theatre and comedy company are unlocking <a href=\"https://www.spymonkey.co.uk/news.html\">their vault</a> of inventive, irreverent shows with many becoming available each Sunday to be streamed for free. Highlights include, from 31 May, The Complete Deaths, a dazzling procession of 75 death scenes from Shakespeare, and from 21 June, the Feydeau farce Every Last Trick.</p> <h2>So It Goes</h2> <p>How do we talk about bereavement? It can be hard to find the words, as encapsulated in this bittersweet, dialogue-free fringe hit by the theatre company On the Run. Hannah Moss uses a mixture of mime, doodling and scribbling \u2013 performing with David Ralfe \u2013 to express her relationship with her father, Mike, and her grief following his death. It\u2019s available to stream for a suggested donation of \u00a33 with 50% of all proceeds donated to Marie Curie Hospice Hampstead, which cared for Mike. <a href=\"https://bit.ly/soitgoesonline\">Online until 29 May</a>.</p> <h2>The Encounter</h2> <p>Complicit\u00e9\u2019s sonic adventure uses binaural technology to take you into the Amazonian jungle, into the mind of an American photographer, Loren McIntyre, and in and out of the life of creator and performer Simon McBurney. A recording from the Barbican is <a href=\"http://www.complicite.org/theencounteronline.php\">available for free</a> until 25 May. Don\u2019t forget your headphones!</p> <h2>Lyric theatre in Belfast</h2> <p>Belfast\u2019s Lyric had to cancel its co-production of 1984 with Bruiser theatre company but instead launched the initiative New Speak: Re-imagined, in which Northern Irish talents including Amadan Ensemble, Dominic Montague and Katie Richardson respond to the lockdown crisis.

A powerful piece of rhyme-packed storytelling for the over-eights, Boys Don\u2019t is delivered by four compelling performers and based on real-life experiences of the expectations placed on \u201clittle men\u201d throughout the generations before they even get to the playground. Presented by <a href=\"https://www.halfmoon.org.uk/\">Half Moon theatre</a>, it\u2019s a Papertale production in association with Apples and Snakes, staged at Brighton festival in 2018.</p> <h2>Funny Girl</h2> <p>Showtunes don\u2019t get much more defiant or rousing than Don\u2019t Rain on My Parade. Sheridan Smith wards off the clouds with a gritty rendition as Fanny Bryce in this production of the classic musical at Manchester\u2019s Palace theatre in 2017. It\u2019s one of the many productions available from <a href=\"https://www.digitaltheatre.com/consumer/production/funny-girl\">Digital Theatre</a>, whose offerings also include The Crucible starring Richard Armitage at the Old Vic in London, and Maxine Peake\u2019s Hamlet at the Royal Exchange in Manchester.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/398851333\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/398851333?app_id=122963\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>Fragments (Beckett by Brook)</h2> <p>Is there a more fitting playwright for our current moment of isolation, uncertainty and endurance than Beckett? In this production, filmed at the marvellously atmospheric Bouffes du Nord in Paris in 2015, Peter Brook directs five Beckett shorts with a cast of three (Jos Houben, Marcello Magni and Kathryn Hunter). The production comprises Rough for Theatre I, Rockaby, Neither, Come and Go and Act Without Words II. Feel the rising panic and despair in Rockaby as the solitary, wide-eyed Hunter recounts a descent through long, lonely days.</p> <h2>Palermo Palermo</h2> <p>Even by Pina Bausch\u2019s standards it\u2019s an arresting opening: a huge wall collapses on stage and across the rubble comes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/mar/04/julie-shanahan-on-dancing-in-her-50s-and-life-beyond-pina-bausch\">Julie Shanahan</a>, in high heels and a floral frock. After desperately commanding hugs from two suitors, she takes a seat and is pelted with rotten tomatoes. And so begins an epic patchwork of masochistic rituals, nightmares and games, blending the quotidian with the phenomenal, all inspired by the choreographer\u2019s trip to Sicily. A rare chance to watch one of Bausch\u2019s creations <a href=\"http://www.pinabausch.org/en/editions/film/palermo-palermo\">in full and for free online</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/210302903\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/210302903?app_id=122963\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>Smashed</h2> <p>At first sight they could be Pina Bausch\u2019s dancers: a procession of performers wearing smart suits and enigmatic smiles, gliding across a stage filled with apples. Bausch\u2019s company memorably balanced apples on their heads in Palermo Palermo, but as Smashed is created by those juggling supremos <a href=\"http://www.gandinijuggling.com/\">Gandini</a>, the fruit is mostly in motion here. Their Bausch homage has the same childlike games, adult fantasy and bruised humour of the German choreographer\u2019s work. Smashed is crisp, fresh and full of flavour. You may never look at an apple in the same way again \u2026</p> <h2>Oscar Wilde season</h2> <p>All four productions in <a href=\"http://www.classicspring.co.uk/about-us\">Classic Spring</a>\u2019s starry Oscar Wilde season in the West End can be watched on the online service <a href=\"https://www.marquee.tv/\">Marquee TV,</a> which is offering a 14-day free trial.

Alternately rousing and yearning, this is a gorgeous hymn to barflies, precious memories and the joys of being a ghost, told with a dash of Edgar Allan Poe and Thelonious Monk. It\u2019s a glorious get-together of a show, as warming as the whiskey handed out to the audience \u2013 but you\u2019ll have to pour your own.</p> <h2>Key Change</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.openclasp.org.uk/\">Open Clasp</a> is a women\u2019s theatre company aiming to \u201cchange the world, one play at a time\u201d.

Tennessee Williams\u2019 A Streetcar Named Desire, with Gillian Anderson as Blanche, filmed at the Young Vic in 2014, is on 21 May. The National\u2019s production of the political comedy This House by James Graham follows on 28 May.

The episodes, which will then be available on demand for three weeks, reunite the original cast of the production, Afia Abusham, Juliet Okotie and Sapphire Joy, who filmed themselves performing in their homes. Starts on 30 May at 11am. Mum and Dad This haunting pair of monologues by Gary Owen is presented by Cardiff\u2019s Sherman theatre. In the four-minute Dad, Michael Sheen\u2019s character recalls an eerie encounter on a country lane while his father is in hospital. In the more expansive Mum, Lynn Hunter\u2019s character remembers the feeling of life being upended when you are young, her father\u2019s struggle to feel settled on his farm and her bond with her first pony.

Like Hines, Watkins grew up in Barnsley. The book\u2019s hero, Billy Casper, finds escape through aviculture; Watkins found it through ballet. \u201cI feel dance is really great at painting that picture, where someone goes from being restricted by their environment to opening up through an emotional, physical journey,\u201d he told the Guardian. A film version by director Ross MacGibbon, with Chester Hayes as Casper and puppetry design by Rachael Canning, has been made available by The Space for free online until 18 June.

Their touring production, The Wedding, which explores bonds of all kinds and isolation within a community, is essential lockdown viewing, available from 27-31 May on YouTube. I Want My Hat Back trilogy The Little Angel theatre has presented charming versions of three Jon Klassen picture books, directed and performed by Ian Nicholson, with characterful puppets made by Sam Wilde. I Want My Hat Back finds an otherwise polite bear taking revenge on a bad bunny who has pinched his pointy red hat. It\u2019s eight and a half minutes of pure joy and just as mischievously macabre as the original book. The sequel, This Is Not My Hat, also staged on top of a wooden dresser and told with music by Jim Whitcher, is a kind of Grand Theft Aqua in which a tiddler has stolen a handsome green bowler from a much bigger fish who reclaims it while enjoying a snack. We Found a Hat completes a triumphant tabletop trilogy, with Nicholson giving a particularly expressive performance as two rod-puppet tortoises stumble across a stylish hat and things get a little bit cosmic. All three films will be online until 7 June. The Little Angel\u2019s presentation of Toby Oli\u00e9\u2019s puppet version of the Ross Collins book What Does an Anteater Eat? is online until 1 September. Sea Wall \u201cShe had us, both of us, absolutely round her finger\u2026\u201d From that first line, Andrew Scott will have you hooked in this half-hour monologue by Simon Stephens that captures truths about family life, art, nature and much else besides. Scott performed the play at the Bush in 2008 and it was a hot ticket when he reprised it at the Old Vic 10 years later. This version was shot in a single take in 2011. Directed by Stephens and Andrew Porter, it is free to watch on YouTube until 25 May and available to rent after that date. Brace yourself. I Wish I Was a Mountain With wonder, wit and sophisticated storytelling, performance poet Toby Thompson creates a beautiful show for over-sevens. Thompson steps in and out of his version of Hermann Hesse\u2019s fairytale Faldum, riffing with the young audience and spinning a handful of jazz LPs. I Wish I Was a Mountain embraces big questions about time and contentment. This is a short but profound show, directed by Lee Lyford, hatched by the Egg theatre\u2019s Incubator development programme and cleverly designed by Anisha Fields. Read the full review. Hamilton Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s phenomenal, Pulitzer prize-winning musical about the \u201c10-dollar founding father without a father\u201d was filmed in New York back in 2016 with the original Broadway cast. It was slated for a 2021 cinema release but has now been fast-tracked for release on the Disney+ streaming service on 3 July. It\u2019s directed by Thomas Kail, who staged the musical, and according to Miranda gives \u201ceveryone the best seat in the house\u201d for a show that has been one of the most wanted on both sides of the Atlantic. Kika\u2019s Birthday A kids\u2019 show that captures the magic of cookery, this tale of mice planning a birthday celebration under the nose of a watchful cat is delightfully told by Danyah Miller. The puppets are appealing in their ingenuity: not least the colander cat. This is a show to celebrate \u2013 and it\u2019s possibly the only time you\u2019ll be delighted to find a mouse peeping its nose out of a bag of flour. Available to watch from Watford Palace, 15-29 May. Miller also has a series of other events online. The Unknown Island For her opening production as the Gate\u2019s artistic director, Ellen McDougall staged an intimate, hour-long adaptation of a Jos\u00e9 Saramago short story, which famously saw the cast sharing bread, olives and wine with the audience. You\u2019ll have to supply the snacks yourself but this is a great chance to experience the bewitching 2017 production. The Gate\u2019s staging of Suzy Storck by Magali Mougel, directed by Jean-Pierre Baro, is also available. Both can be streamed until 30 June. Caretaker The Royal Court, like all UK theatres, is closed due to the lockdown. But you can visit it virtually in this intriguing installation by Hester Chillingworth. The stage is still set for EV Crowe\u2019s play Shoe Lady, as seen from Chillingworth\u2019s static camera in the balcony. Occasionally it is cloaked in darkness and occasionally we hear messages of hope. Principally, the installation becomes a space to savour the importance of theatregoing until the Court invites audiences back to sit on those comfy leather chairs again. Spymonkey The anarchic physical theatre and comedy company are unlocking their vault of inventive, irreverent shows with many becoming available each Sunday to be streamed for free. Highlights include, from 31 May, The Complete Deaths, a dazzling procession of 75 death scenes from Shakespeare, and from 21 June, the Feydeau farce Every Last Trick.

Mountview Live \u2013 Giles Terera Meets \u2026 This isn\u2019t live drama, but should be essential viewing for theatre lovers and students as the Olivier award-winning actor Giles Terera talks to top names from the industry. The hour-long conversations on YouTube include questions from Mountview Academy of Theatre students. Guests include the fabulous Noma Dumezweni, who is a Mountview honorary doctorate, Judi Dench and Lin-Manuel Miranda. Expect some nuanced questions for that last one: Terera is best known for his knockout performance as Aaron Burr in Hamilton. The Midnight Gang Here\u2019s one nurse you wouldn\u2019t clap for: equal parts Miss Trunchbull and Miss Hannigan, the monstrous Matron in The Midnight Gang wants the \u201clittle stinkers\u201d on her children\u2019s ward to pass out with fear. Played with swagger and wicked disdain by Jennie Dale, she is a brilliantly hissable villain in Chichester Festival theatre\u2019s funny, touching and spirited musical version of David Walliams\u2019 bestseller. It not only urges you to be kind while confined but also to beat boredom with the instruction: \u201cDo a bit of pretending and your dreams come true.\u201d Available for free until 29 May.

Written for Quick by Adam Brace, it\u2019s directed again by Michael Longhurst who says its \u201cprescient presentation of a then burgeoning method of digital communication is so entirely a part of our lives under lockdown; and its commentary on ageing and isolation resonate even more profoundly at this time.\u201d On YouTube until 27 May.

These moves are as arresting as any guitar riff, matching Smith\u2019s cantering repetition and a blizzard of trippy visuals from Charles Atlas. The second act celebrates Erik Satie and the third pays tribute to David Bowie. Schaub\u00fchne The Berlin powerhouse, run by Thomas Ostermeier, is streaming a selection of archive productions, many with English subtitles, and often for one night only.

Presented by Half Moon theatre, it\u2019s a Papertale production in association with Apples and Snakes, staged at Brighton festival in 2018.

The production comprises Rough for Theatre I, Rockaby, Neither, Come and Go and Act Without Words II. Feel the rising panic and despair in Rockaby as the solitary, wide-eyed Hunter recounts a descent through long, lonely days. Palermo Palermo Even by Pina Bausch\u2019s standards it\u2019s an arresting opening: a huge wall collapses on stage and across the rubble comes Julie Shanahan, in high heels and a floral frock. After desperately commanding hugs from two suitors, she takes a seat and is pelted with rotten tomatoes. And so begins an epic patchwork of masochistic rituals, nightmares and games, blending the quotidian with the phenomenal, all inspired by the choreographer\u2019s trip to Sicily. A rare chance to watch one of Bausch\u2019s creations in full and for free online. Smashed At first sight they could be Pina Bausch\u2019s dancers: a procession of performers wearing smart suits and enigmatic smiles, gliding across a stage filled with apples. Bausch\u2019s company memorably balanced apples on their heads in Palermo Palermo, but as Smashed is created by those juggling supremos Gandini, the fruit is mostly in motion here. Their Bausch homage has the same childlike games, adult fantasy and bruised humour of the German choreographer\u2019s work. Smashed is crisp, fresh and full of flavour. You may never look at an apple in the same way again \u2026 Oscar Wilde season All four productions in Classic Spring\u2019s starry Oscar Wilde season in the West End can be watched on the online service Marquee TV, which is offering a 14-day free trial.

Ghost Quartet If you missed its run at Soho\u2019s new Boulevard theatre, here\u2019s a chance to savour Dave Malloy\u2019s song cycle, filmed in New York in 2015. Alternately rousing and yearning, this is a gorgeous hymn to barflies, precious memories and the joys of being a ghost, told with a dash of Edgar Allan Poe and Thelonious Monk. It\u2019s a glorious get-together of a show, as warming as the whiskey handed out to the audience \u2013 but you\u2019ll have to pour your own. Key Change Open Clasp is a women\u2019s theatre company aiming to \u201cchange the world, one play at a time\u201d.

Girls Like That London\u2019s Unicorn theatre has a world-class reputation for theatre for young audiences and its production of Evan Placey\u2019s Girls Like That gripped the roomful of teenagers I watched it with in 2014. It\u2019s online in full and offers a raw account of adolescent anxiety, slut-shaming and self-belief. In-your-face theatre that stays in your mind.

No 10 confirmed that Cummings would give a statement and take questions on Monday but did not say when. The prime minister was due to hold a cabinet meeting on Monday to discuss the lifting of the lockdown but plans to ease restrictions, such as partially opening schools from 1 June, have been overshadowed by the affair. On Monday morning, one Tory MP, David Warburton, described how his father had died alone as a result of following the rules, and said Cummings\u2019s actions gave the impression of \u201cdouble standards\u201d. He told BBC Breakfast: \u201cPeople have made sacrifices, this is a difficult time, this is a time of national crisis. \u201cIn those sacrifices there really hasn\u2019t been the choice to use instinct. Instinct hasn\u2019t really been part of it. We\u2019ve been tasked with following regulations laid down by the government.\u201d Other Conservative MPs to speak out included Martin Vickers, the MP for Cleethorpes, who told Sky News Cummings should resign for having \u201cundermined the government\u2019s message\u201d, and Tim Loughton, a former minister, who told the BBC: \u201cHas the action of Dominic Cummings threatened to undermine the message of the government and its ability to carry on its work? I\u2019m afraid regretfully it has and that\u2019s got to be dealt with.\u201d Other Tory MPs appeared to be engaging in an effort by the party\u2019s whips to dampen down public anger by issuing nearly identical cut-and-paste messages asking constituents to \u201crest assured\u201d they are passing on concerns about Cummings to the \u201crelevant colleagues\u201d. Cummings has maintained a defiant position throughout, telling reporters outside his home over the weekend: \u201cWho cares about good looks? It\u2019s a question of doing the right thing.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s not about what you guys think.\u201d The prime minister\u2019s aide faces a possible police investigation under health laws over a claim that he breached self-isolation rules by allegedly visiting Barnard Castle on 12 April. Durham police have yet to respond to the complaints from the public but the Guardian understands the force is considering whether it needs to take any further action in relation to Cummings. However, Steve White, the acting police, crime and victims\u2019 commissioner for Durham, will on Monday ask the force to investigate all the claims about the prime minister\u2019s principal adviser\u2019s time in the Durham area during the coronavirus lockdown and establish the facts. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, was sent out to defend the adviser in the media on Monday morning, despite admitting he had not spoken to Cummings to find out the details of the trip. He said Johnson had been \u201ccategorically assured\u201d that Cummings and family had \u201cfollowed the guidance and \u2026 the law\u201d. \u201cIf you have been given that absolute assurance \u2026 it seems fair to support that person,\u201d he said. The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, has said in Johnson\u2019s position he would have sacked Cummings and has called for a Cabinet Office inquiry. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, added her voice to the criticism on Monday. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, she said: \u201cI fear, and I say this with a heavy heart, Boris Johnson is putting his political interest ahead of the public interest. \u201cAnd when trust in a public health message and public health advice is as important as it is right now the consequences of that could be serious. I hope that the prime minister will reflect further today and perhaps come to a different conclusion than the one he made yesterday.\u201d Some scientific advisers and Church of England bishops also expressed anger at Cummings\u2019s actions for undermining the lockdown. Three members of SPI-B, the Sage subcommittee providing advice from behavioural scientists to the government on how the public might respond to lockdown measures, reacted with disdain to Johnson\u2019s defence of his adviser. Martin Surl, Gloucestershire\u2019s independent police and crime commissioner, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that Cummings\u2019s actions made a \u201cmockery\u201d of police enforcement earlier in the lockdown. \u201cI think it makes it much harder for the police going forward \u2013 this will be quoted back at them time and time again when they try to enforce the new rules,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think more importantly it makes something of a mockery of the police action going back when the message was very, very clear: stay at home. \u201cThe police had to deliver a very harsh, very difficult message and now it appears people could act differently, so I think it does undermine the policing going back and their confidence and going forward it will be more difficult but they will cope, they always do.\u201d Tory MPs publicly criticising Dominic Cummings Steve Baker Simon Hoare Damian Collins Sir Roger Gale Peter Bone Caroline Nokes Craig Whittaker Julian Sturdy Robert Syms Paul Maynard James Gray Robert Goodwill Andrew Jones Tim Loughton David Warburton Robert Halfon Jason McCartney Martin Vickers Peter Aldous George Freeman John Stevenson",

      "bodyText": "The police and crime commissioner for Durham is to formally write to the chief constable of the force he oversees asking for an investigation into Dominic Cummings. Steve White, the acting police, crime and victims\u2019 commissioner for Durham, will on Monday ask the force to investigate all the claims about the prime minister\u2019s principal adviser\u2019s time in the Durham area during the coronavirus lockdown and establish the facts. Cummings, along with his wife and four-year-old son, travelled 260 miles from his London home to his parents\u2019 farm in Durham in late March. The couple say they feared they may be incapacitated by coronavirus and thus struggle to look after their child. Many view that as a breach of the lockdown rules to stay home and have called for Cummings to resign or be sacked as chief aide to Boris Johnson. The disclosures came out of a joint investigation by the Guardian and Daily Mirror that has rocked the government since details were first published last Friday. Durham police are understood to have received further information and complaints about Cummings\u2019s time in around Durham since the revelations on Friday. Officers are reviewing and examining that new information. A spokesman for Durham Constabulary said: \u201cWe can confirm that, over the last few days, Durham Constabulary has received further information and complaints from members of the public and we are reviewing and examining that information.\u201d The letter to Durham\u2019s chief constable, Jo Farrell, will ask her to look at all the claims about Cummings\u2019s time in Durham. That includes an alleged sighting of him in Barnard Castle, some distance away from his parents\u2019 home. The letter will say an inquiry is necessary to maintain public confidence in the force. White, in a statement on Saturday, backed the force\u2019s handling of the matter so far. Since the Guardian and Daily Mirror first reported the story, additional allegations have surfaced. Police and crime commissioners are responsible for holding the forces they oversee to account. Chief constables maintain operational independence. In a statement issued on Monday, White said the Durham force had so far handled the matter appropriately. He added: \u201cIt is clear, however, that there is a plethora of additional information circulating in the public domain which deserves appropriate examination. I have today written to the chief constable, asking her to establish the facts concerning any potential breach of the law or regulations in this matter at any juncture. \u201cIt is vital that the force can show it has the interests of the people of County Durham and Darlington at its heart, so that the model of policing by consent, independent of government but answerable to the law, is maintained. \u201cIt will be for the chief constable to determine the operational response to this request and I am confident that with the resources at its disposal, the force can show proportionality and fairness in what has become a major issue of public interest and trust.\u201d The sighting in Barnard Castle was 30 miles from the home of Cummings\u2019s parents. It was witnessed by a man who made a note of a number plate and the witness, retired chemistry teacher Robin Lees, has made a complaint to the police. He says he saw Cummings and his family on 12 April, walking in the town before getting into a car. At a Downing Street press conference dominated by questions about Cummings\u2019s movements during the lockdown, the prime minister did not dispute that his adviser had made a trip to the Tees Valley beauty spot. Police were unaware that Cummings had travelled to his parents\u2019 farm in Durham from his London home until his father informed them. Robert Cummings asked a friend to contact police because he wanted security advice after his son, suffering from Covid-19 symptoms, arrived in the north-east in late March. Months earlier he had got advice on security for his son from Durham police, but had mislaid the contact details. On 31 March, Robert Cummings contacted someone he knew had details of a senior officer in the Durham force. That senior officer arranged for special branch to contact Cummings\u2019s father. During that call the special branch officer gave advice on security, as well as on physical distancing. Cummings\u2019s father was spoken to again by police earlier this month after they became aware of claims, which are unsubstantiated, on social media and inquiries from a journalist about whether the his son had again been seen in the Durham area. Robert Cummings denied the claim, and said his son was not present at the family farm. Police accepted his word. In a statement issued on Saturday evening, Durham police said: \u201cOn Tuesday, March 31, our officers were made aware that Dominic Cummings had travelled from London to Durham and was present at an address in the city. \u201cAt the request of Mr Cummings\u2019 father, an officer made contact the following morning by telephone. \u201cDuring that conversation, Mr Cummings\u2019 father confirmed that his son had travelled with his family from London to the north-east and was self-isolating in part of the property.\u201d In a statement issued last Friday, Durham police said: \u201cIn line with national policing guidance, officers explained to the family the guidelines around self-isolation and reiterated the appropriate advice around essential travel.\u201d No further action was taken. Durham police have issued a relatively low number of fines for lockdown breaches, compared with other forces. If Durham police decide to investigate, they could use automatic number-plate recognition technology to search for sightings of any car associated with Cummings, which would help in establishing his movements in the Durham area, as well as securing CCTV footage.",

She was and always will be an inspiration to us all for the way she faced death head on, with humour and tonnes and tonnes of love.</p> <p>When the lockdown started we knew we would not be able to see Mum unless she was in her final hours. We knew we would lose most of those precious last days. Incredibly painful as that was my family would never put the hospice staff or patients at unnecessary risk. We all spent many hours feeling so sad and desperate about that but we took it on the chin. So did many of my friends, parents who had Covid-19 but continued not only looking after their children but in many cases working as well.</p> <p>To hear the drivel coming out of the cabinet and No 10 is embarrassing. Our family is grieving after having to say goodbye in the most unsatisfactory of circumstances. It is beyond an insult to families like mine that supposedly serious politicians should seek to justify this for even a second.

      "bodyText": "When the Guardian/Observer and Mirror published fresh claims on Saturday night about Dominic Cummings potentially breaching lockdown rules, Downing Street refused to respond in detail and instead dismissed the outlets as politically motivated \u201ccampaigning newspapers\u201d. It is less clear whether No 10 holds the same dismissive view about the Conservative-supporting Daily Mail, which on Monday used a front-page editorial to demand Cummings is sacked and ran the story across 10 pages of furious coverage. Under the headline \u201cWhat planet are they on?\u201d, the newspaper\u2019s editorial said Cummings \u201cviolated the spirit and letter of the lockdown ... giving every selfish person a licence to play fast and loose with public health\u201d. Just months after enthusiastically cheering Boris Johnson to victory in the general election, the Mail directly attacked the prime minister for sticking by his chief aide: \u201cNeither man has displayed a scintilla of contrition for this breach of trust. Do they think we are fools? For the good of the government and the nation, Mr Cummings must resign. Or the prime minister must sack him. No ifs, no buts.\u201d In the process the newspaper set up a test of its power in the face of a government that has repeatedly made clear its disdain for traditional media outlets. It also serves as a check on whether print newspaper front pages still hold sway in an era of declining circulations and whether the Mail has broken the old newspaper editor\u2019s mantra that you should never launch a campaign that you are likely to lose. The Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen has said people might be \u201csurprised\u201d by what Cummings has to say in his \u201cunprecedented\u201d public statement this afternoon. Many have judged Dominic Cummings without hearing his side of the story. That will change this afternoon and will be unprecedented. It\u2019s possible that people will be surprised. As reviews for Barnard Castle go, \u201cI drove 260 miles, broke a pandemic-enforced nationwide lockdown that I personally helped introduce, risked the health of my extended family, rocked the stability of my own career, and torpedoed the reputation of both myself and the actual prime minister of the United Kingdom just to go there and see the Silver Swan automaton\u201d takes some beating. I have never wanted to see a small Teesdale market town so much in my squalid little life. I cannot imagine the precious selection of keychains the gift shops there must have. I would risk it all for Barnard Castle. If you\u2019ve somehow missed all this (imagine I am gesturing weakly at Dominic Cummings\u2019s house, where a crowd of agitated neighbours, un-socially distanced TV journalists and \u2013 obviously, always \u2013 some sort of Led By Donkeys stunt van, are all assembled in waiting), then the headline news right now is: a joint investigation by the Guardian and the Daily Mirror found that Dominic Cummings, that Gollum-but-if-he-dressed-from-the-assorted-bags-in-the-backroom-of-a-charity-shop one from the government, broke lockdown in the hardest way possible by driving from London to Durham when his wife had coronavirus. Then \u2013 after a perfunctory WhatsApp-coordinated round of Tory ministers tweeting their \u201cit wasn\u2019t that bad, really\u201d defences of the senior adviser \u2013 a further claim: once in Durham, as coronavirus infections crested nationwide, Cummings zigged out on a nice little day trip to the Castle, then back to London, then allegedly back again to Durham, where an eyewitness says they saw him among some woodlands calling the bluebells there \u201clovely\u201d. Ladies and gentlemen, we got him? This is Jessica Murray, I\u2019m back on the blog for the rest of the day and will be covering Dominic Cummings\u2019 press conference at 4pm. Thanks to everyone who has been sending in messages with your comments and thoughts, I\u2019m doing my best to work through them all and get back to as many people as I can. Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser Dominic Cummings will make a public statement following calls for him to be sacked over allegations he breached coronavirus lockdown restrictions at 4pm. A spokesman for Durham Constabulary said: \u201cWe can confirm that, over the last few days, Durham Constabulary has received further information and complaints from members of the public and we are reviewing and examining that information.\u201d NHS England has announced 59 new deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 25,750. Of the 59 new deaths announced on Sunday: - 19 occurred on 24 May - 28 occurred on 23 May - five occurred on 22 May The remaining seven new deaths took place between 16-21 May. NHS England releases updated figures each day showing the dates of every coronavirus-related death in hospitals in England, often including previously uncounted deaths that took place several days or even weeks ago. This is because of the time it takes for deaths to be confirmed as testing positive for Covid-19, for post mortem examinations to be processed and for data from the tests to be validated. The figures published today by NHS England show 8 April continues to have the highest number for the most hospital deaths on a single day, with a current total of 891. Robert Largan, Conservative MP for High Peak, has called for Dominic Cummings to provide answers. In a Facebook post, he said: We can\u2019t have a position where it is one rule for the public and another for politicians. If all the reports about Dominic Cummings are true, then I believe his position is untenable and he should resign. I don\u2019t have all the facts and I don\u2019t want to rush to judgement based on incomplete information, especially when many allegations are being disputed. But we need proper answers and we need them quickly. In the meantime, I have made the government aware of the strength of feeling of local people. John Stevenson, the MP for Carlisle, said: Poundland has said a further 26 of its stores, which have been closed throughout the coronavirus outbreak, are throwing open their doors again. The discount retailer said trade will resume in the stores again this week after 51 shops reopened last week. Poundland said that while it had kept most of its stores open for essential shopping, about 100 were temporarily shut in March. The closed shops were largely where there was another Poundland nearby or where shopping centres found it difficult to remain open, it added. Hello everyone. I am back on the Guardian\u2019s live feed and covering while Jessica Murray takes a lunch break. Please get in touch to share your news tips and any other information. A lot of you have sent stories of how you have been surviving lockdown and following the rules amid difficult situations. I have had so many emails for this, and appreciate all the readers who got in touch. Unfortunately, I am afraid I cannot reply to you all but we\u2019ve now written this story up. Thanks for all the contributions. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Boris Johnson has seriously blown it, writes Guardian columnist Simon Jenkins. Usually he contrives himself to be his own worst enemy \u2013 now it seems to be Dominic Cummings, his chief adviser. In the affair of the Durham runner, a wise political strategist would have given simple advice. Prime Minister, just say sorry. Ahead of Dominic Cummings\u2019s public statement this afternoon, a number of people on Twitter are flagging the government\u2019s code of conduct for special advisers which states they must not take \u201cpublic part in political controversy\u201d. Point 14 states: Special advisers must not take public part in political controversy, through any form of statement whether in speeches or letters to the press, or in books, social media, articles or leaflets. They must observe discretion and express comment with moderation, avoiding personal attacks, and would not normally speak in public for their minister or the department. Nicola Sturgeon said many people would have been left \u201cangry and frustrated by stories you have heard\u201d, after Dominic Cummings, the PM\u2019s senior aide, travelled across the country during the lockdown. While she conceded people may be wondering \u201cwhy bother\u201d to follow the rules, the first minister told Scots: As far as I am concerned the restrictions and rules we put in place really matter. It is vital that all of us stick to the rules, and not just because people like me tell you to or ask you to. The reason we ask you to stick to these rules is because they help to protect you and your loved ones, they help us protect our National Health Service and they do help us to save lives. She said the public had \u201coverwhelmingly done the right thing\u201d in lockdown, with restrictions put in place more than two months ago now. Sturgeon said: \u201cI know many people, parents perhaps in particular, will have made very difficult decisions. \u201cGrandparents will not have seen new grandchildren, parents will have struggled with childcare, and no access to friends and family to support them, and many people have been denied the opportunity to say a final farewell to loved ones.\u201d But Sturgeon said after Thursday the advice would still be for people to \u201cstay at home as much as possible\u201d. And she said while people would be allowed to meet others outside, they should \u201cthink carefully, very carefully\u201d about the number of people they come into contact with. \u201cMany of the current lockdown rules will still be in place, and it will vital everybody sticks to those,\u201d the first minister said. Boris Johnson is facing a revolt from scores of his own backbenchers as they line up to condemn the prime minister and his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings. At least 15 Conservative backbenchers have called for Cummings to go, while several others have spoken out against his actions. A number of MPs, including the newly elected Elliot Colburn, Paul Holmes and Jonathan Gullis, have used the used the same wording in their responses, saying they have \u201cconveyed the strength of local feeling to relevant colleagues\u201d after being contacted by constituents. Conservative former minister Paul Maynard said he shared people\u2019s \u201cdismay\u201d at the PM\u2019s response, and was one of many MPs who insisted Cummings should quit or be sacked. It is a classic case of \u2018do as I say, not as I do\u2019 - and it is not as if he was unfamiliar with guidance he himself helped draw up. It seems to me to be utterly indefensible and his position wholly untenable. Veteran Conservative Sir Roger Gale told PA Media: \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed, I think it was an opportunity to put this to bed and I fear that now the story is simply going to run and run.\u201d The Somerton and Frome MP, David Warburton, said Cummings was \u201cdamaging the government and the country that he\u2019s supposed to be serving\u201d. Speaking on BBC Breakfast on Monday morning, he said his own father had died alone as a result of the coronavirus lockdown. People have made sacrifices, this is a difficult time, this is a time of national crisis. In those sacrifices there really hasn\u2019t been the choice to use instinct. Instinct hasn\u2019t really been part of it. We\u2019ve been tasked with following regulations laid down by the government. Tory grandee Lord Heseltine said it was \u201cvery difficult to believe there isn\u2019t a substance\u201d in the allegations about Cummings\u2019 movements. \u201cI think these unanswered questions are now on the agenda,\u201d he told the BBC, \u201cand I don\u2019t think that this anxiety about the government\u2019s position will end until we know the whole story.\u201d Former minister Steve Baker said if Cummings does not resign \u201cwe\u2019ll just keep burning through Boris\u2019s political capital at a rate we can ill afford in the midst of this crisis\u201d. Other critics include Peter Aldous, Peter Bone, Damian Collins, Caroline Nokes, Julian Sturdy, Robert Syms, Craig Whittaker, James Gray and Martin Vickers. Dominic Cummings will give a public statement this afternoon after allegations he breached coronavirus lockdown restrictions, Downing Street has confirmed. The BBC\u2019s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, reported that Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser will make a statement and take questions himself. The move comes as calls for Cummings to resign and explain his actions mount, following revelations he travelled 264 miles to his parents\u2019 estate in Durham while his wife was suffering coronavirus symptoms. Today\u2019s coronavirus figures from Scotland: A total of 2,273 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus, up by three from 2,270 on Sunday, Nicola Sturgeon said. The first minister said 15,156 people have tested positive for the virus in Scotland, up by 55 from 15,101 the day before. There are 1,269 people in hospital with confirmed or suspected Covid-19, a decrease of 60. Of these, 40 were in intensive care, a fall of four. The shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, has shared a letter he has sent to Priti Patel, asking a series of questions including whether guidance on travel restrictions had been updated for parents with coronavirus symptoms. He asked: If people are travelling in a car in the expectation that they may require childcare at some point, can you confirm that police will not be empowered to issue Fixed Penalty Notices to them? Can you make public details of any communications between the Durham Constabulary and government officials and/or ministers since Thursday 21 May? As you know, police officers have put themselves at extraordinary risk to keep people safe during this crisis, whilst also working with great skill to interpret and explain public health legislation. The confusion and misinformation caused by the government\u2019s response to these revelations appears to make this work even more difficult. Conservative MP Lee Anderson said if Dominic Cummings failed to self-isolate properly in Durham then \u201che should go\u201d but said he would not accept a \u201ctrial by the media\u201d. In a post on his Facebook page, the MP for Ashfield in Nottinghamshire wrote: I have received messages and emails about Dominic Cummings. I have lots of questions to be answered before I pass judgement or comment. I will not accept trial by media when a person\u2019s whole future is at stake. The reaction of the press outside his home and some online comments have quite frankly disgusted me. I have been on the receiving end from the media in the past and it has an awful impact on members of your family. I suspect there will be a few more twists to this story over the next few days and I reserve judgement until I have all the facts. We cannot have one rule for one and another rule for the rest of us. Cummings should have a chance to come back on this as it is clear that he travelled to another house to live with his family but it is not clear if he came into contact with other members of his family or been out and about as suggested. If its the latter then he should go. The shadow health secretary and Labour MP for Leicester South, Jonathan Ashworth, has described some of the emails he has received from constituents in response to the Dominic Cummings saga. In a series of tweets, he said: This isn\u2019t an orchestrated email lobbying exercise, these are not cut and paste messages from a campaign\u2019s website. Each email written with raw emotion \u2013 grandparents who haven\u2019t seen children, sons and daughter worried about elderly mums and dads. An ICU doctor writes \u2018the support of Dominic Cummings and his breaches of the Covid 19 advice sends a clear message to the public. Either that he is above the rest of us or that these guidelines are a waste of time. It also undermines all those members of the public that have adhered to the guidelines and not been allowed to see births or even say goodbye to a dying relative.\u2019 Ashworth goes on to say: \u201cFor test, trace and isolate to work and easing of lockdown to be safe we will have to isolate for 14 days if requested by a tracer. Does Boris Johnson expect that to happen while Cummings\u2019s behaviour is endorsed?\u201d He concludes by saying: \u201cBoris Johnson said in his letter he mailed to everyone paid for by taxpayer we must all stay at home. It really is one rule for him and his elite friends and another for rest of us.\u201d Bangladesh clothing manufacturers are threatening to halt production and deliveries to billionaire Philip Day\u2019s Edinburgh Woollen Mill group in a battle over alleged \u00a327m in unpaid bills. About 30 suppliers to Day\u2019s empire, which includes more than 1,000 outlets including Peacocks, Austin Reed and Jaeger, arranged a letter from the Bangladesh Garments and Manufacturing Association trade body which accuses Edinburgh Woollen Mill and its agents of taking \u201cundue advantage of the Covid-19 situation\u201d. They say Day\u2019s retail group and its agents demanded hefty discounts, cancelled orders or withheld payment for goods already shipped or manufactured for the company. The letter demands payment for goods already handed over to Edinburgh Woollen Mill\u2019s shipping agents by 29 May and payment by 5 June for orders that are already in production. It says any discount requested by the retailer \u201cbeyond permissible limits\u201d could lead to legal action. The letter seen by the Guardian says: The demand for the discounts will not only be financially catastrophic, but will also expose our members to various claims and liabilities from regulations, banks and other third parties, which will eventually legally implicate the buyers themselves. We will have no option but take the decision to place an embargo and blacklist the buyers and their agents who do not comply with our instructions, which will prevent them from conducting business with our members in the future either directly or indirectly. London\u2019s Southbank Centre is at risk of closing until at least April 2021 because of the financial pressure it faces as a result of the coronavirus crisis. The UK\u2019s largest arts and culture organisation has said it is facing a best-case scenario of a \u00a35.1m deficit for the 2020-21 financial year, despite furloughing the majority of its staff, and will need to make some employees redundant. The centre called for further government support, saying the forecast includes using up all its reserves, taking \u00a34m from the government\u2019s furlough scheme, and spending its \u00a319.2m annual grant from Arts Council England (ACE) \u201cto effectively mothball the buildings\u201d. The Southbank Centre is made up of the Royal Festival Hall, the Queen Elizabeth Hall, the Purcell Room and the Hayward Gallery and offers more than 3,500 events a year. It is also home to the National Poetry Library, the Arts Council Collection and eight orchestras including the London Philharmonic and the BBC Concert Orchestra. Its annual ACE grant represents 37% of its income and it has replaced declining public funding with income from ticket sales, bars, restaurants and other commercial activity, but the mandatory closure of the venues, bars and restaurants has led to the immediate loss of 60% of its income. It is calling on the government to extend the furlough scheme beyond October for the cultural sector, develop a \u201clarge-scale intervention\u201d to support the arts sector as it navigates the crisis, and support self-employed artists and musicians who do not qualify for current financial support schemes. The venue is already planning to cancel events from September to November and considering the option of broadcasting concerts from behind closed doors through autumn and next spring. Elaine Bedell, the chief executive of the Southbank Centre, said: It is with an incredibly heavy heart that we today share further details about the future of the Southbank Centre. We know we are not alone in this and stand with our friends, partners and colleagues \u2013 both here in the UK and abroad \u2013 during this time of unprecedented challenge [\u2026] However, this crisis has hit hard, and we join a number of other organisations and venues in sounding the alarm about the long-term health of UK arts and culture. The Southbank Centre\u2019s own history is traced directly to the 1951 Festival of Britain. Here, the post-war government recognised how vital arts and culture were to the health and well-being of a traumatised nation. Just as the South Bank was a focal point of social and economic recovery then, we hope that we\u2019ll emerge from this crisis to an even brighter future, throwing our doors wide open once more. A general hospital in Somerset has temporarily stopped accepting new patients in an attempt to stop the spread of Covid-19 on site. Weston General Hospital in Weston-super-Mare stopped taking new admissions, including into its A&amp;E department, from 8am on Monday \u201cto maintain patient and staff safety\u201d. The decision was a \u201cclinically led\u201d one that had been taken at a time when the hospital had a high number of patients with coronavirus, according to a statement. The hospital provides a range of clinical services to residents of the North Somerset area \u2013 a population of around 212,000 people. University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust said the measure is \u201cprecautionary\u201d and the situation will be kept under review. The trust said there are arrangements in place for new patients to access treatment and care \u201cin other appropriate healthcare settings in the area should they need it\u201d. Dr William Oldfield, medical director at the trust, said: As with any hospital, the number of patients with Covid-19 will frequently change as people are admitted and discharged. We currently have a high number of patients with Covid-19 in Weston General Hospital. Whilst the vast majority will have come into the hospital with Covid-19, as an extra precaution we have taken the proactive step to temporarily stop accepting new patients to maintain patient and staff safety. This is a clinically led decision and we are being supported by our system partners to ensure that new patients receive the care and treatment they need in the appropriate setting, and we are continuing to provide high-quality care to existing patients who are being treated in the hospital. We have a robust coronavirus testing programme in place for patients and staff to identify cases quickly, with appropriate measures taken by clinical teams as required. We will keep the situation under constant review. The police and crime commissioner for Durham is to formally write to the chief constable of the force he oversees asking for an investigation into Dominic Cummings, the Guardian has learned. Steve White, the acting police, crime and victims\u2019 commissioner for Durham, will on Monday ask the force to investigate all the claims about the prime minister\u2019s principal adviser\u2019s time in the Durham area during the coronavirus lockdown and establish the facts. Cummings, along with his wife and young child, travelled 260 miles from his London home to his parents\u2019 farm in Durham in late March. They say they feared they may be incapacitated by coronavirus and thus struggle to look after their young child. Many view that as a breach of the lockdown rules to stay home and have called for Cummings to resign or be sacked as chief aide to Boris Johnson. The letter to Durham\u2019s chief constable, Jo Farrell, will ask her to look at all the claims about Cummings\u2019s time in Durham. That includes an alleged sighting of him in Barnard Castle, some distance away from his parents\u2019 home. The letter will say an inquiry is necessary to maintain public confidence in the force. White, in a statement on Saturday, backed the force\u2019s handling of the matter so far. A mother and son have arrived outside Dominic Cummings\u2019s house carrying a sign that reads: \u201cAll animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others,\u201d a quote from George Orwell\u2019s Animal Farm. The pair, who gave their names as Michelle and Milo, live near to the prime minister\u2019s adviser. Michelle told reporters: Our street looked after each other, he\u2019s not above anybody. I think it\u2019s sad that none of his neighbours could possibly come and help him. We\u2019re all in this together. I think he has to go, and this is our way, on a bank holiday Monday of saying we\u2019re not happy. We weren\u2019t happy with Boris yesterday. Another Conservative MP has joined the calls for Dominic Cummings to resign, this time Peter Aldous, MP for Waveney in Suffolk. He said he was initially sympathetic towards Cummings\u2019s desire to protect his son, but having received many emails from constituents highlighting the sacrifices they have made, \u201cthe government should recognise what families have gone through and what people are thinking and saying. It is thus important that Dominic Cummings should now stand down.\u201d \u201cMoreover, questions remain unanswered as to whether Mr Cummings completely self-isolated whilst he was in County Durham,\u201d he added. Hello everyone, this is Jessica Murray taking over the blog for the rest of what is set to be another tumultuous day in UK politics, with Boris Johnson facing further criticism for defending Dominic Cummings, who himself is facing a possible police investigation over his alleged trip to Barnard Castle. Please do send over your thoughts, suggestions and story tips: Email: jessica.murray@theguardian.com Twitter: @journojess_ Hello everyone. I will be passing the live feed to my colleague Jessica Murray who will be bringing you the latest information on coronavirus. Please do continue to share any news tips or information with me today as I continue my reporting shift. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Between 5% and 6% of Britain\u2019s population had been infected with Covid-19 by the last third of April, according to a study from the University of St Andrews. The number is far lower than the 25% predicted by researchers from the University of Manchester who used local authority data to to calculate the R-value \u2013 the number of people infected by one person with Covid-19 \u2013 within each local authority area. The latest study found England had higher infection rates than Scotland and Wales and that in London more than 10% of the population may have been infected. Overall, infection rates were highest in urban regions and lowest in small towns and rural areas. Their estimates of the cumulative infection rate are based on the Covid-19 deaths reported by ONS and NRS by the first third of May. Further statistical analysis showed that the virus infection rates were higher in areas with high population density and levels of deprivation. Prof Kulu said: \u201cOur analysis shows that the cumulative infection rate may have been slightly smaller or larger, but very unlikely less than 3% or more than 12% unless our current knowledge on death rates from Covid-19 are serious biased. \u201cClearly, we are far from achieving the \u2018herd immunity\u2019 rapidly as some have hoped. The good news is that because the coronavirus is not widely spread, and the number of active cases has declined during the lockdown, its suppression and control is possible with various public health measures before the cure and vaccine become available.\u201d As Dominic Cummings has been criticised for flouting the lockdown rules, we want to hear from families who have been sticking by them during difficult times. Perhaps you haven\u2019t been able to see a sick loved one? Or say goodbye to someone close to you? Please share your stories with me: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Boris Johnson is facing sustained pressure to sack his key aide Dominic Cummings following allegations he breached coronavirus lockdown restrictions. The prime minister will discuss the easing of measures at a cabinet meeting on Monday, but the political storm over his chief adviser\u2019s trip looks set to overshadow any announcements. Cummings travelled to County Durham in March to self-isolate with his family \u2013 apparently because he feared that he and his wife would be left unable to care for their son \u2013 while official guidelines warned against long-distance journeys. Further reports also suggested he took a second trip to north-east England in April, having already returned to London following his recovery from Covid-19 \u2013 a disease that has led to the deaths of more than 45,000 people in the UK. Several Conservative backbenchers have joined calls from opposition parties for Cummings to quit or be sacked, amid warnings that his actions have \u201cundermined\u201d efforts to fight coronavirus. Prof Stephen Reicher, a member of the government\u2019s advisory group on behavioural science, told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain: \u201cIf you look at the research it shows the reason why people observed lockdown was not for themselves, it wasn\u2019t because they were personally at risk, they did it for the community, they did it because of a sense of \u2018we\u2019re all in this together\u2019.\u201d Full story here: Dozens of French-speaking Eurostar employees are supporting language students while being furloughed due to the collapse in demand for international travel. Workers normally carrying out roles as train drivers or in customer service, marketing, operations and finance are among those hosting online sessions for pupils during school closures. The scheme is aimed at improving students\u2019 confidence in French conversation and maintaining their skills while they study at home. The participants are from three schools close to Eurostar\u2019s north-east London depot and its London station, St Pancras International. David Dogue, a French teacher at Sir George Monoux College, Walthamstow, said: \u201cThis project with Eurostar has enabled my A-level students to develop their language skills in a rewarding way by joining conversations with native French speakers. \u201cThe opportunity to speak with someone from outside the school helps boost their confidence whilst they are dealing with the challenges of having to study from home.\u201d A petition has been launched calling for Dominic Cumings to reisgn. It went up yesterday evening and now has more than 200,000 signatures. Dr William Oldfield, medical director at University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS foundation trust, said: \u201cAs with any hospital, the number of patients with Covid-19 will frequently change as people are admitted and discharged. \u201cWe currently have a high number of patients with Covid-19 in Weston General hospital. Whilst the vast majority will have come into the hospital with Covid-19, as an extra precaution we have taken the proactive step to temporarily stop accepting new patients to maintain patient and staff safety. \u201cThis is a clinically led decision and we are being supported by our system partners to ensure that new patients receive the care and treatment they need in the appropriate setting, and we are continuing to provide high-quality care to existing patients who are being treated in the hospital. \u201cWe have a robust coronavirus testing programme in place for patients and staff to identify cases quickly, with appropriate measures taken by clinical teams as required. \u201cWe will keep the situation under constant review.\u201d A hospital in Somerset has temporarily stopped accepting new patients due to a \u201chigh number of patients with coronavirus in the hospital\u201d. Weston General hospital, in Weston-super-Mare, stopped accepting new admissions, including into its A&amp;E department, from 8am on Monday. The move is said to be a \u201cprecautionary measure\u201d. Church of England bishops have expressed unusually strong criticism of Boris Johnson over his defence of actions taken by his chief aide, Dominic Cummings. More than a dozen bishops questioned the integrity of the prime minister following his press conference on Sunday, in which he refused to acknowledge Cummings had breached lockdown rules when he travelled with his infected wife and their child to Durham, north-east England. Durham\u2019s former chief constable Mike Barton said Boris Johnson throwing his support behind Dominic Cummings had made enforcing the lockdown much harder. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Barton said: Policing the lockdown has probably been one of the toughest assignments ever given to the British police and they have risen to the challenge. But what the prime minister did yesterday has now made it exponentially tougher for all those people on the front line, those PCSOs [police community support officers] and cops on the front line, enforcing the lockdown. We are in the middle of a national emergency and people who make the rules cannot break the rules, otherwise we are going to have chaos. Sturgeon said that as lockdown measures begin to be eased, trust in public health advice was vital. She added: \u201cThe consequences are potentially so serious. \u201cAs we go into the next phases of dealing with this crisis, as we start to lift lockdown restrictions and rely less on the letter of the law and more on guidance and appeal to people\u2019s good judgment, then trust in the advice we are giving and the reasons why we are giving that advice is really important. \u201cIf they [the public] get any sense that it is one rule for them and another for people in positions of authority then that will become very difficult.\u201d Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said that prime minister Boris Johnson was putting his political interests ahead of the public interest by supporting Dominic Cummings. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Sturgeon said: I fear, and I say this with a heavy heart, Boris Johnson is putting his political interest ahead of the public interest. And when trust in a public health message and public health advice is as important as it is right now the consequences of that could be serious. I hope that the prime minister will reflect further today and perhaps come to a different conclusion than the one he made yesterday. Anger continues to build among the Tory rank and file, particularly those in the newly won seats in the north of England and Midlands. One MP in a \u201cRed Wall\u201d seat contacted the Guardian\u2019s northern editor, Helen Pidd, to say: \u201cI think [Dominic Cummings] should go. It\u2019s cut through. Massively. He\u2019s a liability.\u201d The MP said they had received more than 100 angry emails about Cummings, with the \u201cnon-lefties\u201d expressing the same sentiment as Monday\u2019s Daily Mail front page: \u201cWhat planet are they on?\u201d They said the Tory WhatsApp group, normally a hive of gossip, was almost entirely devoid of support for Johnson\u2019s defence of Cummings. Morning everyone. Thanks for following the Guardian\u2019s live feed today. Please do get in touch with me if you want to share any news tips or information. Look forward to reading your messages. Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Twitter: @sloumarsh Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Reader Chris Garside from London shared his own experience of lockdown and how the news about Dominic Cummings has felt for grieving families who followed the rules. My Mum passed away a few weeks ago after an incredibly brave last stand against brain cancer. She was and always will be an inspiration to us all for the way she faced death head on, with humour and tonnes and tonnes of love. When the lockdown started we knew we would not be able to see Mum unless she was in her final hours. We knew we would lose most of those precious last days. Incredibly painful as that was my family would never put the hospice staff or patients at unnecessary risk. We all spent many hours feeling so sad and desperate about that but we took it on the chin. So did many of my friends, parents who had Covid-19 but continued not only looking after their children but in many cases working as well. To hear the drivel coming out of the cabinet and No 10 is embarrassing. Our family is grieving after having to say goodbye in the most unsatisfactory of circumstances. It is beyond an insult to families like mine that supposedly serious politicians should seek to justify this for even a second. It is incredibly obvious what Cummings should be doing if he has an ounce of decency. Conservative MP David Warburton said his own father died alone as a result of the coronavirus lockdown, and that the Dominic Cummings story gives an impression of \u201cdouble standards\u201d. He told BBC Breakfast: People have made sacrifices, this is a difficult time, this is a time of national crisis. In those sacrifices there really hasn\u2019t been the choice to use instinct. Instinct hasn\u2019t really been part of it. We\u2019ve been tasked with following regulations laid down by the government. Gloucestershire\u2019s independent police and crime commissioner, Martin Surl, said Dominic Cummings\u2019s actions make a \u201cmockery\u201d of police enforcement earlier in the lockdown. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: I think it makes it much harder for the police going forward \u2013 this will be quoted back at them time and time again when they try to enforce the new rules. But I think more importantly it makes something of a mockery of the police action going back when the message was very, very clear: stay at home. The police had to deliver a very harsh, very difficult message and now it appears people could act differently, so I think it does undermine the policing going back and their confidence and going forward it will be more difficult but they will cope, they always do. Education secretary Gavin Williamson said Dominic Cummings should not resign \u201cbecause he has made it clear that he\u2019s broken no rules and he\u2019s broken no laws\u201d. The Cabinet minister sidestepped a question on whether Mr Cummings would have done the wrong thing if he had been a member of the public. He said: I don\u2019t have the details of all the various dates but the two dates that I do know very clearly is the June 1 when primary schools will start opening their schools and welcoming in pupils for the first time in over two months, and June 15 when secondary schools can start opening their doors and welcoming in years 10 and 12. Criticism has rained down on Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings from the nation\u2019s papers, some of it from unlikely quarters. While attacks from the Daily Mirror and the Guardian were to be expected, even the right-leaning Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph were among the critics, the Mail launching a withering assault on Cummings for flouting lockdown guidelines and on Johnson for his defence of his chief adviser. \u201cWhat planet are they on?\u201d the Mail screams on its front page, saying that is the question the nation is asking about the \u201cNo 10 svengali who flouted the PM\u2019s own strict lockdown rules\u201d, and about Mr Johnson \u201cbrazenly\u201d supporting him. A member of the government\u2019s advisory group on behavioural science has said the \u201cdebacle\u201d over Dominic Cummings has \u201cfatally undermined\u201d efforts to fight coronavirus. Prof Stephen Reicher told Good Morning Britain: If you look at the research it shows the reason why people observed lockdown was not for themselves, it wasn\u2019t because they were personally at risk, they did it for the community, they did it because of a sense of \u2018we\u2019re all in this together\u2019. If you give the impression there\u2019s one rule for them and one rule for us you fatally undermine that sense of \u2018we\u2019re all in this together\u2019 and you undermine adherence to the forms of behaviour which have got us through this crisis.

Overall, nearly 200,000 people received unemployment benefits last month, a 17% jump from the same period last year and a near 14% increase from the previous month, social security service numbers showed.

Edward Helmore reports that last month \u2013 according to the national health body \u2013 dumpster-diving rats were observed resorting to open warfare, cannibalism and eating their young in the wake of urban shutdowns. \u201cCommunity-wide closures have led to a decrease in food available to rodents, especially in dense commercial areas,\u201d the CDC said in recently updated rodent-control guidelines. \u201cSome jurisdictions have reported an increase in rodent activity as rodents search for new sources of food. Environmental health and rodent control programs may see an increase in service requests related to rodents and reports of unusual or aggressive rodent behavior.\u201d Hello, it\u2019s Frances Perraudin here again. I\u2019ll be taking over the live blog while Damien has a break. You can contact me with hints and tips on frances.perraudin@theguardian.com and on twitter @fperraudin. Big crowds turned out for the Memorial Day weekend in the US amid warnings from authorities about people disregarding the coronavirus social distancing rules and risking a resurgence of Covid-19 as the country braces to surpass more than 100,000 deaths. The US is on track to hit the grim milestone in the next few days, while Europe has recorded more than 169,000 dead, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University that almost certainly understates the toll. Worldwide, more than 5.4 million people have been infected and nearly 345,000 have died. Dr Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus taskforce, said she was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about scenes of people crowding together over the weekend. \u201cWe really want to be clear all the time that social distancing is absolutely critical. And if you can\u2019t social distance and you\u2019re outside, you must wear a mask,\u201d Birx said on ABC\u2019s This Week. The Spanish arm of the international charity M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res has ended its coronavirus operations in the country, writes Sam Jones, the Guardian\u2019s Madrid correspondent. For the past two months, MSF Spain has been running field hospitals and working to relieve some of the strains on the country\u2019s overstretched health system. On Monday, the NGO said it was winding up its activities as Spain\u2019s hospitals \u201chave passed the most critical point\u201d. But it warned that the hard-won gains against the virus could not be taken for granted and that systemic problems needed to be addressed. David Noguera, the head of MSF Spain, said: Everyone now appreciates what this epidemic means for the most vulnerable sectors of the population, such as older people in care homes. It would be unacceptable for our system not to be more prepared in order to avoid the repetition of the tragic situations and deaths we\u2019ve seen. Noguera pointed out that more than 19,000 people had died in Spanish care homes, adding: \u201cThe dignity of the most vulnerable people in our society need to be our common focus.\u201d The Netherlands reported 209 more confirmed cases of coronavirus on Monday, taking its cumulative total to 45,445, as officials said a second Dutch worker may have been infected by a mink. According to the latest update from the Dutch national institute for public health and the environment, eight more people have died from Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new virus, taking the country\u2019s total death toll from the outbreak to 5,830. It came as the agriculture minister said on Monday that another person had been infected while working on a mink farm. The case follows a reported infection last week on one of two farms near the southern city of Eindhoven, where the disease was discovered in April among mink that are bred for their valuable fur. \u201cA second case has become known where on one of the mink farms SARS-CoV-2 has been passed from a mink to a human,\u201d Carola Schouten said, according to AFP. \u201cThe case is similar to the previous one,\u201d she said in a letter to the Dutch parliament. The infection happened before it was known the mink were carrying the virus, meaning workers did not wear protective clothing at the time. Spain will lift its quarantine requirement for those entering the country from 1 July, the government has just confirmed, writes Sam Jones, the Guardian\u2019s Madrid correspondent. At the moment, travellers from overseas are required to undergo a 14-day self-isolation on arrival. On Saturday the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, said the country would reopen to tourists from July. The official death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in Sweden has topped 4,000, statistics published by its public health agency showed on Monday. The data published on the agency\u2019s website showed that deaths from Covid-19 had risen to 4,029, from 3,998 a day earlier, while the number of confirmed cases increased by 384 to 33,843. Unlike most other countries, Sweden has taken a soft-touch approach to fighting the virus, leaving most schools, shops and restaurants open and relying on voluntary measures focused on social distancing and good hygiene. Accumulated deaths in the pandemic in Sweden have been many times higher relative to the size of the population than in its Nordic neighbours, but still lower than in some hard-hit countries such as Spain and Britain that implemented strict lockdowns. On Sunday, people gathered in Stockholm to protest against their government\u2019s perceived inaction over the outbreak. Vietnam reported a new case of coronavirus on Monday, its second in a week, bringing its total number of cases to 325, with no deaths so far. The new case is a 20-year-old Vietnamese student who has recently returned to the country from France, the ministry of health was quoted as saying by the Xinhua news agency. She is being treated in Ho Chi Minh City. Vietnam has recorded no local transmission of the coronavirus for 39 consecutive days. The country\u2019s success in tackling the outbreak has been based on a fast, aggressive and comprehensive response. There are currently more than 15,400 people being monitored and quarantined. Newspapers in Brazil continue to rebel against President Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s response to Covid-19, writes Tom Phillips, the Guardian\u2019s Latin America correspondent. On Monday, with Brazil\u2019s official death toll at 22,666, Rio de Janeiro\u2019s O Dia newspaper led its coverage with this striking front page: Bolsonaro continues to cause outrage in Brazil by playing down the pandemic and flouting social distancing guidelines. On Saturday he was branded a \u201ckiller\u201d by opponents as he popped out for a Saturday night hotdog on the day a further 965 of his citizens were reported to have died. Foreign newspapers have also joined the criticism of Bolsonaro. On Monday the Telegraph in the UK branded Bolsonaro \u201cthe man who broke Brazil\u201d. Thirty-four more people in Iran have died from Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, the health ministry reports. But the lowest daily Covid-19 death toll in the country since March comes amid an apparently rise in new coronavirus cases. In his daily update, Kianoush Jahanpour, the health ministry spokesman, said 2,023 more Iranians had tested positive for the virus since yesterday, taking the total cumulative total number of cases in the country to 137,724. Daily new cases have been rising, on average, since 2 May, when the country recorded 802 new infections, but are still well short of a high of 3,186 reported on 30 March. The Covid-19 death toll in Iran is 7,451, while 107,713 have recovered, Jahanpour said. After months of working remotely while the continent has been frozen by coronavirus lockdowns, European Union leaders may meet face to face in the coming weeks to bargain over the next joint budget and a linked pandemic recovery fund. A senior EU diplomat told Reuters: The budget and recovery fund cannot be agreed without a physical summit. I haven\u2019t yet met anyone who would think it possible on a video conference According to Reuters, technical issues, problems with translation and the less personal nature of video calls have made it hard for EU leaders to replicate the atmosphere of their all-night summits, a hallmark of Brussels where they meet to haggle over joint policies. On Wednesday the European commission, the EU executive, will propose its blueprint for the 27-nation budget, known as the Multiannual Financial Framework and worth around \u20ac1tn, and the accompanying coronavirus recovery fund. France and Germany have joined in support of granting handouts worth \u20ac500bn through the new fund to kickstart economic growth. But the so-called \u201cfrugal four\u201d of Austria, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands are opposed, calling for aid to come in the form of repayable loans rather than free grants. A fortnight after the end of France\u2019s strict eight-week lockdown, parks and gardens in Paris remain closed to city-dwellers, many of whom spent the confinement cooped up in apartments with no outside space, writes Kim Willsher, in the French capital. While the city\u2019s mayor, Anne Hidalgo, continues her battle with the government to have the spaces opened \u2013 so far unsuccessfully \u2013 an unlikely hero has emerged from the night-time shadows. An anonymous lock-picker calling himself Jos\u00e9, who says he has a full-time and perfectly respectable day job, is spending his evenings cracking park padlocks. \u201cI\u2019m not a thief, I steal nothing \u2026,\u201d he said. \u201cBut everything is closed, it\u2019s worse than before the lockdown. I saw some children playing in the road in front of a locked-up park and it seemed so stupid. So I decided to open up a green corridor. I leave the gates open and people can do what they want.\u201d Jos\u00e9 says the smiles on childrens\u2019 faces when they discover their local park is open is worth the risk. If caught he risks five years in prison and a maximum \u20ac75,000 fine. Greece has taken another step towards normality today, reinstating ferry links with islands and allowing restaurants, cafes and bars to reopen, writes Helena Smith in Athens. The moves, designed to kick-start the country\u2019s tourist industry ahead of seasonal hotels reopening on 15 June, follow almost three months of enforced closure thanks to coronavirus. In central Athens cafes began filling up from early morning \u2013 although it wasn\u2019t quite business as usual. Waiters wore face coverings and, though not everywhere, hand sanitisers were visible on tables. Yachting industry activities also kicked off as the Greek government gradually opens up the sector in advance of seasonal hotels accepting guests in mid-June and international flights resuming to popular destinations on 1 July. In a nation so reliant on tourism \u2013 one in five Greeks work in the sector, which accounts for almost 25% of GDP \u2013 officials are desperate to capitalise on the country\u2019s successful handling of the pandemic and salvage what is left of the season. But reopening borders is also replete with risk. With less than 3,000 confirmed coronavirus cases to date and a death toll of 172, questions are mounting over the ability of rudimentary health services on popular islands to deal with any outbreak of the virus. So far Greek isles have remained remarkably coronavirus-free. Civil protection officials and personnel from the national public health organisation have been dispatched to remote isles such as Kimolos, Folegrandos and Sikinos to look at boosting medical infrastructure in advance of tourists arrivals. More than 110,900 people have so far tested positive for the coronavirus across Africa, according to the World Health Organization\u2019s office for the continent. More than 14 weeks after the virus was first detected on the continent, the 54 countries of Africa, which between them account for a population of about 1.4 billion people, have so far counted 44,500 recoveries and 3,300 deaths. On Friday, the WHO said it now seemed apparent that the coronavirus outbreak was \u201ctaking a different pathway\u201d in Africa, which has not seen the kind of catastrophe that had earlier been feared. Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO regional director for Africa, said: For now Covid-19 has made a soft landfall in Africa, and the continent has been spared the high numbers of deaths which have devastated other regions of the world. It is possible our youth dividend is paying off and leading to fewer deaths. But we must not be lulled into complacency as our health systems are fragile and are less able to cope with a sudden increase in cases. To hunker in a medieval castle while a pandemic rages outside sounds like a Black Death chronicle but Laura Jamieson and Michael Smith have rather enjoyed their lockdown, writes Rory Carroll, the Guardian\u2019s Dublin correspondent. The young couple have been the sole occupants of Ashford Castle, a five-star hotel with 83 rooms on the shores of Lough Corrib in county Mayo that is one of Ireland\u2019s premier tourist magnets. Jamieson, from Surrey, and Smith, from Perthshire in Scotland, usually live in the nearby village of Cross and commute to the castle for work but have spent the past two months living there while maintaining the buildings and 350-acre estate until tourists return. \u201cIt\u2019s like being in a TV reality show that\u2019s nobody watching,\u201d Smith told RTE. Duties include flushing 160 toilets, dusting chandeliers and fielding emails and phone calls. The working day often ends with a visit to the school of falconry to check on the owls and hawks. For date night they choose a bottle from the wine cellar to accompany a film at the 32-seat private cinema. The couple consider their quarantine there a once-in-a-lifetime adventure \u2013 a story of happy isolation in a big hotel that could be a Ladybird book reworking of Stephen King\u2019s The Shining. Ashford Castle was built in the 13th century, rebuilt in Victorian times and subsequently refurbished. US presidents, Barbra Streisand and Brad Pitt have stayed there. Jamieson and Smith are due to move back to their more modest digs before the castle reopens on 20 July. Afghanistan\u2019s health ministry has pledged to establish three more medical centres for Covid-19 patients in Kabul, as the capital experienced a record rise in infections and the number of confirmed cases nationwide passed 11,000, Akhtar Mohammad Makoii reports from Herat. Ferozuddin Feroz, the health minister, said in a meeting with his deputies on Monday that three more centres will be established in Kabul for Covid-19 patients. Last week the ministry said it had run out of hospital beds for treating patients with the disease in most parts of the country. \u201cThe hospitals which had empty beds until 10 days ago and we were sending patients to, are packed, with no more beds. We should launch more hospitals immediately,\u201d Wahid Majroh, deputy health minister said last week. The health ministry said it had tested 1,095 more suspected patients, of whom 591 were positive, taking the total number of confirmed infections to 11,173. The official death toll reached 219 after one more patient died overnight. There have been 1,097 recoveries. The ministry has pledged to increase the number of daily tests \u2013 it has tested 31,718 suspected patients since the outbreak began. Most of the new infections were reported in Kabul, where 390 cases came back positive out of 697 tests. Kabul is the country\u2019s worst-affected area in number of transmissions, with 4,141 confirmed cases and 29 deaths. The eastern province of Nangarhar and the western province of Herat, which have both recorded surges in the number of new infections in recent days, recorded 80 new cases combined. Herat is the country\u2019s worst-affected area for deaths, with 36. Sunday was the first day of Eid in Afghanistan and concerns are high as streets are crowded with people, despite the government-mandated lockdown, According to a Guardian tally, Afghanistan recorded 3,920 new cases in the seven days before Eid \u2013 a record high. Meanwhile, after recent violence, the country is experiencing a rare period of calm, with the Taliban and Afghan government announcing a three-day Eid ceasefire. Local media reported there were only two security incidents recorded on the first day of Eid. Ethnic minorities have been the hardest-hit by the coronavirus in the US, and now Latino workers are facing fresh difficulty, as they and their communities suffer discrimination after contracting coronavirus in meat processing plants and warehouses, writes Adam Gabbatt for the Guardian US. More than 10,000 meatpacking workers, many of them Latino, have contracted coronavirus in the US, according to the United Food and Commercial Workers union, and dozens have died. Latino advocates say workers are also experiencing racism due to fears they have contracted the virus in the workplace. \u201cWe\u2019ve received reports that some workers at a plant were turned away from grocery stores and not allowed in, because they were presumed to have the coronavirus because they worked at the local meatpacking plant,\u201d said Domingo Garcia, national president of the League of United Latin American Citizens (Lulac). \u201cWe\u2019ve also heard in Marshalltown [Iowa] people were being refused service because they thought they were positive for Covid-19 \u2013 just because they were Latino,\u201d Garcia added. Global cases pass 5.4m There are currently 5,424,718 confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The death toll stands at 345,296. Both figures are likely to be higher, due to differing test rates, definitions and deliberate underreporting. Germany enters recession in first quarter Falling consumer spending, capital investments and exports pushed the German economy into a recession in the first three months of the year, the national statistics office said this morning, as the virus continued to hurt the major economies. Capital investments slumped by 6.9%, private consumption by 3.2% and exports by 3.1% between January and March compared with the last three months of 2019. China says virus pushing US ties to brink of \u2018cold war\u2019 The Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, has said Washington seemed infected by a \u201cpolitical virus\u201d but that Beijing would nevertheless be open to an international effort to find the coronavirus source. \u201cSome political forces in the US are taking China-US relations hostage and pushing our two countries to the brink of a new cold war,\u201d Wang said. Speaking on Sunday, Robert O\u2019Brien, Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser, likened China\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak to the Soviet Union\u2019s cover-up of the meltdown at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in 1986. US bars travellers who have been in Brazil in last two weeks The White House has announced it is prohibiting foreigners from traveling to the US if they have been in Brazil in the last two weeks, two days after the South American nation became the world\u2019s second-worst affected country in terms of coronavirus cases. Brazil meanwhile registered 15,813 new cases and 653 new deaths in 24 hours, taking the total number of fatalities to 22,666, and cases to 363,211 confirmed cases, the health ministry said. Japan ends state of emergency The Japanese prime minister, Shinz\u014d Abe, has lifted the state of emergency imposed due to the coronavirus crisis. He said on Monday that the country had managed to get the spread of the virus under control in under two months. Social distancing curbs were loosened for most of the country on 14 May as new infections fell, but the government has kept Tokyo and four other prefectures under watch. Boris Johnson under pressure to sack senior aide Pressure on Boris Johnson to sack Dominic Cummings has intensified, as at least 18 Conservative MPs publicly called on the adviser to face the consequences of breaking lockdown rules. The UK prime minister backed his senior aide at a defiant press conference on Sunday, saying it had been within the rules for Cummings to drive his family 264 miles to his parents\u2019 estate in Durham while his wife was suffering coronavirus symptoms. Restrictions ease in Madrid and Barcelona Major parks and cafe terraces reopened in Madrid for the first time in more than two months as the capital and the surrounding region moved into the second phase of the loosening of lockdown restrictions. The Barcelona metropolitan area and parts of Castilla y Le\u00f3n also joined Madrid in the same phase, which allows groups of up to 10 people to meet as long as they maintain physical distancing. Small shops can also open without prior appointments and places of worship can reopen at 30% capacity. Chile\u2019s healthcare system \u2018very close to the limit\u2019 The Chilean president, Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era, said on Sunday that the country\u2019s healthcare system was under strain and \u201cvery close to the limit\u201d, as the number of confirmed novel coronavirus infections approached 70,000, after a rapid increase in recent days. The health ministry reported 3,709 new cases in the last day, bringing the total to 69,102. The death toll is at 718. South Africa announces further easing of lockdown South Africa will further relax coronavirus lockdown restrictions from 1 June, President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced, allowing large areas of the economy to fully reopen. \u201cCabinet has determined that the alert level for the whole country should be lowered from level four to level three,\u201d he said in an address broadcast on television, describing the move as a significant shift in approach to the pandemic. Splits are emerging between federal and state governments in Germany over plans to end coronavirus lockdowns, the Associated Press reports. The overall number of coronavirus cases in the country has been in a steady decline after peaking in late April. but as restrictions, imposed 10 weeks ago, have slowly been eased there have been fresh clusters of cases linked to slaughterhouses, restaurants, religious services, nursing homes and refugee shelters. The governor of Thuringia, Bodo Ramelow, said on Saturday he hoped to lift the remaining statewide lockdown rules on 6 June and tackle outbreaks locally. Saxony, a neighbouring state, said on Monday that it too is aiming for a \u201cparadigm change\u201d on pandemic rules from 6 June if infections remain low. Jens Spahn, the health minister, on Monday cautioned against acting as though the outbreak was over. He told Bild, a German tabloid, that \u201con the one hand we are seeing whole regions where there are no new reported infections for days. And on the other hand local and regional outbreaks in which the virus is spreading quickly again and immediate intervention is required.\u201d Federal and state officials agreed earlier this month that restrictions would be re-imposed if there are more than 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants in a city or county within a week. Donald Trump, the US president, recently shared a doctored video of his head superimposed on to actor Bill Pullman\u2019s character in the 1996 film Independence Day\u2019s crowd-rallying scene, likening frontline workers to warriors. But it rang hollow for Denita Jones, a Dallas-area call center worker. For many black, essential workers like her, the message is about reopening the economy, but the real meaning is more subtle. \u201cWe\u2019re not essential, we\u2019re expendable,\u201d she said. African Americans in Texas are dying of Covid-19 at a rate more than one-third higher than their share of the population. Yet across the country, the protesters who became the faces of the race to reopen have been mostly white. Guardian US writer Kenya Evelyn reports on how experts are warning that reopening states could have dire consequences on public health, and black Americans already face greater risk. The cumulative tally of officially confirmed cases of coronavirus in Germany has increased by 289 to 178,570, the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases said on Monday, according to Reuters. The reported death toll rose by 10 to 8,257, the data showed. Meanwhile, the German federal government is recommending that states ease some social distancing regulations from 6 June, the Bild newspaper reported, but continues to urge that limits be placed on the size of social gatherings. According to an official paper seen by the newspaper, Helge Braun, the head of the office of the chancellor, recommended that private gatherings be held in the open air where possible and be limited to 20 people, while indoor meetings should be limited to 10 people. Hi, this is Damien Gayle taking over on the coronavirus live blog now, with thanks to Frances Perraudin for keeping things going for the past few hours.

A chilling video warning Italians not to drop their guard against coronavirus as they socialise has provoked a strong reaction on social media. The video, entitled Happy Hour? and created by leaders of the Veneto region, is mostly targeted at young people who have been criticised for gathering in groups outside bars since they reopened last Monday. The clip shows people drinking, chatting and haphazardly wearing masks, while warning that \u201cit takes little \u2026 a warm greeting, innocent laughter, a handshake \u2026 before it\u2019s all going to stop.\u201d The characters then freeze in action before images of Covid-19 patients in intensive care are shown. Luca Zaia, the president of Veneto, said during a press conference that \u201cHappy hour will be unhappy if you end up in hospital\u201d. He came under attack for the video, with one Twitter user describing it as \u201cpure terrorism\u201d. Another wrote: \u201cDear president, this virus is cured (not fought against) in suitable places. Outside, one must live!\u201d There was support from some quarters, particularly from Vincenzo De Luca, the president of the Campania region, who became somewhat of a star during the lockdown for his comical rants aimed at getting citizens to comply with rules. \u201cWell done Luca,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cSometimes we need to terrorise if they don\u2019t understand.\u201d A town in Veneto was among the first 11 in Italy to be quarantined at the start of the outbreak, but mass testing enabled the region to quickly get the virus under control. As of Sunday, there were 1,869 deaths and 17 new infections. Other Italian leaders have had to reimpose restrictions following scenes of people mixing closely together and without face masks. In Brescia, one of the areas in Lombardy hardest hit by coronavirus, bars will now have to close by 9.30pm, while in Verona in Veneto, bar customers must be seated at a table. Bars will also have to close by 9pm in Perugia, Umbria. Hungary has opened its southern border for citizens of Serbia and Hungary from today, the country\u2019s foreign minister, P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3, has told a news conference. He said Hungary had decided to reciprocate a similar measure taken by Serbia on Friday, Reuters reports, adding that the coronavirus pandemic was under control in both countries, which allowed the easing of restrictions. The move followed a gradual reopening of landlocked Hungary\u2019s other borders, which now allow some movement although restrictions have not been fully lifted. Hungary has recorded 3,756 cases of Covid-19 and 491 deaths. The Japanese prime minister, Shinz\u014d Abe, is to lift the state of emergency imposed due to the coronavirus crisis. He said on Monday that the country had managed to get the spread of the virus under control in under two months. Physical distancing curbs were loosened for most of the country on 14 May as new infections fell, but the government has kept Tokyo and four other prefectures under watch. According to the public broadcaster NHK, the world\u2019s third-largest economy has escaped an explosive outbreak with more than 16,600 infections and 839 deaths so far. A little over a month ago, health experts were saying Japan risked becoming one of the world\u2019s coronavirus \u201cdisaster zones\u201d. This report from the Guardian\u2019s Justin McCurry in Tokyo looks at how the country\u2019s government went on to win plaudits for its response to the crisis. Major parks and cafe terraces reopened in Madrid for the first time in more than two months as the capital and the surrounding region moved into the second phase of the loosening of lockdown restrictions. The Barcelona metropolitan area and parts of Castilla y Le\u00f3n also joined Madrid in the same phase, which allows groups of up to 10 people to meet as long as they maintain physical distancing. Small shops can also open without prior appointments and places of worship can reopen at 30% capacity. Madrid\u2019s mayor, Jos\u00e9 Luis Mart\u00ednez-Almeida, marked the occasion by tweeting a picture of himself standing by the boating lake in the city\u2019s famous El Retiro park. \u201cOpen,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cGood morning and let\u2019s be responsible.\u201d Almost half of Spain \u2013 47% \u2013 has moved into the third phase of the de-escalation. The penultimate phase allows shops in shopping centres to reopen (but not communal areas) and restaurants to serve customers inside, but while operating at 40% capacity. Cinemas and theatres are also permitted to open, but must operate at 30% capacity. What if it had just fizzled out? What if leading Chinese scientist Zhong Nanshan had gone on state television on 20 January and delivered news that the unusual virus detected in Wuhan was not spreading between people, instead of what he really said that night: that human-to-human transmission was certain? ... What would we be talking about instead? What stories would have defined 2020 so far? Even before the worst pandemic in a century, tectonic shifts were already under way. The news felt exhausting. But the world is still turning, despite the movements of half of humanity being restricted in some way. Even apart from Covid-19, it has been a year of significant developments. The Guardian\u2019s international correspondent Michael Safi looks at the global stories that would have been getting our attention if Covid-19 had never emerged. The Philippines\u2019 health department has reported five additional coronavirus deaths and 284 more infections, the largest daily increase of cases in two weeks. In a bulletin, the government said total deaths had increased to 873, while confirmed cases had risen to 14,319. Seventy-four more patients have recovered, bringing total recoveries to 3,323. From crowded informal settlements to conservation areas teeming with wildlife, cottage industries have popped up around the globe producing and distributing face masks for frontline workers, taxi drivers, market sellers and more, Kate Hodal reports. Usually comprised of two fabric layers with a disposable filter, mask-making enterprises are stoking local economies and helping communities. Read the full story here: Singapore\u2019s health ministry has confirmed 344 more coronavirus cases, taking its tally of infections to 31,960, Reuters reports. The lower number of cases on Monday is partly due to fewer tests being conducted, the ministry said in a statement. It said the vast majority of the newly infected people were migrant workers living in dormitories, adding that four were Singaporeans or permanent residents. The often unsanitary dormitories that house migrant workers in Singapore have become a hotbed of infections in recent weeks. For background, read this report from the end of last month from the Guardian\u2019s south-east Asia correspondent, Rebecca Ratcliffe. Spain\u2019s tourism minister has said this morning that foreigners can book vacations in Spain from July as the two-week self-quarantine for overseas travellers is likely to be suspended by then. Spain \u2013 one of the worst-hit nations in the world from the coronavirus \u2013 has an economy that is heavily dependent on tourism. While it is gradually easing its strict lockdown measures, it has kept a quarantine for foreign visitors to try to prevent a second wave of infections. \u201cIt is perfectly coherent to plan summer vacations to come to Spain in July,\u201d Reyes Maroto said in an interview with the local radio station Onda Cero. The country\u2019s prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, said on Saturday the government would guarantee the safety of visitors and locals when they started to return from July. \u201cSpain needs tourism, and tourism needs safety in both origin and destination,\u201d he said. Hello, I\u2019m Frances Perraudin in London. I\u2019ll be taking over the live blog for the morning. You can contact me with hints and tips on frances.perraudin@theguardian.com and on twitter @fperraudin. Thanks for reading. India has resumed domestic flights despite the country recording its biggest daily number of infections yet. Here\u2019s the full story from Amrit Dhillon. The pressure on Boris Johnson to sanction Dominic Cummings is already being ratcheted up after a member of the government\u2019s advisory group on behavioural science told morning TV that the \u201cdebacle\u201d has \u201cfatally undermined\u201d efforts to fight coronavirus. Prof Stephen Reicher told Good Morning Britain: If you look at the research it shows the reason why people observed lockdown was not for themselves, it wasn\u2019t because they were personally at risk, they did it for the community, they did it because of a sense of \u2018we\u2019re all in this together\u2019. If you give the impression there\u2019s one rule for them and one rule for us you fatally undermine that sense of \u2018we\u2019re all in this together\u2019 and you undermine adherence to the forms of behaviour which have got us through this crisis.\u201d Reicher was reiterating criticism he voiced yesterday when he said Johnson\u2019s defence of his favourite aide had \u201ctrashed\u201d advice on how to build public consensus on following the rules of lockdown. Falling consumer spending, capital investments and exports pushed the German economy into a recession in the first three months of the year, the national statistics office said this morning, as the virus continued to hurt the major economies. Capital investments slumped by 6.9%, private consumption by 3.2% and exports by 3.1% between January and March compared with the last three months of 2019. 100 writers call for an end to anti-Asian hostility More than 100 prominent writers, including several top Asian American authors, have called for an end to a surge in anti-Asian hostility in the US which they say has been \u201cegged on\u201d during the pandemic by the Trump administration\u2019s pandering to racist tropes. The joint statement, co-ordinated by Pen America and the Asian American Writers\u2019 Workshop (AAWW), comes at a time when hate crimes, violence and other attacks against Asians and Asian Americans are on the rise in the US. There have been numerous reports since early in the pandemic of Asian Americans being blamed for \u201cbringing the virus\u201d into the country and being told \u201cgo back to China\u201d. Asian stock markets have given back earlier gains amid concerns about growing US-Sino antagonism over the coronavirus crisis and trade. Hong Kong has slumped 1.4% to a two-month low after sinking 5.5% on Friday. The London stock market is closed today for the spring bank holiday but other European bourses are in business. Here are the opening calls. Lockdown gives asylum seekers reprieve and hope for change in policy Clare Considine reports for the Guardian: As Britain takes its first small steps out of lockdown, there is one group of people quietly wishing that it wouldn\u2019t. For many asylum seekers, the two-month hiatus has meant reprieve. Freed from detention centres, liberated from the threat of imminent deportation and no longer obliged to report to the Home Office, many have welcomed the relief. And all this at a time when the general population have learned something of what it is like to live with severe curbs on civil liberties: That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan, on a chilly and wet Sydney evening. I\u2019m off to gently encourage some rather large insects seeking shelter in my house to rediscover their love of the great outdoors \u2013 and not so gently encourage others. Thank you for for following along, and, as always, to those who got in touch. The parts of Spain already in or entering Phase 1 today, according to El Pais, include: \u201cThe regions of Madrid, Castilla y Le\u00f3n and Valencia, as well as most of Catalonia and the provinces of Ciudad Real, Toledo, Albacete, Granada and M\u00e1laga.\u201d Those entering Phase 2 are: \u201cThe Canary and Balearic Islands, Galicia, Asturias, Cantabria, the Basque Country, La Rioja, Navarre, Arag\u00f3n, Extremadura, Guadalajara, Cuenca, Murcia, all of Andalusia apart from M\u00e1laga y Granada, Terres de l\u2019Ebre (Tarragona), Camp de Tarragona (Tarragona), Alt Pirineu-Aran (Lleida), and the Spanish exclave cities of Ceuta and Melilla in North Africa.\u201d Spain is easing lockdown restrictions today, with the country entering Phase 1 of the relaxed restrictions, while some parts will enter Phase 2, which is more relaxed. The El Pais newspaper has detailed the differences between the two phases: Phase 1 Under this stage of the deescalation plan, building work in properties that are being lived in will no longer be prohibited, while the opening of shopping malls will be made more flexible. Stores in malls will be able to open provided that they measure under 400 square meters, or they demarcate an area of that size for customers. They will also require an independent, direct access point from outside of the shopping mall in which they are located. Museums will be able to decide how many people to let in, within a range of 30% to 50% of normal capacity. Phase 2 Local councils will be able to establish access limits and control the number of people on beaches in order to guarantee a two-meter distance can be observed, as well as establishing time limits both on the sand and in car parks. The order specifies that access to beaches must always be free of charge. To calculate the maximum capacity of a beach, each bather is considered to occupy approximately four square meters. Thailand confirmed two new coronavirus cases and one additional death on Monday, a health ministry spokesman said. The new numbers brought the total number of cases in the Southeast Asian country to 3,042 and deaths to 57 since the outbreak began in January, said Taweesin Wisanuyothin, a spokesman for the Covid-19 Administration Centre. More than 96% of the patients, or 2,928 people, have recovered, he said. Get in touch via Twitter @helenrsullivan or email: helen.sullivan[at]theguardian.com. Tips, questions, feedback and fun all welcome. Boris Johnson\u2019s defence of Dominic Cummings has dominated the front pages of the UK\u2019s media landscape, with newspapers taking varied lines on the prime minister\u2019s decision to excuse his senior aide\u2019s lockdown breaches. The Daily Mail \u2013 whose coverage usually backs the prime minister and his government \u2013 has taken a particularly strong line against Johnson, simply asking: \u201cWhat planet are they on?\u201d The Telegraph has stuck closer to its usual pro-Conservative position, quoting Johnson\u2019s defence of his senior aide. Nightclubs in China have mostly come back to life as owners and customers feel increasingly comfortable the novel coronavirus epidemic is under control, but disinfectant, disposable cups and masks have become part of the experience, Reuters reports. At 44KW, a club for electronic music lovers in the financial hub of Shanghai, customers sat, danced and mingled with little sign of social distancing on the weekend. The club re-opened in mid-March after closing for about six weeks, but it took a while for business to get back to normal. \u201cThere really weren\u2019t many clients as most people were quite worried about their safety,\u201d said Charles Guo, founder of 44KW. \u201cOur client flow began to recover quickly towards the end of April\u201d, Guo said, adding that business was back to last year\u2019s average levels by mid-May. But not everything is like the old days: the club checks the temperature of every customer and gets them to register their details. Staff, including bouncers, bartenders and waiters wear masks and gloves all the time. Customers don\u2019t have to wear masks but many do. Some glasses have been replaced with plastic cups and the club has installed hand sanitizer dispensers throughout. Door handles and toilets are disinfected every hour while the entire club is disinfected every day before and after opening, Guo said. President Donald Trump has further limited travel to the US from the world\u2019s coronavirus hotspots by denying entry to foreigners coming from Brazil, which is second to the US in the number of confirmed cases. Trump had already banned certain travellers from China, Europe, the United Kingdom and Ireland and, to a lesser extent, Iran. He has not moved to ban travel from Russia, which has the world\u2019s third-highest caseload, approximately 20,000 fewer than Brazil\u2019s. The worsening situation in Latin America came as other nations started to emerge from coronavirus lockdown. Japan was expected to lift a state of emergency on Monday and India restarted domestic flights. Australia\u2019s most populous state sent children back to school for the first time since the pandemic began. The authorities in New South Wales deployed hundreds of crowd-control staff on Monday to enforce social distancing on public transport amid an expected commuter surge as schools and offices reopened and coronavirus cases fell. The Guardian\u2019s Charlotte Graham-McLay reports: New Zealand will further loosen its coronavirus lockdown restrictions from Friday, allowing gatherings - including funerals, church services and parties - to increase in size from 10 people to 100. Three weeks after a relaxation of the strictest-possible level 4 shutdown rules, prime minister Jacinda Ardern said, it was clear that a fresh wave of infection had been avoided. This was \u201ccounter to what many countries overseas have experienced,\u201d she said, adding that the curb of the virus\u2019 spread was \u201cin large part to New Zealanders sticking to the rules\u201d at levels 3 and 2 over the past few weeks. Under the current level 2 restrictions, schools and most businesses have been permitted to reopen, with strict physical distancing rules in place, but all gatherings are limited to a maximum of 10 people. That has generated criticism from some churches and those holding funeral services, who said they had expected looser rules at level 2. Ardern had earlier promised that the current rules might be relaxed if New Zealand\u2019s record with the virus \u2013 health officials have regularly reporting days of zero or one new case for the country \u2013 continued. On Monday, she said that had happened. The country\u2019s success to date in fighting the virus meant \u201cwe can now make choices others can\u2019t,\u201d Ardern added. \u201cIt\u2019s another step in re-normaisling life as we continue to stamp out the virus.\u201d Cabinet would discuss the lockdown rules again on 8 June, she said, and would consider by 22 June whether the country could safely move to the lightest, level 1 restrictions. New Zealand has recorded fewer than 1,500 confirmed cases and 21 deaths from the virus. One person is in hospital. Global cases pass 5.4m. There are currently 5,407,701 confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The death toll stands at 345,036. Both figures are likely to be higher, due to differing test rates, definitions and deliberate underreporting. White House official likens China\u2019s handling of coronavirus to Chernobyl cover-up. A top White House official on Sunday likened China\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak to the Soviet Union\u2019s cover-up of the meltdown at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in 1986. National security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien said Beijing knew what was happening with the virus, which originated in Wuhan, from November but lied to the World Health Organization and prevented outside experts from accessing information. China says virus pushing US ties to brink of \u201cCold War\u201d. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Sunday that Washington seemed infected by a \u201cpolitical virus\u201d but that Beijing would nevertheless be open to an international effort to find the coronavirus source.\u201cSome political forces in the US are taking China-US relations hostage and pushing our two countries to the brink of a new Cold War,\u201d Wang said. Dominic Cummings reported to police over lockdown breach. Boris Johnson\u2019s chief advisor is facing a possible police investigation under health laws over a claim that he breached self-isolation rules in north-east England, after a weekend of mounting pressure on the prime minister to sack his chief adviser. Boris Johnson described Cummings as acting \u201cresponsibly, legally and with integrity\u201d. World\u2019s top drug firms turned down proposals for work on pathogens like coronavirus. The world\u2019s largest pharmaceutical companies rejected an EU proposal three years ago to work on fast-tracking vaccines for pathogens like coronavirus to allow them to be developed before an outbreak. US bars travellers who have been in Brazil in last two weeks. The White House has announced it is prohibiting foreigners from traveling to the US if they had been in Brazil in the last two weeks, two days after the South American nation became the world\u2019s second-worst affected country in terms of cases. Brazil registers 15,813 new cases, 653 new deaths, taking the total number of fatalities to 22,666, the Health Ministry said. Brazil has 363,211 confirmed cases. France has lowest daily rise in new coronavirus cases and deaths since lockdown. French authorities reported the smallest daily rise in new coronavirus cases and deaths on Sunday since before a lockdown began on 17 March, raising hopes that the worst of the epidemic is over in France. The French government has discouraged citizens from travelling abroad this summer, recommending they holiday in France, the environment minister Elisabeth Borne has said. This follows Emmanuel Macron saying it was unlikely that French people would be able to undertake major foreign trips this summer. First Spanish beaches to reopen as lockdown eases. Coronavirus lockdown measures will finally be eased for people in Madrid and Barcelona from Monday, while elsewhere in Spain the first beaches are due to reopen, AFP reports. Residents in the two cities can now meet in groups of up to 10 people in their homes or on the terraces of bars and restaurants.The gates of the capital\u2019s parks will also be reopened, and major museums will be able to receive a limited number of visitors. Australian children return to school. Australia\u2019s most populous state, New South Wales, on Monday deployed hundreds of crowd control staff to enforce social distancing on public transport amid an expected commuter surge as schools and offices reopened and coronavirus cases fell. Australia has reported just over 7,100 Covid-19 infections, including 102 deaths, well below figures reported by other developed countries. New Zealand expected to further loosen lockdown restrictions. New Zealand has reported another day of no new cases of Covid-19, with the news from health officials coming hours before Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister, is expected to announce further loosening of lockdown restrictions on the country. After a week of \u201czero days\u201d for the coronavirus, peppered with the odd day of one new case \u2013 most recently on Friday \u2013 New Zealand\u2019s total number of confirmed instances of Covid-19 remains under 1,500. Chile\u2019s healthcare system \u201cvery close to the limit\u201d. Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said on Sunday that the country\u2019s healthcare system is under strain and \u201cvery close to the limit\u201d, as the number of confirmed novel coronavirus infections approached 70,000, after a rapid increase in recent days. The Ministry of Health reported 3,709 new cases in the last day, bringing the total to 69,102. The death toll is at 718. South Africa announces further easing of lockdown. South Africawill further relax coronavirus lockdown restrictions from 1 June, President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced, allowing large areas of the economy to fully reopen. \u201cCabinet has determined that the alert level for the whole country should be lowered from level four to level three,\u201d he said in an address broadcast on television, describing the move as a significant shift in approach to the pandemic. India resumes domestic flights despite record spike in new cases. Domestic flights will resume across India on Monday, the federal civil aviation minister has said, despite a 24-hour record increase in new cases on Sunday. The announcement follows a day of \u201chard negotiations\u201d, the minister said, after some states sought to limit the number of flights. Thousands of pro-democracy protesters assembled in Hong Kong against a controversial security law proposed by China, defying a coronavirus measure banning gatherings of more than eight people. The planned legislation is expected to ban treason, subversion and sedition, and the clashes between police and demonstrators were the most intense seen in months. Exclusive: The world\u2019s largest pharmaceutical companies rejected an EU proposal three years ago to work on fast-tracking vaccines for pathogens like coronavirus to allow them to be developed before an outbreak, the Guardian can reveal. The plan to speed up the development and approval of vaccines was put forward by European commission representatives sitting on the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) \u2013 a public-private partnership whose function is to back cutting-edge research in Europe \u2013 but it was rejected by industry partners on the body. The commission\u2019s argument had been that the research could \u201cfacilitate the development and regulatory approval of vaccines against priority pathogens, to the extent possible before an actual outbreak occurs\u201d. The pharmaceutical companies on the IMI, however, did not take up the idea. The revelation is contained in a report published by the Corporate Observatory Europe (COE), a Brussels-based research centre, examining decisions made by the IMI, which has a budget of \u20ac5bn (\u00a34.5bn), made up of EU funding and in-kind contributions from private and other bodies. Opposition leaders across Europe walk coronavirus tightrope The Guardian\u2019s Shaun Walker reports from Budapest with Kate Connolly in Berlin: Opposition politicians across Europe, from cautious centrists to firebrand populists, have had to walk a tricky political tightrope over the past two months, as coronavirus has taken over the political agenda. How to stay politically relevant while governments, even when making errors, are benefiting from a \u2018rally round the flag\u2019 effect and seeing approval ratings rise? And how to hold those governments responsible for their mistakes, without playing political games during a health crisis? \u201cIt\u2019s a very hard balance to strike, but there have been moments where we had no choice except to fight back,\u201d admitted the mayor of Budapest, Gergely Kar\u00e1csony, in a recent interview at his office. Chinas foreign minister is dismissing claims that the country is exploiting the coronavirus outbreak to expand its footprint in the South China Sea, labeling such accusations as sheer nonsense, Reuters reports. State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters at a news conference on Sunday that China was cooperating closely on anti-virus efforts with Southeast Asian countries, several of whom have overlapping territorial claims with China in the strategically vital waterway. While China has long been stepping up its presence in the region, Wang said other countries, implying the United States and its allies, have been creating instability with military flights and sea patrols. Their ill-intentioned and despicable moves are meant to sow discord between China and (Southeast Asian countries) and undermine the hard-won stability in the region, Wang said. Sydney Opera House\u2019s livestreamed concert series could be a game-changer for local bands Sydney\u2019s Vivid festival was due to light up the city on Friday but instead the city is dark and silent bar a few night-joggers ploughing the streets. There\u2019s a stir at Joan Sutherland theatre though, guitars leaning on amps ready for post-punk band Low Life\u2019s concert \u2013 the first contemporary music act to be presented as part of the opera house\u2019s digital season. At the band\u2019s request, a slab of silver bullets (Reschs Pilsener) and KFC have been delivered to the green room. The venue is permitting individual dinners only: buckets and shared fries would breach its social distancing rules. Onstage, plastic bags are puckered around each microphone and, when they\u2019re removed, engineers clap to test the audio. Say goodbye, world, to handshakes, shared Holy Communion, candles on cake and \u201cmicrophone check 1-2\u201d. New Zealand media group Stuff to be sold to chief executive Sinead Boucher for NZ$1 One of New Zealand\u2019s largest media organisations will be sold for a single dollar to its chief executive, the owners announced on Monday. Stuff prints many of the nation\u2019s daily newspapers and runs a popular news website of the same name. It employs about 900 staff, including 400 journalists. Owned by Australia\u2019s Nine Entertainment, Stuff faced financial challenges before the coronavirus pandemic struck and has since seen advertising revenues plunge. In a statement to the Australian stock market, Nine said Stuff would be sold to CEO Sinead Boucher in a management buyout deal that will be completed by the end of the month. \u201cWe have always said that we believe it is important for Stuff to have local ownership and it is our firm view that this is the best outcome for competition and consumers in New Zealand,\u201d said Hugh Marks, the CEO of Nine. Boucher said her plan is to transition the ownership by giving staff a direct stake as shareholders in the company. Coronavirus strands English-born musher in Alaska after Iditarod win Thomas Waerner won this year\u2019s Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race in March, but he is still waiting to return to his home in Norway. Waerner and his 16 dogs have been stranded in Alaska by travel restrictions and flight cancellations caused by the coronavirus pandemic, The Anchorage Daily News reported Saturday. \u201cI like Alaska a lot,\u201d Waerner said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of my dream place. But I have a family.\u201d Waerner, whose official bio states he was born in England but lives in Norway, has five children and 35 other sled dogs in rural Torpa. He missed the 10th birthday of one of his children and misses morning coffee with his wife, Guro, who left Alaska in March shortly before health restrictions stopped travel. The 47-year-old plans to fly home in early June on a DC-6 aircraft bound for the Air History Museum in Sola, Norway. Everts Air Cargo of Fairbanks is selling the historic plane, and Waerner said the museum is expected to finalize the deal this week. \u201cWe are hitchhiking,\u201d Waerner said. \u201cThe plane is going to Norway, and we are going with them. We are so lucky.\u201d Blog readers: get in touch via Twitter @helenrsullivanor email: helen.sullivan[at]theguardian.com. Tips, questions, feedback or fun are welcome. Thank you to those who have already reached out today. China said Sunday that its relations with the United States were \u201con the brink of a new Cold War,\u201d fuelled partly by tensions over the coronavirus pandemic that has killed nearly 350,000 people worldwide and pitched the global economy into a massive downturn. Fresh tensions between Beijing and Washington emerged as virus restrictions continued to shape and remake lives around the world, and in very different ways. US President Donald Trump has accused Beijing of a lack of transparency over the outbreak, suggesting the virus may have leaked from a top-security Chinese laboratory. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Sunday that Washington seemed infected by a \u201cpolitical virus\u201d but that Beijing would nevertheless be open to an international effort to find the coronavirus source. \u201cSome political forces in the US are taking China-US relations hostage and pushing our two countries to the brink of a new Cold War,\u201d Wang said. Only locals will benefit from Spain\u2019s open beaches for the time being. Travel between regions is still forbidden and foreigners arriving in Spain must quarantine for 14 days. But the government plans to reopen the borders to foreign tourists in July. The lockdown, in force since mid-March, has been among the most severe in the world. In the first few weeks, Spaniards could hardly set foot outside and their children were kept indoors. Many residents have become impatient over the government\u2019s slow and cautious process of lifting the restrictions. Thousands of people protested on Saturday by car in major Spanish cities at the call of the far-right Vox party. Drivers honked their horns, waved Spanish flags and banged on pots and pans to denounce the management of the coronavirus crisis by the left-wing government of Pedro Sanchez. Coronavirus lockdown measures will finally be eased for people in Madrid and Barcelona from Monday, while elsewhere in Spain the first beaches are due to reopen, AFP reports. Residents in the two cities can now meet in groups of up to 10 people in their homes or on the terraces of bars and restaurants. The gates of the capital\u2019s parks will also be reopened, and major museums will be able to receive a limited number of visitors. The Madrid and Barcelona regions, the most populated in the country, and a large part of Castile-Leon in the northwest are moving into the first phase of Spain\u2019s four-phase deconfinement programme, following what has been one of the strictest lockdowns in the world. These regions have been on a slower deconfinement track as they bore the brunt of the pandemic in Spain, which has killed more than 28,700 people to date, one of the world\u2019s highest tolls. Everyone must continue to wear a mask, which is already compulsory in buildings and on public streets when it is not possible to keep a distance of two metres (six feet). The rest of the country meanwhile - 22 million out of Spain\u2019s 47 million inhabitants - is moving on to the second phase, which is expected to last until the end of June. Restaurants may then reopen to a limited number of customers, and outings for walks or sports will no longer be limited to certain hours of the day. Americans defy Covid-19 social distancing rules to celebrate Memorial Day holiday Americans across the country appeared to abandon social distancing guidelines as they sunbathed on beaches and gathered for pool parties on Memorial Day weekend. The long weekend traditionally signals the start of the US summer, and despite the country\u2019s Covid-19 death toll approaching 100,000, many revellers dismissed any safety concerns to celebrate. At the Lake of the Ozarks, made famous by the television series with the same name, hundreds gathered for a pool party to enjoy the warm spring weather. Bar tables installed in the pool were filled with drinks, as people danced and apparently forgot that Covid-19 existed. Missouri, where the Ozarks are located, has had 686 deaths from Covid-19. There are currently 5,405,029 confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The death toll stands at 345,036. Both figures are likely to be higher, due to differing test rates, definitions and deliberate underreporting. These are the ten worst-affected countries worldwide in terms of numbers of infections: US: 1,642,021 Brazil: 363,211 Russia: 344,481 United Kingdom: 260,916 Spain: 235,772 Italy: 229,858 France: 182,709 Germany: 180,328 Turkey: 156,827 India: 138,536 Australia\u2019s most populous state, New South Wales, on Monday deployed hundreds of crowd control staff to enforce social distancing on public transport amid an expected commuter surge as schools and offices reopened and coronavirus cases fell. Australia has reported just over 7,100 Covid-19 infections, including 102 deaths, well below figures reported by other developed countries. With fewer than 20 new Covid-19 cases most days, Australian states are pressing ahead with a three-stage plan to remove most social restrictions imposed by July. In New South Wales, which includes the city of Sydney, children returned to full-time face-to-face learning on Monday, allowing many parents to return to offices. But officials warned locals to expect travel delays, with buses and trains operating at significantly reduced capacity due to distancing requirements. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 1.2 million kids on the move,\u201d NSW Transport Minister Andrew Constance told Australia\u2019s Channel 9. \u201cWe just need everyone to be patient.\u201d With international borders likely to remain closed for months, Morrison is also pressing locals to begin holidays locally to help support Australia\u2019s tourism sector. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has spoken to the heads of the country\u2019s six big banks to get their views on the state of the economy and the Covid-19 relief efforts, the Globe and Mail reported on Sunday, citing multiple sources. This was Trudeau\u2019s first one-on-one dialogue with the CEOs since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak, according to the report, which added that the calls took place around the Victoria Day long weekend. The topics covered included adjustments required in relief efforts rolled out by the government, need for further support and pressures faced by clients of the banks, the report said, adding that the talks were \u2018high-level check-ins rather than deep policy discussions\u2019. Brazil, the world\u2019s second-worst coronavirus hotspot behind the United States, registered 653 new coronavirus deaths on Sunday, taking the total number of fatalities to 22,666, the Health Ministry said. Brazil has 363,211 confirmed cases, up 15,813 from Saturday, the ministry said. The Guardian\u2019s Charlotte Graham-McLay reports: New Zealand has reported another day of no new cases of Covid-19, with the news from health officials coming hours before Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister, is expected to announce further loosening of lockdown restrictions on the country. After a week of \u201czero days\u201d for the coronavirus, peppered with the odd day of one new case \u2013 most recently on Friday \u2013 New Zealand\u2019s total number of confirmed instances of Covid-19 remains under 1,500. 97% of all confirmed and probable cases of the virus have recovered, health officials said in a statement on Monday. One person in New Zealand is in hospital with Covid-19. They are not in intensive care. Ardern has drawn praise for a strict, swift lockdown of the country in late March, at a time when there were just over 200 cases and no deaths. 21 people have now died of the virus. She has slowly relaxed restrictions on the country as new case numbers have fallen, and is expected to announce today that her Cabinet has agreed gatherings can be increased to more than 10 people. She will also outline a plan to take the country from its current status of alert level 2 \u2013 out of a possible 4 \u2013 down to level 1. There is not currently a timeline in place for that to happen. Mexican health officials on Sunday reported 2,764 new cases of the novel coronavirus and 215 deaths, bringing the totals to 68,620 and 7,394, respectively. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Sunday that the novel coronavirus could cost as many as a million jobs in the country as many industries considered not essential remain shut, Reuters reports. The Mexican economy was already in recession before the pandemic struck and different investment banks have forecast contractions as large as 9% for this year with only a gradual recovery next year. \u201cMy prediction is that with coronavirus, a million jobs will be lost,\u201d Lopez Obrador said in a televised speech. \u201cBut we will create two million new jobs.\u201d The job loss number matches the estimate by the country\u2019s business coordinating council. Lopez Obrador\u2019s government repeatedly said it had the outbreak under control but since posted record numbers for new cases and deaths. Earlier this week, his government issued guidelines for restarting operations in carmaking, mining and construction in Latin America\u2019s second-largest economy that is linked to the United States and Canada through a free trade agreement. In April, the finance ministry said in an annual economic report used to guide the budget that the economy could contract by as much as 3.9% this year, adding that the numbers incorporated a \u201cdrastic\u201d impact from coronavirus. China reported 11 new imported cases yesterday, compared to three the day before, according to the People\u2019s Daily. There were 40 new asymptomatic cases, up from 36 the day before. There were no new deaths. South Africa\u2019s President Cyril Ramaphosa on Sunday said a controversial ban on the sale of alcohol would be lifted for home consumption when the country moves into level three of a five-tier coronavirus lockdown next month. South Africans were prohibited from buying alcohol and cigarettes when the country went into one of the world\u2019s strictest lockdowns on 27 March. The booze ban was meant to prevent a spike in violence and reduce pressure on emergency wards as hospitals geared up to face a virus that has infected at least 22,583 people across the country and killed 429. \u201cAlcohol will be sold for home consumption only under strict conditions on specified days and for limited hours,\u201d Ramaphosa announced in an address to the nation. \u201cThe sale of tobacco products will remain prohibited in alert level 3 due to the health risks associated with smoking,\u201d he added. South Africa started gradually easing confinement measures on 1 May, allowing citizens to exercise outdoors in the morning and some businesses to partially resume operations. Japan is considering a fresh stimulus package worth over $929bn that will consist mostly of financial aid programmes for companies hit by the coronavirus pandemic, the Nikkei newspaper said on Monday. The package, to be funded by a second extra budget for the current fiscal year beginning in April, would follow a record $1.1tn spending plan deployed last month to cushion the economic blow from the pandemic, reports Reuters. The second extra budget, worth \u00a5100tn ($929.45bn), will include \u00a560tn yen for expanding loan programmes that state-affiliated and private financial institutions offer to firms hit by virus, the paper said. Another \u00a527tn will be set aside for other financial aid programmes, including \u00a515tn for a new programme to inject capital into ailing firms, it said. The government is expected to approve the budget, which will also include subsidies to help companies pay rent and wages as they close businesses, at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday. Virginia Governor Ralph Northam has repeatedly urged Virginia residents to cover their faces in public during the coronavirus pandemic. On Friday, he told reporters wearing a mask \u201ccould literally save someone else\u2019s life\u201d. But the Democrat did not heed his own advice on Saturday, when he posed without a mask for photographs with residents during a visit to the Virginia Beach Oceanfront. A spokeswoman for the governor\u2019s office said Northam should have had a mask. \u201cHe was outside and not expecting to be within 6ft of anyone,\u201d Alena Yarmosky said. \u201cThis is an important reminder to always have face coverings in case situations change. We are all learning how to operate in this new normal, and it\u2019s important to be prepared.\u201d Northam has suggested he will announce a statewide policy on face coverings on Tuesday. At the beach on Saturday, he told reporters his administration was still working on the details. Critics on social media chided Northam, a doctor, for not practicing what he has preached. \u201cPhysician, heal thyself,\u201d tweeted Todd Gilbert, Virginia\u2019s Republican House minority leader. Chile\u2019s healthcare system is under strain and \u201cvery close to the limit,\u201d President Sebastian Pinera said on Sunday, as the number of confirmed novel coronavirus infections approaches 70,000 after a rapid increase in recent days, Reuters reports. The Ministry of Health reported 3,709 new cases in the last day, bringing the total to 69,102. The death toll is at 718. \u201cWe are very close to the limit because we have had a very large increase in the needs and demands for medical care, and for intensive care unit beds and ventilators,\u201d Pinera said during a visit to a hospital in Santiago, which has the highest concentration of cases. More than 1,000 people have been hospitalized for disease associated with the coronavirus, according to the government. Chile, the world\u2019s top copper producer, confirmed its first case of coronavirus in early March and surpassed 50,000 infections this week. A third of Chile\u2019s population of about 19 million is under mandatory quarantine after the government put Santiago and several other cities under lockdown. Here\u2019s the full story on Robert O\u2019Brien, Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser, accusing China of a cover-up that will \u201cgo down in history along with Chernobyl\u201d, and ramping up efforts to deflect attention from a Covid-19 death toll in the US fast closing on 100,000. A top White House official on Sunday likened China\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak to the Soviet Union\u2019s cover-up of the meltdown at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in 1986. National security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien said Beijing knew what was happening with the virus, which originated in Wuhan, from November but lied to the World Health Organization and prevented outside experts from accessing information. \u201cThey unleashed a virus on the world that\u2019s destroyed trillions of dollars in American economic wealth that we\u2019re having to spend to keep our economy alive, to keep Americans afloat during this virus,\u201d O\u2019Brien said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cThe cover-up that they did of the virus is going to go down in history, along with Chernobyl. We\u2019ll see an HBO special about it ten or 15 years from now,\u201d he added, referring to a television miniseries. The disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, in the former Soviet republic of Ukraine, released radioactive nuclear material that killed dozens of people within weeks and forced tens of thousands to flee. Moscow delayed revealing the extent of what is regarded as the worst nuclear accident in history. \u201cThis is a real problem and it cost many, many thousands of lives in America and around the world because the real information was not allowed to get out,\u201d O\u2019Brien said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cIt was a cover-up. And we\u2019ll get to the bottom of it eventually.\u201d More on the US travel ban from Brazil: The White House on Sunday broadened its travel ban against countries hard-hit by the coronavirus by denying admission to foreigners who have been in Brazil during the two-week period before they hoped to enter the US. President Donald Trump had already banned travel from the United Kingdom, Europe and China. He said last week that he was considering similar restrictions for Brazil. The ban on travel from Brazil takes effect late Thursday. As with the other bans, it does not apply to legal permanent residents. A spouse, parent or child of a US citizen or legal permanent resident also would be allowed to enter the country. The White House has announced it is prohibiting foreigners from traveling to the US if they had been in Brazil in the last two weeks, two days after the South American nation became the world No. 2 hot spot for coronavirus cases. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the new restrictions would help ensure foreign nationals do not bring additional infections to the US, but would not apply to the flow of commerce between the new countries. Brazil became the No. 2 hot spot for cases on Friday, second only to the US. Brazil has recorded over 347,000 infections, while the US has over 1.6 million. The decision follows comments by the national security adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, to CBS.\u201cWe hope that\u2019ll be temporary, but because of the situation in Brazil, we\u2019re going to take every step necessary to protect the American people,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. Hello and welcome to today\u2019s live global coverage of the coronavirus pandemic with me, Helen Sullivan. I\u2019ll be bringing you the very latest news for the next few hours \u2013 as always, it would be great to hear from you via Twitter @helenrsullivan or email: helen.sullivan[at]theguardian.com. Tips, questions, feedback or fun are welcome. British PM Boris Johnson has doubled down on his defence of chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, who breached lockdown rules to drive his wife, who who was suffering coronavirus symptoms, and son 425km (264 miles) to his parents\u2019 farm in Durham. Cummings is facing a possible police investigation after retired chemistry teacher Robin Lees made a complaint to the police over the breach. Meanwhile in the US, the Trump administration has barred travel from Brazil, which now has the second-highest number of confirmed cases worldwide. The White House announced it is prohibiting foreigners from traveling to the US if they had been in Brazil in the last two weeks. Here are the main developments from the last few hours: Global toll passes 340,000 The total number of confirmed coronavirus cases stands at 5,344,539, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. There have been 342,695 deaths officially linked to coronavirus around the world. Dominic Cummings reported to police over lockdown breach. Boris Johnson\u2019s chief advisor is facing a possible police investigation under health laws over a claim that he breached self-isolation rules in north-east England, after a weekend of mounting pressure on the prime minister to sack his chief adviser. Boris Johnson described Cummings as acting \u201cresponsibly, legally and with integrity\u201d. US bars travellers who have been in Brazil in last two weeks. The White House has announced it is prohibiting foreigners from traveling to the US if they had been in Brazil in the last two weeks, two days after the South American nation became the world\u2019s second-worst affected country in terms of coronavirus cases. France has lowest daily rise in new coronavirus cases and deaths since lockdown. French authorities reported the smallest daily rise in new coronavirus cases and deaths on Sunday since before a lockdown began on 17 March, raising hopes that the worst of the epidemic is over in France. The French government has discouraged citizens from travelling abroad this summer, recommending they holiday in France, the environment minister Elisabeth Borne has said. This follows Emmanuel Macron saying it was unlikely that French people would be able to undertake major foreign trips this summer. South Africa announces further easing of lockdown. South Africa will further relax coronavirus lockdown restrictions from 1 June, President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced, allowing large areas of the economy to fully reopen. \u201cCabinet has determined that the alert level for the whole country should be lowered from level four to level three,\u201d he said in an address broadcast on television, describing the move as a significant shift in approach to the pandemic. South Africa\u2019s AngloGold Ashanti has suspended operations at its Mponeng mine after at least 164 employees tested positive for coronavirus. The mining company said it had tested 650 workers at the gold mining site in Merafong, Gauteng province, after a first case was detected last week. Contact tracing and sanitisation processes are under way. India resumes domestic flights despite record spike in new cases. Domestic flights will resume across India on Monday, the federal civil aviation minister has said, despite a 24-hour record increase in new cases on Sunday. The announcement follows a day of \u201chard negotiations\u201d, the minister said, after some states sought to limit the number of flights. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Canada has risen to 84,081 from 82,892. There have been 103 more deaths, bringing the country\u2019s toll up to 6,380. German authorities are trying to trace the people who attended a church service in Frankfurt after 107 tested positive for the coronavirus. The service took place at a Baptist church on 10 May, and it is not clear whether all the 107 attended the service, or whether the figure includes those who were infected by those who did. China\u2019s top diplomat Wang Yi has said the US should stop wasting time in its fight against the coronavirus and work with China to combat it, instead of smearing the country. State councillor Wang\u2019s comments came as he expressed his sympathy to the US for the pandemic, where the death toll is approaching 100,000. Thousands of pro-democracy protesters assembled in Hong Kong against a controversial security law proposed by China, defying a coronavirus measure banning gatherings of more than eight people. The planned legislation is expected to ban treason, subversion and sedition, and the clashes between police and demonstrators were the most intense seen in months. Italy has recorded 50 new deaths \u2013 but worst-hit Lombardy\u2019s figures are missing due to late reporting. The number of new infections rose by 531, down from 669 on Saturday. There have been 32, 785 deaths and 140,479 people have recovered.",
