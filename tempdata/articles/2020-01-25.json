      "bodyText": "A doctor treating victims infected with the coronavirus in the Chinese city of Wuhan has died from the virus amid further signs that the local health system has been overwhelmed and that the outbreak is worsening. The 62-year-old doctor Liang Wudong died on Saturday morning, state media said, and it was also reported by the Chinese Global Times website that another doctor who had been treating patients in Wuhan died of a heart attack later in the day. It was not clear if Jiang Jijun, 51, had contracted the virus. The Chinese government stepped up efforts to battle the growing epidemic and sent 1,200 extra medical personnel to Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, to ease the burden on local staff. The Chinese health ministry also ordered nationwide measures to identify and immediately isolate suspected cases of a deadly virus on trains, aeroplanes and buses, as the death toll rose to 41 and the number of people infected reached almost 1,300. Inspection stations will be set up and passengers with suspected pneumonia must be \u201cimmediately transported\u201d to a medical centre, the national health commission said in a statement. The isolation of suspected cases must be followed by disinfection of the train, plane or bus. The statement said \u201call departments of transportation\u201d must \u201cstrictly\u201d introduce prevention and control measures including screening measures in airports, railway stations, bus stations and ports.Staff serving passengers must all wear masks, the NHC said. Dr Liang worked at the Hubei Xinhua hospital in Wuhan and was the first known fatality among staff treating patients in the city, which is under lockdown along with at least a dozen other cities in Hubei state. Liang\u2019s death highlighted the pressure faced by medical staff in the state as social media was flooded with posts showing exhausted workers struggling to cope. One photo circulating showed a sign on a glass door entrance of Wuhan Fourth hospital that read: \u201cMedical staff infected. All appointment cancelled!\u201d Others posts tell of doctors and nurses working without much food or rest under poorly ventilated contamination suits. Another posting showed a local effort of 4,000 volunteer drivers who have been helping distribute supplies around the city to hospitals and medical staff. Beijing News reported on Friday that there were 15 infected medical staff in Wuhan, and said on Saturday that a doctor at Peking University no 1 hospital had the virus. The outbreak has dampened lunar new year celebrations in Wuhan and across the country. With restaurants, markets and parks closed, public gatherings banned and public transport suspended, many people have chosen to stay home. Long queues were reported at pharmacies in the city as people rushed to buy face masks from staff wearing protective suits and surgical gloves. Police were stationed at roadblocks on roads leading out of the city of 11 million people as the government tried to contain the spread of infection. Elsewhere in China, the Great Wall has been closed along with Disneyland in Shanghai, where all cinemas have been closed. The extra staff sent to Hubei included 450 military medics with experience of battling Sars and Ebola, state media said, who arrived in Wuhan on Friday night. As the extra personnel moved into hospitals, work continued on the construction of an emergency 1,000 bed facility for virus sufferers. It is hoped it will be completed by the first week of February. The chaos in cities under lockdown across Hubei has led to shortages of virus testing kits and face masks. There is growing anger within Wuhan that authorities did not do enough in the initial days of the outbreak to determine the extent of the spread of the virus, with misdiagnosis due to limited testing kits, lack of staff and space for patients rampant. One victim, Xia Qianqing, 36, told how she went to hospital in early January after feeling sick but was told her condition was not serious enough. She later came down with fever and was admitted to the hospital but discharged since beds were needed for critical patients. \u201cThe fever clinics at major hospitals are currently only treating those in critical condition who need to be transferred to other hospitals to for testing, and in the process there\u2019s a serious shortage of testing kits,\u201d she told the Guardian, adding that the situation had improved since central government took responsibility for responding to the crisis away from state authorities. In Jingzhou, a city just west of Wuhan also under lockdown, Wang Xin, visiting for the new year holiday from Shenzhen, told the Guardian that he was about to leave the city but started to feel sick on Friday and has now been told to isolate himself at home for 14 days. Wang said the situation in Jingzhou appeared to be better that in Wuhan and that there were few people at the hospital when he visited early on Saturday. \u201cThe drug store was out of antibiotics, but they gave out five free masks to everyone and you can buy the N95 masks [supposedly best for preventing transfer] at the normal price, which might mean that mask supplies are coming back,\u201d he said. Markus Tiet\u00e4v\u00e4inen, 33, a language student at Wuhan University, was scheduled to fly back to Finland on Thursday when the travel ban hit and is now holed up at the campus, mainly waiting around with other foreign students since most Chinese students are away on holiday. \u201cThey have started measuring our body temperatures at the dormitory entrances and are keeping one of the canteens open for those who are still on campus,\u201d Tiet\u00e4v\u00e4inen said. \u201cNo one really knows what is going on or how long this will last,\u201d he said. \u201cI have to admit that I\u2019m not actually worried about the disease itself, it is more the isolation and I had holiday plans and now they are all gone.

He had previously been in Wuhan.</p> <p>The man tested positive for coronavirus early on Saturday morning. He had visited a GP on Thursday and went to the Monash medical centre at Clayton on Friday, where he was put into isolation.</p> <p>The man showed no symptoms while travelling, \u201cso may not have been contagious\u201d at the time, Mikakos said.

The family contacted the Monash medical centre on Friday, they called ahead of time and again he was masked before he turned up at [emergency] and immediately put into isolation.\u201d</p> <p>The three other confirmed Australian cases, all in New South Wales, involve men aged between 30 and 60. Two had visited Wuhan in recent weeks, the other had direct contact with a confirmed case from Wuhan while in China.</p> <p>A man in his 50s arrived in Sydney from Wuhan on China Eastern flight MU749 on 20 January. He developed symptoms that night and subsequently saw a doctor.</p> <p>Another man, who is in his 30s, arrived in Sydney from China on 6 January. He did not develop symptoms until 15 January and saw his GP. He did not visit Wuhan but had contact with a person from the city diagnosed with coronavirus.</p> <p>A third man, in his 40s, arrived in Sydney on 18 January after being in Wuhan. He did not develop symptoms until 24 January and presented to hospital on the same day.</p> <p>All three men were diagnosed with novel coronavirus on Saturday 25 January. All three are currently in isolation in NSW hospitals.</p> <p>A total of 18 people have been tested for the virus in NSW, with 12 of those given the all-clear.</p> <p>The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, urged anyone with symptoms to come forward as soon as they felt unwell.</p> <p>\u201cIt is important people feel confident contacting their GP or local emergency department,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should also call ahead to speak to their GP or emergency department.

      "bodyText": "Four men, all of whom have direct connections to Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the global coronavirus pandemic, have been confirmed as carrying the deadly virus in Australia. A man in his 50s in Melbourne became the first confirmed case of novel coronavirus in Australia on Saturday morning, with three other cases confirmed in New South Wales late on Saturday. Eleven countries have now confirmed cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), 41 people have died and more than 1,000 have been infected. Victoria\u2019s health minister, Jenny Mikakos, said the man in Melbourne, a Chinese national, arrived at Tullamarine airport at 9am on Sunday 19 January on China Southern Airlines Flight No CZ321 from Guangzhou. He had previously been in Wuhan. The man tested positive for coronavirus early on Saturday morning. He had visited a GP on Thursday and went to the Monash medical centre at Clayton on Friday, where he was put into isolation. The man showed no symptoms while travelling, \u201cso may not have been contagious\u201d at the time, Mikakos said. But \u201cout of an abundance of caution\u201d health officials were contacting everybody who was on that flight. \u201cThere is no reason for alarm in the general community,\u201d Mikakos said. \u201cWe have strict protocols that are in place in terms of how we deal with these infectious disease outbreaks.\u201d Mikakos said the first infected man and his family \u201cdid everything right\u201d. \u201cHe exhibited no symptoms on the flight and when he did experience some symptoms of illness they contacted the GP on Thursday, they called ahead and he was double-masked when he presented to the GP clinic. \u201cHe was not confirmed to have coronavirus by the GP. The family contacted the Monash medical centre on Friday, they called ahead of time and again he was masked before he turned up at [emergency] and immediately put into isolation.\u201d The three other confirmed Australian cases, all in New South Wales, involve men aged between 30 and 60. Two had visited Wuhan in recent weeks, the other had direct contact with a confirmed case from Wuhan while in China. A man in his 50s arrived in Sydney from Wuhan on China Eastern flight MU749 on 20 January. He developed symptoms that night and subsequently saw a doctor. Another man, who is in his 30s, arrived in Sydney from China on 6 January. He did not develop symptoms until 15 January and saw his GP. He did not visit Wuhan but had contact with a person from the city diagnosed with coronavirus. A third man, in his 40s, arrived in Sydney on 18 January after being in Wuhan. He did not develop symptoms until 24 January and presented to hospital on the same day. All three men were diagnosed with novel coronavirus on Saturday 25 January. All three are currently in isolation in NSW hospitals. A total of 18 people have been tested for the virus in NSW, with 12 of those given the all-clear. The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, urged anyone with symptoms to come forward as soon as they felt unwell. \u201cIt is important people feel confident contacting their GP or local emergency department,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should also call ahead to speak to their GP or emergency department. If the GP considers novel coronavirus testing is needed they will be referred to the emergency department for testing.\u201d Nine people in Queensland have returned negative results for coronavirus, with authorities on Saturday still waiting on results from another possible case. Four people in South Australia were also being tested but authorities said it was unlikely they actually had the virus, with a man also being checked in a Hobart hospital. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, said the man in Melbourne confirmed as having coronavirus had visited Wuhan province but had come to Australia on a direct flight from Guangzhou to Melbourne. He said \u201cthere are potentially others like this person ... who was well when he travelled\u201d, but that there was \u201cno evidence this virus is being transmitted in Australia\u201d. \u201cAt this stage there is no risk to the general Australian community,\u201d Murphy said. But he said there was significant potential for more cases in Australia. \u201cThere are other cases being tested each day. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we have further confirmed cases.\u201d Murphy said that anyone who had travelled from China who developed flu-like symptoms should see their doctor. The Australian foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, announced the Australian government had raised its travel advice for Hubei province in central China to level four \u2013 the highest level. \u201cWe now advise you: do not travel to and from Hubei province\u201d, the government advised. Payne said: \u201cChinese authorities have restricted travel in at least five Hubei cities. Australians going there may not be able to leave until restrictions are lifted.\u201d The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said a confirmed case of coronavirus had been anticipated by the Australian government and the issue was being addressed \u201cincredibly seriously\u201d. \u201cI want to assure Australians that our officials, our medical experts, our clinicians, our border security officials and agencies, our biosecurity professionals are all working closely together at both a commonwealth and state level,\u201d he said. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has listed the virus as having \u201cpandemic potential\u201d. This allows for enhanced border protection measures. Globally, efforts to contain the deadly new coronavirus have been stepped up, and the first cases have been reported in Europe. China has widened restrictions on movement, expanding its unprecedented lockdown during the country\u2019s new year holiday period to 13 cities, covering at least 36 million people. Late on Friday, authorities confirmed a further 15 deaths and 180 new cases of coronavirus, bringing the total number of fatalities to 41 people and more than 1,000 people affected. Cases have been reported in South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, the United States, Thailand and Vietnam. On Friday, the first cases were reported in Europe with France saying it had identified three cases. The World Health Organisation has stopped short of declaring the outbreak a public health emergency of global concern but called on the international community to work co-operatively to fight the spread of the virus. There is an emerging suspicion in China that officials may be downplaying the number of cases recorded over recent weeks, recalling the government\u2019s reluctance to disclose the full scale of the 2002-03 Sars outbreak, which killed almost 800 people. Videos circulating on Weibo and other social media, reportedly from Hubei hospitals, show crowded waiting rooms and distressed and overwhelmed medical staff. Patients have reported being turned away from hospitals, which have been inundated with people who fear they have the virus. Health facilities in Wuhan are reportedly running out of beds and diagnostic kits for patients who present with fever-like symptoms, which could mean many are unsure if they have the virus. Initial symptoms of coronavirus are similar to those of a cold and flu, and include a cough or fever. Most of the people who have died in the outbreak have been older men but on Friday Chinese authorities confirmed a 36-year-old man had died, the youngest fatality so far.",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/25/coronavirus-five-people-in-nsw-being-tested-for-deadly-disease\">The virus is now confirmed to have reached Australia and Malaysia</a>, while France confirmed on Friday that three people there had the virus.

      "bodyText": "China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, has called an emergency government meeting, telling officials the country is facing a \u201cgrave situation\u201d as the new coronavirus is \u201caccelerating its spread\u201d. More than 50 million people are spending China\u2019s most important holiday under lockdown as the country expands its travel restrictions in an attempt to stop the spread of the new coronavirus. Officials confirmed on Sunday that the death toll from the viral outbreak had reached 54 and that well in excess of 1,200 further people had been affected. A doctor treating people infected with the virus was among those who died. Liang Wudong, 62, died on Saturday morning, state media said, and it was also reported by the Chinese Global Times website that another doctor who had been treating patients in Wuhan died of a heart attack later in the day. In Beijing, five new cases have been confirmed, according to Chinese National Radio, including two patients who had not recently travelled to Hubei, the centre of the outbreak. In all previous cases in the capital, patients had reportedly visited the province. The virus is now confirmed to have reached Australia and Malaysia, while France confirmed on Friday that three people there had the virus. Both France and the US plan to evacuate citizens trapped in Wuhan, the Hubei city where the outbreak began. The Foreign Office advised late on Saturday against all travel to Hubei province because of the outbreak, adding: \u201cIf you are in this area and able to leave, you should do so.\u201d Hong Kong, which has confirmed five cases of the illness, declared the outbreak an emergency on Saturday, and said it would keep primary and secondary schools closed for two more weeks after the holiday. A growing number of airports around the world have introduced screening to identify those affected, although the effectiveness of such measures has been questioned. An article published in the Lancet, based on a family that had recently visited Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak, suggested it was possible to have the disease while not experiencing any symptoms. Across China, the lunar new year holiday has been overshadowed by travel blocks imposed on at least 17 cities, and the cancellation of major festive events. In an effort to stop the disease from spreading further, part of the Great Wall was closed, and Beijing\u2019s temple fairs, a new year tradition, have been cancelled. Shanghai Disneyland also announced it would close indefinitely. It is feared the lunar new year, when hundreds of millions of people go on holiday or to visit relatives, could fuel the spread of the virus across China and abroad. So far, 29 provinces and cities in China have been affected, and further cases had been reported in South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Macao, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. The US reported its second case. In Wuhan, restrictions were tightened on Saturday, with officials banning most vehicles from the roads. Train stations, airports and railway stations had all been shut since the lockdown began on Thursday morning. The city was facing shortages of beds, testing kits and other supplies, and 450 military medical staff arrived late on Friday to help treat patients, the official Xinhua news agency reported. The ministry of commerce was overseeing an operation to supply more than 2m masks and other products from elsewhere in the country, Xinhua said. Footage on social media, apparently taken inside the city\u2019s hospitals, appeared to show staff breaking down and long queues of residents waiting to be assessed. Patients told the Guardian that people had been turned away by hospitals and that their relatives had been unable to get a test to find out if they had the virus. It was announced on Saturday that a second hospital was to be built to treat coronavirus patients. Work has already begun to build a 1,000-bed hospital in 10 days. Wuhan\u2019s streets have been deserted for days, with residents mostly staying home. Many were following social media, where there was a constant stream of updates, videos and speculation, including misinformation. \u201cLooking out of the window every day, I can see one or two cars and pedestrians on the street. The streets are relatively deserted,\u201d said Wuhan resident Mr Wang, who was speaking before the traffic ban was implemented. \u201cNow, at night, it is like a dead city. I look at the neighbourhood and there are very few lights.\u201d Residents who left the city before transport blocks were introduced had faced hostility elsewhere in China, being blamed for potentially spreading the virus. Wang said it was understandable that people felt that way, but added that Wuhan residents were \u201cthe biggest victims of [the] bureaucracy\u201d. \u201cInformation was hidden from everyone. Most people believe that the official information is correct, so when the sudden outbreak is announced and the city is closed, they easily panic about the situation.\u201d Xi Chen, a professor at the Yale school of public health, said: \u201cWe know very little about the origin of this virus and we know very little about the speed of transmission and when it starts to transmit.\u201d The virus comes from a large family of coronaviruses.

After reading that Public Health England wanted to trace all those who had arrived back to the UK from Wuhan in the past 14 days, the physics professor tried to email PHE on various addresses and even emailed the chief medical officer Chris Whitty, but says he has not heard back from anyone. On Saturday the government said that 31 people in the UK had been tested for the virus \u2013 all negative. On Friday the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the NHS was \u201cready to respond appropriately\u201d to any cases. Dove told the Guardian that although he did not feel unwell, he would like to rule himself out and he believed the government could be doing more to contact those in his position.: \u201cIf they want to track us down, why don\u2019t they make it easier for us to contact them? \u201cThe only way they are going to find me is by checking the flight records. They\u2019ve got to be quite clever because there are not that many direct flights to Wuhan. Most people get to Wuhan through a hub airport.\u201d It would save the government \u201ca lot of hard work\u201d tracking flights and movements in and out of Wuhan if they allowed people to self-report. \u201cIt would be better if they just said, \u2018contact us on this number\u2019, and I could call them up and say, \u2018I\u2019m one of the people you\u2019re looking for,\u2019 but there is nothing.\u201d Dove flew back to Heathrow from China via Hong Kong and said no information was given out at any point. He said he was not worried either before he flew over or while he was in China. \u201cBefore I went I had heard there were cases of pneumonia and people were saying it could be SARS, but my colleagues at the university said it was happening really far away form them. Wuhan is a very big city. It\u2019s bigger than greater London.\u201d On Friday, Whitty said there was a \u201cfair chance\u201d cases would emerge in Britain as the number of cases reported worldwide rose to more than 1,300, including 41 deaths \u2013 all in China. Speaking after a meeting of the government\u2019s Cobra emergency committee in Whitehall on Friday, the chief medical officer said: \u201cI am working closely with the other UK chief medical officers. We all agree that the risk to the UK public remains low, but there may well be cases in the UK at some stage. \u201cI think we should definitely see this as a marathon, not a sprint. We need to have our entire response based on that principle.\u201d The Department of Health confirmed it was trying to find \u201cas many passengers as we can\u201d who arrived from the region in the past two weeks to check on their wellbeing. A spokeswoman said work was ongoing to get the information needed to contact all relevant people, adding it is \u201cquite a long process\u201d and will take some time.",

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ll be closing this liveblog shortly. Thanks for joining us. Here\u2019s what you missed if you are just catching up. Forty-one people in China have died from coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, a city in Hubei province. 62-year-old doctor Liang Wudong died from the virus in Wuhan after treating patients. More than 1,370 cases have been confirmed worldwide, the vast majority in China, and others predominantly across Asia. However, the virus reached Europe yesterday, with three confirmed cases in France, and has also been reported in Australia and the US. In total, 14 countries have been affected. The World Health Organization has not declared a crisis, but is monitoring the situation. In China, 30 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions have now raised their public health alert to level 1, the highest level. China announced it had ordered nationwide measures to identify and immediately isolate suspected cases of a deadly virus on trains, aeroplanes and buses. It is also building two new hospitals to deal with the crisis. Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, has said the response level has been raised from \u201cserious\u201d to \u201cemergency\u201d, the highest level. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control issued a statement warning that more cases in the EU are likely. In the UK, 31 people were tested and the results were negative. The government is trying to track down 2,000 people who arrived from Wuhan in recent weeks. The US began an operation to evacuate its citizens and diplomats from Wuhan. Here\u2019s the latest full report from my colleagues Rebecca Ratcliffe and Wu Pei Lin as well as an explainer about what Coronvirus is and another about how it has spread. I spoke to a British academic who returned from China this week and said that no one from the UK government has tried to contact him regarding the coronavirus outbreak. Health officials have teamed up with Border Force agents and airlines to try to track down about 2,000 people who have flown to the UK from Wuhan, the area worst affected by the outbreak. Prof Martin Dove, who works for Queen Mary College London and Wuhan University of Technology, had been working in Wuhan from 3-12 January before heading to other parts of China and flying home on Wednesday. After reading that Public Health England wanted to trace all those who had arrived back to the UK from Wuhan in the past 14 days, the physics professor tried to email PHE on various addresses and even emailed the chief medical officer Chris Whitty, but says he has not heard back from anyone. Dove told me that although he did not feel unwell, he would like to rule himself out and he believed the government could be doing more to contact those in his position. He said: \u201cIf they want to track us down, why don\u2019t they make it easier for us to contact them?\u201d Read the full story here: The five people suspected of having coronavirus in Scotland have tested negative, the Scottish government has said. On Thursday, five patients were confirmed as being tested for the infection, and ministers have now announced they have been given the all-clear. Health Protection Scotland has urged travellers returning from Wuhan who become unwell within a fortnight from a sore throat, cough or breathing difficulties to call their GP or NHS 24. Scotland\u2019s chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, said on Friday: \u201cScotland is well prepared for these types of outbreaks \u2013 we have a proven track record of dealing with challenging health issues and the UK was one of the first countries in the world to develop a test for the new virus. \u201cI am being kept fully informed about the precautionary steps being taken, including timely updates on the patients who are currently being tested.\u201d China has confirmed that it is dealing with a total of 1,372 cases of coronavirus nationally. So far, 39 have been discharged. The number of those affected internationally has surpassed 1,400, but the death toll remains at 41. According to Tom Cheshire, Sky News Asia correspondent, the number has increased from 40 cases of infection 10 days ago. In case you missed it, have a listen to yesterday\u2019s Science Weekly podcast \u2013 The Wuhan Coronavirus: what we know and don\u2019t know. The Guardian\u2019s science correspondent Hannah Devlin talks to Prof Ian Jones about the nature of the virus, and to Dr Rosalind Eggo about how scientists model the spread of novel viruses. Starbucks has announced that it will close all outlets in Hubei province for the duration of the week-long lunar new year holiday. It follows a similar announcement by McDonald\u2019s, which will close branches in five cities in Hubei. Here\u2019s the latest map showing where cases have been confirmed around the world. Over 30 people have now been tested for coronavirus in the UK, the Department of Health and Social Care and Public Health England have said. As of Saturday afternoon, some 31 tests have now concluded, all of which were confirmed as negative for the virus. \u201cThere are currently no confirmed cases in the UK or of UK citizens abroad, and the risk to the public is low,\u201d a statement said. \u201cThe government is monitoring the situation closely and will continue to work with the World Health Organization (WHO) and international community,\u201d it added. It promised to announce any cases in the UK \u201cif and when\u201d it is confirmed. What to do if you think you are at risk If you have visited Wuhan and develop a fever, cough or have difficulty breathing within 14 days of returning, government guidelines recommend people seek medical attention. \u201cIn the UK, please stay indoors and avoid contact with others where possible, call your GP or ring 111 informing them of your symptoms and your recent travel to the city.\u201d The majority of deaths from the virus so far have been those aged between 60 and 89, according to William Yang, the east Asia correspondent for the German news outlet DW. According to the figures, no one under 30 has died from the virus yet. In China, 30 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions have now raised their public health alert to level 1, the highest level, according to Global Times. This enables measures such as quarantining. Sichuan province has announced a ban on group gatherings. Individuals are not allowed to organise gatherings and restaurants are being prevented from hosting them. Anyone who had prior reservations has been told to cancel. In Hubei province, where the virus originated, all 72 train stations have been closed down. Workers in protective suits are checking the temperature of those entering Beijing\u2019s central railway, and some railway services have been suspended in the eastern Yangtze River Delta region. Chinese tourism continues to be affected by the spread of the virus. All domestic and foreign tour group operations are to be suspended from Monday. The move follows the closure of Shanghai\u2019s Disneyland, and all tourist sites in the popular Sanya city. The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, has held a special government meeting to address the spread of the virus. The president warned of a \u201cgrave situation\u201d at a meeting with the politburo on the lunar new year public holiday, state television reported. He also said the virus was \u201caccelerating its speed\u201d. According to the TV report, resources and experts will be channelled to designated hospitals to tackle the virus. Supplies to Hubei province will be guaranteed and cost won\u2019t be a hindrance. Forty-one people in China have died from coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, a city in Hubei province. This is up from 26 a day earlier. At least 17 cities in Hubei have been locked down, and around 28 provinces have issued the highest emergency response ranking possible, which enables measures including quarantines. There is virtually no travel being allowed into or out of Wuhan, and Beijing has suspended inter-province travel. More than 1,280 cases have been confirmed worldwide, the vast majority in China, and others predominantly across Asia. However, the virus reached Europe yesterday, with three confirmed cases in France, and has also been reported in Australia and the US. In total, 14 countries have been affected. In the UK, 14 people were tested and the results were negative. The government is trying to track down 2,000 people who arrived from Wuban in recent weeks. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control says more cases in the EU are likely. Hong Kong announced this morning that it would raise its response from \u2018serious\u2019 to \u2018emergency\u2019, the highest ranking. School holidays will be extended for another two weeks, and a marathon has been cancelled. The World Health Organization has not declared a crisis, but is monitoring the situation. China is building two new hospitals to tackle the crisis, the first in 10 days and another in two weeks. Beijing now has five confirmed cases of coronavirus, but two of those had no connection with the province of Hubei. This appears to be the first time the virus has spread without having a direct link to Hubei, indicating that the virus is now being transmitted person-to-person within the capital. Footage from the BBC\u2019s China correspondent, Stephen McDonell, shows the deserted streets of Hubei, the province where the virus originated. The lockdown has now been expanded to another 16 cities, according to Associated Press. This brings the total to 17 cities, including Wuhan, affecting 50 million people \u2013 more than the population of New York, London, Paris and Moscow combined. The cities of Yichang, Suizhou and Jingzhou were the latest added to the list on Friday evening and Saturday. There are several different figures circulating, so I\u2019ll update you as and when I can. Beijing has suspended all inter-province buses to try to limit the spread of the virus. It is not yet known when the services will resume. China cut off trains, planes and other links to Wuhan on Wednesday, and transport within the city has also been suspended. The US is beginning an operation to evacuate uts citizens and diplomats from Wuhan, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) has said. There are around 1,000 US citizens in the city and the embassy is in the process of contacting them to arrange seats on a plane back to the US. Plans are in place for the consulate to close temporarily, the newspaper said. There are only 230 seats on the plane, according to the WSJ report, and those on board will have to pay the costs entailed. US medical personnel will be on board to treat suspected cases of the coronavirus, and any unfilled seats may be offered to non-US citizens. Washington was given approval for the operation from China\u2019s foreign ministry and other government agencies following negotiations in recent days, the WSJ said. It is not yet known where the plane will land. The central politburo of the Communist party has set up a working group to tackle the spread of the virus, according to Global Times, China\u2019s national English language newspaper. Symptoms may not show until a week after infection Symptoms of coronavirus may not manifest until up to a week after contracting the virus, Dr Adam Kucharski, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine told Sky News. Most symptoms begin to appear between three and six days after infection. It is not yet known whether the virus can be spread by symptomless carriers. Kucharski also confirmed that older people with pre-existing health conditions were at greater risk of the virus, but that the exact risk to younger people in good health was not known. Global Times is reporting that 26 Chinese provinces have now declared a level 1 emergency \u2013 the highest level \u2013 allowing them to introduce measures including quarantines. The issue is unfolding very quickly, so it\u2019s worth noting that figures around the number of areas with travel restrictions and severity alerts are varied, ranging from 22 to 28. A total of 1,287 people are now confirmed to have been infected in China. In Hong Kong, 122 people are being tested for the virus, with five confirmed cases. Coronavirus has flu-like symptoms, which can develop into severe respiratory problems. The current outbreak is understood to be a new strain of coronavirus, not previously found in humans. The virus can be transmitted between humans and animals, making it harder to contain. Other strains of coronavirus are not as dangerous \u2013 the common cold is one. Authorities have said that the current strain of the virus originated at a seafood market in Wuhan, Hubei province, which has seen the most severe outbreak of coronavirus. It is thought the market was selling wildlife illegally and has now been shut down. Hu Yinghai, the deputy director general of the civil affairs department in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, appealed this morning for masks and protective suits. \u201cWe are steadily pushing forward the disease control and prevention ... But right now we are facing an extremely severe public health crisis,\u201d he told a news briefing. Vehicles carrying emergency supplies and medical staff for Wuhan would be exempted from tolls and given traffic priority, China\u2019s transportation ministry said on Saturday. More than 400 military doctors arrived in Wuhan on Friday night, including those experience tackling Ebola. The city, home to 11 million people, is on lockdown, with residents unable to leave. Taxis have been assigned to neighbourhood committees to help those who need to travel immediately. Virus most dangerous for older people Coronavirus is more likely to affect older or middle-aged people, especially those who have had diseases before, according to Dr Nathalie MacDermott, a clinical research fellow in infectious diseases at Imperial College London. For younger people, the virus \u201cmay be similar to having the flu\u201d, she told Sky News this morning. MacDermott also said the UK was well prepared to deal with the virus, and already had tests in place. Wuhan, where the virus originated, is to ban all cars from the downtown area. Only vehicles with a transport pass, or those being used by people working for government services, will be allowed to travel. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has issued a statement following the news that the virus has reached Europe, with three confirmed cases in France. It said the development was \u201cnot unexpected\u201d but \u201cthe fact that these cases were identified, proves that detection and confirmation of this novel virus is working in France, showing a high level of preparedness to prevent and control possible infections\u201d. It said: \u201cMost EU countries have plans and measures in place to contain this kind of infection and Europe has well-equipped laboratories that can confirm probable cases, in addition to hospitals that are prepared to treat patients accordingly.\u201d It added that more cases in Europe were likely. Last night, authorities in England set up a public health hub at Heathrow airport, in terminal four. The hub is staffed by teams of seven clinicians working on rotation, who will support those flying in from China who feel unwell. In a statement, Public Health England said its priority was to distribute information to those arriving from China. \u201cMost people who develop symptoms will get them after leaving the airport and so our priority is providing UK residents and travellers with the latest information to make sure they know what to do if they experience symptoms,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cThe NHS and PHE have an established plan to respond to someone who becomes unwell,\u201d it added. The chief medical officer for England, Prof Chris Whitty, said in a statement last night that the risk to the UK remains low, but that there \u201cmay well be cases in the UK at some point\u201d. \u201cThe UK is well prepared for these types of incidents, with excellent readiness against infectious diseases,\u201d he said. Chinese state media are reporting that a second hospital, with a capacity of 1,300 beds, will be built to tackle the virus. Construction has begun and is scheduled to be completed in around two weeks. Tourism across China has been affected by the virus. Shanghai\u2019s Disneyland resort will be closed from Saturday, and the popular destination of Sanya city has shut down all tourist sites to limit the possible spread. Haikou city, the capital of the Hainan province, has started a two-week medical observation period for all tourists from Hubei, the region where Wuhan is located. Here\u2019s a brief update on the cases worldwide so far: Thailand and Hong Kong each have five reported cases, Australia has four, and France, Japan, Singapore and Taiwan have three each. Vietnam, South Korea and the US have two reported cases, and Nepal has one. In the UK, 14 people have been tested for the virus but all came back negative. North Korea blocked all arrivals from foreigners on Wednesday to prevent the virus spreading to its population. Australia now has four confirmed cases of the virus, one in Melbourne and three in New South Wales. All four people had recently visited China. The three men in New South Wales, aged 43, 45, and 53, had arrived directly from Wuhan, where the virus first emerged. The confirmed case in Melbourne is of a Chinese man, who flew over from China. He is said to be in a stable condition. The Guardian\u2019s Ben Doherty has more information. China\u2019s ministry of finance and its National Health Commission are allocating a special fund for treatment and prevention of the virus. They\u2019re also offering subsidies for medical staff tackling the illness. Eighteen cities in China have suspended public transport. Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, has said the response level has been raised from \u201cserious\u201d to \u201cemergency\u201d, the highest level. A marathon has been cancelled, and new year celebrations scaled back. Primary and secondary school students will be given an extra two weeks holiday to avoid the virus spreading in schools. Lam also said trains and planes from Wuhan would be blocked. She said she would be personally chairing an interdepartmental committee to enable a faster response to the spread of the virus. \u201cWe will not be frugal about the resources needed,\u201d she said. This is Molly, taking over the blog in London. I\u2019ll be reporting on developments in the virus and its spread as they unfold today. The Hubei health commission is giving a press conference. A provincial official has said the situation is very severe and medical supplies are tight. He called for more medical supplies, such as masks and protective suits, from both domestic and overseas providers. These are some of the other main points from the briefing: 67 hospitals have opened special emergency rooms for patients with fevers. 11 medical staff have so far developed a fever. Three have been cured. The rest are under watch. Non-essential vehicles will be banned from the Wuhan city centre from 26 January. Chinese traditional medicine would be used alongside Western medicine in the treatment of coronavirus patients. The People\u2019s Daily has released a photograph of Liang Wudong, the doctor who died in Wuhan from the virus. Here\u2019s a what we know so far about the spreading coronavirus. A 62-year-old doctor, Liang Wudong, has died from the virus in Wuhan after treating patients. Reports say a second doctor Jiang Jijun also died from a heart attack after becoming exhausted from attending to patients. Chinese authorities confirmed on Saturday that 41 people had died from the virus and over 1,300 have been infected globally. 56 million people in 18 provinces are now subject to travel restrictions. China has ordered nationwide measures to identify and immediately isolate suspected cases of a deadly virus on trains, aeroplanes and buses. Shanghai has shut all cinemas until 30 January to try to stop the spread of the virus China\u2019s Haikou city, the capital of the southern island province of Hainan, will start a 14-day centralised medical observation for tourists from the central Hubei province 1,200 military medical personnel have been sent to Wuhan to help with the outbreak, according to state media. Australia reported it\u2019s first confirmed case of the virus \u2013 a man in his 50s who had returned from China and had visited Wuhan. Malaysia reported a third case of the virus on Saturday. Japan confirmed its third case. In the UK, 2,000 travellers who have arrived recently from Wuhan are being sought. Fourteen people tested negative for the virus. 12 countries outside China have confirmed cases. The race is on to build a new hospital in Wuhan to treat patients infected with the virus. Here is a timelapse of the work so far: There are reports on the Global Times that a second doctor has died. It says Jiang Jijun died from exhaustion from treating patients. We\u2019ve updated our explainer on where the virus has spread to: This from Agence France-Presse: China has ordered nationwide measures to identify and immediately isolate suspected cases of a deadly virus on trains, aeroplanes and buses, as the death toll and number of patients has skyrocketed. Inspection stations will be set up and passengers with suspected pneumonia must be \u201cimmediately transported\u201d to a medical centre, the National Health Commission said in a statement. The isolation of suspected cases must be followed by disinfection of the train, plane or bus. The statement said \u201call departments of transportation\u201d must \u201cstrictly\u201d introduce prevention and control measures including screening measures in airports, railway stations, bus stations and ports. A statement from Japan\u2019s health ministry said the new patient was a woman in her 30s who arrived in the country on 18 January with no symptoms. She developed a cough and fever on the 21st. The statement said she had not visited the seafood market in Wuhan. To bring our numbers up to date - 56 million people are now subject to restrictions on their movement as authorities expanded travel bans in central Hubei province, now affecting 18 cities. Japan has reportedly confirmed its third case of the coronavirus. One doctor is reportedly infected in Beijing. More signs that new year\u2019s celebrations are off and many people are staying away from public places: Australia\u2019s prime minister Scott Morrison has released an update on the virus: Chinese news website Caixin has a snapshot of what reporting on the outbreak in Wuhan during Lunar new year is like. In the piece Gao Yu describes rumours flying around the hospitals, including that patients were attacking doctors. None of these things were true. Overall, the city still operates in an orderly fashion. But shortages of medical devices and the fact that most local medical staff are incredibly overloaded are indeed severe problems. And most worryingly of all is the continuous spread of the virus... Back in our hotel, we found protective gear waiting for us kindly donated by people we don\u2019t even know, sent from around the country. The three of us are the only customers of this hotel. They keep operating just for us, and put a small gift of fruit in our room - it\u2019s the new year after all.\u201d The scene in Wuhan: The Global Times reports that 22 provinces, home to 1.1 billion people, have declared a level 1 public health emergency. The Times of India reports that 12 people who have returned to India from China and Hong Kong have been quarantined as a precaution. Three, including a Briton, are in Mumbai, and nine in Kerala. South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news reports that North Korea has stepped up its efforts to prevent the virus entering the country. A flight from Beijing to Pyongyang has been cancelled, travel to China has been restricted and the North\u2019s cabinet Minju Choson called on people to take extra care of personal hygiene, it said. The alarming spread of coronavirus is on the front pages of many Saturday papers around the world: Here is our full report by Michael Standaert in Sichuan on the death of a doctor who was treating patients in Wuhan: Lunar new year celebrations have been subdued as a result of the widespread lockdowns. With many restaurants, markets and parks closed, public gatherings banned and public transport suspended, many people have chosen to stay home. Wang Feng, a 40-year-old resident of Wuhan, told Reuters: \u201cUsually we celebrate as a family. Now, because of the virus I\u2019m not even visiting my parents.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019ll be great just to be able to make it through (the outbreak).\u201d Images of the start of construction of a 1,000-bed hospital to handle cases of coronavirus in Wuhan show a hive of activity. The facility is due to be completed by 3 February. China undertook a similar project after the Sars outbreak. The government mouthpiece that is the People\u2019s Daily clearly endorses Donald Trump\u2019s message that China is working hard to contain the virus and \u201cit will all work out well\u201d. CGTN, China\u2019s official state broadcaster, now says more than 1,200 medical staff are being sent to Wuhan. Reuters is reporting that Starbucks is closing all of its outlets in Hubei province during the week-long Lunar new year holiday. Here is our latest news wrap by Ben Doherty on the situation in Australia, where a man in his 50s in Melbourne has become the first confirmed case of novel coronavirus, with two further \u201cprobable infections\u201d being treated in New South Wales. Here\u2019s a summary of what we know so far about the spreading coronavirus. A 62-year-old doctor, Liang Wudong, has died in Wuhan after treating patients Chinese authorities confirmed on Saturday that 41 people had died from the virus and over 1,200 had been infected Shanghai has shut all cinemas until 30 January to try to stop the spread of the virus China\u2019s Haikou city, the capital of the southern island province of Hainan, will start a 14-day centralised medical observation for tourists from the central Hubei province 450 military medical personnel have been sent to Wuhan to help with the outbreak, according to state media, state media has said, according to Agence France-Presse. Australia reported it\u2019s first confirmed case of the virus \u2013 a man in his 50s who had returned from China and had visited Wuhan Malaysia reported a third case of the virus on Saturday In the UK, 2,000 travellers who have arrived recently from Wuhan are being sought. Fourteen people tested negative for the virus. 12 countries outside China have confirmed cases I\u2019m getting a bit more information on the new case of the virus diagnosed in Malaysia, taking the total in that country to three. The health minister, Dzulkefly Ahmad, said the three individuals infected were Chinese nationals and related to the 66-year-old man that was confirmed by Singapore health authorities to have tested positive for the virus. The infected individuals were a 65-year-old woman, who is the wife of the man detected with the virus in Singapore, and their two grandsons, aged 11 and 2, Dzulkefly said. The three have been admitted to Sungai Buloh hospital in Kuala Lumpur for treatment and were considered in stable conditions, the minister said at a news conference. In a separate statement, Malaysia Airports said it has heightened screening of all passengers and crew arriving from China at gateway airports across the country to minimise the potential spread of the virus. Confirmed coronavirus cases in China and internationally A total of 41 people have now died from the coronavirus, according to official Chinese figures. It\u2019s not clear whether the 62-year-old doctor in Wuhan, who died while treating the outbreak, is included in that figure. The National Health Commission reported a jump in the number of people infected with the virus to 1,287. The latest tally came from 29 provinces across China, including 237 patients in serious condition. Internationally, here\u2019s what we know about cases confirmed outside of China. China has reported 1,287 cases of coronavirus Australia confirmed a man in his 50s tested positive for coronavirus on Saturday after returning to Melbourne from Wuhan. Malaysia has confirmed 3 cases of the virus In France, three people have fallen ill with the virus \u2013 the disease\u2019s first appearance in Europe The United States reported its second case, involving a Chicago woman in her 60s who was hospitalised in isolation after returning from China Two cases confirmed in Vietnam Three cases in Singapore As of Friday night, five people had been diagnosed with the virus in Hong Kong, according to the South China Morning Post On Friday South Korea\u2019s government confirmed the second case of a coronavirus that originated in China, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said. Japan \u2013 a destination for many lunar new year holiday makers \u2013 has confirmed 2 cases Thailand\u2019s public health ministry has confirmed five cases. Nepal has one infection Taiwan has reported three cases and Macao two Malaysia has just reported its third case of coronavirus. Australia reported its first case on Saturday. I\u2019ll bring you a rundown of where cases are internationally shortly. China\u2019s Global Times, state media\u2019s tabloid outlet, has tweeted images of empty streets in Wuhan, including the city\u2019s busiest commercial street. It has also tweeted footage of the race to build the new 1,000-bed hospital in Wuhan to treat patients. Chinese state media is reporting medical staff from around China are flying to Wuhan to help combat the outbreak of coronavirus. CGTN said a medical team of 135 experts from Guangdong province were among them the medics flying out. \u201cThey include a group of 24 doctors and nurses from Nanfang Hospital, who had been at the forefront of the battle against the SARs epidemic in 2003,\u201d the broadcaster said. Chinese state media has posted an update on the number of cases of coronavirus. It\u2019s missing the Australian case diagnosed on Saturday. The Reuters news agency is reporting that China\u2019s financial hub, Shanghai, has shut down all cinemas during the Lunar New Year holidays, which last until 30 January. They are quoting Liberation Daily online channel. I\u2019ll bring you more on this when i have it. China has stepped up its repsonse to the crisis by sending 450 military medical personnel to Wuhan, state media has said, according to Agence France-Presse. The medics, who arrived by aircraft late on Friday, have experience in flighting Sars and Ebola, the statement said. They will be dispatched to hospitals with large numbers of infected patients, according to the official Xinhua news agency. There are a great many social media posts about the coronavirus, including of footage said to be shot in hospitals in Wuhan which have been grappling with a flood of patients and a lack of supplies. Some of the videos show frantic people in masks lined up for examinations, and some report complaints that family members had been turned away at hospitals that were at capacity. The videos are hard to verify but we do know that authorities in Wuhan and elsewhere put out calls for medicine, disinfection equipment, masks, goggles, gowns and other protective gear. It\u2019s also pretty clear that people in the city are taking whatever precautions they can to avoid infection. Just while I\u2019m still looking at CGTN, the network is reporting that the first coronavirus patient in China\u2019s Zhejiang province as been cured. The Chinese state broadcaster CGTN has also been showing footage of the race to build a new hospital to accomodate the growing number of cases of coronavirus. You can see footage of the build on their tweet below. The official twitter feed of China Global Television Network (CGTN), formerly known as CCTV, said: \u201cLiang Wudong, a doctor at Hubei Xinhua Hospital who had been at the front line of the #CoronavirusOutbreak battle in Wuhan, dies from the virus at age 62.\u201d There are reports emerging that a doctor treating patients in Wuhan has died from coronavirus. Chinese state media has named the doctor as 62-year-old Liang Wudong. I\u2019ll bring you more details as soon as I have them. The Chinese ambassador to London, Liu Xiaoming, has said Beijing is co-operating with the World Health Organization over the outbreak of the virus. The WHO declared the new coronavirus an \u201cemergency in China\u201d this week but has stopped short of declaring it of international concern. In Hubei province, where the outbreak is believed to have begun, health authorities said on Saturday there were 658 patients affected by the virus in medical care, 57 of whom were critically ill. As promised, here\u2019s some more of what the Australian PM, Scott Morrison said about the country\u2019s first diagnosed case of coronavirus. Morrison said a confirmed diagnoses in the country had been anticipated. \u201cThe Australian Government, of course, has been taking this issue incredibly seriously. We have activated the necessary precautions and procedures that are in place,\u201d he said. Chief medical officers in all states and territories met today he said, to discuss the outbreak. \u201cWhat I want to assure Australians about is the preparedness and the plans and the capabilities are in place here in Australia to deal with issues of this nature. We have the people, we have all of the procedures that are now swinging into place to ensure that we can provide the protection to Australians. Now, that said, across the country, even as we speak, our border authorities and biosecurity authorities will be ensuring that those flights that are coming from China will be met by our officials and there will be appropriate information that is being provided to those alighting passengers.\u201d Morrison confirmed that Australia\u2019s travel advisory had been changed to recommend people do no travel to Hubei province at all. Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, has just given a press conference about the confirmed case of coronavirus in Melbourne, Australia\u2019s first confirmed. I\u2019ll bring you the details of what he said shortly, but the overall message was for Australian\u2019s to \u201cgo about their normal business\u201d. In China\u2019s Haikou city, the capital of the southern island province of Hainan, will start a 14-day centralised medical observation for tourists from the central Hubei province, the local government in Haikou has announced. Tourists from Hubei, especially from Wuhan city, are not allowed to leave the hotel where the medical observation will be held during the 14-day period, it said. Hubei has confirmed 729 cases of the new coronavirus, with 39 deaths as of 24 January, the provincial health authorities said. Earlier the chief medical office in Australian state of New south Wales, Dr Kerry Chant, said the suspected patients in the country were in isolation and did not pose a risk of transmitting the virus. \u201cWe\u2019re encouraging people who have come back from Wuhan, or who have been in contact with confirmed cases in China or in other countries, to please seek care if you develop any symptoms of fever, sore throat, pneumonia, a cough or respiratory symptoms of any sort,\u201d she said. Chant said testing currently takes about six hours but that time frame will likely shrink in the future. You can read our full coverage of the Australian situation here. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer said about another 12 people were being tested in Australia today for the virus. The man diagnosed with the virus is in his 50s and sought medical advice after he fell ill once he was in Melbourne. Murphy said he wore a face mask to the hospital where he reported his symptoms. He arrived in Melbourne on flight CZ321 last Sunday 19 January \u2013 a China Southern Airlines Flight No CZ321 from Guangzhou. Australian authorities are contacting people on that flight. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Professor Brendan Murphy, is giving a news conference, after a case of coronavirus was confirmed in Melbourne. He says there is \u201cno evidence this virus is being transmitted in Australia\u201d. He has asked that anyone who has travelled from China who develops flu-like symptoms to see their doctor and get checked out. \u201cAt this stage there is no risk to the general Australian community,\u201d Murphy says. \u201cThere are potentially others like this person (diagnosed in Melbourne)... who was well when he travelled.\u201d He confirmed the man diagnosed had visited Wuhan province, but had come from a direct flight from Guangzhou to Melbourne. In the United Kingdom, the 14 people who were tested for coronavirus did not in fact have it. But UK health officials have teamed up with Border Force agents and airlines to try to track down around 2,000 people who have recently flown into the UK from Wuhan. China\u2019s ambassador to London, Liu Xiaoming, says the government in Beijing is determined to curb the spread of the virus. Health officials have teamed up with Border Force agents and airlines to try to track down around 2,000 people who have recently flown into the UK from Wuhan, the Chinese province at the centre of the deadly coronavirus outbreak. As the coronavirus outbreak continues to spread, Chinese authorities in Wuhan are rushing to build a new 1,000-bed hospital in the city to deal with the rising influx of patients. To speed construction, the hospital is being built with prefabricated buildings around a holiday complex originally intended for local workers, set in gardens by a lake on the outskirts of the city. You can read the full story of the hospital build here, but in the mean time, here are some amazing images of the construction. Officials in the Australia say the 50-year-old man arrived in Australia on Sunday. He entered Australia on China Southern Airlines flight number CZ321 and had spent the intervening time with family in Melbourne. The man developed symptoms of pneumonia and presented to a GP on Thursday. He was then put into isolation. Authorities said there may be other people on the plane who were incubating the virus and called for other people on the flight to come forward for testing. A man in Australia has the coronavirus, officials have said. The man arrived in Melbourne from the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou about a week ago, authorities said. Health officials in New South Wales said on Saturday morning that five people were being tested for the coronavirus. Two other people have been discharged after returning negative results on Friday. Another two people in Queensland are also being assessed for the virus. The Australian foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, said the government was advising people not to travel to and from Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital. A flight arrived in Sydney direct from Wuhan on Thursday before the Chinese city\u2019s airport was closed. Here\u2019s the full story from our reporter in Sydney, Ben Doherty. Welcome to our live coverage of the Sars-like coronavirus outbreak. To start is off, these are the main developments in the last few hours: China said on Saturday morning that the death toll has risen to 41 with 1,287 affected. Thirteen cities with a population of 36 million people are in lockdown as the government tries to stop the virus from spreading as China enters the lunar new year holiday. Chinese state TV said the authorities were going to take stricter and more targeted measures to curb the spread. The virus, which began in the central city of Wuhan, has now spread to much of east and south-east Asia, including South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Thailand and Vietnam. Three cases have been recorded in France and the health minister said more were expected In the UK, 2,000 travellers who have arrived recently from Wuhan are being sought. Fourteen people tested negative for the virus. Five people are being tested in the Australian state of New South Wales.

Others have evolved into more severe illnesses, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/24/lessons-from-sars-outbreak-help-in-race-for-coronavirus-vaccine\">Sars</a> and Mers, although so far the new virus does not appear to be nearly as deadly or contagious.</p> <p>Analyses by scientists such as Bedford have so far revealed that genetic sequences of the various strains of 2019-nCoV \u2013 the previously unknown coronavirus that is causing the current outbreak \u2013 that have been isolated in patients are remarkably similar to each other. This lack of genetic diversity suggests the common ancestor of these different strains only emerged recently, possibly in November or December. However, research does not yet say whether the recent rapid expansion of the virus took place in humans or in an animal reservoir. \u201cWe need to gain a better understanding what\u2019s going on in China,\u201d said Prof Jonathan Ball, of Nottingham University. \u201cIn particular, how the virus is being spread, whether individuals with mild or no symptoms can transmit the virus, and, of course, where the virus came from in the first place.\u201d</p> <p>Yesterday, England\u2019s chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, also warned that there was a \u201cfair chance\u201d cases will emerge in Britain as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/live/2020/jan/25/coronavirus-china-death-tolls-rises-to-41-as-france-confirms-three-cases\">overall number reported around the world climbed to almost 1,400.</a></p> <p>In a study published in the <em>Lancet</em> yesterday, researchers revealed details of analyses of the first 41 patients admitted to hospitals with confirmed cases of the infection. Two-thirds had been to a large seafood market that also sold wild animals for meat and is thought to be the place the virus jumped from an animal source to people.</p> <p>The median age of the patients was 49. All had pneumonia, most had fever and a cough. Some had fatigue; rarer symptoms included headache and diarrhoea. Most had been healthy until they contracted the virus.</p> <p>In another <em>Lancet</em> paper, scientists revealed the results of a study of five family members who had recently travelled to Wuhan and had contracted the virus.</p> <p>Alarmingly, one child with the virus did not show any symptoms. Until then, health authorities had said that people with the virus all showed symptoms of fevers and coughs. However, an asymptomatic infection changes that picture dramatically. \u201cBecause asymptomatic infection appears possible, controlling the epidemic will also rely on isolating patients, tracing and quarantining contacts as early as possible, educating the public on both food and personal hygiene, and ensuring healthcare workers comply with infection control,\u201d said research leader Dr Kwok-Yung Yuen of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Scientists are urgently seeking data to resolve one critically important aspect of the coronavirus outbreak that has killed at least 54 people and infected well over 1,000 since emerging in Wuhan, China. Researchers say they desperately need to find out whether most cases have been caused by repeated spillover of the virus from animals into humans, or whether most cases are now being triggered by secondary human-to-human transmission. \u201cThat would be the big epidemiological goal for everyone at the moment,\u201d Trevor Bedford, an evolutionary geneticist at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington, told the journal Nature. If most cases detected so far were caused by direct infections from animals, then there is a prospect the new epidemic could peter out fairly quickly. But if new cases are now being triggered by human-to-human transmission, the chances that a major global epidemic is now under way will be raised dramatically. Chinese president Xi Jinping has already warned that the spread of the deadly new virus is \u201caccelerating\u201d. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some of which cause the common cold. Others have evolved into more severe illnesses, such as Sars and Mers, although so far the new virus does not appear to be nearly as deadly or contagious. Analyses by scientists such as Bedford have so far revealed that genetic sequences of the various strains of 2019-nCoV \u2013 the previously unknown coronavirus that is causing the current outbreak \u2013 that have been isolated in patients are remarkably similar to each other. This lack of genetic diversity suggests the common ancestor of these different strains only emerged recently, possibly in November or December. However, research does not yet say whether the recent rapid expansion of the virus took place in humans or in an animal reservoir. \u201cWe need to gain a better understanding what\u2019s going on in China,\u201d said Prof Jonathan Ball, of Nottingham University. \u201cIn particular, how the virus is being spread, whether individuals with mild or no symptoms can transmit the virus, and, of course, where the virus came from in the first place.\u201d Yesterday, England\u2019s chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, also warned that there was a \u201cfair chance\u201d cases will emerge in Britain as the overall number reported around the world climbed to almost 1,400. In a study published in the Lancet yesterday, researchers revealed details of analyses of the first 41 patients admitted to hospitals with confirmed cases of the infection. Two-thirds had been to a large seafood market that also sold wild animals for meat and is thought to be the place the virus jumped from an animal source to people. The median age of the patients was 49. All had pneumonia, most had fever and a cough. Some had fatigue; rarer symptoms included headache and diarrhoea. Most had been healthy until they contracted the virus. In another Lancet paper, scientists revealed the results of a study of five family members who had recently travelled to Wuhan and had contracted the virus. Alarmingly, one child with the virus did not show any symptoms. Until then, health authorities had said that people with the virus all showed symptoms of fevers and coughs. However, an asymptomatic infection changes that picture dramatically. \u201cBecause asymptomatic infection appears possible, controlling the epidemic will also rely on isolating patients, tracing and quarantining contacts as early as possible, educating the public on both food and personal hygiene, and ensuring healthcare workers comply with infection control,\u201d said research leader Dr Kwok-Yung Yuen of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital.",
