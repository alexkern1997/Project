      "bodyText": "January and February are usually the busiest time of year for longtime Torres Strait fisherman Boggo Billy. Ordinarily, just before dawn or dusk, he would navigate out in a dinghy from his home on Warraber, a 37-hectare island between the top of Cape York and the southern coast of Papua New Guinea, which is home to around 250 people. The reefs around the island teem with life: b\u00eache-de-mer (sea cucumbers), dugongs, crabs and tropical rock lobsters that are usually worth around $70 a kilogram from middlemen supplying fish markets in China. Billy\u2019s local knowledge, inherited from generations before him, means he knows when \u201cthe good tides\u201d will roll in and what they mean for the crustaceans, which leaves him perfectly poised to capitalise on the boom brought on by lunar new year. But this year the boom was a bust. Live crayfish prices plummeted after the outbreak of coronavirus in December. China cancelled many lunar new year celebrations and banned the import of live seafood. On the Torres Strait, rock lobsters are the region\u2019s second-most valuable fishery and a vital source of income for people in small island communities. Now, Billy says, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to try and get many more crayfish to make $1,000\u201d. Rather than increasing the size of their catch, which could cause problems in the heavily regulated industry, most fishermen have chosen to stay ashore. \u201cMost of the fishermen have stopped going out now, because it seems like you can\u2019t make any money because of what\u2019s going on,\u201d he says. James Billy, another Warraber fisherman and a distant relation of Boggo Billy, sells his own catch plus fish he buys from other islanders to a Chinese buyer with a factory in Cairns. James Billy says prices for live crayfish have plummeted to $25 per kilogram, which means that after spending on fuel and equipment, it\u2019s difficult to turn a profit. As well as freediving in the shallower waters, James Billy also hookah dives. The method uses surface-supplied air to keep fishermen in deeper water for longer and is preferred by traditional fishers who hold traditional inhabitant business licenses. A day of hookah diving for lobster, James estimates, would mean a catch of 40kg to 50kg of crayfish and a profit of around $2,000 dollars in a strong market. For those who just freedive, the timing of the virus is especially bad because January and February are the months when the crayfish are most bountiful in shallow waters. \u201cThis is usually a time to load up and sell lots of crayfish,\u201d James Billy says. Boggo and James Billy both have day jobs which mean they can support their families despite the crash. But they say the huge loss of income from fisheries, and the uncertainty about when the market might return are a major cause of stress for the community. The situation isn\u2019t helped by the already inflated prices families have to pay for food on Warraber. \u201cWe\u2019re really worried. We\u2019ve got families to support, kids down mainland for school,\u201d Billy says. \u201cWe\u2019ll cross our fingers.\u201d Industry administrators and fishermen met to consider changes to the sea cucumber fishery as possible stop-gap measures, including lifting restrictions on other fisheries and allowable restrictions. James Billy says some fishermen on Warraber, and its sister island, Poruma, have already transitioned to catching lollyfish, a variety of sea cucumber that is abundant around both islands.

London\u2019s Gerrard Street on a Saturday night is usually the restaurant equivalent of a mosh pit: a heaving crowd of hungry people, the scent of scorched wok in their nostrils, and the reflection of the bronzed and shiny roast ducks that crowd the windows of Chinatown\u2019s main drag in their eyeballs. Tonight, there was a pre-cinema rush, which we got caught up in. But now it\u2019s gone 9pm. The pedestrianised street is sparsely populated and through the picture windows, chairs and tables sit forlorn and empty.

I didn\u2019t need to go to the branch of the <a href=\"http://www.fs-restaurants.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Four Seasons</a> at 12 Gerrard Street to write about it. I eat there alone about once a month, taking a yellow-clothed table in the corner of one of the plain dining rooms. It\u2019s often before going to record an episode of the <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01klvhq\" title=\"\">Kitchen Cabinet</a></em> for Radio 4, when having a good lunch is a grand idea: a plate of Cantonese roast meats of one sort or another, something green, a magazine to read. The food speaks directly to an intense, needy part of my appetite. I also like the brisk and efficient staff who greet me like a total stranger every time, despite the fact I\u2019ve been going for years. I\u2019ve mentioned it on this page and elsewhere before.</p> <p>So no, I really didn\u2019t need to go again. I know what they do and how well they do it. But this is an act of solidarity that also gets me roast duck. I was introduced to this Four Seasons by chef and writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/simon-hopkinson\" title=\"\">Simon Hopkinson</a>. He once told me the Chinese are the best at roasting ducks and that this is one of the best places for the best. I say this one, because it\u2019s a group, which started over on London\u2019s Queensway. There are now half a dozen, including one in Leicester and one literally next door, which specialises in hot pots. But I have my loyalties.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e128fc2bb162cb61900ff3694dc883e10a12c128\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e128fc2bb162cb61900ff3694dc883e10a12c128/501_384_4739_2844/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Salt and pepper squid with rings of red chilli on a round white plate\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Big curls in a fine and lacy batter\u2019: salt and pepper squid.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sometimes I have the cubed belly pork.

It\u2019s just a deep, reddy brown, and in pleasing thumb-thick pieces and is eye-rollingly savoury. It comes on a heap of Chinese cabbage with the obligatory moat of dark, sweet-savoury liquor, which could be sipped neat as a restorative. Sometimes, when I am by myself and I\u2019m convinced nobody is looking, I do just that, lifting the bowl to my lips as if it were a teacup. My motto: \u201cNo spoonful left behind.\u201d</p> <p>And then the roast duck \u2013 the skin dark lacquered, most of the fat rendered, the meat soft and sensuous to the tongue as if braised. Crispy duck with pancakes is the boisterous crowd-pleaser, and has its place.

London\u2019s Gerrard Street on a Saturday night is usually the restaurant equivalent of a mosh pit: a heaving crowd of hungry people, the scent of scorched wok in their nostrils, and the reflection of the bronzed and shiny roast ducks that crowd the windows of Chinatown\u2019s main drag in their eyeballs. Tonight, there was a pre-cinema rush, which we got caught up in. But now it\u2019s gone 9pm. The pedestrianised street is sparsely populated and through the picture windows, chairs and tables sit forlorn and empty. I\u2019ve never seen it like this before. After the Chinese New Year at the end of January, as news of the emerging coronavirus spread, \u201cbusiness just went down,\u201d says Jackie, duty manager of the Four Seasons at No 12, her hand making a swooping gesture like a plane crashing to ground. \u201cWe want the business back but we can\u2019t do anything about it,\u201d she says, with a sad shrug. \u201cPeople are scared.\u201d Because a nasty virus has broken out in a city 5,500 miles away from London, Britain\u2019s Chinese community is suffering.

      "body": "<p>The Chinese authorities are trying to usher the country back to work, a month after announcing the unprecedented <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/quarantine-history-following-china-wuhan-coronavirus-lockdowns-2020-1?r=US&amp;IR=T\" title=\"\">quarantine of millions of people</a>. But they face a difficult balancing act between containing the virus and supporting a faltering economy.</p> <p>Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak, have been the focus of disease prevention efforts. over the last four weeks. As the death toll climbed to more than 2,000 worldwide, and infections to over 75,000, the vast majority of cases were still inside that quarantined zone.</p> <p>But the disease had spread far across the country before <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-51523835\" title=\"\">Hubei was sealed off</a>, and some of the worst-affected places are the manufacturing and economic centres that power China\u2019s economy.</p> <p>Southern Guangdong province, just across from Hong Kong and home to international giants such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a247239a-53b9-11ea-8841-482eed0038b1\" title=\"\">Apple supplier Foxconn</a>, is the second-worst affected province after Hubei, with 1,339 cases of the coronavirus confirmed and five deaths.</p> <p>Eastern Zhejiang, near Shanghai, is the fourth most seriously hit, with 1,205 cases by , although only one death. It is also the base for companies including the hugely influential Alibaba, China\u2019s answer to Amazon and eBay.</p> <p>Those total numbers of infections are far above the 639 cases registered across all of China on 23 January, when Hubei was put on sudden lockdown.</p> <p>The situations are not directly comparable; coronavirus had been spreading almost unchecked in Wuhan for weeks before the quarantine, and overwhelmed hospitals appear to have sent patients home, only to spread the disease.</p> <p>Authorities in other areas started tracking cases much earlier and have better resources to isolate and treat those who fall sick, something reflected in a much lower death rate.</p> <p>The speed of the disease\u2019s spread is perhaps not surprising given Wuhan\u2019s position as a regional economic hub, with links to other key centres, and the fact that the coronavirus has proved contagious in the early days of infection when patients have few symptoms, making it hard to identify carriers as clusters spread.</p> <p>Yet China cannot afford for its factories to sit idle, or its restaurants and shops to stay empty indefinitely. Authorities were already worried about faltering growth after last year saw the slowest rate of expansion in almost three decades; <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51144892\" title=\"\">GDP growth </a>had not slid so low since 1990, when China was isolated in the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square massacre.</p> <p>An influential Chinese economist has already warned that the coronavirus crisis could slice a full percentage point off growth this year. So authorities are trying to balance two unfathomable risks \u2013 of either fuelling the coronavirus by pushing too much for normal routines, or paving the way for the collapse of their local economy by keeping everything on lockdown.</p> <p>Many small and medium companies in particular are already hovering on the brink, and a wave of bankruptcies is expected. Retail and hospitality companies expected bumper sales over the lunar new year, and even factories that closed for the holiday expected to reopen in early February.</p> <p>\u201cThis year our company isn\u2019t talking about the question of profit,\u201d Guangdong Meijie Group chief executive Luo Xiaohua told <em>China Business News</em>. \u201cOur main objective is just to survive.\u201d</p> <p>In Shenzhen, the border city that has come to rival Hong Kong, businesses have been told they can resume work immediately if they have virus control measures that include disinfecting, giving employees at least two masks a day, making temperature checks, and having their plans approved by local officials. There is already a gap between regulation and reality, however. \u201cWe started today, but the boss only gave us one mask when we all know he\u2019s supposed to give out two,\u201d said one 52-year-old woman employed at a Shenzhen factory making plastic items such as skateboard wheels, cups and toy parts.</p> <p>\u201cMy husband, who works at a restaurant near here, is also only getting one mask per day,\u201d she added, giving only her last name, Xiao, over fears of being fired or getting her boss into trouble.</p> <p>Getting employees back to their desk is a further problem for companies that are ready to re-open. Xiao, a migrant from Sichuan, said only about 20 of the factory\u2019s 50-strong workforce had returned from other parts of China. Overall, less than a third of the country\u2019s nearly <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3051445/coronavirus-chinas-east-coast-provinces-offer-chartered\" title=\"\">300 million migrant workers</a>, who power everything from factories to courier networks and restaurants, have returned to the cities from holidays in their home towns and villages, the country\u2019s transport minister said last week.</p> <p>Some are worried about the virus, others unsure if their jobs will be open, but many are struggling to get transport with strict new restrictions meant to slow the spread of the disease. Train tickets have been limited so that passengers aren\u2019t carried in close proximity, and many bus services have been cancelled.</p> <p>To try to counteract this, the Zhejiang province has provided 100 million yuan (\u00a311m) of subsidies to help people return, new tax policies to support business, and has even hired cars, buses and trains to transport employees back to work.</p> <p>One worker from the tech hub of Hangzhou, in a county where there have been 169 confirmed cases, said transport was less of a problem in an economy focused on higher skilled labour \u2013 \u201cwe don\u2019t have as many migrant workers in Hangzhou\u201d \u2013 but government efforts to get people back were encouraging.</p> <p>In the decision to get back to work, officials may also be weighing the accelerating spread of the coronavirus elsewhere as cases appear across the Middle East, and numbers grow closer to home in neighbouring Asian nations.</p> <p>Many infectious disease experts now believe it is likely to become a pandemic, and even the World Health Organisation director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, warned that the window for containment is \u201cnarrowing\u2019.</p> <p>If quarantine and business shutdowns can\u2019t stop Covid-19 in the way it halted Sars in 2003, its heavy cost on local economies \u2013 and populations \u2013 look far less defensible, both in China and beyond.</p> <p>\u201cYes, we want to stop (the) spread, but must start caring a lot more (about the) plight of over 50 million people in Hubei,\u201d said Lawrence Gostin, Professor of Medicine at Georgetown University and Professor of Public Health at the Johns Hopkins University, wrote on Twitter.</p> <p>\u201cOngoing threat to physical and mental health in Hubei is unconscionable \u2013 (people are) trapped together and fearful. Moreover, once quarantine ends, people in Hubei will flee. During the influenza pandemic of 1918, quarantines delayed the spread but over time made little difference.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Chinese authorities are trying to usher the country back to work, a month after announcing the unprecedented quarantine of millions of people. But they face a difficult balancing act between containing the virus and supporting a faltering economy. Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak, have been the focus of disease prevention efforts. over the last four weeks. As the death toll climbed to more than 2,000 worldwide, and infections to over 75,000, the vast majority of cases were still inside that quarantined zone. But the disease had spread far across the country before Hubei was sealed off, and some of the worst-affected places are the manufacturing and economic centres that power China\u2019s economy. Southern Guangdong province, just across from Hong Kong and home to international giants such as Apple supplier Foxconn, is the second-worst affected province after Hubei, with 1,339 cases of the coronavirus confirmed and five deaths. Eastern Zhejiang, near Shanghai, is the fourth most seriously hit, with 1,205 cases by , although only one death. It is also the base for companies including the hugely influential Alibaba, China\u2019s answer to Amazon and eBay. Those total numbers of infections are far above the 639 cases registered across all of China on 23 January, when Hubei was put on sudden lockdown. The situations are not directly comparable; coronavirus had been spreading almost unchecked in Wuhan for weeks before the quarantine, and overwhelmed hospitals appear to have sent patients home, only to spread the disease. Authorities in other areas started tracking cases much earlier and have better resources to isolate and treat those who fall sick, something reflected in a much lower death rate. The speed of the disease\u2019s spread is perhaps not surprising given Wuhan\u2019s position as a regional economic hub, with links to other key centres, and the fact that the coronavirus has proved contagious in the early days of infection when patients have few symptoms, making it hard to identify carriers as clusters spread. Yet China cannot afford for its factories to sit idle, or its restaurants and shops to stay empty indefinitely. Authorities were already worried about faltering growth after last year saw the slowest rate of expansion in almost three decades; GDP growth had not slid so low since 1990, when China was isolated in the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square massacre. An influential Chinese economist has already warned that the coronavirus crisis could slice a full percentage point off growth this year. So authorities are trying to balance two unfathomable risks \u2013 of either fuelling the coronavirus by pushing too much for normal routines, or paving the way for the collapse of their local economy by keeping everything on lockdown. Many small and medium companies in particular are already hovering on the brink, and a wave of bankruptcies is expected. Retail and hospitality companies expected bumper sales over the lunar new year, and even factories that closed for the holiday expected to reopen in early February. \u201cThis year our company isn\u2019t talking about the question of profit,\u201d Guangdong Meijie Group chief executive Luo Xiaohua told China Business News. \u201cOur main objective is just to survive.\u201d In Shenzhen, the border city that has come to rival Hong Kong, businesses have been told they can resume work immediately if they have virus control measures that include disinfecting, giving employees at least two masks a day, making temperature checks, and having their plans approved by local officials. There is already a gap between regulation and reality, however. \u201cWe started today, but the boss only gave us one mask when we all know he\u2019s supposed to give out two,\u201d said one 52-year-old woman employed at a Shenzhen factory making plastic items such as skateboard wheels, cups and toy parts. \u201cMy husband, who works at a restaurant near here, is also only getting one mask per day,\u201d she added, giving only her last name, Xiao, over fears of being fired or getting her boss into trouble. Getting employees back to their desk is a further problem for companies that are ready to re-open. Xiao, a migrant from Sichuan, said only about 20 of the factory\u2019s 50-strong workforce had returned from other parts of China. Overall, less than a third of the country\u2019s nearly 300 million migrant workers, who power everything from factories to courier networks and restaurants, have returned to the cities from holidays in their home towns and villages, the country\u2019s transport minister said last week. Some are worried about the virus, others unsure if their jobs will be open, but many are struggling to get transport with strict new restrictions meant to slow the spread of the disease. Train tickets have been limited so that passengers aren\u2019t carried in close proximity, and many bus services have been cancelled. To try to counteract this, the Zhejiang province has provided 100 million yuan (\u00a311m) of subsidies to help people return, new tax policies to support business, and has even hired cars, buses and trains to transport employees back to work. One worker from the tech hub of Hangzhou, in a county where there have been 169 confirmed cases, said transport was less of a problem in an economy focused on higher skilled labour \u2013 \u201cwe don\u2019t have as many migrant workers in Hangzhou\u201d \u2013 but government efforts to get people back were encouraging. In the decision to get back to work, officials may also be weighing the accelerating spread of the coronavirus elsewhere as cases appear across the Middle East, and numbers grow closer to home in neighbouring Asian nations. Many infectious disease experts now believe it is likely to become a pandemic, and even the World Health Organisation director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, warned that the window for containment is \u201cnarrowing\u2019. If quarantine and business shutdowns can\u2019t stop Covid-19 in the way it halted Sars in 2003, its heavy cost on local economies \u2013 and populations \u2013 look far less defensible, both in China and beyond. \u201cYes, we want to stop (the) spread, but must start caring a lot more (about the) plight of over 50 million people in Hubei,\u201d said Lawrence Gostin, Professor of Medicine at Georgetown University and Professor of Public Health at the Johns Hopkins University, wrote on Twitter. \u201cOngoing threat to physical and mental health in Hubei is unconscionable \u2013 (people are) trapped together and fearful. Moreover, once quarantine ends, people in Hubei will flee. During the influenza pandemic of 1918, quarantines delayed the spread but over time made little difference.\u201d",

As the nation struggled on Sunday to contain the deadly Covid-19 outbreak in the city of Daegu, the president described the coming days as \u201ca very important moment\u201d, the news agency Yonhap said. The government would bolster its fight against the virus by raising the alert level one notch to the highest of \u201cred\u201d, he told an emergency meeting of agencies in Seoul on Sunday. The president said the government and the local authorities should not hesitate to take \u201cunprecedented powerful\u201d measures to contain the viral disease without being limited by \u201cregulations\u201d. Of the 123 new cases, 75 are related to the Shincheonji church in the country\u2019s fourth-largest city of Daegu and a neighbouring hospital. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it has placed more than 9,000 Shincheonji members in self-quarantine and thousands of worshippers have been screened for the virus. It came as a Japanese government minister apologised after a woman allowed to leave the coronavirus-hit cruise ship Diamond Princess on Wednesday tested positive for the infection on Saturday, raising more questions about the country\u2019s management of the outbreak. In South Korea, the government has tried to contain the outbreak by declaring Daegu and its adjacent county Cheongdo \u201cspecial care zones\u201d. But that did not stop the number of infections more than doubling in a single day on Saturday. So far South Korea had released 18 fully recovered novel coronavirus patients from hospitals, the KCDC said. The number of people being checked for the virus and under quarantine came to 6,039 on Sunday morning, the KCDC said. The country has tested 22,633 suspected cases; 16,038 tested negative. South Korea confirmed its first new coronavirus case from a Chinese woman from Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus outbreak, on 20 January. The country\u2019s 31st patient, a probable \u201csuper spreader\u201d, had attended the Shincheonji church\u2019s worship services. In a rare public message on Saturday night, the prime minister, Chung Sye-kyun, reassured people that the virus could be contained if the public cooperated with the government\u2019s instructions. On Sunday Daegu\u2019s mayor, Kwon Young-jin, advised locals to stay indoors and said: \u201cThe crisis level of Daegu and the North Gyeongsang province is grave.\u201d He asked all Shincheonji members with symptoms to come forward and be tested. \u201cHiding is not the answer,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you hide, it could hurt your health, your family\u2019s health, and will not help in the early cessation of the situation.\u201d China\u2019s death toll from the virus rose to 2,442 on Sunday after the government said 97 more people had died, all but one in the epicentre of Hubei province. The national health commission also confirmed another 648 new cases. Most of the deaths and new infections were in Hubei\u2019s provincial capital, Wuhan, where the virus first emerged in December. China\u2019s total infections reached 76,936, the commission said in its daily update. The coronavirus has spread to more than 25 countries and is causing mounting alarm due to outbreaks in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. China\u2019s numbers of daily new infections are well down from the outbreak\u2019s early height. But China has sowed confusion about the data by repeatedly changing its counting methods. On Saturday the US state department raised its travel advisory to South Korea. US citizens were asked to \u201cexercise increased caution\u201d when travelling to South Korea, where \u201csustained community spread\u201d has been reported. \u201cSustained community spread means that people in South Korea have been infected with the virus, but how or where they became infected is not known, and the spread is ongoing,\u201d the department said on its website. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also issued an \u201calert level 2\u201d travel notice, saying \u201colder adults and those with chronic medical conditions should consider postponing nonessential travel\u201d. Britain has also advised its nationals \u201cagainst all but essential travel to Daegu and Cheongdo\u201d, and Israel refused to allow non-Israelis to disembark from a plane that departed from South Korea on Saturday.",

      "body": "<p>Iranian society is physically and politically sick, the youngest son of Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, one of the principal architects of the Iranian revolution, has said in a rare interview.</p> <p>Yasser Rafsanjani reflected on the sweeping gains made by the conservatives on a record low turnout of 42 % at the weekend\u2019s parliamentary elections. He said democracy in Iran had been \u201ccastrated\u201d by forces outside parliament, including the militia.</p> <p>Rafsanjani also said some conservative hardliners in his country were as bad as Donald Trump\u2019s supporters, but he called for dialogue between the US and Iran to resolve the standoff over the nuclear deal.</p> <p>Akbar Rafsanjani was a hugely powerful figure in post-revolutionary Iran. Serving as commander-in-chief during the Iran-Iraq war and later president, he chose Ali Khamenei as the supreme leader. As a member of one of the most well-known political families in post-revolutionary Iran, Yasser Rafsanjani\u2019s comments underline the deep and unresolved divisions within Iranian society.</p> <p>Critics said the conservatives\u2019 triumph in the parliamentary elections was an engineered victory that left reformists and opposition members with tough choices about how to conduct politics in the future. Many prominent reformists were barred from standing by the Guardian Council, the 12-strong body of jurists and clerics who are largely answerable to Khamenei.</p> <p>Blame has been freely distributed over the mass abstention, despite the leadership\u2019s insistence that religious duty required Iranians to vote.</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian at the house in north Tehran where his father lived for 35 years, Yasser Rafsanjani said: \u201cPeople vote when they think it will create change. The people felt they kept sending a message to the government but they are not heard. In the last elections, people voted for a parliament to bring change, and it did not happen but there are forces outside the parliament \u2013 politicians, military guards \u2013 that limit the power of the parliament.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cDemocracy has become a eunuch. It has been castrated. Our society is somehow sick. We are infected by viruses \u2026 such as coronavirus but also a societal virus where people do not respect others.\u201d</p> <p>His father was first elected president in 1989, serving two terms to 1997 before rejoining the parliament in 2000. He was then elected to the 86-strong committee of experts and became its chairman in 2007. He was disqualified from standing for the presidency in 2013.</p> <p>Yasser Rafsanjani insisted that if his father, a writer as well as a politician, was still alive, he would be deeply disappointed. However, he would still try to provide hope for Iranian society as he had throughout his lifetime, and would be advocating contact with other countries, Rafsanjani said.</p> <p>\u201cMy father said to President Hassan Rouhani when he signed the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPOA), or the Iranian nuclear deal, this agreement has four main enemies: the Arab countries that have enough money to spend, Israel lobbying in the US, Republican hardliners in the US and hardliners in Iran. The hardliners in the US and Iran have in effect been cooperating with one another.</p> <p>\u201cNow with these elections it shows the Iranian hardliners are getting stronger.\u201d</p> <p>Although he admitted the election results could be interpreted as a signal Iran was retreating from involvement with the west, and that the scope for President Rouhani with Iran\u2019s new parliament was restricted, he stressed the importance of ongoing dialogue.</p> <p>\u201cI believe in negotiations, and the JCPOA showed if you want to talk to the world you have go to the table,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes I tell some of my friends that we would have had to face Donald Trump, with or without the JCPOA, and if anything it helps prevent some of his most insane illegal acts.\u201d</p> <p>Rafsanjani repeatedly described Trump as insane and accused him of assassinating Iran\u2019s most senior general, Qassem Suleimani, to further his re-election campaign. But he did not rule out talking to the US while sanctions remained in place.</p> <p>He said: \u201cI accept negotiations at any time. When we signed the JCPOA in 2015, our economy began to grow, and it did so year after year.\u201d</p> <p>The Rafsanjani children have found themselves in repeated difficulty with the regime, even before their father\u2019s death in 2017. Moshen, one of Yasser\u2019s brothers, and his sister Faezeh Hashemi were sent to Tehran jail in 2012.</p> <p>Faezeh recently called for the ayatollah to resign, and proposed that a woman stand in the presidential elections next year. Aides said interviews with the foreign press were being blocked.</p> <p>A second brother, Mehdi Hashemi, was jailed for 15 years on corruption charges in 2015 and barred from holding public office.</p> <p>Before heading to visit his brother in prison, Yasser said throwing people into jail for their beliefs was not the answer. \u201cMy father always said you can eradicate bodies but you cannot delete ideas.\u201d</p>",

Rafsanjani also said some conservative hardliners in his country were as bad as Donald Trump\u2019s supporters, but he called for dialogue between the US and Iran to resolve the standoff over the nuclear deal. Akbar Rafsanjani was a hugely powerful figure in post-revolutionary Iran. Serving as commander-in-chief during the Iran-Iraq war and later president, he chose Ali Khamenei as the supreme leader. As a member of one of the most well-known political families in post-revolutionary Iran, Yasser Rafsanjani\u2019s comments underline the deep and unresolved divisions within Iranian society. Critics said the conservatives\u2019 triumph in the parliamentary elections was an engineered victory that left reformists and opposition members with tough choices about how to conduct politics in the future. Many prominent reformists were barred from standing by the Guardian Council, the 12-strong body of jurists and clerics who are largely answerable to Khamenei. Blame has been freely distributed over the mass abstention, despite the leadership\u2019s insistence that religious duty required Iranians to vote. Speaking to the Guardian at the house in north Tehran where his father lived for 35 years, Yasser Rafsanjani said: \u201cPeople vote when they think it will create change. The people felt they kept sending a message to the government but they are not heard. In the last elections, people voted for a parliament to bring change, and it did not happen but there are forces outside the parliament \u2013 politicians, military guards \u2013 that limit the power of the parliament.\u201d He added: \u201cDemocracy has become a eunuch. It has been castrated. Our society is somehow sick. We are infected by viruses \u2026 such as coronavirus but also a societal virus where people do not respect others.\u201d His father was first elected president in 1989, serving two terms to 1997 before rejoining the parliament in 2000. He was then elected to the 86-strong committee of experts and became its chairman in 2007. He was disqualified from standing for the presidency in 2013. Yasser Rafsanjani insisted that if his father, a writer as well as a politician, was still alive, he would be deeply disappointed. However, he would still try to provide hope for Iranian society as he had throughout his lifetime, and would be advocating contact with other countries, Rafsanjani said. \u201cMy father said to President Hassan Rouhani when he signed the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPOA), or the Iranian nuclear deal, this agreement has four main enemies: the Arab countries that have enough money to spend, Israel lobbying in the US, Republican hardliners in the US and hardliners in Iran. The hardliners in the US and Iran have in effect been cooperating with one another. \u201cNow with these elections it shows the Iranian hardliners are getting stronger.\u201d Although he admitted the election results could be interpreted as a signal Iran was retreating from involvement with the west, and that the scope for President Rouhani with Iran\u2019s new parliament was restricted, he stressed the importance of ongoing dialogue. \u201cI believe in negotiations, and the JCPOA showed if you want to talk to the world you have go to the table,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes I tell some of my friends that we would have had to face Donald Trump, with or without the JCPOA, and if anything it helps prevent some of his most insane illegal acts.\u201d Rafsanjani repeatedly described Trump as insane and accused him of assassinating Iran\u2019s most senior general, Qassem Suleimani, to further his re-election campaign. But he did not rule out talking to the US while sanctions remained in place. He said: \u201cI accept negotiations at any time. When we signed the JCPOA in 2015, our economy began to grow, and it did so year after year.\u201d The Rafsanjani children have found themselves in repeated difficulty with the regime, even before their father\u2019s death in 2017. Moshen, one of Yasser\u2019s brothers, and his sister Faezeh Hashemi were sent to Tehran jail in 2012. Faezeh recently called for the ayatollah to resign, and proposed that a woman stand in the presidential elections next year. Aides said interviews with the foreign press were being blocked. A second brother, Mehdi Hashemi, was jailed for 15 years on corruption charges in 2015 and barred from holding public office. Before heading to visit his brother in prison, Yasser said throwing people into jail for their beliefs was not the answer. \u201cMy father always said you can eradicate bodies but you cannot delete ideas.\u201d",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>More than half of all South Korean cases so far have been linked to the Daegu branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus sect, with over 100 more cases coming from a mental health ward at Daenam hopital in the nearby town of Cheongdo.</p> \n<p>Officials believe cases at the hospital may be related to a funeral of the sect leader\u2019s brother, held there at the beginning of February.</p> \n<p>While the exact source of the infections remains unclear, health officials have pointed to a 61-year-old female member of the sect who tested positive on 18 February. Local authorities are now scrambling to trace all 9,336 members of the church\u2019s Daegu branch as well as out of town visitors who may have come into contact with the woman.</p> \n<p>A taxi driver, Kwang-ho Lee, wondered why the woman hadn\u2019t done more to stop spreading the disease.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s ruining everyone here,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m making less than 10% of my normal income.

No one has the peace of mind to flip through them now.\u201d South Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, placed the country on red alert on Sunday as its number of coronavirus infections tripled over the weekend to 602. Barring the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan, South Korea now has the highest number of infections outside China. Residents of Daegu, the country\u2019s fourth-largest city and the centre of its outbreak, are leaving nothing to chance. The city\u2019s streets were eerily quiet, with stores and restaurants closed and stations, markets and shopping areas devoid of the usual foot traffic. The few people who dared to venture out were masked and wearing gloves. More than half of all South Korean cases so far have been linked to the Daegu branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus sect, with over 100 more cases coming from a mental health ward at Daenam hopital in the nearby town of Cheongdo. Officials believe cases at the hospital may be related to a funeral of the sect leader\u2019s brother, held there at the beginning of February. While the exact source of the infections remains unclear, health officials have pointed to a 61-year-old female member of the sect who tested positive on 18 February. Local authorities are now scrambling to trace all 9,336 members of the church\u2019s Daegu branch as well as out of town visitors who may have come into contact with the woman. A taxi driver, Kwang-ho Lee, wondered why the woman hadn\u2019t done more to stop spreading the disease. \u201cIt\u2019s ruining everyone here,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m making less than 10% of my normal income. The other drivers and I are just standing around, waiting all day. Sometimes we\u2019re even too scared to talk to each other because we don\u2019t know who has the virus and who might belong to that cult.\u201d There is widespread anger over the sect\u2019s secretiveness and their apparent unwillingness to cooperate with health officials. According to the authorities, more than 600 members of the Daegu branch are not answering calls or texts and cannot be accounted for. A petition demanding that the government forcibly disband the Shincheonji Church of Jesus was posted on the presidential office\u2019s website on Friday, and has so far attracted more than 300,000 signatures. The public fury directed at both the sect and the authorities was echoed by a bus driver, whose vehicle carried a single passenger. \u201cIf I violate a traffic law, police contact me before the day is over and I get fined,\u201d he said. \u201cHow come they can\u2019t get hold of so many cult members? How can we say South Korea is an IT powerhouse with this going on?\u201d At Dongseung-ro, a popular meeting place for the city\u2019s youth, things were quiet and most of the stores and cafes were closed. Sung-jin Choi and Yoon Na, a couple in their twenties, had decided to go out, masked up and with gloves on. \u201cWe saw on the internet that now is the time to experience this area looking like Gotham City, so we decided to have a look,\u201d said Choi. Na said that some couples were choosing not to meet up because no one is sure whether their partner belonged to the cult. \u201cOnly couples who know each other very well can be sure,\u201d he added. One of the few places in Daegu where more than 20 people had congregated on Sunday was at the city\u2019s medical centre. The hospital has become a dedicated Covid-19 treatment centre, with paramedics and nurses working in full biohazard suits and plastic face visors. Some 30 people were waiting to be examined in a makeshift tent set up outside the main hospital building. Despite the constant activity by staffers, things were curiously quiet, the silence broken only by the comings and goings of ambulances and the odd cough. On the other side of the city, the Shincheonji Church of Jesus building was locked up and the area, as with other parts of Daegu, was deserted. Simon Kim, a spokesman for the church, said it was cooperating fully with authorities. \u201cWe\u2019re the biggest victims of the Covid-19 epidemic,\u201d he said, \u201c[and we have] become a target of hatred\u201d. He said a membership list the church had given the authorities had been leaked, provoking hate speech and members being pressured to leave their jobs. Back at the train station, a group of five people sat around the communal TV set in the ticket hall. All turned out to be workers rather than travellers; given the lack of customers, there was little need for them to be behind their counters. When one of them coughed, the others turned away from the screen to look at her. \u201cIt\u2019s not corona,\u201d she said, with a wave of her hand. \u201cMy tea went down the wrong way.\u201d No one looked relieved.",

<p>Despite a decline in cases from China it is \u201cextremely concerning\u201d to see developments elsewhere, experts have said.</p> \n  <p>Prof Paul Hunter from the University of East Anglia (UEA), said: \u201cThe dramatic increase in case in South Korea most of which are associated with a religious sect has been unprecedented so far in the epidemic.

Here are a selection of them, including whether we should panic: </p> \n  <h2><strong>What is Covid-19 - the illness that started in Wuhan?</strong></h2> \n  <p>It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.</p> \n  <h2><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></h2> \n  <p>The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.</p> \n  <h2><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></h2> \n  <p>UK Chief Medical Officers are advising anyone who has travelled to the UK from mainland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a>, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the last 14 days and who is experiencing a cough or fever or shortness of breath to stay indoors and call NHS 111, even if symptoms are mild.</p> \n  <h2><strong>Is the outbreak a pandemic?</strong></h2> \n  <p>A pandemic, in WHO terms, is \u201cthe worldwide spread of a disease\u201d. Coronavirus cases have been confirmed outside China, but by no means in all 195 countries on the WHO\u2019s list. It is also not spreading within those countries at the moment, except in a very few cases. By far the majority of cases are travellers who picked up the virus in China.</p> \n  <h2><strong>Should we panic?</strong></h2> \n  <p>No. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/jan/30/coronavirus-what-other-public-health-emergencies-has-the-who-declared\">declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency</a> of international concern. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people, and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e5240a38f08e13324748757\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-23T09:16:13.778Z\">9.16am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In South Korea\u2019s fourth-biggest city, Daegu, 90 new cases were confirmed on Sunday, bringing the city\u2019s total to 247. <br></p> \n  <p>More than half of the people confirmed to have been infected are either members of \u2013 or connected to \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/world/asia/south-korea-coronavirus-shincheonji.html\">the Shincheonji Church of Jesus</a>, a secretive religious sect with a strong presence in Daegu. </p> \n  <p>The mayor asked all Shincheonji members with symptoms to come forward and be tested, with hundreds yet to be reached by authorities.<br></p> \n  <p>Moon described the situation in Daegu and Cheongdo \u2013 the birthplace of Shincheonji\u2019s founder Lee Man-hee \u2013 as a \u201cnational crisis\u201d, adding the cities would receive \u201cfull support\u201d for any lacking medical supplies and personnel.</p> \n  <p>Shincheonji, accused of being a cult by mainstream Christian groups, claims its founder has donned the mantle of Jesus Christ and will take 144,000 people with him to heaven on judgment day.</p> \n  <p>But with more church members than available places in heaven, they are said to have to compete for slots and pursue converts.</p> \n  <p>In a video statement read out by its spokesman, Shincheonji apologised for \u201ccausing concern\u201d, but insisted it was cooperating with health authorities for the \u201cearly cessation\u201d of the situation.</p> \n  <p>The spokesman refuted public criticism blaming his church over the spike in the number of infections, noting the virus had broken out in China. \u201cPlease be aware that the Shincheonji Church of Jesus and its members are the biggest victims of the COVID-19,\u201d he said.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-23T10:38:09.905Z\">at 10.38am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e523fd38f0811db2fafccc6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/robinmckie\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-23T09:03:53.776Z\">9.03am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A repatriation flight carrying 32 Britons and Europeans from the coronavirus-infected cruise ship Diamond Princess landed in the UK on Saturday \u2013 amid growing fears for the welfare of some UK passengers left behind in Japan.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/23/coronavirus-cruise-ship-diamond-princess-passengers-land-in-uk\">Passengers from coronavirus-hit cruise ship Diamond Princess land in UK</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e523eb98f0811db2fafccc3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-23T09:00:46.882Z\">9.00am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">South Korea spike in cases leads president to raise alert level to 'highest'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>President Moon Jae-in said South Korea was raising its alert level on the new coronavirus to the \u201chighest\u201d in the face of a sudden spike in the number of infections.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n  <p>\u201cThe Covid-19 incident faces a grave turning point.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s Angela Giuffrida, Patrick Wintour and Sam Jones\u2019s roundup of today\u2019s coronavirus developments across the globe. Four of the 32 British and Irish Diamond Princess cruise ship passengers taken to Arrowe Park, Merseyside on Saturday have tested positive for coronavirus strain Covid-19, the chief medical officer for England has said. Prof Chris Whitty said: \u201cFour further patients in England have tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of cases in the UK to 13. \u201cThe virus was passed on in the Diamond Princess cruise ship and the patients are being transferred from Arrowe Park to specialist NHS infection centres.\u201d We are pausing the live blog now but will update it again is there are more major developments. There have been a lot of updates today in terms of how the coronavirus is spreading and what measures are being taken to stop it. Here is a summary of the main points. Turkey and Pakistan have closed their borders with Iran in an effort to stop the potential spread of coronavirus. It comes after Iran reported 43 cases of the disease and eight deaths. Turkey will also be halting incoming flights and said all highways and railways at the border would shut at 5pm local time. A provincial official in Pakistan and the country\u2019s Frontier Corps confirmed that it had also sealed its land border with Iran. More than 100 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Italy, as the government adopts measures to limit the spread of the outbreak. Milan\u2019s mayor, Giuseppe Sala, announced that all schools would be closed from Monday. Universities in both Lombardy and Veneto have also been shuttered until early March. Italians across the country\u2019s north prepared for weeks of quarantine on Sunday as lockdown measures hit tens of thousands. Over 50,000 residents in 11 towns \u2013 10 in Lombardy and one in the neighbouring region of Veneto \u2013 now face what the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said on Saturday could be weeks of lockdown. The final two days of the Venice carnival have been cancelled because of the coronavirus outbreak. Fashion week in Milan was also also affected and Giorgio Armani, whose show was scheduled for 4pm on Sunday afternoon, announced on Saturday night that guests should not come to the venue. Instead, the collection would be shown to an empty room. In the UK, 118 people flown out of Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak, were leaving Kents Hill Park training and conference centre in Milton Keynes on Sunday for the first time in 14 days. They had been quarantined there. The European Union sees \u201cno need to panic\u201d over a coronavirus outbreak in Italy that has killed two people and infected more than 100 in the country. The bloc\u2019s economic affairs commissioner, Paolo Gentiloni, said: \u201cThe EU has full confidence in the Italian authorities and the decisions they are taking.\u201d \u201cWe share concern for possible contagion [but] there is no need to panic.\u201d Venice carnival will close early this year due to concerns about the coronavirus, which has spread in northern Italy. Below is a photograph of a police officer wearing a protective face mask and standing next to a masked carnival reveller at the event. The Bank of Japan governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, has said that if the virus outbreak persists it may have a big impact on Japan and global economies through supply chain disruptions. France should produce more vital goods, such as drugs and electric batteries, as the coronavirus outbreak highlights the danger of relying on imports from China, the country\u2019s finance minister said. Bruno Le Maire spoke to Reuters on Sunday as the virus spread in Europe, with Italy particularly affected. Le Maire said the emergency called for accelerating a shift in industrial policy towards making key goods within national or European Union borders, using state aid when necessary. \u201cIt\u2019s not protectionism, it\u2019s just responsibility,\u201d he said on the sidelines of a meeting of financial leaders in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. \u201cIt costs a lot at the starting point so you need the support of public funding. China is doing the same, the United States are doing the same, I don\u2019t know why Europe would not do the same for strategic assets like electric batteries.\u201d The Irish singer Rebecca Harkin is among those who have been evacuated from the Coronavirus-stricken Diamond Princess. The musician is now in quarantine in Australia. She and her partner were working as musicians on the ship and were evacuated to Australia along with many others. They will spend two weeks in quarantine in Darwin. Pakistan has closed its land border with Iran, as Afghanistan suspends travel to the neighbouring country amid concerns about the growing numbers of people being infected by new coronavirus. \u201cTo prevent the spread of the novel \u001dcoronavirus and protect the public, Afghanistan suspends all passenger movement (air and ground) to and from Iran,\u201d the office of the National Security Council of Afghanistan said in a statement posted on Twitter. A provincial official in Pakistan and the country\u2019s Frontier Corps also confirmed that the country had sealed the land border with Iran. Iran has now had eight deaths from the virus, the highest toll of any country outside China. The latest three deaths reported on Sunday were among 15 new confirmed cases of the COVID-19 virus, bringing the overall number of infections to 43. Four new infections surfaced in the capital Tehran, seven in the holy city of Qom, two in Gilan and one each in Markazi and Tonekabon, health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said. Authorities have ordered as a \u201cpreventive measure\u201d the closure of schools, universities and other educational centres in 14 provinces across Iran from Sunday. Afghanistan and Pakistan share porous borders with Iran that are often used by smugglers and human traffickers, while millions of Afghan refugees currently live in the Islamic Republic. Fears were raised that the virus could easily spread over the border. Health authorities said that 18 of the 39 South Koreans from the south-eastern region who had made a group pilgrimage to sites in Israel later tested positive for the virus. Israel\u2019s foreign ministry issued added warnings about travel to South Korea and Japan due to the coronavirus, and the health ministry is ordering Israelis returning from those countries to remain in home quarantine. This was previously ordered for those returning from Hong Kong, China, Macau, Thailand and Singapore. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, will be adding additional restrictions on entry to Israel from countries including Australia and Japan. Iran has seen the lowest parliamentary election turnout since 1979, with senior figures blaming the new coronavirus outbreak. \u201cThe turnout across the country was 42.57% ... In Tehran, it was around 25%. Across Iran, over 24 million people voted,\u201d interior minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli told a televised news conference. The final results showed big gains by hardline loyalists close to the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the last say on all state matters. Khamenei, who on Friday said that voting was \u201ca religious duty\u201d, blamed the low turnout on the \u201cnegative propaganda\u201d about the new coronavirus by Iran\u2019s enemies. \u201cThis negative propaganda about the virus began a couple of months ago and grew larger ahead of the election,\u201d said Khamenei, according to his official website. \u201cTheir media did not miss the tiniest opportunity for dissuading Iranian voters and resorting to the excuse of disease and the virus.\u201d The turnout is seen as a referendum on the popularity of the Islamic Republic\u2019s rulers. It was 62% in the 2016 parliamentary vote and 66% of voters cast ballots in 2012. Giuseppe Conte says cases of the the Covid-19 virus in Italy have risen dramatically in the past two days. The prime minister told a press conference Italy would not try and suspend the Schengen treaty as such a draconian measure would be disproportionate. Schools in Milan will be closed, however, and people will not be allowed in and out of affected areas. Social and sporting events in Lombardy and Veneto have also been cancelled. As of Sunday morning, there were 89 confirmed coronavirus cases in Lombardy (with two in its industrial centre, Milan) 16 in Veneto, three in Piedmont (including two in Turin) and two in Emilia-Romagna The virus can be spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Hand-washing is a first line of defence Here is a roundup of the areas where cases of Covid-19, the virus\u2019s official designation, have been confirmed: China: 77,000 people have been infected and 2,442 have died. South Korea: 602 people have been infected by the virus and five people have died. Japan: more than 130 people have been infected and four have died. Singapore: 85 people infected. Thailand: 35 cases. Malaysia: 22 cases. Taiwan: 26 cases, including one death. Australia: 17 cases. Vietnam: 16 cases. Philippines: three cases, including one death. India: three cases Nepal: one case. Sri Lanka: one case. Cambodia: one case United States: 35 cases. Canada: eight cases. Italy: 132 cases, two deaths. Germany: 16 cases. France: 12, including one death. Britain: nine cases. Russia: five cases. Spain: two cases. Finland: one case. Sweden: one case. Belgium: one case. Iran: 43, eight deaths, the largest number of fatalities of any country outside China. United Arab Emirates: 11 cases Israel: one case. Lebanon: one case. Egypt: one case. Turkey will close its border with Iran as a precautionary measure to halt the possible spread of coronavirus. It comes after reports emerged of 43 cases of the disease in Iran, with eight deaths \u2013 the highest death toll outside of China. The Turkish health minister Fahrettin Koca said on Sunday that all highways and railways would be closed as of 5pm (14.00 GMT). Flights from Iran were suspended, he told reporters. The Japanese government faces growing questions about whether it is doing enough to counter the coronavirus, after 773 cases were announced by early Sunday evening. Most of the infected people were from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was quarantined near Tokyo. A third passenger from the ship \u2013 a Japanese man in his 80s \u2013 died on Sunday. The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, instructed government agencies to urgently prepare medical provisions and draft a comprehensive plan to curb the spread. Jordan will not allow entry to citizens of China, Iran and South Korea and other foreigners travelling from those countries in response to the deadly coronavirus outbreak. The minister of state for media affairs, Amjad Adayleh, said the decision was part of \u201cpre-emptive measures ... following the rise in cases of coronavirus in South Korea, Iran\u201d and China. Adayleh said the ban would be \u201ctemporary\u201d and imposed on all non-Jordanians coming from the three nations among the worst affected by the illness. \u201cJordanians who come from those countries will be placed in quarantine for two weeks to ensure they have not contracted the coronavirus,\u201d he said. Milan fashion week has also been affected by the outbreak. Giorgio Armani, whose show was scheduled for 4pm on Sunday afternoon, announced on Saturday night that guests should not come to the venue. Instead, the collection would be shown to an empty room. \u201cThe decision was taken to safeguard the wellbeing of all his [Armani\u2019s] invited guests by not having them attend crowded spaces,\u201d said a press release. On Sunday, the head of the civil protection department, Angelo Borrelli, said during a press conference that thousands of beds were at the ready in military barracks or hotels to house quarantined or sick individuals, if needed. The number of those infected with the virus had now grown to 132, including the two people who died, Borrelli said. Italians across the country\u2019s north prepared for weeks of quarantine on Sunday as lockdown measures hit tens of thousands. More than 100 cases have now been reported in Italy, with two deaths from the virus since Friday. Most of the reports centred around the small town of Codogno, about 43 miles (70km) south-east of Milan. Over 50,000 residents in eleven towns - 10 in Lombardy and one in the neighbouring region of Veneto - now face what prime minister Giuseppe Conte said on Saturday could be weeks of lockdown. In Casalpusterlengo, a 10-minute drive from Codogno, locals lined up outside supermarkets wearing facemasks. Photographs emerged showing them gathering supplies. Shoppers were made to wait, then allowed to enter in groups of 40 inside the store to stock up on provisions. \u201cIt\u2019s inhuman,\u201d said one man, speaking to AFP, who gave his name as Sante. \u201cFighting over four sandwiches is just disgusting.\u201d Another woman, Emanuela, told AFP-TV that residents were nervous. \u201cI\u2019m really scared. We\u2019re going through a really tough situation,\u201d said the woman, a nurse who works in the area. Blockades had not yet been put up, and cars were still driving around the area of Codogno and Casalpusterlengo, but police were patrolling. \u201cWe\u2019re preparing to set up the checkpoints for the containment zone,\u201d a police officer told AFP, saying that initially the perimeter would be narrow but could widen over time. \u201cWe\u2019re about 10 criminal police teams here, so nothing related to this kind of situation, but we\u2019ve been called in from Bologna, Turin and Genoa to give a hand,\u201d she added. The coronavirus is communist China\u2019s \u201cbiggest health emergency\u201d, said president Xi Jinping. The virus has killed over 2,400 people and Xi Jinping said Sunday that it was necessary to learn from \u201cobvious shortcomings exposed\u201d during China\u2019s response. The new coronavirus has drawn comparisons to the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak of 2002-2003 which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong, and led to criticism over authorities\u2019 cover-up. While China has been praised by the World Health Organization for its handling of the epidemic this time, the death of whistleblower doctor Li Wenliang, who was reprimanded for warning about the virus, sparked calls for political reform and freedom of speech. In comments reported by state broadcaster CCTV on Sunday, Xi said the epidemic \u201chas the fastest transmission, widest range of infection and has been the most difficult to prevent and control\u201d. \u201cThis is a crisis for us and it is a big test,\u201d he said. He said it was the \u201clargest public health emergency\u201d since communist China\u2019s founding in 1949 Xi\u2019s comments come as the number of virus infections hit almost 77,000 in mainland China - with countries such as South Korea on high alert and Italy taking containment measures as well. Xi acknowledged that the epidemic will \u201cinevitably have a large impact on the economy and society\u201d, but he stressed the effects will be \u201cshort-term\u201d and controllable. Some 118 people flown out of Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak, were leaving Kents Hill Park training and conference centre in Milton Keynes on Sunday for the first time in 14 days. The group, who were brought back to Britain earlier this month, included about 10 children and a family of four. Health secretary Matt Hancock said: As the final group flown from Wuhan leave supported isolation in Milton Keynes today, they must be commended for their patience and perseverance. All 118 are in good health and pose no risk to the public \u2013 and this is thanks to the dedicated team of healthcare professionals and other staff who have worked round the clock to keep each and every one of them safe and supported. I\u2019m incredibly proud that once again our NHS and public health teams \u2013 including at Milton Keynes Hospital and Milton Keynes council \u2013 have gone the extra mile to deal with this situation.\u201d Professor Keith Willett NHS strategic incident director, said: The guests from Kents Hill Park Hotel are leaving today, and I\u2019d like to thank them for the very responsible compliance they have shown during their time in self-isolation. In the upcoming weeks, more of us may need to spend time at home to reduce the spread of the virus, and those in Milton Keynes have set the best example of how to self-isolate, while remaining calm and patient in what must have been a difficult situation. I would also like to thank all of the NHS staff and partners, as well as colleagues at Public Health England, who have worked to make their stay as comfortable as possible, as well as doctors, nurses, and healthcare professionals across the NHS who have successfully treated patients.\u201d The final two days of the Venice Carnival have been cancelled because of the coronavirus outbreak. The head of the Veneto region, Luca Zaia, said on Sunday that the event, which draws tourists from around the world, would no longer continue on Monday and Tuesday after more than 100 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Italy. Zaia told reporters that events scheduled for Sunday in the lagoon city would continue as planned. \u201cBut as of this evening there will be a ban on the Venice Carnival as well as on all events, sporting as well, until March 1 inclusive,\u201d he said. Earlier, Zaia reported the first two cases of coronavirus in Venice as officials struggled to contain an outbreak of the disease.Almost all of Italy\u2019s cases are clustered in the north, with roughly a dozen towns on lockdown meaning that people are not allowed to enter or leave the towns\u2019 boundaries. The governor of the Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, said that there were 89 cases in his region, most of which had popped up in small towns in the countryside. It comes as hotel reservations in Venice were down one-third during the first weekend of Carnival, though the floods in the lagoon city late last year are likely to have scared off visitors. Despite a decline in cases from China it is \u201cextremely concerning\u201d to see developments elsewhere, experts have said. Prof Paul Hunter from the University of East Anglia (UEA), said: \u201cThe dramatic increase in case in South Korea most of which are associated with a religious sect has been unprecedented so far in the epidemic. Although far less dramatic Japan is the country with most cases after China and South Korea and is also experiencing a growing epidemic.\u201d He added: \u201cThe identification of the large cluster of cases in Italy yesterday is a big worry for Europe and we can expect there to by quite a few more cases identified in the next few days.\u201d Hunter said the situation in Iran \u201chas major implications for the Middle East\u201d. \u201cIt is unlikely that Iran will have the resources and facilities to adequately identify cases and adequately manage them if case numbers are large,\u201d he said. He noted that another concern with the Iranian cases is wider armed conflicts in the region. \u201cAs we have seen with Ebola in the Democratic Republic and Poliomyelitis in Syria, war facilitates the spread of infectious disease.\u201d Prof Andrew Tatem from the University of Southampton, said that there was previously a relatively low number of cases outside of China but recent news was worrying. \u201cThe fact that cases have been confirmed in both Canada and Lebanon that seem to have come from Iran suggests that a significant outbreak is ongoing there and may have been occurring for some time.\u201d He said: \u201cIran normally has some strong travel connections to countries where health systems may be weaker, such as Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan \u2013 importations and outbreaks here would be particularly concerning in terms of capacities to detect the virus and contain spread.\u201d Dr Robin Thompson from the University of Oxford said we were at an important stage of the outbreak. \u201cFast isolation of even mild cases in affected areas is important for preventing substantial person-to-person transmission in Europe. It is critical that public health guidelines are followed.\u201d China\u2019s president said measures to deal with the coronavirus outbreak have been effective, but the battle is still at a crucial stage. On Sunday, state TV quoted Xi Jinping as saying the situation is showing a positive trend after arduous efforts but remains serious and complex. He said the outbreak will have a relatively big hit on the economy and society but the government will step up policy support to help achieve economic and social development targets for 2020. More than 100 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Italy, as numbers continued to rise on Sunday following government measures to limit the spread of the outbreak. Here\u2019s a selection of photos from the northern region, which has been worst hit. The worst-affected areas in Italy are Lombardy \u2013 home to Italy\u2019s financial capital, Milan \u2013 and Veneto, Italy\u2019s industrial heartland What\u2019s happening and where? The World Health Organization (WHO) is worried about the number of cases with no clear link \u2013 including those with no travel history to China or contact with a confirmed case. However, the total number of cases outside China remains relatively small, WHO\u2019s director general said on Saturday. It added that there have been more than 1,200 cases in 26 countries. South Korea The country declared a \u201cred alert\u201d on Sunday after a surge in coronavirus infections and two more deaths. On Sunday it was confirmed that coronavirus cases in the country jumped to 602 and the death toll rose to five. China There have been a reported 76,936 cases of the disease caused by the virus, known as Covid-19, including 2,442 deaths. In mainland China there were 648 new confirmed cases on Saturday, up from 397 a day earlier. The virus epicentre of Hubei province reported 96 new deaths, of which 82 were in the provincial capital Wuhan. The World Athletics Indoor Championships, scheduled for Nanjing from March 13-15, were postponed until next year. Other sporting events have been postponed. The International Monetary Fund predicted on Saturday the outbreak would lower China\u2019s growth this year to 5.6%. Hong Kong There have been 74 confirmed cases, up from 69 on Saturday. The death toll is two. Italy In the country\u2019s northern Lombardy region 89 cases were reported on Sunday, up from 54 a day earlier. The total number of cases in the country has now reached more than 100. Veneto, the other worst hit area, said it had 19 cases, up seven from Saturday. Two people have died. Authorities have banned public events and told workers in affected areas to stay home. Iran There have been a further 15 ases of the new coronavirus, health Ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur said, taking the total to 43 with a death toll of eight. France It currently had one patient with the virus but new cases were reportedly \u201cvery likely\u201d. Japan Elderly passengers from aboard a cruise ship moored near Tokyo died, as hundreds more disembarked after two weeks in quarantine. Tokyo Metropolitan Government said it would either cancel or postpone major indoor events it has sponsored for the next three weeks. Iran has confirmed eight deaths from the the new coronavirus, with the number infected rising to 43. Most of the infections have been in Qom. The health minister, Saeed Namaki, urged people to avoid travelling to the city, a major site for Shia pilgrims 75 miles (120km) south of the capital, Tehran. \u201cThe virus came from China to Qom city. A Merchant from Qom who died of the virus used to regularly travel to China ... Flights were suspended between the two countries but he used indirect flights,\u201d Namaki said. \u201cObviously we do not recommend trips to Qom or any other holy Shia cities in Iran,\u201d Namaki said on state television. The health ministry spokesman, Kianush Jahanpur, announced the 15 new cases earlier on Sunday. \u201cSo far, we have 43 infected cases and the death toll is eight,\u201d he told the television. Eight of the new infections were in Qom, where authorities have shut down schools and religious seminaries. In Tehran and some other cities, schools have been closed until Tuesday. The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in Italy had reached 115. The governor of the Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, said that there were 89 cases in his region, most of which had popped up in small towns in the countryside. Almost all of Italy\u2019s cases are clustered in the north, with roughly a dozen towns on lockdown meaning that people are not allowed to enter or leave the towns\u2019 boundaries. After Lombardy, the next hardest-hit region is Veneto, in the north-east, with at least 17 cases. Sports events in the affected northern areas, including local kids sports team practices to three Serie A soccer matches, were cancelled. Bishops in several dioceses in northern Italy issued directives that holy water fonts be kept empty, that communion wafers be placed in the hands of the faithful and not directly into their mouths by priests. Congregants were also told to refrain from shaking hands or exchanging kisses during the symbolic \u201csign of the peace\u201d ritual. Government reports show nine patients in England have tested positive for coronavirus. As of 22 February, a total of 6,152 people have been tested \u2013 the government said \u2013 of which 6,143 were confirmed negative and nine positive. The Department of Health and Social Care will be publishing updated data here every day at 2pm. An evacuee released from a two-week coronavirus quarantine centre has said it is \u201cfantastic\u201d to be allowed to return home. Some 118 people flown out of Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak, were leaving Kents Hill Park training and conference centre in Milton Keynes on Sunday for the first time in 14 days. The group, who were brought back to Britain earlier this month, included about 10 children and a family of four. Paul Walkinshaw, from Manchester, left with his wife, Lihong, having been on holiday visiting her parents in the city of Shiyan for the lunar new year when family members contacted them and told them about the outbreak. Speaking to reporters as he left the centre on Sunday morning, he said: \u201cIt feels fantastic to leave although it feels weird not having to wear a mask and gloves in public. The first 48 hours were hard when we were confined to our rooms, after that it was fine.\u201d The 39-year-old praised \u201cfriendly\u201d staff and the local community for their support and said he was looking forward to sleeping in his own bed again. It comes as dozens of evacuees from a coronavirus-hit cruise ship spent their first night quarantined at Arrowe Park hospital on the Wirral. Thirty-two people, who spent more than two weeks trapped on the Diamond Princess cruise ship off the coast of Japan, arrived in Merseyside on Saturday evening. All of those who arrived at Arrowe Park tested negative for Covid-19 before flying back to the UK. Parts of Iran face lockdown in an attempt to control the spread of coronavirus that has now claimed eight lives and led to 43 infections in the country. \u201cIf the situation gets any worse city staff will be expected to convert to teleworkers,\u201d said Pirouz Hanachi, the mayor of Tehran, Iran\u2019s capital. Government authorities have also been fighting an information war amid widespread distrust on social media about whether the public is being told the truth about the scale of the outbreak. The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, claimed Iran\u2019s enemies were spreading mistrust, and even said the low turnout in Iran\u2019s parliamentary elections on Friday was due to western scare stories. The coronavirus outbreak had claimed its first victim in the Middel East in the religious city of Qom last Wednesday about an hour\u2019s drive from Tehran. The number of people on Tehran\u2019s streets has been noticeably lower, with many shops shut and face masks in short supply and increasingly expensive. In Tehran and 13 other affected provinces, the authorities have introduced increasingly drastic \u201cpreventive measures\u201d including the closure of schools, universities, cinemas and theatres. Public buses in Tehran could also be seen being disinfected, and posters were being put up urging people to clean, and not shake hands. The school system is being shut for a minimum of two days starting on Sunday to allow for disinfection spraying. There was also widespread advice to stay home and avoid places where people congregate. Some football matches were cancelled. Metro stations were not shut, but water fountains and shops were all being closed. The council said it was also taking new steps to dispose of waste. At the airport, roughly a third of passengers were wearing masks, but there were no special controls on people leaving the country. Turkey, Iraq and Pakistan have either closed borders or are imposing extra health checks. Despite the precautions the vast majority were carrying on daily lives as normal. Some of the families of those that have died in Qom claim to know of no contact with anyone in China prompting claims that this might be an indigenous disease. The minister for health denied this, saying one victim traded in China and had travelled there indirectly. The strain discovered in Iran matched that in China, he said. He has recommended no travel to or from Qom, as well as promising to distribute free coronavirus packages to residents in the area, including masks and educational brochures. More than 100 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Italy, as numbers continued to rise on Sunday following government measures to limit the spread of the outbreak. The governor of Italy\u2019s northern Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, said cases of the illness in his area had risen in a day from 54 to 89, with total cases in the country now at more than 100. In an emergency decree approved late on Saturday \u2013 just hours after two people died \u2013 the government adopted special powers to be able to stop people leaving or entering the worst impacted zones. A spokesman for the governor of the northern region Veneto said the number of cases there had risen to 19, seven more than on Saturday. The worst-hit areas in Italy are Lombardy \u2013 home to Italy\u2019s financial capital, Milan \u2013 and Veneto, Italy\u2019s industrial heartland. They jointly account for 30% of gross domestic output. Milan\u2019s mayor, Giuseppe Sala, announced that all schools would be closed from Monday. Universities in both Lombardy and Veneto have also been shuttered until early March. With the confirmed cases of Coronavirus in Italy at 79, focused in the north of the country, Milan\u2019s fashion week is being affected by the outbreak. Giorgio Armani, whose show was scheduled for 4pm on Sunday afternoon, announced on Saturday night that guests should not come to the venue. Instead, the collection would be shown to an empty room. \u201cThe decision was taken to safeguard the wellbeing of all his [Armani\u2019s] invited guests by not having them attend crowded spaces,\u201d read a press release. Instead, models still presented the clothes, with the show streamed on the brand\u2019s website, as well as Instagram and Facebook. Dolce &amp; Gabbana\u2019s show on Saturday afternoon was scheduled to go ahead as usual. But the designers have also addressed the outbreak. They announced last week that they have contributed money to Humanitas University to fund research into the Coronavirus. In a statement, they said \u201cwe felt we had to do something to fight this devastating virus, which started from China but is threatening all mankind. In these cases, it is important to make the right choice. This is why we thought Humanitas University would be the ideal partner, whose excellence and humanity make it a special entity.\u201d Although the Milan fashion shows have felt largely business as usual, the coronavirus outbreak has affected the event. Those travelling to Milan have been screened at airports for the virus, and a lot of Chinese press and buyers usually in attendance have not travelled to the shows. Three Chinese designers on the schedule have cancelled their shows. Britons in Cambodia who left another cruise ship, the Westerdam, and who have been cleared for travel, are also being assisted by the Foreign Office to make their way home. All have tested negative after one case was diagnosed onboard. In an effort to help stop the spread of the virus in the UK, the health service is piloting home testing, where NHS staff, including nurses and paramedics, will visit people in their homes. As dozens of evacuees from a the coronavirus-hit Diamond Princess cruise ship begin their two-week quarantine in the UK, more than 100 others rescued from China are due to be released from isolation. Thirty-two people, who spent more than two weeks on the cruise ship off the coast of Japan, are settling in at an accommodation block at Arrowe Park hospital on the Wirral \u2013 their home for the next 14 days. The group, reportedly made up of 30 Britons and two Irish nationals, will undergo regular health checks while in quarantine. Some made gestures from their coaches as they arrived at the Merseyside facility on Saturday evening \u2013 one forming a heart symbol with her hands and another an OK signal. Meanwhile, a group who have spent the past two weeks holed up in a centre in Milton Keynes are due to be allowed home on Sunday. Around 150 people, who arrived in the UK on February 9 on an evacuation flight from the virus-hit Chinese city of Wuhan, have been staying at the Kents Hill Park training and conference centre. They too will have been regularly tested and as of Saturday afternoon the Department of Health said no new cases of coronavirus had been detected in the UK. Infection toll in China reaches 2,345 as South Korea raises its alert level and Iran confirms sixth death from virus In South Korea the national toll of 556 cases is now the highest outside China, apart from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. Japan has confirmed that a woman who tested negative and left the coronavirus-hit Diamond Princess cruise ship later tested positive, raising more questions about the effectiveness of quarantine measures. A dozen towns in northern Italy in effect went into lockdown on Saturday after deaths of two people infected with the coronavirus from China, and a growing cluster of cases with no direct links to the origin of the outbreak abroad. A repatriation flight carrying 32 Britons and Europeans from the coronavirus-infected cruise ship Diamond Princess landed in the UK on Saturday \u2013 amid growing fears for the welfare of some UK passengers left behind in Japan. The French health minister, Olivier V\u00e9ran, said new cases of coronavirus were \u201cvery likely\u201d in France and health authorities were ready in case of an epidemic. Mainland China noted a significant fall in the number of new cases, with 397 reported on Saturday. The total number of cases in mainland China to 76,288 and there have been 2,345 deaths. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the window of opportunity to stem the deadly epidemic was \u201cnarrowing\u201d amid concern about a surge in cases with no clear link to China. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has accused foreign media of trying to use the outbreak of coronavirus in Iran to discourage people from voting in a general election. This negative propaganda began a few months ago and grew larger approaching the election and in the past two days, under the pretext of an illness and a virus, their media did not miss the slightest opportunity to discourage people from voting,\u201d said Khamenei on his official website. [Our enemies] are even opposed to any election by the Iranian people\u201d. Iran shut schools, universities and cultural centres across 14 provinces from Sunday following five deaths in the Islamic Republic, the first in the Middle East. Iran\u2019s outbreak surfaced on Wednesday and quickly grew to 28 confirmed infections. \u201cThe concern is ... that we have seen ... a very rapid increase (in Iran) in a matter of a few days,\u201d said Sylvie Briand, director of the WHO\u2019s global infectious hazard preparedness department. Iraq on Thursday clamped down on travel to and from Iran, and its flagship carrier Kuwait Airways has suspended flights to the country. Although Egypt is the only African country with a confirmed case, the World Health Organization warned that the continent was vulnerable, urging more African Union cooperation. The WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said necessary treatment tools such as respiratory support machines were \u201cin short supply in many African countries and that\u2019s a cause for concern\u201d. The Chinese authorities are encouraging citizens to return to work, a month after announcing the unprecedented quarantine of millions of people. Authorities are caught between urgent need to restart economy and efforts to contain virus. Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak, have been the focus of disease prevention efforts. But the disease had spread far across the country, and some of the worst-affected places are the manufacturing and economic centres that power China\u2019s economy. Read more here. The French health minister, Olivier V\u00e9ran, said new cases of coronavirus were \u201cvery likely\u201d in France and health authorities were ready in case of an epidemic. \u201cToday, there is only one infected patent in France, who is hospitalised in Lyon. His health condition is not worrying. All the others, apart from an 80-year old man who died, were released cured and are not contagious,\u201d V\u00e9ran said in an interview with Le Parisien/Aujourdhui en France-Dimanche newspaper. \u201cOther cases \u2013 it is very likely. An epidemic? We are getting ready for it,\u201d V\u00e9ran added. He said the number of laboratories in France equipped with diagnostic tests would be increased to reach a capacity of \u201cseveral thousands\u201d of tests a day, against 400 now. The number of cases of the new coronavirus in Italy\u2019s Lombardy region has risen to 89, the governor of the region, Attilio Fontana, said on Sunday. That brings the total number of cases in the country to more than 100, Fontana said, speaking on Sky TV. Asked on Friday if the new cases put the crisis at a tipping point, the World Health Organization director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the \u201cwindow of opportunity is narrowing, so we need to act quickly before it closes completely\u201d. My colleagues Sarah Boseley, Hannah Devlin and Martin Belam have answered questions on the virus. Here are a selection of them, including whether we should panic: What is Covid-19 - the illness that started in Wuhan? It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city. What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes? The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health. Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough? UK Chief Medical Officers are advising anyone who has travelled to the UK from mainland China, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the last 14 days and who is experiencing a cough or fever or shortness of breath to stay indoors and call NHS 111, even if symptoms are mild. Is the outbreak a pandemic? A pandemic, in WHO terms, is \u201cthe worldwide spread of a disease\u201d. Coronavirus cases have been confirmed outside China, but by no means in all 195 countries on the WHO\u2019s list. It is also not spreading within those countries at the moment, except in a very few cases. By far the majority of cases are travellers who picked up the virus in China. Should we panic? No. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people, and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children. In South Korea\u2019s fourth-biggest city, Daegu, 90 new cases were confirmed on Sunday, bringing the city\u2019s total to 247. More than half of the people confirmed to have been infected are either members of \u2013 or connected to \u2013 the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, a secretive religious sect with a strong presence in Daegu. The mayor asked all Shincheonji members with symptoms to come forward and be tested, with hundreds yet to be reached by authorities. Moon described the situation in Daegu and Cheongdo \u2013 the birthplace of Shincheonji\u2019s founder Lee Man-hee \u2013 as a \u201cnational crisis\u201d, adding the cities would receive \u201cfull support\u201d for any lacking medical supplies and personnel. Shincheonji, accused of being a cult by mainstream Christian groups, claims its founder has donned the mantle of Jesus Christ and will take 144,000 people with him to heaven on judgment day. But with more church members than available places in heaven, they are said to have to compete for slots and pursue converts. In a video statement read out by its spokesman, Shincheonji apologised for \u201ccausing concern\u201d, but insisted it was cooperating with health authorities for the \u201cearly cessation\u201d of the situation. The spokesman refuted public criticism blaming his church over the spike in the number of infections, noting the virus had broken out in China. \u201cPlease be aware that the Shincheonji Church of Jesus and its members are the biggest victims of the COVID-19,\u201d he said. A repatriation flight carrying 32 Britons and Europeans from the coronavirus-infected cruise ship Diamond Princess landed in the UK on Saturday \u2013 amid growing fears for the welfare of some UK passengers left behind in Japan. President Moon Jae-in said South Korea was raising its alert level on the new coronavirus to the \u201chighest\u201d in the face of a sudden spike in the number of infections. \u201cThe Covid-19 incident faces a grave turning point. The next few days will be crucial,\u201d Moon said following a government meeting. \u201cThe government will raise the alert level to the highest level according to experts\u2019 recommendations,\u201d he added. South Korea has seen a rapid surge in the number of coronavirus cases in recent days after a cluster of infections emerged from a religious sect in the southern city of Daegu last week. The national toll of 556 cases is now the highest outside China, apart from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. A dozen towns in northern Italy in effect went into lockdown on Saturday after the deaths of two people infected with the coronavirus from China. In some Lombardy and Veneto towns, schools, businesses and restaurants have closed. The mayor of Milan, Italy\u2019s business capital and the regional capital of Lombardy, shuttered public offices. A 78-year-old man infected with the coronavirus died in Veneto, and a postmortem performed on a 77-year-old woman in Lombardy came back positive, although it wasn\u2019t clear if illness from the virus caused her death. Late on Saturday, civil protection officials said 79 people had contracted the virus, including the two who died, and one who recovered. Of the remaining 76 people infected, 54 were in Lombardy, 17 in Veneto, two in Emilia-Romagna, two \u2013 a Chinese couple from Wuhan \u2013 in Lazio, and one in Piedmont. It comes amid a growing cluster of cases in the country with no direct links to the origin of the outbreak abroad. Lombardy government authorities said the region\u2019s cases were traceable to a 38-year-old Italian who had not travelled to China, but it remained unclear how this man had been infected. Ten towns in Lombardy received orders to suspend nonessential activities and services. Luca Zaia, the Veneto regional president, said on Saturday that the contagion showed that the virus was transmitted like flu, and that trying to pinpoint a single source for the cases or to establish a link to China were no longer effective containment measures. Welcome to this morning\u2019s coronavirus live blog. I will be here to give you updates on the latest news throughout the day. A summary of the news on Sunday: Japan has confirmed that a woman who tested negative and left the coronavirus-hit Diamond Princess cruise ship later tested positive, raising more questions about the effectiveness of quarantine measures. A dozen towns in northern Italy in effect went into lockdown on Saturday after deaths of two people infected with the coronavirus from China, and a growing cluster of cases with no direct links to the origin of the outbreak abroad. South Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, on Sunday put the country on the highest possible alert in its fight against the coronavirus. The measure empowers the government to lock down cities and take other sweeping measures to contain the outbreak. Russia has denied allegations that it is spreading disinformation about the new coronavirus outbreak. US officials said Russian-linked accounts were making unfounded claims on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram through thousands of profiles that the US started the outbreak. Almost a third (31%) of UK consumers will consider avoiding foreign travel if the coronavirus outbreak continues, new research indicates. The consultancy firm Retail Economics, which commissioned the poll of more than 2,000 people, calculated that this could result in \u00a317bn of holiday spending being put on hold. As dozens of evacuees from a coronavirus-hit cruise ship begin their two-week quarantine in the UK, more than 100 others rescued from China are due to be released from isolation.",

The confirmation they have contracted the virus brings the number of people with Covid-19 in the UK up to 13. England\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said the patients caught the virus onboard the Diamond Princess. The cruise ship had been held for more than two weeks off the coast of Japan. The patients are being transferred from Arrowe Park hospital in Wirral, Merseyside, to specialist NHS infection centres. A spokesperson for the Department of Health said \u201ca full infectious disease risk assessment\u201d was done before Saturday\u2019s flight back from Japan and stressed that no one who boarded the flight had displayed any symptoms of the virus.

Shoppers were made to wait, then allowed to enter in groups of 40 inside the store to stock up on provisions.</p> \n<p>Although one woman in the crowd downplayed the virus, telling other shoppers it was not fatal if properly treated, others were less sanguine. \u201cIt\u2019s inhuman,\u201d one man who gave his name as Sante told AFP. \u201cFighting over four sandwiches is just disgusting.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hundreds of colleagues who worked with the first infected man, a researcher at Unilever, were being tested but it was still unclear whom he had contracted the illness from. The man, who was in intensive care, was initially thought to have caught the virus after meeting a colleague who had recently returned from China, but the colleague tested negative.</p> \n<p>\u201cUnfortunately, the person who was considered to be \u2018patient zero\u2019 was not,\u201d said Attilio Fontana, the president of Lombardy. \u201cWe need to look elsewhere.

At first, we thought that the virus was only abroad, but now it is also in Italy. People should try not to panic but limiting the spread is, in part, down to our behaviour.

Crowded places should also be avoided; sacrifices need to be made to try to overcome the virus.\u201d</p> \n<p>The first two cases of the virus in Italy were those of a Chinese couple from Wuhan who arrived in the country on 23 January. They were being treated at Spallanzani hospital for infectious diseases in Rome. A group they were travelling with were released from hospital this month after being quarantined for 14 days. A third case in Rome was that of an Italian man who had caught the virus in China.</p> \n<p>Giuseppe Sala, the mayor of Milan, where fashion week wraps up on Monday, asked for all schools to be closed for a week. \u201cIt\u2019s a prudent measure, then we\u2019ll see if a week is sufficient. There are so many events in the city. I don\u2019t imagine everything shutting down and being cancelled, but events that are not obligatory and which can be postponed, should be.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 24 February 2020.

Milan fashion week has also been affected by the outbreak. Giorgio Armani, whose show was scheduled for 4pm on Sunday afternoon, announced on Saturday night that guests should not come to the venue. Instead, the collection would be shown to an empty room. \u201cThe decision was taken to safeguard the wellbeing of all his [Armani\u2019s] invited guests by not having them attend crowded spaces,\u201d said a press release. Models still presented the clothes, with the show streamed on the brand\u2019s website, as well as on Instagram and Facebook. The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said: \u201cWe have adopted a decree to protect the health of Italians, which is our priority and which ranks first in the list of constitutional values.\u201d He urged people to \u201chave faith in the political and scientific institutions, which are doing everything possible\u201d. Locals wearing face masks were already lined up outside a supermarket in the town of Casalpusterlengo, a 10-minute drive from Codogno, on Sunday morning. Shoppers were made to wait, then allowed to enter in groups of 40 inside the store to stock up on provisions. Although one woman in the crowd downplayed the virus, telling other shoppers it was not fatal if properly treated, others were less sanguine. \u201cIt\u2019s inhuman,\u201d one man who gave his name as Sante told AFP. \u201cFighting over four sandwiches is just disgusting.\u201d Hundreds of colleagues who worked with the first infected man, a researcher at Unilever, were being tested but it was still unclear whom he had contracted the illness from. The man, who was in intensive care, was initially thought to have caught the virus after meeting a colleague who had recently returned from China, but the colleague tested negative. \u201cUnfortunately, the person who was considered to be \u2018patient zero\u2019 was not,\u201d said Attilio Fontana, the president of Lombardy. \u201cWe need to look elsewhere. We are following two hypotheses, and we will try to understand if one of the two is correct.\u201d The 38-year-old recently took part in a number of races. His pregnant wife is also infected, as is a person who went running with him. Three other cases in Lombardy are elderly people who frequented a bar in Codogno owned by the father of the man who went running with the 38-year-old. The man who died in Veneto was diagnosed with pneumonia a few weeks ago but had not travelled to China nor come into contact with anyone who had. \u201cUnfortunately, we haven\u2019t managed to limit the spread of the virus,\u201d said Roberto Burioni, a professor of microbiology and virology at the Vita-Salute San Raffaele University in Milan, which has also closed. \u201cAnd we need to face the fact that it is spreading quickly. At first, we thought that the virus was only abroad, but now it is also in Italy. People should try not to panic but limiting the spread is, in part, down to our behaviour. Those who have been in contact with someone infected must isolate themselves. Crowded places should also be avoided; sacrifices need to be made to try to overcome the virus.\u201d The first two cases of the virus in Italy were those of a Chinese couple from Wuhan who arrived in the country on 23 January. They were being treated at Spallanzani hospital for infectious diseases in Rome. A group they were travelling with were released from hospital this month after being quarantined for 14 days. A third case in Rome was that of an Italian man who had caught the virus in China. Giuseppe Sala, the mayor of Milan, where fashion week wraps up on Monday, asked for all schools to be closed for a week. \u201cIt\u2019s a prudent measure, then we\u2019ll see if a week is sufficient. There are so many events in the city. I don\u2019t imagine everything shutting down and being cancelled, but events that are not obligatory and which can be postponed, should be.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 24 February 2020. An earlier version incorrectly placed the latest Lombardy coronavirus death in the \u201ccity of Cremona\u201d; the death was in the city of Crema, in Cremona province.",

Media roundup The Sydney Morning Herald reveals that the friend of the driver of the Sydney-to-Melbourne train that derailed says the driver \u201craised concerns about poorly maintained rail network\u201d. \u201cAustralia\u2019s farmers and the $130bn freight industry have demanded Labor make the economic case for its plan to deliver zero net emissions by 2050,\u201d the Australian reports. On the ABC: \u201cPolice say 11 children were strip-searched at an under-18s music festival in western Sydney at the weekend, despite it coming under intense criticism at an inquiry into the practice.\u201d Coming up The findings into the deaths of four people at Dreamworld in October 2016 will be handed down in a Brisbane court. Forecasters expect Cyclone Esther to cross the coastline at the Queensland-Northern Territory border. And if you\u2019ve read this far \u2026 The weird and wonderful world of hand dryers is a blast of fresh air. \u201cI began to take photos and share them on Instagram. I now get sent images from across the globe,\u201d says Samuel Ryde. Sign up If you would like to receive the Guardian Australia morning mail to your email inbox every weekday, sign up here.",
