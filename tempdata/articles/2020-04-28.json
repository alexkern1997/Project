On social media he has stressed that the identity of the species that served as an intermediate host for the virus is \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/edwardcholmes/status/1246237549556686848?s=20\">still uncertain</a>\u201d.</p> <p>One <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1286457920300496\">statistical study</a> looked at a characteristic of the virus that evolved to enable it to latch on to human cells. Pangolins were able to develop this characteristic, but so were cats, buffalo, cattle, goats, sheep and pigeons.</p> <p>Another <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jmv.25731\">study claimed</a> to have ruled out pangolins as an intermediary altogether, because samples of similar viruses taken from pangolins lacked a chain of amino acids seen in the virus now circulating in humans.</p> <p>The study Holmes worked on suggested that the scenario in which a human at the Wuhan market interacted with an animal that carried the virus was only one potential version of the Covid-19 origin story. Another was the possibility that a descendent of the virus jumped into humans and then adapted as it was passed from human to human.</p> <p>\u201cOnce acquired, these adaptations would enable the pandemic to take off and produce a sufficiently large cluster of cases to trigger the surveillance system that detected it,\u201d the study said.</p> <p>Analysis of the first 41 Covid-19 patients in <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext#%20\">medical journal the Lancet</a> found that 27 of them had direct exposure to the Wuhan market. But the same analysis found that the first known case of the illness did not.</p> <p>This might be another reason to doubt the established story.</p> <p>Prof Stanley Perlman, a leading immunologist at the University of Iowa and an expert on previous coronavirus outbreaks that have stemmed from animals, says the idea the link to the Wuhan market is coincidental \u201ccannot be ruled out\u201d but that possibility \u201cseems less likely\u201d because the genetic material of the virus had been found in the market environment.</p> <p>Perlman told Guardian Australia he does believe there was an intermediary animal but adds that while pangolins are possible candidates, they \u201care not proven to be the key intermediary\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI suspect that any evolution [of the virus] occurred in the intermediate animal if there was one. There has been no substantial changes in the virus in the three months of the pandemic, indicating that the virus is well adapted to humans.\u201d</p> <p>So-called wet markets \u2013 where live animals are traded \u2013 have been <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14738798\">implicated in previous outbreaks of coronaviruses</a>, in particular Sars.</p> <p>Dr Michelle Baker, an immunologist at CSIRO who studies viruses in bats, says some of the research on Covid-19\u2019s origins have stepped off from what was known from the past.</p> <p>But \u201cwe really don\u2019t know\u201d how accurate the origin story is, she says: \u201cThere\u2019s some sort of connection [to the Wuhan market] and there were people exposed to the market that were infected.\u201d</p> <p>Baker says what is \u201cvery likely\u201d is that the virus originated in a bat. \u201cIt\u2019s a likely scenario but we will never know. The market was cleaned up quite quickly. We can only speculate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThese wet markets have been identified as an issue because you do have species interacting,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to highlight the dangers of them and an opportunity to clamp down on them.\u201d</p> <p>Turner adds: \u201cWe\u2019ve found the ancestors of the virus, but having broader knowledge of the coronavirus in other species might give us a hint about the evolution of this thing and how it jumped.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Due to the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the coronavirus outbreak, this article is being regularly updated to ensure that it reflects the current situation at the date of publication.

As reported in Nature, pangolins were not listed on the inventory of items being sold in Wuhan, although this omission could be deliberate as it\u2019s illegal to sell them. \u201cWhether the poor pangolin was the species at which it jumped, it\u2019s not clear,\u201d Turner says. \u201cIt\u2019s either mixed in something else, mixed in a poor pangolin, or it\u2019s jumped into people and evolved in people.\u201d Prof Edward Holmes, of the University of Sydney, was a co-author on a Nature study that examined the likely origins of the virus by looking at its genome. On social media he has stressed that the identity of the species that served as an intermediate host for the virus is \u201cstill uncertain\u201d. One statistical study looked at a characteristic of the virus that evolved to enable it to latch on to human cells. Pangolins were able to develop this characteristic, but so were cats, buffalo, cattle, goats, sheep and pigeons. Another study claimed to have ruled out pangolins as an intermediary altogether, because samples of similar viruses taken from pangolins lacked a chain of amino acids seen in the virus now circulating in humans. The study Holmes worked on suggested that the scenario in which a human at the Wuhan market interacted with an animal that carried the virus was only one potential version of the Covid-19 origin story. Another was the possibility that a descendent of the virus jumped into humans and then adapted as it was passed from human to human. \u201cOnce acquired, these adaptations would enable the pandemic to take off and produce a sufficiently large cluster of cases to trigger the surveillance system that detected it,\u201d the study said. Analysis of the first 41 Covid-19 patients in medical journal the Lancet found that 27 of them had direct exposure to the Wuhan market. But the same analysis found that the first known case of the illness did not. This might be another reason to doubt the established story. Prof Stanley Perlman, a leading immunologist at the University of Iowa and an expert on previous coronavirus outbreaks that have stemmed from animals, says the idea the link to the Wuhan market is coincidental \u201ccannot be ruled out\u201d but that possibility \u201cseems less likely\u201d because the genetic material of the virus had been found in the market environment. Perlman told Guardian Australia he does believe there was an intermediary animal but adds that while pangolins are possible candidates, they \u201care not proven to be the key intermediary\u201d. \u201cI suspect that any evolution [of the virus] occurred in the intermediate animal if there was one. There has been no substantial changes in the virus in the three months of the pandemic, indicating that the virus is well adapted to humans.\u201d So-called wet markets \u2013 where live animals are traded \u2013 have been implicated in previous outbreaks of coronaviruses, in particular Sars. Dr Michelle Baker, an immunologist at CSIRO who studies viruses in bats, says some of the research on Covid-19\u2019s origins have stepped off from what was known from the past. But \u201cwe really don\u2019t know\u201d how accurate the origin story is, she says: \u201cThere\u2019s some sort of connection [to the Wuhan market] and there were people exposed to the market that were infected.\u201d Baker says what is \u201cvery likely\u201d is that the virus originated in a bat. \u201cIt\u2019s a likely scenario but we will never know. The market was cleaned up quite quickly. We can only speculate.\u201d \u201cThese wet markets have been identified as an issue because you do have species interacting,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to highlight the dangers of them and an opportunity to clamp down on them.\u201d Turner adds: \u201cWe\u2019ve found the ancestors of the virus, but having broader knowledge of the coronavirus in other species might give us a hint about the evolution of this thing and how it jumped.\u201d Due to the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the coronavirus outbreak, this article is being regularly updated to ensure that it reflects the current situation at the date of publication.

It\u2019s a good number.\u201d There was a memorably pointed question: \u201cDoes a president deserve another term after more Americans die in six weeks than the entire Vietnam war?\u201d Trump, who was reportedly warned about the coronavirus by US intelligence agencies more than a dozen times in January and February, replied: \u201cWe\u2019ve lost a lot of people. But if you look at what original projections were \u2026 we\u2019ve made a lot of good decisions.\u201d Another reporter inquired about Kim\u2019s condition. \u201cI do have a very good idea but I can\u2019t talk about it now,\u201d Trump teased, gameshow-style. \u201cI just wish him well \u2026 I hope he\u2019s fine. I do know how he\u2019s doing, relatively speaking. We will see, you\u2019ll probably be hearing in the not too distant future.\u201d If only the victims of the coronavirus were afforded such presidential compassion. But empathy, like lunch, is for wimps.",

The US has roughly 173,000 ventilators, according to the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins University. Experts from Harvard Medical School predict that the US could end up needing <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2005689\">31 times that number</a> to treat coronavirus patients. </p> \n  <p>An article in the <a href=\"https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nejm.org%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1056%2FNEJMp2006141\">New England Journal of Medicine published on Wednesday 25 March </a>categorically concluded that the US does not have enough ventilators to treat patients with Covid-19 in the coming months.</p> \n  <p>The authors, American public health experts, wrote: \u201cThere is a broad range of estimates of the number of ventilators we will need to care for U.S. patients with Covid-19, from several hundred thousand to as many as a million. The estimates vary depending on the number, speed, and severity of infections, of course, but even the availability of testing affects the number of ventilators needed.... current estimates of the number of ventilators in the United States range from 60,000 to 160,000, depending on whether those that have only partial functionality are included. The national strategic reserve of ventilators is small and far from sufficient for the projected gap. No matter which estimate we use, there are not enough ventilators for patients with Covid-19 in the upcoming months.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea75d3e8f0869484d9441ff\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-27T22:33:50.031Z\">11.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Trump was asked whether he has any information about Kim Jong Un\u2019s health, which has been the subject of rumors and speculation in recent days. </p> \n  <p>He says: \u201cI can\u2019t tell you exactly.

      "bodyText": "Live reporting on the coronavirus in the US continues on Tuesday\u2019s blog: Thanks everyone for following along on another grim day, as the death toll in the US exceeded 55,000. Here\u2019s a rundown of the day\u2019s biggest news: Donald Trump touted a plan to increase testing at a White House briefing featuring chief executives from medical testing firms, pharmacies, and major grocers such as Kroger and Walmart. Trump also continued to blame China for the pandemic and suggested his administration was investigating what had happened. And the president refused to take responsibility for people who acted upon his bizarre and unsafe suggestion last Thursday that injecting disinfectant could help patients with Covid-19. No one should ingest or inject disinfectant; it is very unsafe and could kill you. A number of US states announced plans to reopen businesses despite concern from state officials and public health experts that they need to ramp up their testing capacity before it\u2019s safe to ease restrictions. Ohio and Texas are among the states that outlined plans to reopen on Monday. New York state cancelled its Democratic primary, sparking outrage among supporters of Vermont senator Bernie Sanders. Sanders campaign said the state should not get to send a delegation to the convention. The New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, said the state\u2019s death toll was in decline. He will extend the stay-at-home order for some parts of the state, while allowing others to start easing restrictions on 15 May. Our global liveblog for coronavirus updates is live here: Nursing homes have been hit hard by coronavirus across California, my colleague Sam Levin reports. In Los Angeles county, nursing home residents have accounted for more than 30% of Covid-19 deaths and 72% in the city of Long Beach. At one Central Valley facility, nearly all 167 residents and staff tested positive, and at a home in Riverside, nearly 100 residents were evacuated after staff failed to show up due to an outbreak. The Gateway center is now under criminal investigation. Behind the staggering numbers, advocates say, is a poorly regulated industry with a long history of chronic understaffing, inadequate infection control, a lack of critical equipment and weak labor standards. Experts and attorneys say the public health catastrophe was preventable, and that the botched response of some nursing homes constitutes criminal neglect. Read his full report here: Trump continued to blame of China for the pandemic during today\u2019s briefing. At one point, while riffing on \u201cso much unnecessary death,\u201d he appeared to suggest that China could have stopped the outbreak: \u201cIt could have been stopped and it could have been stopped faster but someone a long time ago decided not to do it that way.\u201d He later said that his administration was conducting \u201cserious investigations\u201d into what happened with China. \u201cWe\u2019re doing very serious investigations ... We are not happy with China,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe believe it could have been stopped at the source. It could have been stopped quickly and it wouldn\u2019t have spread all over the world.\u201d As Donald Trump speaks at the White House, the Daily Beast reports that Diamond and Silk, prominent African American supporters of the president, have lost their slot at Fox News due to their \u201cbonkers coronavirus claims\u201d. There\u2019s no official confirmation that the \u201cMAGA vlogging superstars\u201d will no longer appear on Fox Nation, Fox News\u2019 streaming service, but the Beast reports: The sudden split comes after the Trump-boosting siblings have come under fire for promoting conspiracy theories and disinformation about the coronavirus. \u201cAfter what they\u2019ve said and tweeted you won\u2019t be seeing them on Fox Nation or Fox News anytime soon,\u201d a source with knowledge of the matter told The Daily Beast. Among such conspiracy theories and disinformation spread by Lynette \u201cDiamond\u201d Hardaway and Rochelle \u201cSilk\u201d Richardson: the number of US coronavirus deaths has been inflated to make Trump look bad the disease was \u201cman-made\u201d and \u201cengineered\u201d that people should expose themselves to the virus by breaking lockdown that Bill Gates wants to develop vaccines in order to practice population control that 5G technology might be being used to infect people and fill up hospitals No word from Diamond and Silk either, though their Twitter account has been active all day. Trump has been cross with Fox News on Twitter recently, so you\u2019d think the Beast report might provoke presidential comment before long\u2026 Debate over Fox News\u2019 role in spreading disinformation about Covid-19 has become a prominent part of media coverage of the outbreak. Here\u2019s David Smith\u2019s look at the network\u2019s close relationship with the Trump administration, from earlier this month. Fact check: Testing Trump announced at the White House on 27 April overall the US has now administered more than 5.4m coronavirus tests, which is approximately the same as the figure according to the Covid Tracking Project. From a very slow start, the US, which was previously testing at a rate lower than many other countries, has gradually ramped up. With a population of 329 million, 5.4m tests equates to one test for every 61 people. On 31 March, as the number of cases and deaths was rising fast, the US had conducted just over a million tests, or one for every 301 Americans. The briefing has ended. Fact check: Ventilator shortages Trump has at intervals questioned some state governors\u2019 assertions that they face shortages of medical equipment and are likely to run out of ventilators, or expressed skepticism at numbers being stated, especially by New York leaders. It is true that some states, so far, have ended up with more ventilators than they originally projected they would need. California has loaned 500 ventilators to states like New York. California hospitals managed to increase their stock from 7,500 machines to more than 11,000, according to the state\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom. \u201cThat has put less strain and pressure on the state\u2019s effort to procure additional ventilators,\u201d Newsom said. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that there isn\u2019t a national shortage. The US has roughly 173,000 ventilators, according to the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins University. Experts from Harvard Medical School predict that the US could end up needing 31 times that number to treat coronavirus patients. An article in the New England Journal of Medicine published on Wednesday 25 March categorically concluded that the US does not have enough ventilators to treat patients with Covid-19 in the coming months. The authors, American public health experts, wrote: \u201cThere is a broad range of estimates of the number of ventilators we will need to care for U.S. patients with Covid-19, from several hundred thousand to as many as a million. The estimates vary depending on the number, speed, and severity of infections, of course, but even the availability of testing affects the number of ventilators needed.... current estimates of the number of ventilators in the United States range from 60,000 to 160,000, depending on whether those that have only partial functionality are included. The national strategic reserve of ventilators is small and far from sufficient for the projected gap. No matter which estimate we use, there are not enough ventilators for patients with Covid-19 in the upcoming months.\u201d Trump was asked whether he has any information about Kim Jong Un\u2019s health, which has been the subject of rumors and speculation in recent days. He says: \u201cI can\u2019t tell you exactly. Yes, I do have a very good idea but I can\u2019t talk about it now.\u201d The vice president appears to be arguing that the administration actually met its goals because millions of test kits were distributed, even though they were not given and processed. That is quite an argument. We\u2019re hearing a lot about very large numbers of tests that will be done during the month of May. But it\u2019s worth remembering that we have heard big promises in the past about testing, such as the big promises of drive-through testing run by Google, that have yet to materialize. Asked if he takes any responsibility for reports of people ingesting disinfectant after his own remarks, Trump says: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d Maryland\u2019s Republican governor Larry Hogan (who\u2019s also chairman of the National Governors Association) said yesterday that his state\u2019s health officials have received \u201chundreds\u201d of inquiries about the safety of ingesting cleaning products after Trump last week raised the idea, saying internal use of disinfectant could be looked into as a possible treatment for the coronavirus. We\u2019ve moved on to questions from the press. A reporter asks why the HHS secretary, Alex Azar, hasn\u2019t been fired. Trump says it\u2019s an unfair question and attacks Democratic politicians. Brett Giroir, the HHS assistant secretary, is now discussing an eight-part plan for testing. Apparently we are on step eight. Trump spoke again about testing, and has introduced Dr Birx to discuss a \u201cblueprint\u201d for states to expand testing. We also heard from Krogers, Walmart, and Rite-Aid. Now we\u2019re back to the president. The CEO of CVS Health just announced that the pharmacy chain will expand testing to 1,000 CVS facilities in May. For context, there are nearly 10,000 CVS locations across the US, so this means that approximately one out of 10 CVS locations will have testing capacity by next month. Next is the Walgreens CEO, who says they will triple testing capacity, but does not provide hard numbers. Trump spoke briefly and generally about the pandemic before introducing a group of CEOs who are choosing not to identify themselves by name. First up was the Quest Diagnostics CEO, Steve Rusckowski, who boasted that his company is now running 50,000 tests per day. Donald Trump has just come out to start the briefing, alongside Mike Pence. Computer issues at the Small Business Administration have slowed down the process for the second round of loan applications for the government\u2019s small business relief program, the AP reports. The SBA was supposed to begin accepting applications for $310bn in funding today, after the intial $349bn in funding for the program was used up in just two weeks. Banks had thousands of applications from small businesses ready to go today, according to the report, but are now struggling to send the applications through to the government computer system. These loans are designed to protect jobs by offering forgiveness for the money small business owners spend on payroll. For more on the challenges entrepreneurs facing under stay-at-home orders, my colleagues on the West Coast spoke to five small business owners: Hello everyone, this is Julia Carrie Wong in Oakland, California, taking over the liveblog for the rest of the afternoon. We\u2019re waiting to hear from Donald Trump, who is expected to hold a White House briefing shortly. In the meantime, my colleague Daniel Strauss has written about the various groups of states that are uniting to form new regional partnerships to combat the coronavirus. California, Oregon and Washington have formed the Western States Pact. Seven east coast states, stretching from Delaware to Massachusetts, have formed another alliance. And seven mostly midwestern states \u2013 encompassing a vast region that includes Minnesota, Ohio and Kentucky \u2013 have created a third group. The development has even raised fears \u2013 or hopes \u2013 that the federal government\u2019s grip on America\u2019s states will be loosened, perhaps threatening the union itself. Here\u2019s a look at what\u2019s happened so far today. Donald Trump is due to hold a press conference shortly. This was scheduled after the White House initially canceled the briefing. A number of US states announced plans to reopen businesses despite concern from state officials and public health experts that they need to ramp up their testing capacity before it\u2019s safe to ease restrictions. Ohio and Texas are among the states that outlined plans to reopen on Monday. New York state cancelled its Democratic primary, sparking outrage among supporters of Vermont senator Bernie Sanders. Sanders campaign said the state should not get to send a delegation to the convention. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said the state\u2019s death told was in decline. He will extend the stay-at-home order for some parts of the state, while allowing others to start easing restrictions on May 15. Trump is meeting with business leaders from companies like Walgreens, Rite-Aid and CVS. During the meeting, at which everyone abided by social distancing guidelines, Trump said that he had just gotten off the phone with the nation\u2019s governors. \u201cEverybody was very happy, and the testing is going really well,\u201d Trump said of his conversation with the governors, according to media pool report of the event. He added that there was \u201cno complaints.\u201d \u201cSince then, what we\u2019ve achieved is really nothing short of amazing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe United States now holds the world record for testing and by a lot.\u201d Trump said the US conducted more than 5.4m tests so far, which he noted was more than any other country. While true, it overlooks the fact that we lag behind countries like Germany and Canada when looking at tests conducted per million people. Experts say the US needs to ramp up its daily testing capacity before it is safe to reopen businesses. Trump said there are 73 retail sites testing sites in 25 states and that testing in communities of color is ramping up. Former Senate majority leader Harry Reid is urging the US to take a \u201cserious, scientific look\u201d at the national security implications on the reported encounters with unidentified aircrafts. Responding to a news article that the Pentagon released three Navy videos showing \u201cunidentified aerial phenomena,\u201d Reid said the new footage only \u201cscratches the surface of research and materials available.\u201d As majority leader, the Nevada senator persuaded the Pentagon to set up a program to study the issue. \u201cThe American people deserve to be informed,\u201d he said on Twitter. The six northern California counties that led the charge on the first stay-at-home measures in the nation have extended the order through the end of May, writes The Guardian\u2019s Vivian Ho from San Francisco. The extension came down Monday as California governor Gavin Newsom chastised the tens of thousands who packed beachesin southern California during a weekend heatwave, capturing the contrast in regional enforcement of behavioral shifts meant to curb the spread of the virus. \u201cThis virus doesn\u2019t take the weekends off, this virus doesn\u2019t go home because it\u2019s a beautiful, sunny day along our coast,\u201d Newsom said.\u201dWe can\u2019t see the images like we saw, particularly on Saturday in Newport Beach and elsewhere.\u201d The northern California order, which includes San Francisco and Santa Clara county, was originally set to expire on 3 May. The six counties issued their order four days before the governor issued his shelter-in-place order, which has no end date. Newsom has hinted in recent weeks that if Californians continue to flatten the curve, he may be able to discuss modifying the order soon. As of Monday, California has had 43,464 positive cases and 1,755 deaths. The state has issued $4.4bn in unemployment insurance payments since 15 March, Newsom said. Texas governor Greg Abbott says the state\u2019s stay-at-home order on April 30, with \u201cphase one\u201d of the reopening process beginning on May 1. California governor Gavin Newsom says the state is weeks, not months away from starting the process of starting to reopen its economy. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, a Republican, on Monday outlined what he called the \u201cfirst steps\u201d to easing the state\u2019s stay-at-home order and re-opening its economy. The phased-in approach will begin on May 1, when state will allow non-essential surgeries that do not require an overnight stay in the hospital. On May 4, manufacturing, distribution, and construction will reopen following social distancing and other safety guidelines. On May 12, the state will reopen its consumer, retail, and services businesses. An order restricting gatherings of more than 10 people will remain in place. DeWine was among the first governors to begin taking steps to shut down businesses in Ohio as the coronavirus began to spread rapidly in March. His Midwestern state cancelled gatherings, forcing the presidential candidates to suspend their campaign events in early March. The state also postponed its primary, which is now due to take place on Tuesday. \u201cWith a decision like this, there is no easy decision - we have to balance,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be criticized by those who think we shouldn\u2019t open up. We\u2019ll be criticized by those who think we didn\u2019t open up enough. I understand both arguments, but I think we found the sweet spot.\u201d New York Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is hosting Senator Elizabeth Warren to discuss her Essential Workers Bill of Rights, which she introduced as a framework for the Congressional response to the coronavirus pandemic. Bernie Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign tore into the New York state board of elections on Monday after it decided to remove the senator from the ballot for the state\u2019s June 23 election, the Guardian\u2019s Sam Levin reports. The state\u2019s two Democratic election commissioners voted to remove Sanders on Monday, relying on a new provision in state law that allows the board to remove a candidate who actively suspends their campaign. Sanders had urged the board to let him remain on the ballot and had been hoping to gather delegates to gain sway over the party\u2019s platform. His presence on the ballot also may have increased turnout in down ballot primary races. No one asked New York to cancel the election. The DNC didn\u2019t request it. The Biden campaign didn\u2019t request it. And our campaign communicated that we wanted to remain on the ballot,\u201d Jeff Weaver, a senior Sanders adviser said in a statement. \u201cNew York has clearly violated its approved delegate selection plan. If this is not remedied, New York should lose all its delegates to the 2020 Democratic National Convention.\u201d New York has also long had extremely restrictive voting policies - it had no early voting until last year - and Weaver called on Democrats to investigate \u201cNew York\u2019s checkered pattern of voter disenfranchisement.\u201d The move comes as states are scrambling to figure out how to allow people to vote while protecting their health in the Covid-19 pandemic. New York governor Andrew Cuomo recently issued an executive order requiring the state to send an absentee ballot application to every registered voter in the state. New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a top Sanders surrogate, called the decision \u201ccompletely wrong.\u201d Coming soon to a living room near you ... Former first lady Michelle Obama announced that a documentary based on her best selling memoir, Becoming, will be released on Netflix on May 6. \u201cDuring this difficult time, I hope you\u2019ll find some inspiration and joy in this film,\u201d she wrote. Obama has re-emerged lately as an advocate for vote-by-mail, an effort that has gained traction amid the Covid-19 pandemic. She has also been raised as a potential running mate for Joe Biden, who recently said he\u2019d pick her in a \u201cheartbeat\u201d but suspected that she did not want to return to the White House. Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell will convene the US Senate on May 4. In a statement on Monday afternoon, McConnell said the Senate, which adjourned last month, must \u201chonor our constitutional duty to the American people.\u201d If it is essential for doctors, nurses, healthcare workers, truck drivers, grocery-store workers, and many other brave Americans to keep carefully manning their own duty stations, then it is essential for Senators to carefully man ours and support them. He said the Senate must urgently return to Washington to start working on the next round of legislation to help ease the economic strain of the coronavirus pandemic on American families and businesses. This crisis has every part of our society in dire need of stability, clarity, and certainty,\u201d McConnell wrote. \u201cThe Senate has already stepped up, but our work is not over. I look forward to seeing all my colleagues next Monday.\u201d Guardian reporter Vivian Ho sends this report on the death of a 57-year-old California woman who is believed to be the first person to die of coronavirus in the US. Coronavirus caused a rupture in the heart of the California woman whose death is believed to be the first Covid-related death so far in the US, according to an autopsy report obtained by the San Francisco Chronicle. Patricia Dowd, 57, died 6 February in her home in San Jose, California after reporting flu-like symptoms in the days leading up to her death, according to the report. Though the first official death in the nation from the virus was reported in Kirkland, Washington on 29 February, and the first case had not reached Dowd\u2019s county until 28 February, the medical examiner had been suspicious, and sent tissue samples to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for testing. The autopsy found traces of the virus in her heart, trachea, lungs and intestines. Her official cause of death was listed as \u201cacute hemopericardium due to rupture of left ventricle...due to covid-19 infection.\u201d Dowd worked as a senior quality manager for a semiconductor company for 28 years. She was a wife and mother who loved to travel, read and spend time with her friends and family. \u201cShe will always be remembered for her beautiful smile and infectious laugh,\u201d her family writes. Dowd was one of three deaths that have changed what experts have come to understand about community spread of the virus in the country. Gavin Newsom, California\u2019s governor, has ordered medical examiners and coroners across the state to review autopsies going back to December to get a better understanding of when the pandemic truly began. Surprise! After much back-and-forth the White House has re-scheduled and coronavirus task force briefing that it had previously cancelled after initially scheduling it. The press conference is scheduled for 5pm EST in the White House Rose Garden. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Trump will \u201cbrief the nation\u201d on additional testing guidance and new guidelines for lifting stay-at-home orders. A spokeswoman for Mike Pence, Alyssa Farah, joked about the changes. Jesse Ventura is considering a third-party run for president. In a tweet tagged #MondayThoughts and #MondayMood, the professional wrestler, actor and one-term governor of Minnesota said wondered if he should run for president on the Green Party ticket. Ventura ran for governor in 1998 as the nominee for the Reform Party and narrowly beat the Democratic and Republican candidates. After his election, Ventura left the party and became a member of the state\u2019s Independence Party. This is not the first time Ventura has flirted with a third-party run. He added on Twitter: \u201cI haven\u2019t filed anything. I authorized a letter of interest that was sent on my behalf to the Greens and I\u2019m testing the waters for Green Party nomination. I\u2019m an independent. I\u2019m not a Democrat or a Republican because I know they\u2019re not the solution.\u201d Two women have come forward publicly to corroborate details of a sexual assault allegation against Joe Biden, according to new reporting from Business Insider. Tara Reade, a former aide in Biden\u2019s Senate office, alleged that the presumptive Democratic nominee assaulted her in a congressional hallway in 1993. Biden\u2019s campaign has denied the allegation. In an interview with Business Insider, a former neighbor of Reade\u2019s said Reade shared details of the alleged assault with her in the mid-1990s. \u201cThis happened, and I know it did because I remember talking about it,\u201d the neighbor, Lynda LaCasse, told the website. The other woman, Lorraine Sanchez, a colleague of Reade\u2019s in the office of a California state senator in the mid-1990s, told the website that she remembers Reade complaining that she had been fired after complaining about a former boss in Washington DC who had sexually harassed her. In April 2019, Reade was among several women who came forward to accuse Biden of inappropriate behavior or conduct that made them feel uncomfortable. But last month, in a podcast interview with progressive media host Katie Halper, Reade made a much more serious allegation. She said Biden cornered her in a semi-private corridor on Capitol Hill, pinned her against the wall and digitally penetrated her. She repeated the story to The Intercept, The New York Times and The Washington Post. Reade\u2019s brother and a friend who has remained anonymous have confirmed aspects of her story. Reade also said she told her mother, who is deceased. This weekend video archive emerged of a woman Reade identified as her mother calling into CNN\u2019s Larry King Live in 1993 to discuss what Reade said was a reference to her claim. The woman\u2019s question is vague but she references her daughter\u2019s \u201cproblems\u201d with a prominent senator. Kate Bedingfield, Biden\u2019s communications director, said in a statement last month: \u201cWomen have a right to tell their story, and reporters have an obligation to rigorously vet those claims. We encourage them to do so, because these accusations are false.\u201d Biden has not publicly commented on the story. Read Business Insider\u2019s full story here. Cuomo has finished his daily briefing. Here are the top lines: New York\u2019s death rate is in decline, but hospitalizations are flat. Cuomo plans to extend a 15 May stay-at-home order for some parts of the state while other parts of the state may begin to \u201cunpause\u201d. Cuomo said the state is still seeing 1,000 new Covid-19 cases per day. A preliminary survey found that 14.9% of New York residents have antibodies to the virus. Cuomo said he would not \u201csecond guess\u201d the state board of elections over a decision to cancel its June primary. The New York State Board of Elections has removed Bernie Sanders from the ballot and cancelled the states primary, which was scheduled for 23 June. Sanders dropped out of the Democratic race earlier this month and endorsed Joe Biden, making him the party\u2019s presumptive nominee. But Sanders had hoped to stay on the ballot in the remaining state primaries and collect delegates to influence the party platform. New York, the center of the coronavirus outbreak in the US, was the most delegate-rich Democratic primary left on the calendar. Sanders supporters had urged the state to keep him on the ballot. \u201cI\u2019m not going to second guess the Board of Elections,\u201d Cuomo said, responding to the development in real time. The mechanics of voting has become a fraught political issue amid the pandemic, with several states, including New York postponing primaries until later in the year. States like Wisconsin pressed ahead with their primary despite warnings from public health officials, a decision that raised questions about how the nation would conduct a general election if there is a resurgence of the virus later this year. Ohio, which delayed its March primary, is scheduled to hold elections on Tuesday. Cuomo hammers the point that states still need federal assistance. He takes issue with the suggestion that politically-liberal states like New York \u201ctake more\u201d from the federal government than conservative states. Cuomo is now rhapsodizing about the American spirit and the possibility of remaking an economy and a body politic that has for decades advantaged the wealthy and the privileged. \u201cWe have to use this moment to reimagine and be smart and grow,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cThis is one of these moments if you look back in history sometimes it takes a crisis to wake people up.\u201d He closed by praising the leadership of Kentucky governor Andy Beshear, a Democrat in a conservative state who he said \u201cstood up\u201d to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. \u201cIt takes guts. You don\u2019t get that from a typical politician,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cSo thank you, Governor.\u201d Preliminary results from an antibody survey of New York residents found that 14.9% of the state is positive for Covid-19 antibody. The sample size of the survey was 7,500. Cuomo said the state will test 1,000 NYPD officers and 1,000 FDNY workers for antibodies He said this is part of the state\u2019s effort to prepare for the virus to return later this year. \u201cAnticipate an issue in the future,\u201d he said, noting that he spoke to Trump this morning. Cuomo said he would extend the stay-at-home order in some parts of the state, but will allow other regions to re-open on 15 May. He said the state is still seeing 1,000 new cases per day. \u201cI will extend them in many parts of the state but in some parts of the state, in some regions, you could make the case that we should unpause on May 15,\u201d Cuomo said at his daily briefing from Albany. \u201cBut you have to be smart about it. ... There is no light switch.\u201d He issued a warning to his colleagues who will be overseeing the reopening in the coming weeks: \u201cIf you are not smart you will see that infection rate go right back to where it was, right where we were 58 days ago.\u201d He described the reopening as turning a valve. How much to turn the dials will be based on four factors: hospitalization rate, antibody testing, diagnostic testing, rate of transmission. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said 337 New Yorkers died in past 24 hours, a sign of \u201cdecline\u201d in the state. He said the hospitalization rate is \u201cflat.\u201d The White House officially cancels a planned Covid-19 coronavirus task force press briefing, according to an updated version of the president\u2019s daily schedule. The briefing was initially scheduled for 5pm EST. The cancellation comes amid concern that the briefings \u2013 during which Trump will hold court for 90 minutes, or more \u2013 have become politically problematic for the president. During a meeting last week, he mused that coronavirus might be treated with disinfectant, forcing manufactures and public health officials to issue urgent warnings to Americans about the serious, possibly fatal, dangers of ingesting such toxins. Following the shocking \u2013 and baseless \u2013 suggestion, Trump took no questions at the briefing on Friday. No briefings were held over the weekend. Axios reported on Sunday that the White House was planning to shift to events focused on the economy rather than the public health crisis in the coming days. Some news out of New York Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s Monday press briefing. De Blasio announced self-swab testing, which he says is \u201csimpler and safer\u201d for health care professionals to administer. The mayor said the new method will be rolled out this week. \u201cThis is a whole different thing,\u201d de Blasio said, describing the process. He said patients would be given instructions on how to administer the test using what he said was effectively a \u201csterile Q-tip.\u201d He said the new testing method, which will be overseen by medical professionals, will protect health care workers and help conserve personal protective equipment (PPE). De Blasio also announced that the city intends to open up more streets to pedestrians, beginning with 40 miles around parks with a goal of reaching 100 miles. The supreme court has sidestepped what could have been a major decision to expand gun rights. The Associated Press called it an \u201canti-climatic end\u201d and a \u201cdisappointment\u201d to gun rights advocates who had hoped the court\u2019s newly-installed conservative majority would rule in their favor. More from the AP report: It ruled that the city\u2019s move to ease restrictions on taking licensed, locked and unloaded guns outside the city limits, coupled with a change in state law to prevent New York from reviving the ban, left the court with nothing to decide. The court asked a lower court to consider whether the city\u2019s new rules still pose problems for gun owners. Will there or won\u2019t there? The mystery over whether there will or won\u2019t be a coronavirus press briefing on Monday evening appears to been resolved, for now. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told Fox News: \u201cToday we\u2019re not tracking a briefing.\u201d Daily guidance for Mike Pence, which was sent one hour ago, listed a task force briefing at 5pm EST. Trump continued his long-running diatribe against the \u201cLamestream Media\u201d claiming there has \u201cnever been, in the history of our Country a more vicious or hostile\u201d national press corps. A second missive labeled the press the \u201cENEMY OF THE PEOPLE.\u201d Meanwhile, the US death toll from coronavirus is quickly approaching the number of Americans \u2013 58,200 \u2013 killed during the Vietnam War. The comments followed a weekend of rage-tweeting against the press, in which Trump appeared particularly incensed by a New York Times article that portrayed the cloistered president as consumed by his own negative media coverage. In a series of Sunday bulletins, Trump suggested reporters who won a \u201cNoble\u201d Prize for their coverage of Russia should have the award taken back. Responding to the Twitterati, quick to point out that the reporters received a Pulitzer prize and that the other award was the Nobel, not Noble, prize, Trump lamented: \u201cDoes sarcasm ever work?\u201d (He has since deleted the tweets.) Over the weekend, the White House gamely participated in a New York Post piece that rebutted the Times\u2019 characterization of Trump\u2019s daily preoccupations. Indeed, the Post story begins with a claim from White House aides that Trump\u2019s schedule is \u201cso packed\u201d that he \u201csometimes skips lunch\u201d. In the article, Mark Meadows, the president\u2019s new chief of staff, said his \u201cbiggest concern\u201d is ensuring the president gets \u201ca quick bite to eat.\u201d That is perhaps not what you\u2019d expect to be at the top of the White House chief of staff\u2019s priority list during the worst national crisis since the second world war. The $2.2tn coronavirus stimulus deal, the largest economic rescue package in American history, was also, perhaps unsurprisingly, one of the most lobbied bills of all time, according to a new analysis by the Open Secrets, which tracks money in politics. \u201cOpenSecrets found that at least 3,200 clients reported lobbying on issues related to coronavirus and the stimulus bill. More than 1,500 lobbying clients specifically reported attempting to influence the House version of the CARES Act. Among all non-appropriations bills introduced since 2005, only the 2009 stimulus package drew more lobbying clients. It also found that: Clients that had never lobbied before hired lobbyists to ask Congress for financial aid in the stimulus bill. Industry groups asked Congress for more than $2.7 billion in direct support, but only a select few industries received carved-out stimulus funds. Some airlines increased their lobbying spending in the first quarter as the industry secured billions in taxpayer-funded grants. ... Health sector spending reached $161 million, around the all-time high first-quarter mark set last year. Gilead Sciences, the drugmaker working on a COVID-19 treatment, saw one of the biggest jumps in spending. It spent nearly $2.5 million, beating its 2019 first-quarter figure. You\u2019ll remember that drugmaker Gilead had come under fierce criticism that it was exploiting the coronavirus pandemic, after it sought orphan-status from the FDA for its antiviral drug remdesivir, which is being tested as a potential treatment. Bernie Sanders had called it \u201ctruly outrageous\u201d that the drug company would seek the special status, which grants drug companies market exclusivity. The company ultimately backtracked. An interesting line from the Associated Press, which has found that \u201cAmericans\u2019 support for mail-in voting has jumped amid concerns about the safety of polling places during the coronavirus pandemic\u201d. The AP also notes that its poll on the matter, conducted with NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, found \u201ca wide partisan divide\u201d which \u201csuggests President Donald Trump\u2019s public campaign against vote by mail may be resonating with his Republican backers\u201d. More: Democrats are now much more likely than Republicans to support their state conducting elections exclusively by mail, 47% to 29%. In 2018, about half as many Democrats were in favor, and there was little difference in the views of Democrats and Republicans on the question. and: The poll also shows 60% of Americans support allowing people to vote via absentee ballot without requiring them to give a reason if the outbreak is still happening. That includes 73% of Democrats and 46% of Republicans. Some 40% of Republicans are opposed. This month\u2019s elections in Wisconsin, and remarks by the president to Fox News, brought the issue of mail-in voting to national attention. Here\u2019s more from Sam Levine: A final slice of AP: The partisan differences could have a strong impact across the presidential battleground states. Five of the top seven swing states Michigan, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have divided government, and skirmishes over voting have already broken out in several. In some, there are signs that Democratic areas are moving faster than GOP ones to embrace mail voting Trump trade adviser, coronavirus czar and noted self-pseudonym Peter Navarro has been speaking to Fox News about reopening US factories. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to figure out the best protocols to keep our factories going,\u201d Navarro said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to use appropriate protocols, different social distancing. You\u2019re going to have to reconfigure factories. You\u2019re going to have to use things like thermoscanners to check fever as they come in.\u201d Navarro had a reasonably warm time of it in the news a couple of weeks ago. Here\u2019s Julian Borger\u2019s profile, from then, which still has probably the greatest headline ever to grace a profile of a White House trade adviser: Of course, the moment I blog that there\u2019s a briefing on the White House schedule today, Geoff Bennett of NBC News tweets the following: Update: Multiple White House officials tell NBC News this morning that there may NOT be a task force briefing today and that Trump may instead open to the press his 4pm Cabinet Room event with industry executives. (The current WH strategy, I\u2019m told, is to show Trump \u201cat work\u201d.) Why seek to show Trump \u201cat work\u201d? The New York Times, remember, reported last week that the president: \u2026arrives in the Oval Office these days as late as noon, when he is usually in a sour mood after his morning marathon of television. He has been up in the White House master bedroom as early as 5am watching Fox News, then CNN, with a dollop of MSNBC thrown in for rage viewing \u2026 the president sees few allies no matter which channel he clicks. He is angry even with Fox [News], an old security blanket, for not portraying him as he would like to be seen. The Times also said: \u201cThe daily White House coronavirus task force briefing is the one portion of the day that Mr Trump looks forward to, although even Republicans say that the two hours of political attacks, grievances and falsehoods by the president are hurting him politically.\u201d And it added: \u201cAfter he is done watching the end of the daily White House briefing \u2026 Mr Trump watches television in his private dining room off the Oval Office. Assorted aides who are still around will join him to rehash the day and offer their assessments on the briefings. Comfort food \u2013 including French fries and Diet Coke \u2013 is readily available.\u201d From the White House, meanwhile, the first tweet of the day\u2026 Here\u2019s what Florida governor Ron DeSantis had to say about problems in his state: that the unemployment insurance system there was \u201cdesigned to fail\u201d. And here\u2019s what sometime Guardian contributor Steven Greenhouse says today: It\u2019s worth noting that though Donald Trump did not brief the press over the weekend, amid reports that such briefings would be scaled back in an attempt to limit the damage done by the president\u2019s freewheeling performances, there is a briefing on the White House schedule for Monday, at 5pm ET. It\u2019s also worth noting that one of Trump\u2019s targets in his remarkable-even-by-his-standards Sunday tweet storm (which included a retweet of doctored video from an account named \u201cTrump &amp; Biden are Rapey\u201d) was Fox News. \u201cThe people who are watching Fox News, in record numbers (thank you President Trump), are angry,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey want an alternative now. So do I!\u201d One alternative for Trump seems to have been the New York Post, which released a report about how the president \u2013 contrary to a New York Times report about his working habits, diet and schedule \u2013 is supposedly too busy to have lunch every day. The Post is of course owned by Rupert Murdoch, who also owns Fox News. Of the president and his words to the nation over the past week, meanwhile, the following is from CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter and his Reliable Sources email. It\u2019s pretty stark: As the death toll has worsened, President Trump\u2019s behavior has worsened. I think his statements and rants and tweets are newsworthy no matter what, but should be reported in context, and right now the death toll is crucial context. As the US death toll approached 50,000, Trump mused about disinfectants. 50,000 dead, and he claimed he was just pranking the media. 51,000 dead, and he attacked CNN\u2019s owner AT&amp;T. 52,000 dead, and he tweeted about a professional wrestler. 53,000 dead, and he touted his ratings. 54,000 dead, and he went on a misspelled rant about \u2018Noble Prizes\u2019. Nearly 55,000 dead, and he retweeted a far-right commentator who suggested \u2018lunatics\u2019 on the left might be inflating the mortality rates \u2018in an attempt to steal the election.\u2019 This morning, the Washington Post is out with a report which says \u201cthe White House is finalising expanded guidelines to allow the phased reopening of schools and camps, childcare programs, certain workplaces, houses of worship, restaurants and mass transit, according to documents under review by administration officials\u201d. According to the Post: The 17-page guidance lists recommendations for each of six settings. It says all decisions should be made locally in collaboration with local health officials. An accompanying set of documents provides one-page checklists to help state and local health officials make decisions. The Washington Post obtained copies of the guidance and checklists. Down south, Georgia is set to reopen restaurants and cinemas today, with social distancing restrictions in place. Gyms, barber shops and hair salons were allowed to reopen on Friday. Governor Brian Kemp seems to have fallen rather afoul of President Trump on this one, his decision having been disowned by the president. The two men are not quite on the same page in other matters, politically, including Kemp\u2019s appointment of Kelly Loeffler \u2013 she of the stock sales \u2013 to a vacant US Senate seat instead of Trump\u2019s favoured pick, Republican congressman Doug Collins. Experts warn, widely, that reopening too early risks a resurgence in Covid-19 infections. Oliver Milman spoke to one last week: I don\u2019t think the US is ready, there are 50 states all at different points in their epidemic,\u201d said Yanis Ben Amor, executive director of the Center for Sustainable Development in the Earth Institute. \u201cWe aren\u2019t diagnosing enough people and if we don\u2019t have a testing system in place it will flare up again badly. We just don\u2019t have that testing system and as a human being I\u2019m deeply concerned about the consequences for people who think their governor is saying it\u2019s safe now.\u201d Nancy Pelosi is out with an endorsement for Joe Biden, the Democrats\u2019 presumptive nominee to face Trump at the polls in November. In the YouTube video, the House speaker says the former Delaware senator and US vice-president \u201cwill be an extraordinary president because he knows how to get the job done\u201d. Pelosi cites Biden\u2019s record in office under Barack Obama and calls him \u201ca voice of reason and resilience\u201d in the face of the coronavirus pandemic, \u201cwith a clear path to lead us out of this crisis\u201d. Apropos of all this, something I at least found interesting: the billionaire Mark Cuban has told Yahoo Finance he might yet mount a White House run. Why do I find this interesting? Because Cuban is a rugby nut and discussed it with me a couple of years ago. Rugby \u201ctaught me not to take myself too seriously\u201d, said the businessman who volunteered to be Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate and has flirted with a run for the White House himself. \u201cThe beauty of rugby is that it\u2019s so irreverent that you learn not to take anyone else too seriously too. You learn to accept other people for who they are. The same piece discussed how Bill Clinton and George W Bush, Ted Kennedy and former national security adviser HR McMaster, and Newt Gingrich\u2019s half-sister, Candace Gingrich, played and loved the greatest game. I didn\u2019t note it at the time but I know now that Rhode Island governor Gina Raimondo, an outside bet to be Biden\u2019s running mate, also played the game at college: So there\u2019s that. \u2026and welcome to another day of coverage of the coronavirus outbreak in the US. First, the figures according to Johns Hopkins University: US cases: 965,767 US deaths: 54,872 New York cases: 288,045 New York deaths: 22,269 For one comparison, around 58,000 Americans died in the Vietnam war. New York is of course the worst-hit state but not the only state badly hit. There have been nearly 6,000 deaths across the Hudson in New Jersey, more than 3,000 in Michigan and nearly 3,000 in Massachusetts, with more than 1,000 in many other states. One key question, with more than 26 million Americans unemployed due to the shutdown caused by the virus, is when states might move to safely reopen their economies. Andrew Cuomo, governor of New York, addressed the question on Sunday, as did Phil Murphy of New Jersey. One thing for sure \u2013 it will be gradual and dependent on death rates and hospitalisations declining, and testing capacity continuing to increase. In the White House, meanwhile, Donald Trump stews over his prospects in a re-election year. Chastened by the fallout from his remarks about disinfectant and sunlight last week \u2013 or not, of course \u2013 the president did not brief the press over the weekend. Instead, he went on a Twitter tear against the press and reports regarding his own work ethic, a possible move to fire health secretary Alex Azar, and more. It wasn\u2019t particularly pretty \u2013 it never is, particularly. Here\u2019s Rick Wilson, former Republican strategist and co-founder of the Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump effort, speaking to Lauren Gambino of this parish today: All re-election campaigns \u2013 every single one of them \u2013 are a referendum on the incumbent. And if Donald Trump had come into this election with peace and prosperity, it would be a very high hill to climb to defeat him. But he\u2019s not. He is coming into this with plague and depression.\u201d More to come of course \u2013 in the meantime, some further, devastating reading from Sam Levin in Los Angeles:",

The slickly produced final video is free to watch, although the <a href=\"http://sydneychamberopera.com/\">SCO does ask for donations</a> in lieu of ticket sales.</p> <p>Each work, guided with aplomb by female directors Danielle Maas and Clemence Williams, dives headfirst into disturbing themes: from debilitating depression to the eradication of wildlife.</p> <p>Yet despite wonderfully expressive performances from opera singers Jane Sheldon, Jessica O\u2019Donoghue, Mitchell Riley and Simon Lobelson, who are all seen up-close (with nowhere to hide) on screen, Breaking Glass is a mixed bag.</p> <p>Take The Tent by Josephine Macken, which depicts a strange, nightmarish future. In this dystopian world, scientists wearing white stand over projections of long-extinct creatures. Mixing electronic with live music, this is an opera with sparse singing: instead there are ominous roars, throaty gurgles and animalistic babbling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e29ac101b153b7bd9d46a9e7a9af92f11b5ab26\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e29ac101b153b7bd9d46a9e7a9af92f11b5ab26/0_0_2500_1667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The strange, nightmarish future of The Tent.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The strange, nightmarish future of The Tent.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Boud</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The result is a little too self-conscious. Claims in the program that The Tent is inspired by superstar author Margaret Atwood\u2019s short story of the same name seems both improbable (the two artworks have very little in common) and done largely to woo the audience into the (now virtual) auditorium.</p> <p>By contrast, Peggy Polias\u2019 Commute, also a take on literature \u2013 this time, Homer\u2019s Iliad \u2013 fares better. In this twist on the tale of Odysseus, a woman walks home alone at night. On a giant screen behind her, the monsters of the dark emerge: creeping male hands become menacing and tarantula-like; a giant eye, representing the Cyclops, threatens to all but consume the woman as she clutches her bag in fear. The music, which starts with sinister white noise, ends on a note of relief when dawn finally breaks and a purple wash erupts over the stage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a6bf1f579d066dd2f47b311632db54a18688a11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a6bf1f579d066dd2f47b311632db54a18688a11/0_0_2500_1667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peggy Polias\u2019 Commute is a take on Homer\u2019s The Iliad.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peggy Polias\u2019 Commute is a take on Homer\u2019s The Iliad.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Boud</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is The Invisible Bird, by Bree Van Reyk, however, that is the freshest of the four works \u2013 showing that difficult subjects are sometimes best served through humour.</p> <p>The opera tells the tale of the rare Australian night parrot, thought to be extinct for a hundred years, before it was rediscovered in 2013. Thankfully, it does not take itself as seriously as the other pieces but starts like a cabaret with its performers dressed in black tuxedos and tails and a long black, plunging dress. They sing about the macaroni penguin, the white-breasted scrubtit, the galah and the honeyeater. Often the choreography is done for comic effect: the lyric \u201cextinct\u201d is delivered with a grotesquely cheerful grin and an overly dramatic slice of the hand across the neck.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/apr/28/theatre-kept-my-mind-so-activated-the-existential-crisis-of-sydneys-standing-ovation-man\">'Theatre kept my mind so activated': the existential crisis of Sydney's 'standing ovation man'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The scene that most sticks with me is beautiful for its simplicity. Standing in a lit, raised box, vocalist Jane Sheldon dons an off-the-shoulder green feathered shrug. When the cast sing of trees cut down by \u201cwhite men\u201d she starts to pluck off its feathers, one by one. Eventually, feathers rain from the sky.</p> <p>It is a welcome relief from an evening\u2019s entertainment that often feels claustrophobic, especially when gorged on online, trapped at home, during a pandemic. Watch this only when in the mood, otherwise it might just tip you off the edge. As the cast sing in Her Dark Marauder: \u201cI see myself rise, wrap new skin on old bones / (burned my new coat yesterday) / and open my mouth to eat the future.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Sydney Chamber Opera\u2019s Breaking Glass is <a href=\"http://sydneychamberopera.com/\">available to stream online</a> now</em></p>",

But Her Dark Marauder, while visually stunning, creates an atmosphere of breathless oppression. The work opens Breaking Glass, a showcase of four new operatic acts developed over the last two years by the Sydney Chamber Opera (SCO) with Sydney Conservatorium\u2019s Composing Women program. Breaking Glass breaks the mould for Australian arts in two ways. First, each of the four operas is by a female composer \u2013 a small step to rectify the woeful neglect of women in the classical music world. (In 2018\u201319, 95% of concerts worldwide contained music only composed by men). Second, with the live Sydney premiere cancelled due to the coronavirus lockdown, Breaking Glass instead launched online on Facebook, by merging together recordings of dress rehearsals filmed at Carriageworks with a final audio take. The slickly produced final video is free to watch, although the SCO does ask for donations in lieu of ticket sales. Each work, guided with aplomb by female directors Danielle Maas and Clemence Williams, dives headfirst into disturbing themes: from debilitating depression to the eradication of wildlife. Yet despite wonderfully expressive performances from opera singers Jane Sheldon, Jessica O\u2019Donoghue, Mitchell Riley and Simon Lobelson, who are all seen up-close (with nowhere to hide) on screen, Breaking Glass is a mixed bag. Take The Tent by Josephine Macken, which depicts a strange, nightmarish future. In this dystopian world, scientists wearing white stand over projections of long-extinct creatures. Mixing electronic with live music, this is an opera with sparse singing: instead there are ominous roars, throaty gurgles and animalistic babbling. The result is a little too self-conscious. Claims in the program that The Tent is inspired by superstar author Margaret Atwood\u2019s short story of the same name seems both improbable (the two artworks have very little in common) and done largely to woo the audience into the (now virtual) auditorium. By contrast, Peggy Polias\u2019 Commute, also a take on literature \u2013 this time, Homer\u2019s Iliad \u2013 fares better. In this twist on the tale of Odysseus, a woman walks home alone at night. On a giant screen behind her, the monsters of the dark emerge: creeping male hands become menacing and tarantula-like; a giant eye, representing the Cyclops, threatens to all but consume the woman as she clutches her bag in fear. The music, which starts with sinister white noise, ends on a note of relief when dawn finally breaks and a purple wash erupts over the stage. It is The Invisible Bird, by Bree Van Reyk, however, that is the freshest of the four works \u2013 showing that difficult subjects are sometimes best served through humour. The opera tells the tale of the rare Australian night parrot, thought to be extinct for a hundred years, before it was rediscovered in 2013. Thankfully, it does not take itself as seriously as the other pieces but starts like a cabaret with its performers dressed in black tuxedos and tails and a long black, plunging dress. They sing about the macaroni penguin, the white-breasted scrubtit, the galah and the honeyeater. Often the choreography is done for comic effect: the lyric \u201cextinct\u201d is delivered with a grotesquely cheerful grin and an overly dramatic slice of the hand across the neck. The scene that most sticks with me is beautiful for its simplicity. Standing in a lit, raised box, vocalist Jane Sheldon dons an off-the-shoulder green feathered shrug. When the cast sing of trees cut down by \u201cwhite men\u201d she starts to pluck off its feathers, one by one. Eventually, feathers rain from the sky. It is a welcome relief from an evening\u2019s entertainment that often feels claustrophobic, especially when gorged on online, trapped at home, during a pandemic. Watch this only when in the mood, otherwise it might just tip you off the edge. As the cast sing in Her Dark Marauder: \u201cI see myself rise, wrap new skin on old bones / (burned my new coat yesterday) / and open my mouth to eat the future.\u201d \u2022 Sydney Chamber Opera\u2019s Breaking Glass is available to stream online now",

Perhaps some good could come from this. \u201cI\u2019ve got a story that could really help a lot of young people who [are] in my position,\u201d he says. \u201cOut of all my friends I\u2019m the one the best at giving advice, so I thought I\u2019d extend on that a bit. I want to be able to change young people\u2019s lives before they get too far gone.\u201d *Not their real names.

      "body": "<p>A total of 50.8 million people around the world were recorded as internally displaced last year, forced from their homes by conflict and disaster. This is the highest number ever, and 10 million more than in 2018.</p> <p>Annual <a href=\"https://www.internal-displacement.org/global-report/grid2020/\">statistics published</a> by the Norwegian Refugee Council\u2019s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) calculated that by the end of 2019, 45.7 million people were internally displaced \u2013 effectively becoming refugees in their own country \u2013 as a result of violence in 61 countries. An additional 5.1 million people in 96 countries had been displaced by disasters.</p> <p>Alexandra Bilak, the IDMC director, said she had hoped internal displacement would receive more global attention this year, following the launch in October of a <a href=\"https://disasterdisplacement.org/press-release-by-co-chairs-of-the-un-secretary-generals-high-level-panel-on-internal-displacement-on-commencement-of-work\">UN high-level panel</a> to address the problem and find long-term solutions. The panel held its first meeting in February.</p> <p>However, Covid-19 was expected to shift focus away, she said. \u201cWe were so hoping this year would be really the wake-up call to the international community, with the new high-level panel on internal displacement.

      "bodyText": "A total of 50.8 million people around the world were recorded as internally displaced last year, forced from their homes by conflict and disaster. This is the highest number ever, and 10 million more than in 2018. Annual statistics published by the Norwegian Refugee Council\u2019s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) calculated that by the end of 2019, 45.7 million people were internally displaced \u2013 effectively becoming refugees in their own country \u2013 as a result of violence in 61 countries. An additional 5.1 million people in 96 countries had been displaced by disasters. Alexandra Bilak, the IDMC director, said she had hoped internal displacement would receive more global attention this year, following the launch in October of a UN high-level panel to address the problem and find long-term solutions. The panel held its first meeting in February. However, Covid-19 was expected to shift focus away, she said. \u201cWe were so hoping this year would be really the wake-up call to the international community, with the new high-level panel on internal displacement. We thought this year would be the year of internal displacement,\u201d said Bilak. She said it was too early to assess the full impact of the coronavirus on displacement and the efforts to address it, but was worried about future funding. \u201cIf we\u2019re about to plunge into a recession, of course it\u2019s going to have an impact on the generosity of donor governments,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a really bad situation for everybody.\u201d Bilak added there was great concern for the safety of people who have been displaced. \u201cIDPs (internally displaced people) are often highly vulnerable people living in crowded camps, emergency shelters and informal settlements with little or no access to healthcare. The global coronavirus pandemic will make them more vulnerable still. It will compromise their already precarious living conditions, by further limiting their access to essential services and humanitarian aid.\u201d Bilak said the Norwegian Refugee Council and other humanitarian agencies were already reporting that government restrictions were affecting the delivery of aid. The report, published on Tuesday, showed that the majority of new cases of displacement last year were in poorer countries. The highest number were recorded in sub-Saharan Africa, where escalating violence and deteriorating security in the Sahel and ongoing conflict in Somalia and South Sudan continued to drive hundreds of thousands from their homes. Tropical storms and monsoon rains in south and east Asia and the Pacific had also displaced millions. India, the Philippines, Bangladesh and China each recorded at least 4 million displacements, although the majority were the result of evacuations by their governments. By the end of last year, more than 130,000 people were still unable to return home after the devastation of cyclones Idai and Kenneth. Bilak warned that next year\u2019s displacement report was \u201cgoing to be extremely difficult\u201d to compile as people responsible for collecting data may struggle to do so under current restrictions. \u201cWe could end up with a black hole of data,\u201d she said.",

Coates said the IOC believed it had given itself \u201cas much time as possible,\u201d but conceded that the situation remained unpredictable. \u201cIt may be there is still an issue about the number of people congregating and those things, testing on athletes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to say.\u201d Japan has so far avoided a catastrophic coronavirus outbreak seen in the US and some European countries, with about 13,600 cases and 394 deaths, according to the health ministry. Those numbers do not include infections and deaths linked to the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was quarantined in Yokohama, near Tokyo, in February. On Monday, Tokyo saw the number of daily confirmed cases drop below 100 for two days in a row, with 72 cases reported on Sunday and 39 on Monday, public broadcaster NHK said. The numbers of cases reported at the weekends and on Mondays tend to be lower because some testing facilities are not open throughout the week. Tokyo has reported almost 4,000 infections, by far the highest number among Japan\u2019s 47 prefectures. \u201cWe have indeed seen a decrease in new cases including here in Tokyo,\u201d Yokokura said during an online briefing at the Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club of Japan. \u201cI would like to think this is a genuine decrease, but we are still facing a situation in Japan in which the number of tests is insufficient. So I think we need to wait a week or so to see how things develop.\u201d The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, declared a state of emergency in Tokyo and six other areas in early April that has since been widened to cover the entire country. Local governors can request that people stay home and that nonessential businesses close, but there are no fines or other penalties for non-compliance.",

      "bodyText": "Britain has gone without coal-fired power generation for its longest stretch since the Industrial Revolution, breaking the existing record of 18 consecutive days this morning. The UK\u2019s energy system has not used coal-fired plants for more than 438 hours, according to National Grid data, the longest uninterrupted period since 1882. The 18-day stretch has broken the UK\u2019s previous record, which was set on 4 June 2019, partly because of a collapse in demand for electricity during the coronavirus lockdown and because of greater use of solar power. The UK set a new solar power record on 20 April after solar farms generated more than 9.6GW of electricity for the first time. The lockdown has also caused the UK\u2019s electricity demand to fall to record lows because schools, shops, factories and restaurants have closed. On Monday the demand was forecast to fall almost a fifth below the usual levels in April, according to the data. The lower overall demand for electricity means low-carbon energy sources are able to make up a greater proportion of the energy system than usual. This month National Grid said it may need to turn windfarms and some power plants off in order to avoid overloading the electricity grid. The new coal-free record comes almost three years after the grid first ran without coal power for 24 hours for the first time. Since then, all but four of the UK\u2019s coal power plants have shut in advance of a government ban on coal generation from 2025. Coal made up only 2.1% of the country\u2019s total power mix last year, a dramatic fall from almost a quarter just four years ago. The collapse of coal and rise of renewable energy sources have led to a drastic reduction in carbon emissions from the UK power sector. Since 2012, the average carbon intensity of the grid \u2013 the amount of emissions required to produce one kilowatt hour of energy \u2013 has declined by more than two-thirds, from 507g of CO2 to 161g. Britain\u2019s dwindling fleet of coal plants still includes the West Burton A and Ratcliffe-on-Soar power stations in Nottinghamshire, the Kilroot facilityin Northern Ireland and two generation units at the Drax site in Yorkshire, which are earmarked for conversion to burn gas.",

      "body": "<p>If Ovidiu Olea is astonished by the fact that he\u2019s gone from being a finance guy to a mask mogul in four months, he shows no sign of it. The transition started innocuously. Late in January, when the coronavirus spread beyond Wuhan, Olea decided he would buy masks for his staff. He lives in Hong Kong, where he runs a payment technology firm. His staff isn\u2019t large \u2013 just 20 employees \u2013 but finding even a few hundred masks proved hard. Part of the problem was that last year, after protesters in Hong Kong used masks to hide their identity, the Chinese government restricted supplies from the mainland. Before the pandemic, half the world\u2019s masks were manufactured in China; now, with production there shifting into overdrive, that figure may be <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-the-richest-country-on-earth-cant-get-you-a-face-mask-11585741254\" title=\"\">as high as 85%</a>. If China isn\u2019t sending you masks, you likely aren\u2019t getting any at all. We have no masks, local pharmacies told Olea, but if you find some, we\u2019ll buy them from you.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/11/how-the-face-mask-became-the-worlds-most-coveted-commodity-podcast\">How the face mask became the world's most coveted commodity \u2013 podcast</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Olea got to work. In a journal article, he read that epidemiologists spoke highly of N95 respirators, masks that filter out 95% of small particulate matter. Stealing time out of his day job, Olea began phoning N95 suppliers in Mexico, Turkey, Indonesia, Ireland. Each one turned him down. \u201cThe answers ranged from \u2018No\u2019 to \u2018We only sell to accredited buyers\u2019 to \u2018Come back next year,\u2019\u201d Olea told me. After three days, Olea found a South African firm named North Safety Products, which had 500,000 masks in stock. Olea bought them all, at less than a pound per mask, certain that he would be able to sell the surplus.</p> \n<p>During their conversations, North Safety Products executives warned Olea to be careful. There were \u201cinterested parties\u201d lurking outside its factory gates, ready to bribe truck drivers for their cargoes. Olea hired a security detail to ride alongside his truck of masks as it drove to the airport in Johannesburg. (He sent me a photo of the team: six grim men packing pistols and rifles, clad in camo and bulletproof vests. \u201cThey asked if I wanted machine guns as well. I thought not. We\u2019re not invading Lesotho. Let\u2019s keep it reasonable.\u201d) In mid-February, two weeks after he placed his order, his shipment touched down in Hong Kong. Within six hours, the buyers he had signed up had collected nearly all of the masks. \u201cEven if I\u2019d had 5m masks,\u201d Olea said, \u201cI\u2019d have sold out.\u201d</p> \n<p>Olea, who has a keen nose for business opportunities, quickly became possessed by this new line of work. Since February, as the pandemic has streaked around the planet, he has bought and sold on another million N95 masks from North Safety Products. In March, Olea became a middleman for Chinese-made three-ply masks, too, the simple kind that just about everyone everywhere is now opting to wear. He sold masks to the Hong Kong government, to European countries, via their diplomats in Hong Kong and China, and to European companies, which wanted them for their employees. All told, Olea reckons he\u2019s sold about 48m of them.</p> \n<p>By April, Olea decided he might as well take the next step. He bought a mask-making machine from a Chinese manufacturer: an eight-metre-long assembly line, which shapes and cuts sheets of plastic into masks. When I spoke to him, in mid-April, I was reading about mask prices close to \u00a36 a pop, and Olea was waiting with giddy excitement for his machine to reach him. He was still running his payments firm, and masks were a departure from that work. \u201cBut these are weird times,\u201d he insisted. \u201cWe all must do something to survive.\u201d</p> \n<p>No object better symbolises the pandemic than the mask, and no object better explains the world into which the pandemic arrived. Social distancing, at first, felt like a strange notion: the inaction of it, the vagueness of it. But the mask sang out to our deepest consumeristic impulses. In the absence of a drug or a vaccine, the mask is the only material protection we can buy; it\u2019s a product, and we\u2019ve been trained like seals to respond to products. As a result, in every corner of every country, the humble face mask \u2013 this assembly of inexpensive plastic \u2013 has been elevated into a fetishised commodity. One mask broker described it as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/market-for-chinese-made-masks-is-a-madhouse-says-broker\" title=\"\">a madhouse</a>\u201d, another as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddisalvo/2020/03/30/i-spent-a-day-in-the-coronavirus-driven-feeding-frenzy-of-n95-mask-sellers-and-buyers-and-this-is-what-i-learned/#199e11b356d4\" title=\"\">the craziest market I\u2019ve ever seen</a>\u201d.</p> \n<p>Countries have hoarded masks, and used them as chips in geopolitical games. Thieves have made off with them. Prada, Gucci and Balenciaga have started to manufacture them. We already have MaskClub.com which, like a \u201cjam of the month\u201d club, offers $9.99-a-month mask subscriptions: the best-beloved business model of hipster e-commerce. Last year, an industry insider told me, Burberry had toyed with the notion of putting face masks on some of its models during a catwalk show \u2013 a wink, perhaps, at our apocalyptic future. By March, things had become real, and the fashion house <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2020/03/30/burberry-making-gowns-masks-nhs-12479187/\" title=\"\">was pledging</a> to make masks and gowns for the UK\u2019s NHS. From a healthcare perspective, the mask was a matter of life and death. But it also took on the function of a talisman \u2013 as an object to hang comfortingly between the body and a diseased society.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e0e4b23bea5e8f048388e938d8d19e552e768430\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0e4b23bea5e8f048388e938d8d19e552e768430/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protective masks hang in a decontamination unit in Somerville, Massachusetts.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protective masks hang in a decontamination unit in Somerville, Massachusetts.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Dwyer/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>All this when no one even seemed to know precisely how useful masks were, or who should wear them. The advice we got was a mess. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/apr/10/world-health-organization-who-v-coronavirus-why-it-cant-handle-pandemic\" title=\"\">World Health Organization</a> maintained, at first, that healthy people had no need for masks. But people bought masks anyway. Shelves were emptied. People improvised. A friend of mine in Tel Aviv ended up fashioning one for herself out of her husband\u2019s boxer shorts \u2013 washed and dried, she assured me, and slid over her head like a balaclava. Then, in early April, the WHO reversed its counsel, and a host of governments followed suit, which sparked a fresh run on mask stocks.</p> \n<p>In this pandemic, the mask reveals far more than it hides. It exposes the world\u2019s political and economic relations for what they are: vectors of self-interest that ordinarily lie obscured under glib talk of globalisation and openness. For the demagogues who govern so much of the world, the pandemic has provided an unimpeachable excuse to fulfil their dearest wishes: to nail national borders shut, to tar every outsider as suspicious, and to act as if their own countries must be preserved above all others.</p> \n<p>When these tendencies combine with a fawning loyalty to the free market, the results can be ruinous. In mere weeks, the mask went from being an urgent human need to a cynically exploited asset in a global resource grab \u2013 the fastest such journey, perhaps, of any product in history. Sometimes, it felt as if the mask itself was beside the point \u2013 that it was just a trigger to rehearse old routines of acquisitiveness and discord, with no further, greater end in sight.</p> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<p>We\u2019ve been living with the coronavirus long enough now that we can distinguish the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/apr/23/coronavirus-face-masks-around-the-world-in-pictures\" title=\"\">various tribes</a> of mask-wearers. Note the shopper in the pasta aisle, clad in a classic white N95 with the 3M manufacturer logo just under the snout. The N95 and its equivalents keep out nearly every particle larger than 0.3 microns, and although the virus is tinier, the fibres in the mask\u2019s layers obstruct its passage. These masks are meant to go first to healthcare workers, which might explain the shopper\u2019s furtive, guilty eyes. Note the finance bro out for his allotted hour of jogging, wearing a Vogmask \u2013 a brand so stylish that its midnight-blue model might even match his suit when he eventually returns to the City. Note the extreme worrier in the GVS Elipse P100, the heavy-duty mask that promises to keep out 99.97% of particles. In the age of Covid-19, the equivalent of sensible shoes may be the simple surgical mask or the home-hemmed cloth. The gaps in their weave are big enough for the virus to pass through, but they do at least protect others from the wearer\u2019s sneezes and coughs.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5d25beb5-14fb-47b4-bd06-0714dbfabc04\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cqLnDhHSJDU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Such deep familiarity with masks is hard-won. The pandemic has brought on a global shortage of masks, which is really a global shortage of one particular plastic inside the masks \u2013 a type of non-woven polypropylene that acts as a filter. In casual conversation, people in the mask business call the plastic \u201cmeltblown\u201d, referring to how its plastic filaments are made. Meltblown goes into many things: jackets, nappies, filters in water purifiers and air conditioners. Masks are in short supply not because they\u2019re difficult to produce, but because the meltblown industry is used to stable, long-term demand. It churns out just enough for its customers and no more. To install an assembly line of meltblown takes many months, even at the calmest of times; with demand now soaring, some companies supplying meltblown equipment are quoting timelines of up to two years to even deliver a new machine.</p> \n<p>Hot out of the plant, meltblown looks like a giant toilet roll: 15,000 yards or so of polypropylene wrapped around a cardboard core. The material feels like synthetic cloth, but it\u2019s so thin that you might accidentally put your finger through it, an executive at one American meltblown manufacturer told me. He asked to keep his and his company\u2019s names out of this article, for a reason I\u2019ve never been given before. They don\u2019t want to be known more widely, he said: \u201cWe\u2019re so overburdened with enquiries already. If any further information gets out, that\u2019s another thousand messages coming in every day. That makes it impossible to do any work.\u201d Until last year, just 2 or 3% of his company\u2019s meltblown went into face masks, he said. This year, it\u2019s 95%.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"16aebaf27d74fc9aaa773114022c1c07576baae1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16aebaf27d74fc9aaa773114022c1c07576baae1/0_301_4941_2966/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manufacturing of meltblown fabric for use in face masks in Chengdu, China.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manufacturing of meltblown fabric for use in face masks in Chengdu, China.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chine Nouvelle/SIPA/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Until now, countries didn\u2019t consider meltblown a strategic commodity, so during the past three decades, much of its production has migrated from the west to low-cost factories in Asia. The executive\u2019s company is one of just five or 10 remaining manufacturers in the US, he said, and China produces close to half of all the meltblown in the world. As a result, the rush for masks provided a compressed, vivid reminder of something we\u2019d been aware of for a couple of decades now: that in all manufacturing and trade, the lines of commerce inevitably bend towards China.</p> \n<p>Early in February, the Chinese government began preventing exports of meltblown, so that the material could first be used to assemble masks for China\u2019s own population. The prospect of being cut off from half the world\u2019s meltblown supply \u201cput the fear of God\u201d into everyone who manufactured anything that contained it, the executive said. The market price of meltblown went up fourfold. He began to get 200 or 300 phone calls a day from mask companies all over the world, demanding meltblown. Even Chinese mask manufacturers rang him, worried that their country might run out. They\u2019d offer cash up front and try to outbid each other. \u201cThey\u2019d say: \u2018Name your price, any price you want to, anything,\u2019 and I\u2019d explain that we don\u2019t do it that way,\u201d said the executive. Then they dangled bribes before him: all-expenses-paid holidays. Just tell us where you want to go.</p> \n<p>Also in February, the Chinese government effectively made itself the sole customer of the major mask-making factories in its territory. This applied to Chinese-owned companies, but also to big mask plants in China owned by foreign firms; their products were earmarked for domestic use and banned from being shipped overseas. On 3 February, in <a href=\"https://guide.jsp.co.uk/statement/JSP%20Coronavirus%20Statement%203%20February%202020.pdf\" title=\"\">an apologetic letter</a> to customers, the British company JSP Safety said that its output of masks was running low, because two of its Chinese factories had been \u201cformally requisitioned by the government to make disposable RPE [respiratory protection equipment] for Chinese government agencies\u201d.</p> \n<p>Christopher Dobbing, who founded the Cambridge Mask Company in 2015, said his own factory in China was small enough to escape the government\u2019s notice, so his inventory wasn\u2019t snapped up by the authorities. But he did see, first-hand, the wave of Chinese panic-buying. \u201cChinese communities everywhere snapped up our masks wherever we had a footprint, so that they could send them home,\u201d Dobbing said. Chinese companies overseas <a href=\"http://www.chinaisa.org.cn/gxportal/xfgl/portal/content.html?articleId=4e44369ab9d5797768fa034525b2aad5c816782b7dd0ee3c401cfc3af43c1c3a&amp;columnId=58af05dfb6b4300151760176d2aad0a04c275aaadbb1315039263f021f920dcd\" title=\"\">were also</a> <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-07/china-implores-employees-and-clients-to-scour-world-for-masks\" title=\"\">asked</a> to purchase and ship back masks. On 26 January, Dobbing got 1,200 emails and 400 phone calls. \u201cMaybe they thought we were a huge company, but we were just a couple of guys in an office, panicking as the orders flowed in.\u201d By 28 January, he was taking pre-orders for March.</p> \n<p>Roughly 2bn masks were imported into China in February. To those with a kneejerk mistrust of China\u2019s rulers, it appeared as if, having first failed to contain the disease, they were now ransacking the mask market just when the coronavirus was starting to race through other nations. After a Chinese real-estate company in Sydney <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-doctors-issue-protective-equipment-warning-after-report-china-backed-firm-sourced-bulk-supplies-from-sydney\" title=\"\">was discovered</a> to have bought millions of masks, the Australian Medical Association urged its government to keep protective gear safe from foreign buyers. A lawyer attached to Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/04/05/trump-admin-weighs-legal-action-over-alleged-chinese-hoarding-of-ppe/\" title=\"\">compared</a> China\u2019s actions to \u201cfirst-degree murder\u201d and wondered aloud if the US could sue Beijing. The US state of Missouri then went on to do just that, arguing in its <a href=\"https://ago.mo.gov/docs/default-source/press-releases/2019/prc-complaint.pdf?sfvrsn=86ae7ab_2\" title=\"\">lawsuit</a> that China had \u201choarded personal protective equipment \u2013 thus causing a global pandemic that was unnecessary and preventable\u201d.</p> \n<p>But for the US and the rest of the west to complain about China aggressively pursuing its own interests is, in one way, to engage in a fundamental duplicity. China\u2019s wealth and power are the result of a longstanding international consensus championed by the US: that the quest for the lowest possible cost of production and the highest possible profit is paramount. According to this philosophy, if that means offshoring nearly everything to China, nothing must be allowed to stand in the way: not the hollowing-out of industry at home, or the loss of livelihoods, or human-rights concerns. And it isn\u2019t just China that has prospered from this arrangement. It has also been good to the richest people in the richest countries. Many of those same people now seem affronted by the world they helped create.</p> \n<p>As events transpired, few large nations behaved very differently from China once the disease blazed up within their own borders. \u201cA dog-eat-dog world is back,\u201d one former Polish diplomat <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/amid-coronavirus-a-dog-eat-dog-world-is-back/\" title=\"\">lamented</a>, as if such a world had ever gone anywhere in the first place.</p> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<p>By mid-March, China had relaxed its rules, allowing both masks and meltblown to be sold overseas again, to nations that were now in dire need of pandemic gear. But the market kept failing: supplies of masks often didn\u2019t make it to doctors, nurses, the elderly and others who required them most.</p> \n<p>During the great global scrum that followed, governments used every conceivable means to get hold of masks for their citizens before they went elsewhere. Foreign embassies in China turned their diplomatic staff <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/defence/coronavirus-mea-plays-proactive-role-in-fight-against-covid-19/1938679/\" title=\"\">into scouts</a> for medical supplies; Canada hired a multinational consulting firm to help <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-building-own-ppe-supply-chain-in-china-1.5530259\" title=\"\">figure out</a> which manufacturers could be trusted. Freight agents in China, who book space on ships and planes for goods leaving the country, found themselves handling medical equipment and little else. One agent in Shanghai, Fredrik Barner, had been shipping auto parts until this spring, when he was flooded with orders to move masks instead. \u201cI\u2019ve been in the industry for 10 years and I\u2019ve never seen such high air-freight rates,\u201d Barner told me. \u201cNormally, the rate is around $3 or $4 a kilogram. That went up to $17 or $18.\u201d</p> \n<p>Nations that couldn\u2019t make enough masks for themselves had to find unconventional ways to bring them in from China. In Ireland, the government asked Aer Lingus to run supplies out of Beijing. The airline had never flown to China before, and the planning and approvals for a new route would usually have taken six months. Aer Lingus did it in a week. Brian O\u2019Sullivan, Aer Lingus\u2019s chief flying instructor, captained the first plane to Beijing on 27 March, taking with him four other pilots, two engineers and a specialist in balancing loads in an airplane. Ten hours out, six hours on the ground, then 13 hours back: the kind of flight schedule that is, for a single crew, inconceivable in regular aviation.</p> \n<p>They landed in Beijing very early on a Sunday morning. Through the plane\u2019s open door, O\u2019Sullivan noticed that the airport, which usually buzzes like a beehive with flights landing and taking off, was practically in hibernation; in six hours, he saw just half a dozen or so departures. His crew never left the aircraft, O\u2019Sullivan told me, because that would have required them to go into quarantine. Instead, they stayed in business class, behind thick plastic drapes, while ground handlers loaded first the cargo hold and then economy class: huge green bags filled with masks, gowns and gloves were strapped into the seats, as if the cabin had been booked out by gigantic pods of peas. \u201cWe didn\u2019t shake hands with anyone,\u201d O\u2019Sullivan said, \u201cbut there were plenty of smiles and thankyous and nodding heads.\u201d When I spoke to him in mid-April, Aer Lingus had completed 30 Beijing flights, and expected to run another 200 or so by the end of May.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\" no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>To meet the rush for masks, a strange alternate ecosystem of suppliers sprang up, often supplying products of dubious quality. In Europe, several buyers of Chinese masks found their products to be sub-standard. The Dutch government had to recall 600,000 masks. Finland <a href=\"https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/04/09/finland-discovers-masks-bought-from-china-not-hospital-safe.html\" title=\"\">discovered</a> that an order of 2m surgical masks, which are discarded after use with a single patient, weren\u2019t good enough for hospital wear. Even if they had been up to scratch, those 2m masks would have only met the country\u2019s needs for four days.</p> \n<p>It wasn\u2019t always clear who was producing these masks. Being in the trade, Christopher Dobbing got a number of emails throughout March and April from Chinese mask vendors he\u2019d never heard of before. He sent me a few of them, and I rang one of the listed numbers, in the city of Zhangjiagang, 100 miles or so from Shanghai. A woman picked up and introduced herself as Rita. She told me that the company she worked for had been selling K95 masks since the first week of March, for $2.50 a pop. I asked if they manufactured the masks as well.</p> \n<p>She laughed. \u201cNo, we make tin plate. But our clients in America and Europe asked if we could source masks, so we do that now,\u201d she told me. \u201cWe get them from a big factory nearby, which makes masks.\u201d</p> \n<p>I asked how long it would take to send 10,000 masks to London. She couldn\u2019t say. There weren\u2019t many flights out of the country, and after some batches of exported masks had been found to be defective, Chinese customs authorities were inspecting mask cargoes more rigorously. A friend of hers, another mask vendor, had been waiting two weeks already for one of her shipments to clear customs, she told me.</p> \n<p>The factory that actually made the masks belonged to another company, Rita said. Chinese manufacturers that produce masks for medical use in the west must be certified by government health agencies such as the US Food and Drug Administration. Rita assured me that the manufacturer had an FDA certificate, and she emailed me a scan to prove it. It had been issued on 1 April. In the space where the manufacturer\u2019s name should have been displayed, there was just a short span of white space followed by the generic words Technology Co., Ltd. It looked like any company might print its name into the blank space and make the certificate its own. On the FDA\u2019s database, I looked up the certificate\u2019s number. The FDA had awarded it to Jiangsu Newborn Medical Technology Co, Ltd \u2013 a different company altogether.</p> \n<p>Among those tempted to reinvent themselves as mask merchants were drug dealers, who used the crisis to diversify their portfolio. Logan Pauley, a researcher at the Center for Advanced Defense Studies in Washington DC, tracks the sales of illicit drugs on the internet, focusing on trafficking from east Asia to the rest of the world. Towards the end of February, he noticed that some of the dealers he monitors were advertising masks and gloves. He sent me screenshots. \u201cMask, 3ply, 50pcs per box, 20 box min. $33.50 per box, exclude shipping charges,\u201d ran one Facebook post by a user named Vicky, in a group where people otherwise offer fentanyl for sale.</p> \n<p>It was difficult to know how to feel about these transactions, Pauley said. On the one hand, Vicky\u2019s masks might well be of terrible quality, and there was a danger that the masks would be deliberately mislabelled, whisked through US customs, and then sold on to US hospitals short of gear. \u201cCustoms is swamped right now,\u201d said Pauley. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to be opening and checking every box.\u201d On the other hand, he said, the FDA and other international authorities that license medical supplies \u201chave made it difficult, in this time of need, to get new suppliers approved in a timely fashion. If the masks are good, the hospital may be paying three times the price for them, but it\u2019s still better than waiting for FDA approvals.\u201d</p> \n<p>He was right. If I\u2019d been a hospital administrator in critical need of masks, perhaps I\u2019d have placed an order with one of these shadowy brokers. In the absence of government supplies or a well-ordered mask market, the seediest corners of the internet seemed to offer one of the few ways to find any masks at all.</p> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<p>Alongside the new mask middlemen and the criminal elements finding a fresh vocation, there were the groups who had never fabricated a mask before, but who had a sure sense of money to be made. From February onwards, legions of new mask-makers emerged, of every size and shape: from big companies such as BMW to the amateurs the meltblown executive characterised as \u201cfour neighbours in a cul-de-sac in Los Angeles, who\u2019ve gone on to the internet to learn about sewing masks\u201d. A face mask-making machine costs about $100,000, he told me, and it makes about 70,000-100,000 masks a day. He has received at least 200 enquiries from Americans who are importing machines from China \u2013 \u201cpeople who just have 100K to spend and a bit of space, and want to make some money.\u201d</p> \n<p>You\u2019d like to think they have some experience doing this, he said, but many of them don\u2019t know a thing. They ring him when they\u2019re expecting a new machine in three weeks, to ask vaguely for mask textile.</p> \n<p>\u201cDo you want meltblown?\u201d he asks them.</p> \n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> \n<p>What about noseclips? What about spun-bound polypropylene, the plastic that encases the melt-blown?</p> \n<p>\u201cOh, we need to get some of that, too, do we?\u201d</p> \n<p>And then, the executive said to me with a sigh: \u201cI have to spend half an hour teaching them about mask manufacturing.\u201d</p> \n<p>All these breakdowns in the market \u2013 the hospitals without masks, the bogus gear, the exorbitant prices, the hoarding, the fly-by-night profiteers \u2013 seem to expose the limits of orthodox economics. The most ardent devotees of the free market believe that supply and demand solve every basic problem if they\u2019re permitted to work unconstrained. When demand is high, the price climbs, and the prospect of profit brings in a host of new suppliers. With time, the market rewards those who sell good products and punishes those who sell poor ones; with time, the price settles so that it allocates products most efficiently to those who value them most.</p> \n<p>That\u2019s the theory, anyway, and its advocates insist that it applies even in a crisis. In 2012, for instance, researchers at the University of Chicago asked eminent economists for their opinions on Connecticut\u2019s plan to outlaw price-gouging \u2013 exploitatively high prices \u2013 during floods or other weather cataclysms. Seventy-seven <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JwfFDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA82&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=connecticut+2012+price+gouging+weather&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DpDYaMSZDs&amp;sig=ACfU3U1edKBXJpI4IT5ntHyRR69cgTO2eQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjVkrK1rfnoAhWyunEKHXzbDm0Q6AEwB3oECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=connecticut%202012%20price%20gouging%20weather&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">percent</a> of the economists thought that governments shouldn\u2019t curb or interfere with prices \u2013 that, all things considered, the best way to get vital goods to those who needed them was to put no reins on the market at all.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e2b9a315c5d597cb77a8da5dda99dd13199ac2c4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2b9a315c5d597cb77a8da5dda99dd13199ac2c4/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vendors selling masks at the roadside in Los Angeles this week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vendors selling masks at the roadside in Los Angeles this week.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Vogel/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But this pandemic has provided a huge weight of evidence to the contrary: tales <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/coronavirus-indonesia-seizes-half-a-million-masks-amid-panic-buying\" title=\"\">of</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/nyregion/brooklyn-coronavirus-price-gouging.html\" title=\"\">hoarders</a>, of doctors and nurses so short of protective gear that some wore <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nurse-at-brooklyn-hospital-on-coronavirus-protective-clothing-its-a-garbage-bag-its-like-something-out-of-the-twlight-zone-2020-04-07\" title=\"\">bin bags</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/01/nhs-staff-making-masks-from-snorkels-amid-ppe-shortages\" title=\"\">snorkels</a>, and of deals so desperate that a <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/the-trump-administration-paid-a-bankrupt-company-with-zero-employees-2455-million-for-n95-masks-which-its-never-manufactured/ar-BB12JwUk\" title=\"\">security training company</a>, bankrupt for months and with no employees, somehow won a $55m contract to supply masks. These failures happen, in part, because ordinarily the market\u2019s idea of efficiency involves getting products to those willing to pay the most for them. In a crisis, or even outside of one, that isn\u2019t the same as getting products to the maximum possible number of people who need them.</p> \n<p>\u201cI have always thought that economists were obsessed with efficiency, no matter what happened to distribution,\u201d Angus Deaton, the Nobel-winning economist, told me. But distribution is what matters, particularly in an emergency. During this pandemic, the best scenario for everyone would be to get masks to doctors and nurses first \u2013 \u201cwe want to keep them well, so that they can save our lives and the lives of others,\u201d said Nicholas Bloom, a Stanford economist who studies periods of panic and uncertainty. But high prices in unregulated markets keeps masks out of reach for the hospitals that need them. By the time the market culls bad suppliers, stabilises the price and compels hoarders to sell, the disease has spread and people have died.</p> \n<p>Solving this, Bloom said, requires a hand on the tiller: steering the market in ways that classical economists tend to dislike. One strategy is to cap prices so that they don\u2019t become exorbitant but still offer the kind of profits that draw new manufacturers in. Bloom also thinks governments should requisition masks for their health services first, before allowing the rest into the market. \u201cIt\u2019s no different from how food was rationed during the world wars. Or how Britain bought tanks from Vickers during the second world war. It didn\u2019t have to take over the firm. It just offered a fair price. This is the same,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is like an economy in wartime.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<p>For anyone who views the prevailing international order as a brutish contest for resources, disguised occasionally by noble words and fine treaties, the scramble for masks offers a perfect little parable. It has taken on the appearance of a zero-sum struggle straight out of a game-theory seminar: with limited supply and endless demand, one mask for you is one mask less for me. To this austere truth, nations have reacted in familiar ways; amid the novel chaos created by Covid-19, old enmities and hardened habits reassert themselves.</p> \n<p>So when, in early April, news anchors in Pakistan <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ani/covid-19-china-buffoons-all-weather-ally-pakistan-by-sending-underwear-masks-120040500163_1.html\" title=\"\">complained</a> that China had sent their country masks made out of underwear, Indian nationalists on Twitter launched a mocking <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/underwear_mask_for_pakistan\" title=\"\">hashtag</a>. A couple of weeks before that, when British tabloids reported on French border guards impounding two trucks of masks earmarked for the NHS, it confirmed the worst suspicions of every Eurosceptic. \u201cThis shows you all you need to know about European cooperation,\u201d Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader and ardent Brexiter, told the Sun. When the EU did<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/uk-missed-three-chances-to-join-eu-scheme-to-bulk-buy-ppe\" title=\"\"> invite Britain to take part</a> in a bulk purchase of protective apparel and ventilators, though, the government passed. The reason appears to be either the stubbornness of its Brexit spirit or its ineptitude in checking its email; both seem equally possible under Boris Johnson\u2019s government.</p> \n<p>The US, for its part, treated the procurement of masks as a smash-and-grab operation. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/global-battle-coronavirus-equipment-masks-tests\" title=\"\">April</a>, an incredible account emerged of Americans brandishing cash on the runway of a Shanghai airport, buying up a cargo of masks that was already on a plane, ready to fly out to France. No one quite clarified who these Americans were, or how they barged onto the runway, but the episode enraged French officials. In its wake, Renaud Muselier, the president of the regional council of Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, chose to bring his masks home by sea. \u201cAt least that way, I can be sure nobody will steal my masks from the tarmac,\u201d he told a French TV station.</p> \n<p>The US was also accused of waylaying masks in Bangkok before they flew on to Germany, and of blocking the delivery of 3m American-made masks to Canada. Last month, Ovidiu Olea, the Hong Kong entrepreneur, purchased 50,000 sets of masks, gloves and coveralls, which he planned to donate to the health service in his native Romania. \u201cEverything else was ready, and then my coveralls supplier called to say that some Americans showed up, paid three times the price, and bought my order out from under my nose,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6a6386814815c1bf68619fe7240279974679b378\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a6386814815c1bf68619fe7240279974679b378/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Germany\u2019s defence minister welcoming a shipment of 10 million masks and other protective items from China in Leipzig this week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Germany\u2019s defence minister welcoming a shipment of 10 million masks and other protective items from China in Leipzig this week.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jens Schlueter/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the EU, relations between member nations have prickled with tension over the lack of masks and other gear. By the end of February, there were more than 1,000 coronavirus cases across Italy, and it needed more protective gear \u2013 masks in particular. Around that time, a legislator in Italy\u2019s coalition government told me, France and Germany implemented national laws that declared masks as strategic assets, which meant that if masks were transiting through these countries, bound for elsewhere, they could be appropriated. For a while, she said, France and Germany kept hold of some masks that Italy had ordered from India, Turkey and Vietnam.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn those darkest moments, China stepped in and offered 200,000 masks as a present,\u201d the legislator said. A plane landed in Rome, carrying masks and gear but also traditional Chinese herbs: an exercise in what has come to be known as \u201cmask diplomacy\u201d. Not long afterwards, France and Germany lifted their mask seizure laws and sent free masks to Italy. But by that point, the legislator said, \u201cthe damage had been done\u201d.</p> \n<p>Since then, Italy has bought more than 20m masks from China, but China has been expert at projecting these sales as an extension of its benevolence. The Chinese government now buys full newspaper pages for advertorials that laud its assistance to Italy. After we spoke, the legislator texted me an opinion poll by an Italian thinktank, in which 52% of respondents named China as Italy\u2019s best friend. \u201cLook at the list of enemies,\u201d she wrote. On top: Germany at 45% and then France at 38%.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s alarming,\u201d she said, \u201chow the public isn\u2019t seeing that European institutions are actually doing a lot for Italy.\u201d Germany reserved dozens of intensive-care beds for Italians, flew them in for treatment and delivered ventilators to Italian hospitals; France sent hundreds of thousands of protective suits. But China\u2019s mask diplomacy has fanned a mistrust of the EU kindled years ago by Italy\u2019s populists. The legislator sounded despondent. \u201cI wish I could say this mask diplomacy isn\u2019t working very well. But it is, unfortunately.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<p>Whatever the new normal is after this pandemic, everyone I spoke with agreed on one thing: there will be masks. Lots and lots of masks. They\u2019ll be handed out on airlines and at hotels; they\u2019ll be stacked next to the till at Boots; they\u2019ll be stashed in sock drawers and linen closets in practically every home. Every country will produce and stockpile its own supply, unwilling to rely any more on the vagaries of the international market; Germany, forever ahead of the curve, has already <a href=\"https://www.thelocal.de/20200408/highly-likely-that-face-mark-requirement-will-come-to-germany-says-bavarian-president\" title=\"\">begun</a>.</p> \n<p>We already guessed, before the pandemic, that one version of our future would entail masks for billions of us. It\u2019s the version in which we keep burning carbon, polluting our air and aggravating global warming so much that our land keeps going up in flames. But that still felt distant enough to be somewhat avoidable. We could hope that, however slowly or inexpertly, countries would pool their energies to stop this. Now, though, the age of masks has arrived sooner than we anticipated, brought on by an entirely different threat altogether. And the manner of its arrival carries a warning: that with the world as it is, the solidarity needed to battle climate change may be impossible to secure, and that the future of smoky skies and rising seas is the only one that lies ahead of us.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/how-coronavirus-almost-brought-down-the-global-financial-system\">How coronavirus almost brought down the global financial system | Adam Tooze</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Ovidiu Olea\u2019s mask machine arrived from China on the third Monday of April. It can cut and hem 50 masks a minute; it has no casing of any kind, so a bystander can observe its innards as sheets of polypropylene pass through the machine\u2019s automated rollers and slicers. \u201cIt needs just two people \u2013 one to load the material, and one to press the emergency stop button if necessary,\u201d Olea said. He has rented some space in a former bottling plant, but he hasn\u2019t begun manufacturing yet. He wants to make medical-grade gear, and for that he needs to set up a clean room and sterilisation facilities. If all goes to plan, his first masks will roll off the line in mid-summer.</p> \n<p>He wasn\u2019t worried about the delay. However outlandish the circumstances that cast Olea as mask manufacturer, he was still preparing to settle into the role for the foreseeable future. He didn\u2019t think Covid-19 was going to disappear any time soon. \u201cI think it\u2019ll end up being some sort of seasonal disease \u2013 like the flu, but with harsher consequences,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this disease has changed attitudes towards mask-wearing. Earlier, people in Italy would giggle at the sight of Chinese tourists walking around wearing masks. Now there aren\u2019t many giggles left.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "If Ovidiu Olea is astonished by the fact that he\u2019s gone from being a finance guy to a mask mogul in four months, he shows no sign of it. The transition started innocuously. Late in January, when the coronavirus spread beyond Wuhan, Olea decided he would buy masks for his staff. He lives in Hong Kong, where he runs a payment technology firm. His staff isn\u2019t large \u2013 just 20 employees \u2013 but finding even a few hundred masks proved hard. Part of the problem was that last year, after protesters in Hong Kong used masks to hide their identity, the Chinese government restricted supplies from the mainland. Before the pandemic, half the world\u2019s masks were manufactured in China; now, with production there shifting into overdrive, that figure may be as high as 85%. If China isn\u2019t sending you masks, you likely aren\u2019t getting any at all. We have no masks, local pharmacies told Olea, but if you find some, we\u2019ll buy them from you. Olea got to work. In a journal article, he read that epidemiologists spoke highly of N95 respirators, masks that filter out 95% of small particulate matter. Stealing time out of his day job, Olea began phoning N95 suppliers in Mexico, Turkey, Indonesia, Ireland. Each one turned him down. \u201cThe answers ranged from \u2018No\u2019 to \u2018We only sell to accredited buyers\u2019 to \u2018Come back next year,\u2019\u201d Olea told me. After three days, Olea found a South African firm named North Safety Products, which had 500,000 masks in stock. Olea bought them all, at less than a pound per mask, certain that he would be able to sell the surplus. During their conversations, North Safety Products executives warned Olea to be careful. There were \u201cinterested parties\u201d lurking outside its factory gates, ready to bribe truck drivers for their cargoes. Olea hired a security detail to ride alongside his truck of masks as it drove to the airport in Johannesburg. (He sent me a photo of the team: six grim men packing pistols and rifles, clad in camo and bulletproof vests. \u201cThey asked if I wanted machine guns as well. I thought not. We\u2019re not invading Lesotho. Let\u2019s keep it reasonable.\u201d) In mid-February, two weeks after he placed his order, his shipment touched down in Hong Kong. Within six hours, the buyers he had signed up had collected nearly all of the masks. \u201cEven if I\u2019d had 5m masks,\u201d Olea said, \u201cI\u2019d have sold out.\u201d Olea, who has a keen nose for business opportunities, quickly became possessed by this new line of work. Since February, as the pandemic has streaked around the planet, he has bought and sold on another million N95 masks from North Safety Products. In March, Olea became a middleman for Chinese-made three-ply masks, too, the simple kind that just about everyone everywhere is now opting to wear. He sold masks to the Hong Kong government, to European countries, via their diplomats in Hong Kong and China, and to European companies, which wanted them for their employees. All told, Olea reckons he\u2019s sold about 48m of them. By April, Olea decided he might as well take the next step. He bought a mask-making machine from a Chinese manufacturer: an eight-metre-long assembly line, which shapes and cuts sheets of plastic into masks. When I spoke to him, in mid-April, I was reading about mask prices close to \u00a36 a pop, and Olea was waiting with giddy excitement for his machine to reach him. He was still running his payments firm, and masks were a departure from that work. \u201cBut these are weird times,\u201d he insisted. \u201cWe all must do something to survive.\u201d No object better symbolises the pandemic than the mask, and no object better explains the world into which the pandemic arrived. Social distancing, at first, felt like a strange notion: the inaction of it, the vagueness of it. But the mask sang out to our deepest consumeristic impulses. In the absence of a drug or a vaccine, the mask is the only material protection we can buy; it\u2019s a product, and we\u2019ve been trained like seals to respond to products. As a result, in every corner of every country, the humble face mask \u2013 this assembly of inexpensive plastic \u2013 has been elevated into a fetishised commodity. One mask broker described it as \u201ca madhouse\u201d, another as \u201cthe craziest market I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d. Countries have hoarded masks, and used them as chips in geopolitical games. Thieves have made off with them. Prada, Gucci and Balenciaga have started to manufacture them. We already have MaskClub.com which, like a \u201cjam of the month\u201d club, offers $9.99-a-month mask subscriptions: the best-beloved business model of hipster e-commerce. Last year, an industry insider told me, Burberry had toyed with the notion of putting face masks on some of its models during a catwalk show \u2013 a wink, perhaps, at our apocalyptic future. By March, things had become real, and the fashion house was pledging to make masks and gowns for the UK\u2019s NHS. From a healthcare perspective, the mask was a matter of life and death. But it also took on the function of a talisman \u2013 as an object to hang comfortingly between the body and a diseased society. All this when no one even seemed to know precisely how useful masks were, or who should wear them. The advice we got was a mess. The World Health Organization maintained, at first, that healthy people had no need for masks. But people bought masks anyway. Shelves were emptied. People improvised. A friend of mine in Tel Aviv ended up fashioning one for herself out of her husband\u2019s boxer shorts \u2013 washed and dried, she assured me, and slid over her head like a balaclava. Then, in early April, the WHO reversed its counsel, and a host of governments followed suit, which sparked a fresh run on mask stocks. In this pandemic, the mask reveals far more than it hides. It exposes the world\u2019s political and economic relations for what they are: vectors of self-interest that ordinarily lie obscured under glib talk of globalisation and openness. For the demagogues who govern so much of the world, the pandemic has provided an unimpeachable excuse to fulfil their dearest wishes: to nail national borders shut, to tar every outsider as suspicious, and to act as if their own countries must be preserved above all others. When these tendencies combine with a fawning loyalty to the free market, the results can be ruinous. In mere weeks, the mask went from being an urgent human need to a cynically exploited asset in a global resource grab \u2013 the fastest such journey, perhaps, of any product in history. Sometimes, it felt as if the mask itself was beside the point \u2013 that it was just a trigger to rehearse old routines of acquisitiveness and discord, with no further, greater end in sight. * * * We\u2019ve been living with the coronavirus long enough now that we can distinguish the various tribes of mask-wearers. Note the shopper in the pasta aisle, clad in a classic white N95 with the 3M manufacturer logo just under the snout. The N95 and its equivalents keep out nearly every particle larger than 0.3 microns, and although the virus is tinier, the fibres in the mask\u2019s layers obstruct its passage. These masks are meant to go first to healthcare workers, which might explain the shopper\u2019s furtive, guilty eyes. Note the finance bro out for his allotted hour of jogging, wearing a Vogmask \u2013 a brand so stylish that its midnight-blue model might even match his suit when he eventually returns to the City. Note the extreme worrier in the GVS Elipse P100, the heavy-duty mask that promises to keep out 99.97% of particles. In the age of Covid-19, the equivalent of sensible shoes may be the simple surgical mask or the home-hemmed cloth. The gaps in their weave are big enough for the virus to pass through, but they do at least protect others from the wearer\u2019s sneezes and coughs. Such deep familiarity with masks is hard-won. The pandemic has brought on a global shortage of masks, which is really a global shortage of one particular plastic inside the masks \u2013 a type of non-woven polypropylene that acts as a filter. In casual conversation, people in the mask business call the plastic \u201cmeltblown\u201d, referring to how its plastic filaments are made. Meltblown goes into many things: jackets, nappies, filters in water purifiers and air conditioners. Masks are in short supply not because they\u2019re difficult to produce, but because the meltblown industry is used to stable, long-term demand. It churns out just enough for its customers and no more. To install an assembly line of meltblown takes many months, even at the calmest of times; with demand now soaring, some companies supplying meltblown equipment are quoting timelines of up to two years to even deliver a new machine. Hot out of the plant, meltblown looks like a giant toilet roll: 15,000 yards or so of polypropylene wrapped around a cardboard core. The material feels like synthetic cloth, but it\u2019s so thin that you might accidentally put your finger through it, an executive at one American meltblown manufacturer told me. He asked to keep his and his company\u2019s names out of this article, for a reason I\u2019ve never been given before. They don\u2019t want to be known more widely, he said: \u201cWe\u2019re so overburdened with enquiries already. If any further information gets out, that\u2019s another thousand messages coming in every day. That makes it impossible to do any work.\u201d Until last year, just 2 or 3% of his company\u2019s meltblown went into face masks, he said. This year, it\u2019s 95%. Until now, countries didn\u2019t consider meltblown a strategic commodity, so during the past three decades, much of its production has migrated from the west to low-cost factories in Asia. The executive\u2019s company is one of just five or 10 remaining manufacturers in the US, he said, and China produces close to half of all the meltblown in the world. As a result, the rush for masks provided a compressed, vivid reminder of something we\u2019d been aware of for a couple of decades now: that in all manufacturing and trade, the lines of commerce inevitably bend towards China. Early in February, the Chinese government began preventing exports of meltblown, so that the material could first be used to assemble masks for China\u2019s own population. The prospect of being cut off from half the world\u2019s meltblown supply \u201cput the fear of God\u201d into everyone who manufactured anything that contained it, the executive said. The market price of meltblown went up fourfold. He began to get 200 or 300 phone calls a day from mask companies all over the world, demanding meltblown. Even Chinese mask manufacturers rang him, worried that their country might run out. They\u2019d offer cash up front and try to outbid each other. \u201cThey\u2019d say: \u2018Name your price, any price you want to, anything,\u2019 and I\u2019d explain that we don\u2019t do it that way,\u201d said the executive. Then they dangled bribes before him: all-expenses-paid holidays. Just tell us where you want to go. Also in February, the Chinese government effectively made itself the sole customer of the major mask-making factories in its territory. This applied to Chinese-owned companies, but also to big mask plants in China owned by foreign firms; their products were earmarked for domestic use and banned from being shipped overseas. On 3 February, in an apologetic letter to customers, the British company JSP Safety said that its output of masks was running low, because two of its Chinese factories had been \u201cformally requisitioned by the government to make disposable RPE [respiratory protection equipment] for Chinese government agencies\u201d. Christopher Dobbing, who founded the Cambridge Mask Company in 2015, said his own factory in China was small enough to escape the government\u2019s notice, so his inventory wasn\u2019t snapped up by the authorities. But he did see, first-hand, the wave of Chinese panic-buying. \u201cChinese communities everywhere snapped up our masks wherever we had a footprint, so that they could send them home,\u201d Dobbing said. Chinese companies overseas were also asked to purchase and ship back masks. On 26 January, Dobbing got 1,200 emails and 400 phone calls. \u201cMaybe they thought we were a huge company, but we were just a couple of guys in an office, panicking as the orders flowed in.\u201d By 28 January, he was taking pre-orders for March. Roughly 2bn masks were imported into China in February. To those with a kneejerk mistrust of China\u2019s rulers, it appeared as if, having first failed to contain the disease, they were now ransacking the mask market just when the coronavirus was starting to race through other nations. After a Chinese real-estate company in Sydney was discovered to have bought millions of masks, the Australian Medical Association urged its government to keep protective gear safe from foreign buyers. A lawyer attached to Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign compared China\u2019s actions to \u201cfirst-degree murder\u201d and wondered aloud if the US could sue Beijing. The US state of Missouri then went on to do just that, arguing in its lawsuit that China had \u201choarded personal protective equipment \u2013 thus causing a global pandemic that was unnecessary and preventable\u201d. But for the US and the rest of the west to complain about China aggressively pursuing its own interests is, in one way, to engage in a fundamental duplicity. China\u2019s wealth and power are the result of a longstanding international consensus championed by the US: that the quest for the lowest possible cost of production and the highest possible profit is paramount. According to this philosophy, if that means offshoring nearly everything to China, nothing must be allowed to stand in the way: not the hollowing-out of industry at home, or the loss of livelihoods, or human-rights concerns. And it isn\u2019t just China that has prospered from this arrangement. It has also been good to the richest people in the richest countries. Many of those same people now seem affronted by the world they helped create. As events transpired, few large nations behaved very differently from China once the disease blazed up within their own borders. \u201cA dog-eat-dog world is back,\u201d one former Polish diplomat lamented, as if such a world had ever gone anywhere in the first place. * * * By mid-March, China had relaxed its rules, allowing both masks and meltblown to be sold overseas again, to nations that were now in dire need of pandemic gear. But the market kept failing: supplies of masks often didn\u2019t make it to doctors, nurses, the elderly and others who required them most. During the great global scrum that followed, governments used every conceivable means to get hold of masks for their citizens before they went elsewhere. Foreign embassies in China turned their diplomatic staff into scouts for medical supplies; Canada hired a multinational consulting firm to help figure out which manufacturers could be trusted. Freight agents in China, who book space on ships and planes for goods leaving the country, found themselves handling medical equipment and little else. One agent in Shanghai, Fredrik Barner, had been shipping auto parts until this spring, when he was flooded with orders to move masks instead. \u201cI\u2019ve been in the industry for 10 years and I\u2019ve never seen such high air-freight rates,\u201d Barner told me. \u201cNormally, the rate is around $3 or $4 a kilogram. That went up to $17 or $18.\u201d Nations that couldn\u2019t make enough masks for themselves had to find unconventional ways to bring them in from China. In Ireland, the government asked Aer Lingus to run supplies out of Beijing. The airline had never flown to China before, and the planning and approvals for a new route would usually have taken six months. Aer Lingus did it in a week. Brian O\u2019Sullivan, Aer Lingus\u2019s chief flying instructor, captained the first plane to Beijing on 27 March, taking with him four other pilots, two engineers and a specialist in balancing loads in an airplane. Ten hours out, six hours on the ground, then 13 hours back: the kind of flight schedule that is, for a single crew, inconceivable in regular aviation. They landed in Beijing very early on a Sunday morning. Through the plane\u2019s open door, O\u2019Sullivan noticed that the airport, which usually buzzes like a beehive with flights landing and taking off, was practically in hibernation; in six hours, he saw just half a dozen or so departures. His crew never left the aircraft, O\u2019Sullivan told me, because that would have required them to go into quarantine. Instead, they stayed in business class, behind thick plastic drapes, while ground handlers loaded first the cargo hold and then economy class: huge green bags filled with masks, gowns and gloves were strapped into the seats, as if the cabin had been booked out by gigantic pods of peas. \u201cWe didn\u2019t shake hands with anyone,\u201d O\u2019Sullivan said, \u201cbut there were plenty of smiles and thankyous and nodding heads.\u201d When I spoke to him in mid-April, Aer Lingus had completed 30 Beijing flights, and expected to run another 200 or so by the end of May. To meet the rush for masks, a strange alternate ecosystem of suppliers sprang up, often supplying products of dubious quality. In Europe, several buyers of Chinese masks found their products to be sub-standard. The Dutch government had to recall 600,000 masks. Finland discovered that an order of 2m surgical masks, which are discarded after use with a single patient, weren\u2019t good enough for hospital wear. Even if they had been up to scratch, those 2m masks would have only met the country\u2019s needs for four days. It wasn\u2019t always clear who was producing these masks. Being in the trade, Christopher Dobbing got a number of emails throughout March and April from Chinese mask vendors he\u2019d never heard of before. He sent me a few of them, and I rang one of the listed numbers, in the city of Zhangjiagang, 100 miles or so from Shanghai. A woman picked up and introduced herself as Rita. She told me that the company she worked for had been selling K95 masks since the first week of March, for $2.50 a pop. I asked if they manufactured the masks as well. She laughed. \u201cNo, we make tin plate. But our clients in America and Europe asked if we could source masks, so we do that now,\u201d she told me. \u201cWe get them from a big factory nearby, which makes masks.\u201d I asked how long it would take to send 10,000 masks to London. She couldn\u2019t say. There weren\u2019t many flights out of the country, and after some batches of exported masks had been found to be defective, Chinese customs authorities were inspecting mask cargoes more rigorously. A friend of hers, another mask vendor, had been waiting two weeks already for one of her shipments to clear customs, she told me. The factory that actually made the masks belonged to another company, Rita said. Chinese manufacturers that produce masks for medical use in the west must be certified by government health agencies such as the US Food and Drug Administration. Rita assured me that the manufacturer had an FDA certificate, and she emailed me a scan to prove it. It had been issued on 1 April. In the space where the manufacturer\u2019s name should have been displayed, there was just a short span of white space followed by the generic words Technology Co., Ltd. It looked like any company might print its name into the blank space and make the certificate its own. On the FDA\u2019s database, I looked up the certificate\u2019s number. The FDA had awarded it to Jiangsu Newborn Medical Technology Co, Ltd \u2013 a different company altogether. Among those tempted to reinvent themselves as mask merchants were drug dealers, who used the crisis to diversify their portfolio. Logan Pauley, a researcher at the Center for Advanced Defense Studies in Washington DC, tracks the sales of illicit drugs on the internet, focusing on trafficking from east Asia to the rest of the world. Towards the end of February, he noticed that some of the dealers he monitors were advertising masks and gloves. He sent me screenshots. \u201cMask, 3ply, 50pcs per box, 20 box min. $33.50 per box, exclude shipping charges,\u201d ran one Facebook post by a user named Vicky, in a group where people otherwise offer fentanyl for sale. It was difficult to know how to feel about these transactions, Pauley said. On the one hand, Vicky\u2019s masks might well be of terrible quality, and there was a danger that the masks would be deliberately mislabelled, whisked through US customs, and then sold on to US hospitals short of gear. \u201cCustoms is swamped right now,\u201d said Pauley. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to be opening and checking every box.\u201d On the other hand, he said, the FDA and other international authorities that license medical supplies \u201chave made it difficult, in this time of need, to get new suppliers approved in a timely fashion. If the masks are good, the hospital may be paying three times the price for them, but it\u2019s still better than waiting for FDA approvals.\u201d He was right. If I\u2019d been a hospital administrator in critical need of masks, perhaps I\u2019d have placed an order with one of these shadowy brokers. In the absence of government supplies or a well-ordered mask market, the seediest corners of the internet seemed to offer one of the few ways to find any masks at all. * * * Alongside the new mask middlemen and the criminal elements finding a fresh vocation, there were the groups who had never fabricated a mask before, but who had a sure sense of money to be made. From February onwards, legions of new mask-makers emerged, of every size and shape: from big companies such as BMW to the amateurs the meltblown executive characterised as \u201cfour neighbours in a cul-de-sac in Los Angeles, who\u2019ve gone on to the internet to learn about sewing masks\u201d. A face mask-making machine costs about $100,000, he told me, and it makes about 70,000-100,000 masks a day. He has received at least 200 enquiries from Americans who are importing machines from China \u2013 \u201cpeople who just have 100K to spend and a bit of space, and want to make some money.\u201d You\u2019d like to think they have some experience doing this, he said, but many of them don\u2019t know a thing. They ring him when they\u2019re expecting a new machine in three weeks, to ask vaguely for mask textile. \u201cDo you want meltblown?\u201d he asks them. \u201cYes.\u201d What about noseclips? What about spun-bound polypropylene, the plastic that encases the melt-blown? \u201cOh, we need to get some of that, too, do we?\u201d And then, the executive said to me with a sigh: \u201cI have to spend half an hour teaching them about mask manufacturing.\u201d All these breakdowns in the market \u2013 the hospitals without masks, the bogus gear, the exorbitant prices, the hoarding, the fly-by-night profiteers \u2013 seem to expose the limits of orthodox economics. The most ardent devotees of the free market believe that supply and demand solve every basic problem if they\u2019re permitted to work unconstrained. When demand is high, the price climbs, and the prospect of profit brings in a host of new suppliers. With time, the market rewards those who sell good products and punishes those who sell poor ones; with time, the price settles so that it allocates products most efficiently to those who value them most. That\u2019s the theory, anyway, and its advocates insist that it applies even in a crisis. In 2012, for instance, researchers at the University of Chicago asked eminent economists for their opinions on Connecticut\u2019s plan to outlaw price-gouging \u2013 exploitatively high prices \u2013 during floods or other weather cataclysms. Seventy-seven percent of the economists thought that governments shouldn\u2019t curb or interfere with prices \u2013 that, all things considered, the best way to get vital goods to those who needed them was to put no reins on the market at all. But this pandemic has provided a huge weight of evidence to the contrary: tales of hoarders, of doctors and nurses so short of protective gear that some wore bin bags and snorkels, and of deals so desperate that a security training company, bankrupt for months and with no employees, somehow won a $55m contract to supply masks. These failures happen, in part, because ordinarily the market\u2019s idea of efficiency involves getting products to those willing to pay the most for them. In a crisis, or even outside of one, that isn\u2019t the same as getting products to the maximum possible number of people who need them. \u201cI have always thought that economists were obsessed with efficiency, no matter what happened to distribution,\u201d Angus Deaton, the Nobel-winning economist, told me. But distribution is what matters, particularly in an emergency. During this pandemic, the best scenario for everyone would be to get masks to doctors and nurses first \u2013 \u201cwe want to keep them well, so that they can save our lives and the lives of others,\u201d said Nicholas Bloom, a Stanford economist who studies periods of panic and uncertainty. But high prices in unregulated markets keeps masks out of reach for the hospitals that need them. By the time the market culls bad suppliers, stabilises the price and compels hoarders to sell, the disease has spread and people have died. Solving this, Bloom said, requires a hand on the tiller: steering the market in ways that classical economists tend to dislike. One strategy is to cap prices so that they don\u2019t become exorbitant but still offer the kind of profits that draw new manufacturers in. Bloom also thinks governments should requisition masks for their health services first, before allowing the rest into the market. \u201cIt\u2019s no different from how food was rationed during the world wars. Or how Britain bought tanks from Vickers during the second world war. It didn\u2019t have to take over the firm. It just offered a fair price. This is the same,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is like an economy in wartime.\u201d * * * For anyone who views the prevailing international order as a brutish contest for resources, disguised occasionally by noble words and fine treaties, the scramble for masks offers a perfect little parable. It has taken on the appearance of a zero-sum struggle straight out of a game-theory seminar: with limited supply and endless demand, one mask for you is one mask less for me. To this austere truth, nations have reacted in familiar ways; amid the novel chaos created by Covid-19, old enmities and hardened habits reassert themselves. So when, in early April, news anchors in Pakistan complained that China had sent their country masks made out of underwear, Indian nationalists on Twitter launched a mocking hashtag. A couple of weeks before that, when British tabloids reported on French border guards impounding two trucks of masks earmarked for the NHS, it confirmed the worst suspicions of every Eurosceptic. \u201cThis shows you all you need to know about European cooperation,\u201d Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader and ardent Brexiter, told the Sun. When the EU did invite Britain to take part in a bulk purchase of protective apparel and ventilators, though, the government passed. The reason appears to be either the stubbornness of its Brexit spirit or its ineptitude in checking its email; both seem equally possible under Boris Johnson\u2019s government. The US, for its part, treated the procurement of masks as a smash-and-grab operation. In April, an incredible account emerged of Americans brandishing cash on the runway of a Shanghai airport, buying up a cargo of masks that was already on a plane, ready to fly out to France. No one quite clarified who these Americans were, or how they barged onto the runway, but the episode enraged French officials. In its wake, Renaud Muselier, the president of the regional council of Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, chose to bring his masks home by sea. \u201cAt least that way, I can be sure nobody will steal my masks from the tarmac,\u201d he told a French TV station. The US was also accused of waylaying masks in Bangkok before they flew on to Germany, and of blocking the delivery of 3m American-made masks to Canada. Last month, Ovidiu Olea, the Hong Kong entrepreneur, purchased 50,000 sets of masks, gloves and coveralls, which he planned to donate to the health service in his native Romania. \u201cEverything else was ready, and then my coveralls supplier called to say that some Americans showed up, paid three times the price, and bought my order out from under my nose,\u201d he said. In the EU, relations between member nations have prickled with tension over the lack of masks and other gear. By the end of February, there were more than 1,000 coronavirus cases across Italy, and it needed more protective gear \u2013 masks in particular. Around that time, a legislator in Italy\u2019s coalition government told me, France and Germany implemented national laws that declared masks as strategic assets, which meant that if masks were transiting through these countries, bound for elsewhere, they could be appropriated. For a while, she said, France and Germany kept hold of some masks that Italy had ordered from India, Turkey and Vietnam. \u201cIn those darkest moments, China stepped in and offered 200,000 masks as a present,\u201d the legislator said. A plane landed in Rome, carrying masks and gear but also traditional Chinese herbs: an exercise in what has come to be known as \u201cmask diplomacy\u201d. Not long afterwards, France and Germany lifted their mask seizure laws and sent free masks to Italy. But by that point, the legislator said, \u201cthe damage had been done\u201d. Since then, Italy has bought more than 20m masks from China, but China has been expert at projecting these sales as an extension of its benevolence. The Chinese government now buys full newspaper pages for advertorials that laud its assistance to Italy. After we spoke, the legislator texted me an opinion poll by an Italian thinktank, in which 52% of respondents named China as Italy\u2019s best friend. \u201cLook at the list of enemies,\u201d she wrote. On top: Germany at 45% and then France at 38%. \u201cIt\u2019s alarming,\u201d she said, \u201chow the public isn\u2019t seeing that European institutions are actually doing a lot for Italy.\u201d Germany reserved dozens of intensive-care beds for Italians, flew them in for treatment and delivered ventilators to Italian hospitals; France sent hundreds of thousands of protective suits. But China\u2019s mask diplomacy has fanned a mistrust of the EU kindled years ago by Italy\u2019s populists. The legislator sounded despondent. \u201cI wish I could say this mask diplomacy isn\u2019t working very well. But it is, unfortunately.\u201d * * * Whatever the new normal is after this pandemic, everyone I spoke with agreed on one thing: there will be masks. Lots and lots of masks. They\u2019ll be handed out on airlines and at hotels; they\u2019ll be stacked next to the till at Boots; they\u2019ll be stashed in sock drawers and linen closets in practically every home. Every country will produce and stockpile its own supply, unwilling to rely any more on the vagaries of the international market; Germany, forever ahead of the curve, has already begun. We already guessed, before the pandemic, that one version of our future would entail masks for billions of us. It\u2019s the version in which we keep burning carbon, polluting our air and aggravating global warming so much that our land keeps going up in flames. But that still felt distant enough to be somewhat avoidable. We could hope that, however slowly or inexpertly, countries would pool their energies to stop this. Now, though, the age of masks has arrived sooner than we anticipated, brought on by an entirely different threat altogether. And the manner of its arrival carries a warning: that with the world as it is, the solidarity needed to battle climate change may be impossible to secure, and that the future of smoky skies and rising seas is the only one that lies ahead of us. Ovidiu Olea\u2019s mask machine arrived from China on the third Monday of April. It can cut and hem 50 masks a minute; it has no casing of any kind, so a bystander can observe its innards as sheets of polypropylene pass through the machine\u2019s automated rollers and slicers. \u201cIt needs just two people \u2013 one to load the material, and one to press the emergency stop button if necessary,\u201d Olea said. He has rented some space in a former bottling plant, but he hasn\u2019t begun manufacturing yet. He wants to make medical-grade gear, and for that he needs to set up a clean room and sterilisation facilities. If all goes to plan, his first masks will roll off the line in mid-summer. He wasn\u2019t worried about the delay. However outlandish the circumstances that cast Olea as mask manufacturer, he was still preparing to settle into the role for the foreseeable future. He didn\u2019t think Covid-19 was going to disappear any time soon. \u201cI think it\u2019ll end up being some sort of seasonal disease \u2013 like the flu, but with harsher consequences,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this disease has changed attitudes towards mask-wearing. Earlier, people in Italy would giggle at the sight of Chinese tourists walking around wearing masks. Now there aren\u2019t many giggles left.\u201d \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

Two days later, she was taken to a funeral home and cremated; under the lockdown rules, David was unable to attend the ceremony.</p> <p>\u201cThe hearse simply drove down our road and the neighbours all came out to clap for her,\u201d he says over the phone from his home in Kerry, his voice cracking with emotion. \u201cThat was how I said goodbye after 48 years of us being together.\u201d David is now living alone, experiencing both isolation and loneliness for the first time in half a century.</p> <p>As the global pandemic has brought a host of new experiences, including working from home, home-schooling and online socialising, it has also, unsurprisingly, increased the loneliness of many people.

There are some people who are currently isolated who will not get lonely and there are others who will really struggle.\u201d</p> <p>In 2018, Qualter led <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/2yzhfv4DvqVp5nZyxBD8G23/who-feels-lonely-the-results-of-the-world-s-largest-loneliness-study\">a BBC study into loneliness</a> among the British public that found that, out of the 55,000 respondents, a third said they often feel lonely. It is a situation she believes is being exacerbated by the lockdown. \u201cOur isolation is going to trigger loneliness in many people, some who might never have experienced it for extended periods of time before,\u201d she says. \u201cYou might be with your family and feel lonely, since we fall into different roles and hide parts of ourselves with family, or you might feel lonely even if you are video-calling constantly, as that can sometimes emphasise our distance from others.\u201d</p> <p>At 76 years old, David is among those most vulnerable to loneliness and its associated mental health consequences.

They ranged from university students struggling to adapt to moving back in with their large families to people who had moved abroad for work and are now stuck isolating in a foreign country alone, from parents feeling lonely while attempting to homeschool their children to newly single people.</p> <p>\u201cI have a four-month-old baby at home and, even though my partner and my parents are here, I\u2019m struggling to cope with the lockdown,\u201d says Nadia (not her real name). \u201cI\u2019ve always loved being around people and I\u2019m so fortunate to have my beautiful baby and such family support, but it\u2019s still so easy to slip into a sense of loneliness.\u201d</p> <p>Brian Turner, a psychotherapist at the Counselling Directory, defines this situation as \u201cemotional loneliness \u2026 This is like the scene you get in a film where someone is singled out in a crowd, held at a standstill when others are moving all around them,\u201d he says. \u201cIt shows you that loneliness is an emotional disconnect, not merely a physical distance.\u201d</p> <p>Turner recommends trying to connect with at least one other person and making space for privacy if you are living in a shared home. \u201cYou need to both try to keep up your communication, to tell people if you need space and then also have somewhere to withdraw to,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re built on connection as humans, so isolation can be a confusing time, but if you can build a routine into your day and prioritise your mental health, that will be very important.\u201d</p> <p>Researchers at the University of Cambridge have already been calling for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/urgent-studies-needed-mental-health-coronavirus-lockdown\">studies into the mental health effects</a> of coronavirus, which they say is \u201cclearly having a major social and psychological impact on the whole population\u201d. For Nadia, her weekly online therapy sessions have been a much-needed outlet. \u201cI was lucky that, when I signed up for free NHS counselling, it finally came through after the lockdown started,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been finding it really helpful talking to my counsellor about my anxieties. She recommended I use a mindfulness app each day, which has been a godsend.\u201d She has also been listening to podcasts, which help create a sense of conversation around her, and watching lots of TV.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"76bbf6574c1566dc4a5de37f8724acc4ea16ce50\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76bbf6574c1566dc4a5de37f8724acc4ea16ce50/0_97_2316_2895/800.jpg\" alt=\"Capella.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Capella.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Provided by Capella</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before the lockdown began, the artist Capella was accustomed to being alone. \u201cI would spend the week painting or making things at home, and then when the weekend came I would be down at the market just chatting with everyone I knew,\u201d she says. But with the lockdown and the beginning of chemotherapy treatment after a breast cancer diagnosis in December 2019, things have changed rapidly. \u201cIt\u2019s been really difficult adapting to the lockdown, because such a big part of my life was just talking to strangers and meeting new people, but now it feels like that has all been put on hold,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019ve been alone before, but this loneliness is new.\u201d</p> <p>Capella has taken solace in an unlikely place: her chemotherapy nurses. \u201cI have developed a friendship with the nurses at the Royal Marsden when I go once a week to have my catheter flushed,\u201d she says. \u201cTo be remembered by a nurse who has her own busy life is such a gift. It\u2019s so lovely to be thought of by someone else; it makes me feel like more than just my diagnosis.\u201d</p> <p>Another unexpected upside has come from a rekindled relationship with her 16-year-old daughter, who lives with her father in Denmark. \u201cShe didn\u2019t take my cancer diagnosis too well and we found it hard to speak for a while,\u201d she says. \u201cBut now that she\u2019s in lockdown we\u2019re texting and video-calling all the time. It\u2019s so nice that I\u2019m not having to make videos telling her how to live her life after I\u2019m gone, but rather we can have video calls about online shopping and having fun.\u201d</p> <p>For NHS workers such as Charlotte, 28, a physiotherapist, working in a hospital has been a saving grace, even though it might be more fraught than normal. \u201cI live on my own and I quite like it usually, but the lockdown has let loneliness creep in,\u201d she says. \u201cIt has been so useful being able to go to work every day. Even though it\u2019s stressful \u2013 particularly for my colleagues who are on the frontline \u2013 we chat to each other and keep our spirits up knowing that we\u2019re all in the same boat.\u201d</p> <p>Whereas previously her colleagues might not have spoken so readily about their mental health, Charlotte believes the coronavirus pandemic has led to a need for greater help. \u201cThe chaplaincy team at the hospital has been amazing throughout this and we\u2019ve all been talking quite openly about the support we might require. It\u2019s made us all very empathetic to each other\u2019s needs.\u201d</p> <p>Capella says that this empathy has been a positive side-effect of the lockdown. \u201cWhen I have managed to chat to people on my way into the hospital, I\u2019ve been so pleasantly surprised to hear them talking about their anxieties \u2013 it\u2019s something we\u2019re all so shy about usually,\u201d she says. Kate Shurety, the executive director for <a href=\"https://www.campaigntoendloneliness.org/\">the Campaign to End Loneliness</a>, agrees. \u201cWhat we\u2019re experiencing now is what thousands of older people experience all the time,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a valuable lesson that we should all make an effort to help others when they don\u2019t need to be in that situation and we can use this time to try and build links to our community \u2013 something that often gets neglected in big cities.\u201d</p> <p>While the widespread use of video-calling and messaging has been a key feature of lockdown, it can have its pitfalls, even for the younger generation. Jake, 21, is self-isolating alone in his student house in Manchester and using video-calling to stay in touch with friends and family each day. \u201cWe play online quizzes and sometimes even eat our meals together over the screen, but it can be exhausting,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it\u2019s because there\u2019s no background atmosphere so you\u2019re always trying to fill the silences and also not talk over each other.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"01f22d09b6b847ffeaa316312c4c55bf70846fd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01f22d09b6b847ffeaa316312c4c55bf70846fd4/0_0_3898_1890/1000.jpg\" alt=\"loneliness illo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"485\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Turner says video-calling sometimes has a disassociating effect \u2013 one where you can \u201czone out\u201d of your interaction as your mind becomes confused by the lack of physical connection, despite the visual one. \u201cWe have the most technology at the moment, but possibly also the most loneliness,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s important to keep everything in moderation, otherwise you can develop an information overload with too much contact and not enough to say.\u201d</p> <p>For Jake, there are also financial concerns around the related consequences of the pandemic. He experienced coronavirus symptoms as the lockdown began and decided to isolate at university rather than return to his father\u2019s house. \u201cI\u2019m lucky that I worked enough last summer to build up savings to keep me here, otherwise I\u2019d have nowhere to go,\u201d he says. \u201cThe biggest concern among my friends is not really about getting seriously ill, but about how we\u2019ll afford to return to uni or get a job when we graduate, as there\u2019s just no work at the moment.

But she would still smile and I know that she would want me to keep going now, too. So when this is all over, I\u2019m going to buy a little caravan and do a bit of travelling. It\u2019s important to enjoy things while you can and keep reminding yourself that this, too, shall pass.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Two days before Ireland went into lockdown, David\u2019s wife, Maureen, went into a hospice. He stayed there with her for 10 days until she died on 3 April, ending her seven-year illness with the neurodegenerative disorder multiple system atrophy. Two days later, she was taken to a funeral home and cremated; under the lockdown rules, David was unable to attend the ceremony. \u201cThe hearse simply drove down our road and the neighbours all came out to clap for her,\u201d he says over the phone from his home in Kerry, his voice cracking with emotion. \u201cThat was how I said goodbye after 48 years of us being together.\u201d David is now living alone, experiencing both isolation and loneliness for the first time in half a century. As the global pandemic has brought a host of new experiences, including working from home, home-schooling and online socialising, it has also, unsurprisingly, increased the loneliness of many people. Some may have felt socially isolated before physical distancing began, while others, such as David, are having to cope with life-altering experiences on their own. Pamela Qualter, a professor of psychology for education at the University of Manchester, defines loneliness as \u201cnot necessarily about being on your own, but about feeling a disconnect with other people \u2013 a sense that the relationships you have aren\u2019t satisfying your emotional needs,\u201d she says. \u201cLoneliness is a subjective experience, so it\u2019s not always obvious to us. There are some people who are currently isolated who will not get lonely and there are others who will really struggle.\u201d In 2018, Qualter led a BBC study into loneliness among the British public that found that, out of the 55,000 respondents, a third said they often feel lonely. It is a situation she believes is being exacerbated by the lockdown. \u201cOur isolation is going to trigger loneliness in many people, some who might never have experienced it for extended periods of time before,\u201d she says. \u201cYou might be with your family and feel lonely, since we fall into different roles and hide parts of ourselves with family, or you might feel lonely even if you are video-calling constantly, as that can sometimes emphasise our distance from others.\u201d At 76 years old, David is among those most vulnerable to loneliness and its associated mental health consequences. Calls to the older people\u2019s helpline the Silver Line have increased by 31% since the outbreak of coronavirus in the UK. In the weeks since Maureen\u2019s death, though, he has been finding new ways to cope. \u201cI\u2019ve been tending to the garden and going for walks with our dog, Titch,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve also been chatting to the neighbours over the fence and I\u2019ve taken up painting again \u2013 I used to be a landscape painter, but it felt wrong to be doing it when Maureen was seriously ill. It\u2019s such a wonderful thing to be able to lose myself in now, though.\u201d He has also found a way to memorialise Maureen without having had the chance to spread her ashes. \u201cI keep her on a table in the living room with a picture and every time I go out I touch the box and tell her what I\u2019m up to,\u201d he says. \u201cTowards the end, when she couldn\u2019t speak, she wrote on a beach stone that she loves me; I have that there, too \u2013 it\u2019s one of my most precious possessions.\u201d David was one of more than 100 respondents to a Guardian callout on how readers are coping with loneliness during the lockdown.

Stripped of proper access and insight, observers are forced to parse the wording of official news reports or interpret how a certain political anniversary is marked \u2013 and by whom \u2013 as well as analysing satellite images in an attempt to build a credible narrative about the regime. The country\u2019s previous leader \u2013 and Kim\u2019s father \u2013 Kim Jong-il, had been dead for almost two days before confirmation came from the state-run Korean Central News Agency. Even neighbouring South Korea has been unable to create a reliable intelligence network, according to Du Hyeogn-cha, a senior researcher at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. \u201cIt is clear our government has some level of information on the North but not enough to make a confident statement about where he is and whether he\u2019s fully healthy,\u201d said Cha, an ex-intelligence secretary to the former South Korean president Lee Myung-bak. Kim Jong-un\u2019s absence since 11 April, when he led a party politburo meeting, has generated several theories, including that he is dead or gravely ill, that he is on holiday, or even that he self-isolating from a coronavirus outbreak that the North Korean media continues to insist has not affected the country. A report by the Daily NK website last week claimed that Kim\u2019s unhealthy lifestyle \u2013 he is a heavy smoker with clear weight issues and a family history of heart problems \u2013 had caught up with him. The Seoul-based site, which employs North Korean defectors, said Kim, who is believed to be in his mid-30s, had undergone heart surgery on 12 April and was continuing to receive treatment. Kim missed celebrations to mark the anniversary of the birth of his grandfather and North founder, Kim Il-sung on 15 April. He had not missed the event, one of the most important in country\u2019s calendar, since assuming power in late 2011. This weekend, however, satellite images of Kim\u2019s train analysed by 38 North, a monitoring group based in Washington, led some to suggest he was taking time out at his compound in Wonsan, on the country\u2019s east coast. South Korea\u2019s government has insisted that despite Kim\u2019s absence, it is business as usual in the North. The unification minister, Kim Yeon-chul, told a forum in Seoul on Monday that the South had \u201cenough intelligence\u201d to say with confidence that there were no unusual developments to support the theory that Kim was unwell.

In addition the official Rodong Sinmun newspaper said as recently as Monday that Kim had sent a message thanking workers building tourist facilities in Wonsan, where some believe he is staying. Crucially, though, none of the reports carried photographs of him. While the world continues to speculate, North Korea watchers have warned the US, South Korea and other countries in the region to prepare for instability, should the rumours about Kim\u2019s health \u2013 and perhaps his death \u2013 prove correct.

US conducting \u2018serious investigations\u2019 into China Donald Trump has said the US will conduct \u201cserious investigations\u201d into China\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak and could pursue the country for billions in damages because China \u201ccould have stopped\u201d the coronavirus. In his return to his daily White House briefing after an absence of two days, Trump also said he \u201cdoes not\u201d take responsibility for reports that people have may ingested disinfectant after his comments last week on its effectiveness. Holding Tokyo Olympics in 2021 will be \u2018difficult\u2019, medical expert warns The head of the Japan Medical Authority said it would be \u201cdifficult\u201d to hold the Olympics, even after it was delayed until 2021, unless a vaccine is developed. \u201cUnless an effective vaccine is developed I think it will be difficult to hold the Olympics next year,\u201d JMA president Yoshitake Yokokura told reporters in Tokyo on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m not saying at this point that they shouldn\u2019t be held. The outbreak is not only confined to Japan ... it\u2019s a worldwide issue.\u201d New Zealand eases lockdown New Zealand has moved to level-3 restrictions, allowing some businesses to reopen if they abide by strict social distancing rules. Around 75% of the economy is now operational, but workers were told to work from home if they could. There was much excitement at the reopening of restaurants and cafes for takeaway. Australia eases restrictions Australia\u2019s most populous state, New South Wales, said it would allow up to two adults to visit any house from Friday. Sydney\u2019s iconic Bondi Beach re-opened for the first time in weeks for swimming and surfing. Australia recorded just 12 new cases of the virus nationally in the 24 hours to 6am on Tuesday and a total of 84 deaths. Indonesia\u2019s death toll higher than recorded, experts say More than 2,200 Indonesians may have died from Covid-19, without being recorded in official death totals, according to a Reuters analysis. The official death toll is 765. WHO raises concerns about vaccines for diseases other than Covid-19 The director general of the World Health Organisation, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has said he is concerned about people missing vaccines for diseases such as polio and measles because of the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cChildren may be at relatively low risk from severe disease and death from Covid-19 - the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus - but can be at high risk from other diseases that can be prevented with vaccines,\u201d said Tedros. China reports six new coronavirus cases and no deaths The National Health Commission said half of the new cases were imported. A total of 82,836 confirmed cases have now been reported in China, with 77,555 cases discharged from hospital and a total of 4,633 deaths.",

The UK\u2019s energy system <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/britain-breaks-record-for-coal-free-power-generation\">has not used coal-fired plants for the last 436 hours</a>, according to National Grid data, the longest uninterrupted period since 1882. It has happened partly because of a collapse in demand for electricity during the coronavirus lockdown and because of greater use of solar power. The UK\u2019s previous record was set on 4 June 2019. All but four of the UK\u2019s coal power plants have shut in advance of a government ban on coal generation from 2025. Since 2012 the average carbon intensity of the grid \u2013 the emissions required to produce one kilowatt hour of energy \u2013 has declined by more than two-thirds, from 507g of CO<sub>2 </sub>to 161g.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>UFO footage released \u2013 </strong>The Pentagon has released three declassified videos that show US navy pilots <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/pentagon-releases-three-ufo-videos-taken-by-us-navy-pilots\">encountering \u201cunexplained aerial phenomena\u201d and exchanging excited radio chatter</a>.

The figures come from the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) in Norway. The most displacements were recorded in sub-Saharan Africa amid violence in the Sahel and conflict in Somalia and South Sudan. Natural disasters in south and east Asia and the Pacific also displaced millions. Alexandra Bilak, the IDMC director, said it was too early to assess the full impact of coronavirus on efforts to address displacement. \u201cIf we\u2019re about to plunge into a recession, of course it\u2019s going to have an impact on the generosity of donor governments,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a really bad situation for everybody.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Zoom call scandal \u2013 </strong>The Financial Times reporter Mark Di Stefano has been suspended after the Independent and the Evening Standard accused him of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/27/ft-suspends-journalist-mark-di-stefano-accused-listening-papers-zoom-calls-independent-evening-standard\">listening in on sensitive Zoom meetings</a> held by senior managers telling staff about salary cuts and furloughs.

Since 2012 the average carbon intensity of the grid \u2013 the emissions required to produce one kilowatt hour of energy \u2013 has declined by more than two-thirds, from 507g of CO2 to 161g. * * * UFO footage released \u2013 The Pentagon has released three declassified videos that show US navy pilots encountering \u201cunexplained aerial phenomena\u201d and exchanging excited radio chatter. The videos had been circulating in unauthorised form as far back as 2007. The defence department said it released the footage to \u201cto clear up any misconceptions by the public on whether or not the footage that has been circulating was real or whether or not there is more to the videos\u201d. \u201cAfter a thorough review, the department has determined that the authorized release of these unclassified videos does not reveal any sensitive capabilities or systems, and does not impinge on any subsequent investigations of military air space incursions by unidentified aerial phenomena.\u201d The videos show what pilots saw during training flights in 2004 and 2015. The former Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid, from Nevada, tweeted that what has been released \u201conly scratches the surface of research and materials available\u201d. * * * Millions displaced before virus hit \u2013 A total of 50.8 million people around the world were recorded as internally displaced in 2019, forced from their homes by conflict and disaster. This is the highest number ever, and 10 million more than in 2018. The figures come from the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) in Norway. The most displacements were recorded in sub-Saharan Africa amid violence in the Sahel and conflict in Somalia and South Sudan. Natural disasters in south and east Asia and the Pacific also displaced millions. Alexandra Bilak, the IDMC director, said it was too early to assess the full impact of coronavirus on efforts to address displacement. \u201cIf we\u2019re about to plunge into a recession, of course it\u2019s going to have an impact on the generosity of donor governments,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a really bad situation for everybody.\u201d * * * Zoom call scandal \u2013 The Financial Times reporter Mark Di Stefano has been suspended after the Independent and the Evening Standard accused him of listening in on sensitive Zoom meetings held by senior managers telling staff about salary cuts and furloughs. In each case Di Stefano, a prolific tweeter with more than 100,000 followers, broke the news of the meetings on Twitter at the same time as staff were being informed. Related stories were subsequently published on the FT website and live blog. The FT has declined to comment. Coronavirus Extra After a string of studies that highlight the possible link between air pollution and Covid-19 deaths, Ian Sample hears from Prof Anna Hansell about the complicated relationship between pollution, health and infection with Sars-CoV-2. Following weeks of isolation many people are falling prey to loneliness. Guardian readers and experts offer their experience and advice on how to get through this distressing, dislocating time. \u201cThe future looks bleak\u201d \u2013 what will be left of Europe\u2019s culinary scene after lockdown? Chefs and owners fear bankruptcy as their industry remains in limbo. Today in Focus podcast: Secrets of Sage Following the revelation that Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, took part in the key scientific committee meetings tasked with providing independent advice, Anushka Asthana hears from the Observer\u2019s Sonia Sodha and the former chief scientist Sir David King. Lunchtime read: Face value The global scramble for face masks has exposed the harsh realities of international politics and the limits of the free market, writes Samanth Subramanian. Sport Efforts will intensify this week to find a way to complete the Premier League season, after the government declared its desire to see football back \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. Liverpool have postponed the expansion of the Anfield Road stand by at least 12 months because of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The England and Wales Cricket Board has been urged to open up the Hundred to private investment \u2013 including equity stakes for counties and even Indian Premier League team owners \u2013 in response to the coronavirus crisis. Umar Akmal has been banned from all cricket for three years after the Pakistan batsman failed to report details of corrupt approaches made to him in two separate incidents. Formula One Group is likely to provide the financial backing to enable the British Grand Prix to go ahead behind closed doors this year. And the Six Nations schedule is set for a radical overhaul, with organisers considering creating a new window for the women\u2019s competition to avoid clashing with the men\u2019s tournament. Business Asian shares have been mixed as governments inch toward letting businesses reopen and central banks step in to provide cash to economies. Japan\u2019s benchmark Nikkei 225 lost earlier gains, dipping 0.4% to 19,706.19. South Korea\u2019s Kospi stood virtually unchanged, inching down less than 0.1% to 1,921.39. Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200 gained 0.2% to 5,329.50. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng rose 0.2% to 24,329.34, while the Shanghai Composite fell nearly 0.2% to 2,811.09. The pound is worth $1.241 and \u20ac1.147 while the FTSE is trending 0.3% higher at time of writing. The papers \u201cPM: We\u2019re moving to second phase of battle\u201d \u2013 the Times today says Boris Johnson will detail a limited relaxation of lockdown rules, including the reopening of shops selling non-essential items and allowing small family visits \u2013 while schools will stay shut until June. The Guardian has \u201cNo 10 in talks to allay public fears over end to lockdown\u201d. Others seem keen to drum up a narrative that lockdown is nearly over. \u201cTime to fire up engines, says PM\u201d. Well, he didn\u2019t really say that, Telegraph \u2013 it was more along the lines that the engines will be fired up when it is safe to do so. \u201cNot much longer\u201d, enthuses the Mirror, while the Sun has \u201cTurning the tide\u201d \u2013 which seems more accurate \u2013 under a strapline that gasps with relief: \u201cBoris back at last\u201d. \u201cHope in sight: talks this week on easing UK lockdown\u201d \u2013 can\u2019t really fault the i there. The Express reminds us of the minute\u2019s silence at 11am for NHS workers who have lost their lives: \u201cIn memory of their sacrifice\u201d. The Metro leads with \u201c\u00a360,000 for families of lost heroes\u201d \u2013 on the payments to those left behind. The Mail remains prosecutorial in its coverage: \u201cDoctors\u2019 PPE desperation\u201d \u2013 it adds that \u201cFailure to stockpile gowns and visors dates back 11 years\u201d. We will close with the FT: \u201cSunak commits to shield economy from \u2018cold turkey\u2019 jobless surge\u201d \u2013 employment support payments will be wound down rather than cut off abruptly.

This is thought to be the work exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1894 under the title Lost in Reverie. Image: Agatha Mary Clarissa Miller (1890\u20131976), later Agatha Christie, aged four, Lost in Reverie, 1894, Douglas John Connah (1871\u20131941), National Trust, Greenway, 2:C - Rushbearing festivals started when medieval parish churches still had earthen floors covered in rushes. The custom died out when flagstones were introduced but was revived in the 19th century in many English villages. It takes place in Grasmere on or near to St Oswald\u2019s Day (5 August). Image: The Grasmere Rushbearing, 1905, Frank Bramley (1857\u20131915), National Trust, Lake District, 3:A - Rex Whistler\u2019s decorative panel was painted for Sir Courtauld Thomson (1865-1954) to separate the front door and the hall of his house at Dorneywood. The full panel depicts an allegorical scene of the goddess Flora holding the hand of a frightened little Cupid, coming into the house from the garden. Although the garden is an imagined one, the walled croquet lawn is indeed part of Dorneywood Garden and is still in use today. Image: Ave Silvae Dornii, 1928, Rex Whistler (1905\u20131944), National Trust, Dorneywood, 4:D - Cupid is shown shooting arrows. One, made of gold, hits Apollo, who is consequently smitten with Daphne; the other, of lead, pierces Daphne and fills her with hate for Apollo. In order to escape Apollo\u2019s relentless advances Daphne persuades her river-god father, Peneus, to transform her into a laurel tree. Image: Apollo Pursuing Daphne Transforming into a Laurel, early 17th century, after Paulus Willemsz van Vianen (1570\u20131613), National Trust, Kingston Lacy, 5:D - Love Among the Ruins by Edward Burne-Jones at Wightwick Manor is a pre-Raphaelite painting inspired by Robert Browning\u2019s 1855 poetic meditation of the same name on the transient nature of human power, wealth and glory, and the endurance of love. Image: Love Among the Ruins, 1894, Edward Burne-Jones (1833\u20131898), National Trust, Wightwick Manor, 6:C - This cast by Sir Joseph Edgar Boehm comes from a statue of Thomas Carlyle, who was a British historian, satirical writer, essayist, translator, philosopher, mathematician and teacher. Image: Hands of Thomas Carlyle (1795\u20131881), c1874, Joseph Edgar Boehm (1834\u20131890), National Trust, Carlyle\u2019s House, 7:A - Elizabeth \"Bess\" of Hardwick\u2019s fourth husband, George Talbot \u2013 sixth Earl of Shrewsbury \u2013 was \"keeper\" of Mary Queen of Scots from 1568 until 1584. During her imprisonment with Shrewsbury, Bess and the Queen became friends, and together they embroidered the wonderful Marian embroideries, which are currently at Oxburgh Hall, Norfolk. Image: Elizabeth Hardwick (1520\u20131608), Countess of Shrewsbury, \"Bess of Hardwick\", 16th century, follower of Hans Eworth (c1520\u2013after 1578), National Trust, Hardwick Hall, 8:C - Lyme Park famously appeared as the location for Pemberley in the 1995 BBC adaptation of Jane Austen\u2019s Pride and Prejudice, including the memorable scene where Elizabeth Bennet encounters Darcy emerging fully clothed from the lake. Lacock Abbey and village, which are also cared for by the Trust, featured in this adaptation.

The statement confirmed ambassador Cheng Jingye took a phone call from Dfat secretary Frances Adamson, but said media reports about what was said were incorrect. \u201cSecretary Adamson tried her best to defend Australia\u2019s proposal about the independent review, saying the proposal neither has political motive nor targets China. She also admitted it is not the time to commence the review now and Australia has no details of the proposal. She further said that Australia does not want the matter to have any impact on Australia-China relationship. \u201cAmbassador Cheng elaborated clearly China\u2019s relevant position, stressing that no matter what excuses the Australian side has made, the fact can not be buried that the proposal is a political manoeuvre. \u201cAmbassador Cheng flatly rejected the concern expressed from the Australian side over his remarks during the recent AFR interview, and called on Australia to put aside ideological bias, stop political games and do more thing to promote the bilateral relations.\u201d The foreign minister, Marise Payne, on Monday put down \u201cany suggestion that economic coercion is an appropriate response to a call for such an assessment\u201d. The trade minister, Simon Birmingham, added: \u201cAustralia is no more going to change our policy position on a major public health issue because of economic coercion or threats of coercion, than we would change our policy position in matters of national security.\u201d The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has called on member nations of the World Health Organization to support an independent inquiry into the origins and spread of the coronavirus. He has said his country will push for an international investigation at the WHO assembly on 17 May. With Paul Karp",

      "bodyText": "A Productivity Commission report touted by Scott Morrison as providing important policy options to help the Australian economy recover from the coronavirus crisis was so riddled with errors and unsupported assertions that the commission was forced to issue a six-page correction. In its correction to the Shifting the Dial report, which was initially released in 2017 while Morrison was treasurer, the commission revised some numbers downwards by an order of magnitude and abandoned claims that regulatory changes could deliver tens of billions of dollars of gains to the economy. The report recommended sweeping changes to everything from healthcare to taxation, including banning \u201clow value\u201d surgeries, watering down copyright laws and replacing stamp duties with a land tax. Morrison referred to the report by name at least twice last week, on Thursday saying it contained \u201cimportant policy options\u201d that the government would look at to see \u201chow they can be utilised to have an effective and sustainable and strong recovery on the other side of the coronavirus\u201d, and on Friday telling Sky News he wanted to \u201cput all this stuff on the table again and let\u2019s look at the things that we think can best work\u201d. The commission, which acts as an in-house thinktank to the federal government, is required to conduct an inquiry into productivity in Australia every five years, but the Shifting the Dial report was far more comprehensive than the body\u2019s normal review of microeconomic reform. In a speech in December 2016, the then commission chairman Peter Harris said Morrison was heavily involved in the design of the review, and before commissioning it \u201cwanted to discuss in detail the design of the brief that was given to us\u201d. A Productivity Commission spokeswoman said the report was changed in July last year after concerns about some of the numbers in it were raised within the organisation. Most of the abandoned claims were in appendix B of the report, which dealt with regulatory reforms. However, error also infected supporting papers and parts of the main body of the report that relied on the work in appendix B. Clangers in the report included a claim that loosening restrictions on importing used cars could boost the economy by $13.5bn a year and that changes to industry assistance, government procurement and intellectual property policies could create gains of $5bn a year. Both numbers were deleted in the corrected report. Instead, the commission said the effect of changing car import rules was \u201chard to estimate given unreliable data on used car sales and the prospective impact on car prices\u201d, and did not quantify the effect of the grab-bag of proposed policy changes. It is believed the used car and intellectual property numbers were changed because, on review, Productivity Commission officials felt they were unrealistic. Loosening occupational licensing rules was originally said to be a $15bn a year gain, but was changed to being \u201cworth billions\u201d. The original report implied that making Australian intellectual property laws less restrictive, by replacing the \u201cfair dealing\u201d regime that covers copying with a \u201cfair use\u201d one similar to that in force in the United States, could boost annual gross domestic product by $1.9bn. This was revised down by an order of magnitude, to $190m. It is believed concerns were first raised about some of the numbers in the report by public servants from outside the commission. This prompted senior commission staff to conduct a review of the entire report, which discovered and corrected the errors and unsafe assumptions. Within the commission, it is accepted that the errors were serious, but it stands by the recommendations of the report as a whole. A spokeswoman said the changes \u201caddress concerns about the degree to which numerical estimates are sufficiently reliable for some specific reforms, and in other instances correct early estimates\u201d. \u201cThe changes do not affect any qualitative judgments made in appendix B or elsewhere in the report, or the overall view about the collective magnitude of traditional microeconomic reform,\u201d she said.",

to the families of healthcare workers who have died, confronted Hancock on the Nick Ferrari radio show on LBC on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>He asked why his father\u2019s letter to Johnson was ignored. \u201cWhen he was unwell he wrote an open letter to the prime minister appealing for more PPE for NHS frontline workers, it was a request that was ignored, two weeks later he passed away and since then over 100 NHS and social care workers have passed away from contracting the virus,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom

      "bodyText": "The son of a doctor who died of coronavirus after warning Boris Johnson about a lack of personal protective equipment has confronted the health secretary, Matt Hancock, asking if he regrets not taking his father\u2019s concerns seriously enough. Intisar Chowdhury, the 18-year-old son of Abdul Mabud Chowdhury, a consultant urologist at Homerton hospital in east London who died after contracting Covid-19, also criticised the government\u2019s response to the coronavirus crisis. Intisar Chowdhury, who earlier called on the government to apologise to the families of healthcare workers who have died, confronted Hancock on the Nick Ferrari radio show on LBC on Tuesday. He asked why his father\u2019s letter to Johnson was ignored. \u201cWhen he was unwell he wrote an open letter to the prime minister appealing for more PPE for NHS frontline workers, it was a request that was ignored, two weeks later he passed away and since then over 100 NHS and social care workers have passed away from contracting the virus,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you regret not taking my dad\u2019s concerns, my 11-year-old sister\u2019s concerns \u2026 seriously enough for my dad that we\u2019ve all lost?\u201d The health secretary told him he was \u201creally sorry\u201d about his father\u2019s death and thought it was brave of him to speak out in public. \u201cWe took very, very seriously what your father said and we\u2019ve been working around the clock to ensure that there\u2019s enough protective equipment,\u201d he said \u201cIn the case of anybody who works in the NHS or in social care [who] has died from coronavirus, we look into it in each case to find out the reasons where they might have caught it and what lessons we can learn.\u201d Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme earlier on Tuesday, Chowdhury said: \u201cI definitely do want a public apology because I feel like the government response in not only handling the PPE crisis but the whole crisis wasn\u2019t the best.\u201d He added: \u201cI think that we could forgive that as a country, as it\u2019s such an unprecedented thing it\u2019s hard to know what the right thing is to do, but they need to be able to hold themselves accountable for that, make an apology for that, learn from that and then move on so we can trust them more.\u201d The 18-year-old\u2019s father urged the prime minister to ensure every NHS worker was protected in a direct plea on Facebook last month shortly after being taken ill with Covid-19.

      "bodyText": "With everyone stuck at home during this moment, it tracks that the windowsill has turned into a canvas, people looking out on the world while sharing something with it. As part of a new photo project, Stephen Lovekin has photographed hopeful messages posted in the windows of his Brooklyn neighborhood of Ditmas Park, an area known for its palatial Victorian homes. The series, Words at the Window: Self Isolation and the Coronavirus, shows roughly 40 couples, families and solo residents of his neighborhood, from children to seniors, pugs and babies in diapers, posing out of the window. \u201cI started the project to help neighbors find a way to still feel connected with each other in this \u2018new normal\u2019 of social distancing and self-isolation,\u201d says Lovekin. \u201cI also thought the use of the window, as opposed to having my subjects come outside, which complements the isolation idea. \u201cThe thing I\u2019ve learned about this is that people are strong, kind and good,\u201d he adds. \u201cI really wanted to make people feel connected. The photos include portraits of the 91-year-old artist Shirley Fuerst, the neighbor and landlady of Lovekin. \u201cWe live in a split house and she lives by herself on one side, my family and I live on the other,\u201d he says. \u201cShe continues to work on her art every day up in her studio on the top floor.\u201d In another shot, Guatemalan artist Juan Carlos Pinto poses alongside his family on the fifth floor of a building, holding up a sign that reads: \u201cTogether.\u201d Getting the shot was no easy feat. \u201cFor some reason, the only window that would open was the one in front of the fire escape,\u201d says Lovekin. \u201cYou can only really see their eyes through the slats.\u201d There\u2019s also a pensive-looking shot of Robert E Clark Jr, who runs a community radio station called Cortelyou Road Radio, the only one of its kind in Ditmas Park. He\u2019s holding a sign behind a screen window that reads: \u201cTough times never last ... but tough people do.\u201d The phrases are all hopeful, from \u201cThis too shall pass\u201d to \u201cWaiting with you\u201d (one \u201coff-brand\u201d message with children says: \u201cWe are so bored\u201d). Ditmas Park, a largely residential neighborhood in Flatbush, Brooklyn, is lined with stately homes, many of which are divided into multiple apartments. Brooklyn is among the boroughs that has been hit the hardest by the pandemic, proving the coronavirus isn\u2019t an equalizer. \u201cOne of the things I love about Brooklyn is that people tend to come together in times of need,\u201d says Lovekin, a staff photographer with Shutterstock. \u201cEven though this is so hard, I think we will come through it together. Lovekin still abides by social distancing rules while shooting, using a zoom lens to maintain a safe distance from his subjects and wearing protective gear. \u201cI make sure I am wearing a mask and gloves and always have some hand sanitizer, as well,\u201d he adds. In one memorable photo, psychotherapist Marge Blaine poses alongside Ed Blaine, a writer and playwright, while holding up a sign that reads: \u2018Keep calm, wash your hands \u2013 and carry on!\u2019 \u201cIt\u2019s a way of connecting with others when most of our time is being spent alone at home,\u201d says Dr Blaine. \u201cSince we visit the UK every year, we\u2019re familiar with the phrase and it seemed particularly apt here, with the addition of the reminder to keep washing hands.\u201d There\u2019s one photo of gallerist Tom Parker and his wife Elizabeth and their children posing with the sign: \u201cNever doubt the capacity of the human spirit.\u201d \u201cIn all this madness, you\u2019re looking for things that resonate and seem important,\u201d says Parker. \u201cThat stuck out as having real seriousness and poignancy.\u201d The Parker family are accompanied by their dog Gypsy, peeking out the window with them. \u201cI love the sign about the strength of the human spirit and our dog sitting right there, with us,\u201d he says. \u201cThe human spirit has prevailed throughout the history of mankind; overcoming pandemics, world wars, natural disasters,\u201d says Parker. \u201cUltimately, we survive. We find a way to overcome. It\u2019s a strong instinct in all of us to find the best in a situation. There is no shortage of examples, it\u2019s something we can all believe in.\u201d",

It\u2019s happening before our very eyes,\u201d said Sheldon Goldman, a professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst who focuses on the federal bench.</p> <p>While the US supreme court is the country\u2019s highest judicial authority and attracts most national and international attention, it is the country\u2019s appeals courts that have the last word on justice in the vast majority of cases. They hear thousands of cases each year, compared with the 100-150 the supreme court typically hears. And largely unlike the British court system, federal judges in the United States are selected by politicians in a process that has become an intense area of focus for outside partisans.</p> <p>Trump has notched more confirmations of appeals court judges, faster, than any president at a similar stage in history, a record he frequently gloats about and <a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2019/11/trumps-exaggerated-judicial-boasts/\">cannot resist inflating</a>.</p> <p>Trump has appointed 51 out of the 179 active circuit court judges, or almost 30% of the entire bench, and next month the total is expected to hit 53. By comparison, Barack Obama appointed 55 circuit court judges and George W Bush appointed 62 \u2013 in eight years each. Trump\u2019s judges, who can serve for life, have a starting <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/01/28/judicial-appointments-in-trumps-first-three-years-myths-and-realities/\">median age</a> of 48.2, compared with 52.8 for Obama and 51 for Bush. As the country demographically becomes more diverse, they are <a href=\"https://www.afj.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Confirmed-2.13.20.pdf\">predominantly male and white</a>, and ideologically they tend to inhabit deep right field.</p> <p>Together, they are changing America.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My motto for the year is leave no vacancy behind.

District judges in the ninth circuit, historically among the most progressive in the nation, had been fastest to block his travel ban and challenge his incursions on immigration, LGBTQ and voting rights. In 2018, when a district judge in the ninth circuit blocked Trump restrictions on asylum applications, Trump tweet-raged <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1065581119242940416\">that</a> \u201cthe 9th Circuit is a complete &amp; total disaster\u201d and \u201cout of control\u201d with \u201ca horrible reputation\u201d.</p> <p>In the last two years, however, the ninth circuit has changed.</p> <p>Court vacancies and ruthless engineering by McConnell have allowed Trump to install 10 new judges on the ninth circuit, which with 29 active judges total is by far the biggest in the land. When the family planning cases landed before the court last year, two Trump appointees were selected at random to sit on an 11-member ruling panel.</p> <p>In late February, the court handed down its decision. The judges split 7-4 precisely according to the party identities of their appointing presidents. To the shock of longtime observers of the federal courts, the ruling greenlighted Trump\u2019s family planning restrictions \u2013 with the sure result, <a href=\"http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2020/02/24/19-15974_opinion.pdf\">in the words</a> of dissenting Judge Richard Paez, that \u201cwomen and their families will suffer for it\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe majority disregards 20 years of progress, insistent on hauling the paternalism of the past into the present,\u201d Paez wrote. He quoted a district judge in Oregon: \u201cThis is madness.\u201d</p> <p>But as shocking as the ruling might have been, scholars saw in the ninth circuit decision a clear augury, \u201ca precursor for what we\u2019re likely to see in the future,\u201d according to Carl Tobias, a professor at Richmond School of Law specializing in federal judicial selection.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a classic case that shows you how much power these new judges have,\u201d Tobias said. \u201cThat\u2019s a concrete example of the changing dynamics of that court.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7362ffe8933902d010b40c05daf9cf66beaca4a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7362ffe8933902d010b40c05daf9cf66beaca4a6/0_260_6062_3638/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Asylum seekers wait for their turn to cross to the United States at El Chaparral crossing port on the US-Mexico border in Tijuana, Baja California state, Mexico, on 29 February 2020.

In fact, a 63% majority of Trump judges replaced judges who had been appointed by previous Republican presidents, according to <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/01/28/judicial-appointments-in-trumps-first-three-years-myths-and-realities/\">analysis by</a> Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institute.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s just a little early to begin making determined judgments about how much things have changed on the courts of appeals,\u201d Wheeler said.</p> <p>But the data is beginning to pile up, in rulings starting at the top \u2013 the supreme court, where Trump has installed two justices out of nine, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch.

      "bodyText": "For all the extravagant projects of the Donald Trump presidency, and for all its flamboyance and bluster, his makeover of the judiciary \u2013 a quieter project that has been ratcheted forward by a network of quieter people \u2013 may prove to have the longest and most far-reaching impacts on the daily lives of Americans. All new presidents change the courts by filling vacancies. But what is only now coming into focus is the impact that Trump\u2019s unprecedented number of judicial appointments is having on the courts, ruling by ruling, and on the day-to-day lives of Americans, in areas such as healthcare, voting rights, criminal justice, anti-discrimination efforts and the climate. \u201cThe change is happening. It\u2019s happening before our very eyes,\u201d said Sheldon Goldman, a professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst who focuses on the federal bench. While the US supreme court is the country\u2019s highest judicial authority and attracts most national and international attention, it is the country\u2019s appeals courts that have the last word on justice in the vast majority of cases. They hear thousands of cases each year, compared with the 100-150 the supreme court typically hears. And largely unlike the British court system, federal judges in the United States are selected by politicians in a process that has become an intense area of focus for outside partisans. Trump has notched more confirmations of appeals court judges, faster, than any president at a similar stage in history, a record he frequently gloats about and cannot resist inflating. Trump has appointed 51 out of the 179 active circuit court judges, or almost 30% of the entire bench, and next month the total is expected to hit 53. By comparison, Barack Obama appointed 55 circuit court judges and George W Bush appointed 62 \u2013 in eight years each. Trump\u2019s judges, who can serve for life, have a starting median age of 48.2, compared with 52.8 for Obama and 51 for Bush. As the country demographically becomes more diverse, they are predominantly male and white, and ideologically they tend to inhabit deep right field. Together, they are changing America. The Trump administration has come under fire for its dithering and denial in the face of the coronavirus pandemic since the first fatal case outside China was recorded on 2 February. But the White House has been a hive of focused activity when it comes to advancing judicial appointments. Keeping up a brisk clip established early in his presidency, Trump has advanced 19 judges to fill federal vacancies since early February, in unwavering pursuit of his grand project to impose a new, conservative cast on American justice. And even as the virus rages, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has vowed to make confirming the judges the first order of business when the chamber reconvenes early next month. \u201cMy motto for the year is leave no vacancy behind,\u201d McConnell said in a radio interview on Wednesday. \u201cThat hasn\u2019t changed. The pandemic will not prevent us from achieving that goal.\u201d The Guardian reviewed dozens of cases affected by Trump\u2019s judges, which included creating majorities in rulings that targeted immigrants and workers and undermined protections for society\u2019s most vulnerable. They have: Attacked the Affordable Care Act and chipped away at healthcare. Greenlighted funding for Trump\u2019s border wall. Stepped aside to allow partisan gerrymandering. Defended abusive policing. Permitted encroachments on the Americans with Disabilities Act. Shrugged at emergency requests in death penalty cases. Established and reinforced religious exemptions from anti-bias laws. \u201cWe had fears about what these jurists would do when they got on the bench, just from their records,\u201d said Marge Baker, executive vice-president of People for the American Way (PFAW), which has just unveiled a report called Shredding the Social Safety Net on \u201cthe Republican plot to use federal courts to destroy public health\u201d. \u201cThis administration more than any has really been putting movement ideologues on the bench who have an agenda. And once we got far enough into the administration, we realized that the judges about whom we had fears were issuing decisions that were highly problematic.\u201d A clear example of the impact of Trump\u2019s judicial project was seen last spring, when the Trump administration stepped up its war on reproductive rights with new regulations gagging healthcare providers from fully counseling millions of mostly low-income women about their options while pregnant. The new rules threatened to shutter Planned Parenthood clinics and other facilities that offer abortion services alongside healthcare subsidized by federal funds. As with Trump\u2019s original travel ban, the family planning regulations seemed clearly illegal, with a decades-old reef of legislation protecting healthcare funding from just such attacks by conservative activists. Three western states immediately sued, and before long a trio of district courts had issued injunctions suspending the new Trump rules. The cases landed on appeal as a package last summer before the ninth circuit court, one of the 13 federal appeals courts, a step below the US supreme court, which are the last stop for justice in almost every case. Once upon a time, Trump would have, literally, cursed the venue. District judges in the ninth circuit, historically among the most progressive in the nation, had been fastest to block his travel ban and challenge his incursions on immigration, LGBTQ and voting rights. In 2018, when a district judge in the ninth circuit blocked Trump restrictions on asylum applications, Trump tweet-raged that \u201cthe 9th Circuit is a complete &amp; total disaster\u201d and \u201cout of control\u201d with \u201ca horrible reputation\u201d. In the last two years, however, the ninth circuit has changed. Court vacancies and ruthless engineering by McConnell have allowed Trump to install 10 new judges on the ninth circuit, which with 29 active judges total is by far the biggest in the land. When the family planning cases landed before the court last year, two Trump appointees were selected at random to sit on an 11-member ruling panel. In late February, the court handed down its decision. The judges split 7-4 precisely according to the party identities of their appointing presidents. To the shock of longtime observers of the federal courts, the ruling greenlighted Trump\u2019s family planning restrictions \u2013 with the sure result, in the words of dissenting Judge Richard Paez, that \u201cwomen and their families will suffer for it\u201d. \u201cThe majority disregards 20 years of progress, insistent on hauling the paternalism of the past into the present,\u201d Paez wrote. He quoted a district judge in Oregon: \u201cThis is madness.\u201d But as shocking as the ruling might have been, scholars saw in the ninth circuit decision a clear augury, \u201ca precursor for what we\u2019re likely to see in the future,\u201d according to Carl Tobias, a professor at Richmond School of Law specializing in federal judicial selection. \u201cThat\u2019s a classic case that shows you how much power these new judges have,\u201d Tobias said. \u201cThat\u2019s a concrete example of the changing dynamics of that court.\u201d Growing impact In case after case, the rulings of Trump\u2019s picks represent not the preference of a majority of the public, but the preference of a shrinking American conservative minority whose grip on power runs through the US Senate and its exclusive power to confirm federal judges, here exploited mightily. The latest census projections in 2018 suggested that the US will become \u201cminority white\u201d in 2045, yet Trump\u2019s judges are almost uniformly white and male, in direct opposition to the changing demographics of the country. Experts caution that many Trump appointees are very recent arrivals on the bench and the extent to which they have shifted or will shift the law of the land won\u2019t be clear for five years or more. Most circuit court rulings are made by panels of three judges selected from each court\u2019s total judges pool, averaging 13 in number, and Trump judges don\u2019t rule on every case. Likewise, the addition of a Trump judge to a court does not necessarily change its overall balance. In fact, a 63% majority of Trump judges replaced judges who had been appointed by previous Republican presidents, according to analysis by Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institute. \u201cI think it\u2019s just a little early to begin making determined judgments about how much things have changed on the courts of appeals,\u201d Wheeler said. But the data is beginning to pile up, in rulings starting at the top \u2013 the supreme court, where Trump has installed two justices out of nine, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch. In the last two years, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh have joined controversial decisions on voter purges, immigration, public unions, prisoners\u2019 rights, Trump\u2019s travel bans, the environment and more. In March, the pair for the first time heard oral arguments in a major abortion case that could undermine Roe v Wade. Supreme court decisions draw a lion\u2019s share of public attention, but the circuit courts have an arguably greater role in shaping daily life, and recent circuit rulings give plenty of cause for alarm, said Baker. \u201cEverything that people think of and care about in terms of quality of their daily lives \u2013 access to healthcare, access to clean water to drink and clean air to breathe, protections in the workplace from discrimination, the ability to marry the person they love and be free from discrimination whether it\u2019s based on their gender or race or status as an LGBTQ person \u2013 all of that the courts are deciding on a daily basis,\u201d Baker said. To capture a picture of how Trump\u2019s judges are changing the country, Baker\u2019s organization has built an interactive catalog called Confirmed Judges, Confirmed Fears. The database includes analysis of rulings by Trump judges sortable by topic and by judge name. \u201cThe increase in the number of Trump judges means you have more and more cases where you might very well have two Trump judges in the majority\u201d on a three-person panel, said Elliott Mincberg, a senior fellow at PFAW. \u201cAnd that\u2019s happening more and more.\u201d Meanwhile traditionally more conservative circuits, such as the New Orleans-based fifth circuit, have taken a noticeably hardline turn under Trump judges (the fifth circuit has five out of 17, with one vacancy about to be filled by a sixth Trump nominee). In December, a Trump judge on the court joined a two-to-one majority attacking Obama\u2019s healthcare law, ruling that the former \u201cindividual mandate\u201d to carry health insurance was unconstitutional. Other judges on the court have joined controversial opinions on border wall construction, voting rights and fair housing. Even in cases where Trump judges replaced judges appointed by an earlier Republican, Trump\u2019s judges as a group espouse a more extreme conservative philosophy \u2013 which may be enhanced in practice if the judges see their appeals court jobs as tryouts for the US supreme court. \u201cI\u2019m sure that at least some of them are doing their judging with one eye on the health of Ruth Ginsburg and Steve Breyer,\u201d said Wheeler. \u201cWondering, \u2018what can I do to persuade the administration that I\u2019d be a great person to appoint to the supreme court?\u2019\u201d In critiquing the recent ninth circuit decision on family planning, Paez warned that Trump\u2019s judges were seeking to turn back the clock of American jurisprudence. \u201cThe majority would return us to an older world, one in which a government bureaucrat could restrict a medical professional from informing a patient of the full range of healthcare options available to her,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI strongly dissent.\u201d",

It\u2019s ironic that the public is told to keep a two-metre distance and yet healthcare professionals are protected in a flimsy surgical mask, plastic gloves and a pathetic apron. I tried to make them keep away from me because I obviously had coronavirus but it is impossible to maintain a safe distance and take observations or bloods from a patient. My CT showed widespread Covid-19. I was not tested so I don\u2019t count, like numerous others in the country\u2019s total of positive tests. I was there all day and they wanted to keep me in, but I cried and told them I wanted to be at home. They only let me leave because I\u2019m a doctor.</p> <p>I was more ill than I\u2019ve ever been; I might well have died. My oldest son doesn\u2019t want me to go back to work because he thinks it\u2019s too dangerous. But I\u2019m desperate to get back.

Leaving my children was the hardest, most traumatic moment I have ever experienced. Knowing that my job had put them in a position where they could lose their mother made me feel so selfish. The staff in my local A&amp;E were very unprotected. It\u2019s ironic that the public is told to keep a two-metre distance and yet healthcare professionals are protected in a flimsy surgical mask, plastic gloves and a pathetic apron. I tried to make them keep away from me because I obviously had coronavirus but it is impossible to maintain a safe distance and take observations or bloods from a patient. My CT showed widespread Covid-19. I was not tested so I don\u2019t count, like numerous others in the country\u2019s total of positive tests. I was there all day and they wanted to keep me in, but I cried and told them I wanted to be at home. They only let me leave because I\u2019m a doctor. I was more ill than I\u2019ve ever been; I might well have died. My oldest son doesn\u2019t want me to go back to work because he thinks it\u2019s too dangerous. But I\u2019m desperate to get back. I hate knowing my colleagues are still in the firing line, fighting, and thinking I\u2019m not doing anything to help them.

Each model, each finding is just adding to a weight of evidence in one direction or another.</p> <p><strong>A lot of the reporting is focusing on models, and most of us probably don\u2019t have any basic training in how </strong><strong>to read </strong><strong>them or what kind of credence </strong><strong>to put in them. What should we know?</strong></p> <p>The key thing, and this goes for scientists as well as non-scientists, is that people are not doing a very good job thinking about what the purpose of different models are, how the purposes of different models vary, and then what the scope of their value is.

But we weren\u2019t ready for the degree to which that stuff would be picked up and assigned meaning in this highly politically polarized environment. Work that might be fairly easy for researchers to contextualize in the field can be portrayed as something very, very different in the popular press.</p> <p>The first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/new-data-new-policy-why-uks-coronavirus-strategy-has-changed\">Imperial College model</a> in March was predicting 1.1 million to 2.2 million American deaths if the pandemic were not controlled. That\u2019s a really scary, dramatic story, and I still think that it\u2019s not unrealistic. That got promoted by one side of the partisan divide. Then Imperial came back and modeled a completely different scenario, where the disease was actually brought under control and suppressed in the US, and they released a subsequent model that said, \u2018If we do this, something like 50,000 deaths will occur.\u2019 That was picked up by the other side and used to try to discredit the Imperial College team entirely by saying, \u2018A couple of weeks ago they said a million now they\u2019re saying 50,000<em>;</em> they can\u2019t get anything right.\u2019 And the answer , of course, is that they were modeling two different scenarios.</p> <p>We\u2019re also not doing enough of deliberately stressing the possible weaknesses of our interpretations. That varies enormously from researcher to researcher and team to team.</p> <p><strong>It requires a lot of discipline to argue really hard for something but also be scrupulously open about all of the weaknesses in your own argument.</strong></p> <p>But it\u2019s more important than ever, right? A really good paper will lay out all the most persuasive evidence it can and then in the conclusion section or the discussion section say, \u2018OK, here are all the reasons that this could be wrong and here are the weaknesses.\u2019</p> <p>When you have something that\u2019s so directly policy relevant, and there\u2019s a lot of lives at stake, we\u2019re learning how to find the right balance.</p> <p><strong>It is a bit of a nightmare to put out data that is truthful, but also be aware that there are bad faith actors at the moment who might pounce on it and use it in a way you didn\u2019t intend.</strong></p> <p>There\u2019s a spectrum. You have outright bad faith actors \u2013 Russian propaganda picking up on things and bots spreading misinformation \u2013 and then you have someone like Georgia Governor Brian Kemp who I wouldn\u2019t call<em> </em>a bad faith actor. He\u2019s a misinformed actor. </p> <p>There\u2019s so much that goes unsaid in science in terms of context and what findings mean that we don\u2019t usually write in papers. If someone does a mathematical forecasting model, you\u2019re usually not going to have a half-page discussion on the limitations of forecasting. We\u2019re used to writing for an audience of 50 people in the world, if we\u2019re lucky, who have backgrounds that are very similar to our own and have a huge set of shared assumptions and shared knowledge. And it works really well when you\u2019re writing on something that only 50 people in the world care about and all of them have comparable training, but it is a real mess when it becomes pressing, and I don\u2019t think any of us have figured out exactly what to do about that because we\u2019re also trying to work quickly and it\u2019s important to get this information out.</p> <p><strong>One area that has already become contentious and in some ways politicized is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/coronavirus-antibody-studies-california-stanford\">serology surveys</a>, which are supposed to show what percentage of the population has antibodies to the virus. What are some of the big picture contextual caveats and limitations that we should keep in mind as these surveys come out?</strong></p> <p>The seroprevalence in the US is a political issue, and so the first thing is to recognize that when anyone is reporting on that stuff, there\u2019s a political context to it. It may even be that some of the research is being done with an implicitly political context, depending on who the funders are or what the orientations and biases of some of the researchers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>It may even be that some of the research is being done with an implicitly political context, depending on who the funders are or what the orientations and biases of some of the researchers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On the scientific side, I think there\u2019s really two things to think about. The first one is the issue of selection bias. You\u2019re trying to draw a conclusion about one population by sampling from a subset of that population and you want to know how close to random your subset is with respect to the thing you\u2019re trying to measure. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/antibody-study-suggests-coronavirus-is-far-more-widespread-than-previously-thought\">Santa Clara study</a> recruited volunteers off of Facebook. The obvious source of sampling bias there is that people desperately want to get tested. The people that want it are, of course, people that think they\u2019ve had it. </p> <p>The other big piece is understanding the notion of positive predictive value and the way false positive and false negative error rates influence the estimate. And that depends on the incidence of infection in the population.</p> <p>If you have a test that has a 3% error rate, and the incidence in the population is below 3%, then most of the positives that you get are going to be false positives. And so you\u2019re not going to get a very tight estimate about how many people have it. This has been a real problem with the Santa Clara study. From my read of the paper, their data is actually consistent with nobody being infected. A New York City<em> </em>study on the other hand showed <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/nyregion/coronavirus-antibodies-test-ny.html\">21% seropositive</a>, so even if there has a 3% error rate, the majority of those positives have to be true positives.</p> <p><strong>Now that we\u2019ve all had a crash course in models and serosurveys, what are the other areas of science where it makes sense for the public to start getting educated on the terms of the debate?</strong></p> <p>One that I think will come along sooner or later is interpreting studies of treatments. We\u2019ve dealt with that a little bit with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus-scientific-studies-research\">hydroxychloroquine business</a> but not in any serious way because the hydroxychloroquine work has been pretty weak and the results have not been so positive.</p> <p>But there are ongoing tests of a large range of existing drugs. And these studies are actually pretty hard to do. There\u2019s a lot of subtle technical issues: what are you doing for controls? Is there a control arm at all? If not, how do you interpret the data? If there is a control arm, how is it structured? How do you control for the characteristics of the population on whom you\u2019re using the drug or their selection biases in terms of who\u2019s getting the drug?</p> <p>Unfortunately, given what we\u2019ve already seen with hydroxychloroquine, it\u2019s fairly likely that this will be politicized as well. There\u2019ll be a parallel set of issues that are going to come around with vaccination, but that\u2019s more like a year off.</p> <p><strong>If you had the ability to arm every person with one tool \u2013 a statistical tool or scientific concept \u2013 to help them understand and contextualize scientific information as we look to the future of this pandemic, what would it be?</strong></p> <p>I would like people to understand that there are interactions between the models we make, the science we do and the way that we behave. The models that we make influence the decisions that we take individually and as a society, which then feed back into the models and the models often don\u2019t treat that part explicitly.</p> <p>Once you put a model out there that then creates changes in behavior that pull you out of the domain that the model was trying to model in the first place. We have to be very attuned to that as we try to use the models for guiding policy.</p> <p><strong>That\u2019s very interesting, and not what I expected you to say.</strong></p> <p>What did you expect?</p> <p><strong>That correlation </strong><strong>does not imply causation.</strong></p> <p>That\u2019s another very good one. Seasonality is a great example there. We\u2019re trying a whole bunch of things at the same time. We\u2019re throwing all kinds of possible solutions at this and lots of things are changing. It\u2019s remarkable to me actually, that so many US states are seeing the epidemic curve decrease. And so there\u2019s a bunch of possibilities there. It could be because people\u2019s behavior is changing. There could be some seasonality there. And there are other possible explanations as well.</p> <p>But what is really important is that just because the trend that you see is consistent with a story that someone\u2019s selling, there may be many other stories that are also consistent, so inferring causality is dangerous.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/563882/calling-bullshit-by-carl-t-bergstrom-and-jevin-d-west/\">Calling Bullshit: The Art of Scepticism in a Data-Driven World</a> by Carl Bergstrom and Jevin West will be published 4 August 2020 by Penguin.</em></p></li> </ul>",

There\u2019s a spectrum. You have outright bad faith actors \u2013 Russian propaganda picking up on things and bots spreading misinformation \u2013 and then you have someone like Georgia Governor Brian Kemp who I wouldn\u2019t call a bad faith actor. He\u2019s a misinformed actor. There\u2019s so much that goes unsaid in science in terms of context and what findings mean that we don\u2019t usually write in papers. If someone does a mathematical forecasting model, you\u2019re usually not going to have a half-page discussion on the limitations of forecasting. We\u2019re used to writing for an audience of 50 people in the world, if we\u2019re lucky, who have backgrounds that are very similar to our own and have a huge set of shared assumptions and shared knowledge. And it works really well when you\u2019re writing on something that only 50 people in the world care about and all of them have comparable training, but it is a real mess when it becomes pressing, and I don\u2019t think any of us have figured out exactly what to do about that because we\u2019re also trying to work quickly and it\u2019s important to get this information out. One area that has already become contentious and in some ways politicized is the serology surveys, which are supposed to show what percentage of the population has antibodies to the virus. What are some of the big picture contextual caveats and limitations that we should keep in mind as these surveys come out? The seroprevalence in the US is a political issue, and so the first thing is to recognize that when anyone is reporting on that stuff, there\u2019s a political context to it. It may even be that some of the research is being done with an implicitly political context, depending on who the funders are or what the orientations and biases of some of the researchers. On the scientific side, I think there\u2019s really two things to think about. The first one is the issue of selection bias. You\u2019re trying to draw a conclusion about one population by sampling from a subset of that population and you want to know how close to random your subset is with respect to the thing you\u2019re trying to measure. The Santa Clara study recruited volunteers off of Facebook. The obvious source of sampling bias there is that people desperately want to get tested. The people that want it are, of course, people that think they\u2019ve had it. The other big piece is understanding the notion of positive predictive value and the way false positive and false negative error rates influence the estimate. And that depends on the incidence of infection in the population. If you have a test that has a 3% error rate, and the incidence in the population is below 3%, then most of the positives that you get are going to be false positives. And so you\u2019re not going to get a very tight estimate about how many people have it. This has been a real problem with the Santa Clara study. From my read of the paper, their data is actually consistent with nobody being infected. A New York City study on the other hand showed 21% seropositive, so even if there has a 3% error rate, the majority of those positives have to be true positives. Now that we\u2019ve all had a crash course in models and serosurveys, what are the other areas of science where it makes sense for the public to start getting educated on the terms of the debate? One that I think will come along sooner or later is interpreting studies of treatments. We\u2019ve dealt with that a little bit with the hydroxychloroquine business but not in any serious way because the hydroxychloroquine work has been pretty weak and the results have not been so positive. But there are ongoing tests of a large range of existing drugs. And these studies are actually pretty hard to do. There\u2019s a lot of subtle technical issues: what are you doing for controls? Is there a control arm at all? If not, how do you interpret the data? If there is a control arm, how is it structured? How do you control for the characteristics of the population on whom you\u2019re using the drug or their selection biases in terms of who\u2019s getting the drug? Unfortunately, given what we\u2019ve already seen with hydroxychloroquine, it\u2019s fairly likely that this will be politicized as well. There\u2019ll be a parallel set of issues that are going to come around with vaccination, but that\u2019s more like a year off. If you had the ability to arm every person with one tool \u2013 a statistical tool or scientific concept \u2013 to help them understand and contextualize scientific information as we look to the future of this pandemic, what would it be? I would like people to understand that there are interactions between the models we make, the science we do and the way that we behave. The models that we make influence the decisions that we take individually and as a society, which then feed back into the models and the models often don\u2019t treat that part explicitly. Once you put a model out there that then creates changes in behavior that pull you out of the domain that the model was trying to model in the first place. We have to be very attuned to that as we try to use the models for guiding policy. That\u2019s very interesting, and not what I expected you to say. What did you expect? That correlation does not imply causation. That\u2019s another very good one. Seasonality is a great example there. We\u2019re trying a whole bunch of things at the same time. We\u2019re throwing all kinds of possible solutions at this and lots of things are changing. It\u2019s remarkable to me actually, that so many US states are seeing the epidemic curve decrease. And so there\u2019s a bunch of possibilities there. It could be because people\u2019s behavior is changing. There could be some seasonality there. And there are other possible explanations as well. But what is really important is that just because the trend that you see is consistent with a story that someone\u2019s selling, there may be many other stories that are also consistent, so inferring causality is dangerous.

They have a relationship with the landlord, so I imagine that is a discussion they will have with the landlord to determine how much has the landlord been able to recoup and can that be offset against any loss of rent claim that\u2019s been made.</p> \n  <p><strong>Leigh:</strong> Are you encouraging your members to pursue tenants? </p> \n  <p><strong>Whelan:</strong> No, we\u2019re not encouraging them to do so, but it is up to individual insurers to make their own arrangements with their relationship with the landlord. But it\u2019s really again around community expectations as well. But <strong>they are contracts at the end of the day that have been entered into, and the insurers are abiding by those contracts and so too the tenants should be as well. </strong></p> \n  <p><strong>Leigh: </strong>It hardly seems in the spirit of things though. There\u2019s a range of rent moratoriums that are being put in place as a result of Covid-19. Landlords are suffering some of that pain, and are then turning to their insurer, and you\u2019re telling me you think it would be alright if the insurer then went back and sued the tenant?</p> \n  <p><strong>Whelan</strong>: No, what I\u2019m saying is they need to take into account the community expectations and the degree to which they\u2019re able to absorb that is really their own individual decisions. That\u2019s something that the company must take onboard themselves and decide themselves. It is down to the individual companies to make those decisions. We encourage and provide information to them, but at the end of the day it\u2019s an individual company decision to make. </p> \n  <p><strong>Leigh:</strong> I think we can be pretty sure about what the community sentiment would be on this. I\u2019m just surprised that the Insurance Council doesn\u2019t have an approach to it, that you\u2019re essentially taking this hands off, \u2018it\u2019s up to our members\u2019 approach to what could turn out to be quite a serious problem.</p> \n  <p><strong>Whelan: </strong>Well, I wouldn\u2019t quite characterise it like that. We do monitor the situation and feed back what we believe are the issues that insurers should be taking into account when they are making these sorts of decisions. So it\u2019s not that we\u2019re absent in this discussion. We are participants in it obviously, because we want to make sure that the industry\u2019s reputation is held high. So that\u2019s an expectation on our behalf. And there\u2019s also a code of practise, which they\u2019re expected to abide by, which goes to issues around financial hardship and people in vulnerable positions. And that has some quite strong requirements on those particular companies to be able to abide by that code of practise.

      "bodyText": "We will wrap up our Australian rolling coverage of Covid-19 developments now. Thank you for your company and correspondence. The Guardian\u2019s international liveblog continues here: In summation: The global death toll from Covid-19 has surpassed 211,000. There are more than 3.05m confirmed cases worldwide. Australia recorded just 12 new cases in the last 24 hours, and 100 in the past seven days. Australia has had a total of 6727 confirmed cases. 88 people have died in Australia from Covid-19, including four more deaths on Tuesday at Sydney\u2019s Newmarch House aged care home. More than 2.4m Australians have downloaded the government\u2019s Covidsafe app. The NRL has said it has confirmed it will start playing matches on May 28, resuming a 20-round season. The deteriorating relationship between Canberra and Beijing worsened further over Australia\u2019s proposal for an independent inquiry into China\u2019s handling of the Covid-19 outbreak. We will return tomorrow as this country, and this world, continues to grapple with the Covid-19 pandemic. All of you, stay well, and stay safe. Coles and Woolworths have both pulled the April-May 2020 edition of What Doctors Don\u2019t Tell You magazine from their stores, after concerns were raised about health conspiracy theories the magazine was promoting. Coles said it did not endorse the magazine\u2019s content, in a statement to 2GB radio station. \u201cWhat Coles was shown when they were originally shown the magazine is different content to what is in this edition. \u201cColes is removing it from all stories nationwide. We encourage everyone to listen to help authorities in regards to Covid-19.\u201d Woolworths said it appreciated its customers\u2019 concerns over the magazine. \u201cWe\u2019ve informed the supplier we\u2019ll be removing the magazine from sale. \u201cAs always, we would encourage our customers to seek and follow expert medical advice.\u201d President of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, Dr Harry Nespolon, told The Guardian he applauded the decision of Coles and Woolworths \u201cto exercise sound corporate responsibility\u201d. Doctors aren\u2019t keeping anything from you, we are working as hard as we can to help our patients every day. Now, more than ever, we need to heed expert medical advice and ignore pseudo-scientific nonsense and myths that will \u2018cure\u2019 Covid-19 and all else. I understand that people are anxious and suffering from information overload but please apply a \u2018sniff test\u2019 to information you are seeing on social media or supermarket shelves. Instead, listen to your local GP because expert advice matters and we are doing all we can to keep you safe and well. The high-profile promotion of unproven Covid-19 \u2018cures\u2019 has been problematic in Australia. Australian celebrity chef Pete Evans was fined $25,000 by the Therapeutic Goods Administration last week for claiming a \u201csubtle energy platform\u201d could be used to treat coronavirus. Evans was selling the BioCharger NG Subtle Energy Platform \u2013 dismissed by the Australian Medical Association as a \u201cfancy light machine\u201d \u2013 for $14,990 on his website. Evans\u2019 ad said the machine was a \u201csubtle energy revitalisation platform\u201d. Very subtle it seems. There is no evidence Covid-19 can be treated or cured by coloured lights. We\u2019ve been reporting extensively on the plight of those in Australia left out of the government\u2019s Covid-19 assistance packages, including hundreds of thousands of international students. Now, more than 300 Australians have offered to open their homes to international students struggling during the coronavirus crisis without government support. The Australian Homestay Network says more than 300 families have signed up in the past two weeks to become hosts of international students following a call-out. Founder David Bycroft says Australians have a responsibility to step up and look after the students, who aren\u2019t getting federal government support during the pandemic. \u201cThe prime minister has told international students to return home if they can\u2019t afford to support themselves but the reality of the situation is it isn\u2019t that simple,\u201d Bycroft said in a statement. \u201cFor many students, going home is not an option.\u201d There are more than 500,000 international students in Australia and many of them have lost their jobs during the pandemic. Some want to go home but can\u2019t due to the lack of flights, funds or border restrictions, while others have built lives and families in Australia. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, international education contributed $37.6bn to the economy in the 2018/19 financial year and employs 240,000 people. \u201cWhen you hear someone saying Australians need to be looked after first, they don\u2019t understand that international students actually support Australian livelihoods,\u201d Bycroft said. For a weekly fee of $160, students are provided with accommodation and three meals a day as part of the initiative. \u201cWe can connect vulnerable international students with Australian families who are willing and able to fulfil those needs, and help them get through these tough times,\u201d he said. As minds in Australia turn to the easing of Covid-19 restrictions, globally, there are concerns about the long-term ramifications of extended lockdowns. At least 15m more cases of domestic violence are predicted this year as a result of pandemic restrictions, according to new data that paints a bleak picture of life for women over the next decade. The UN population fund (UNFPA) has also calculated that tens of millions of women will not be able to access modern contraceptives this year, and millions more girls will undergo female genital mutilation or be married off by 2030. This story, from my colleague Liz Ford in London, makes for sobering reading. Tokyo 2020 president Yoshiro Mori says the Olympic Games, already postponed to 2021, would be \u201cscrapped\u201d if they could not take place next year. The International Olympic Committee and the Japanese government last month postponed the Games until July 2021 because of the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. With the epidemic\u2019s worldwide infection rate climbing and experts suggesting a vaccine is still a long way off, questions are being asked about whether the global sporting event might need to be delayed further. \u201cNo. In that case, the Olympics will be scrapped,\u201d Mori said in the interview with Japanese sports daily Nikkan Sports, when asked if the Games could be postponed again until 2022. However Yori, a former prime minister, remained confident they would go ahead in 2021. \u201cWe have delayed the Olympics until next summer after we will have won the battle,\u201d he was quoted as saying. \u201cThe Olympics would be much more valuable than any Olympics in the past if we could go ahead with it after winning this battle. We have to believe this otherwise our hard work and efforts will not be rewarded.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Justin McCurry, in Tokyo, has filed on just how difficult getting the games up next year will be. If the NRL restarts on May 28, it likely won\u2019t be the first footballing competition in the world to resume: Germany\u2019s Bundesliga is slated to return to competition on May 9, pending final approval from the German government. Germany is gradually easing social distancing restrictions, and the football league\u2019s proposal is to limit crowds to just 300 people (perhaps the Sheffield Shield can restart here). Australian Brandon Borrello plays for SC Freiburg in the Bundesliga. He spoke with the ABC here: A little more detail on the restarting of the NRL. The rugby league is the first major code in Australia to announce its resumption: others will no doubt be watching with bated breath. Australian Rugby League Commission Chair Peter V\u2019landys confirmed the restart late Tuesday afternoon \u201cafter extensive consultation with broadcast partners, clubs, and key stakeholders\u201d. Else: The first two rounds of the competition will be counted and the current competition ladder will be in place when games resume (this may be subject to prime ministerial appeal given the Sharks haven\u2019t won a game yet). The draw for the rest of the season will be worked out in coming weeks, along with the timing of the State of Origin (which Queensland will win, because... \u2018Queenslander\u2019, ahh Billy Moore, those were the days). The 2020 season will be 20 rounds, with the grand final on October 25. (Oh, and the first two rounds will count ... good news for some.) I am now handing over the blog to my colleague, Ben Doherty. Have a good evening, everyone. Anglicare has announced four more deaths at Newmarch House, taking the total number of deaths of residents who tested positive to coronavirus at the facility to 11. Anglicare Sydney is deeply saddened to advise that four residents from its Newmarch House residential aged care site, who had tested positive for Covid-19, have passed away since 8pm last night. We extend our deepest sympathies to these families for the losses they are experiencing. Anglicare was first informed of a Coronavirus outbreak at Newmarch House on Saturday 11 April. On the best advice available, we know that it will be some weeks before the home is clear of the virus. For those residents with a positive Covid-19 diagnosis, NSW Health has provided the support and guidance of Nepean Blue Mountains Local Area Health Network and an Infectious Diseases Specialist to ensure residents receive the best medical care possible. We have been provided with significant support from the Commonwealth Government. This is a tragic time not only for the families who have lost their loved ones but for other residents and families. It is also taking a deep toll on our staff who cared for and knew these residents and families so well. The Chinese embassy in Canberra has responded to reports about the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade raising the investigation of the source of Covid-19 with the ambassador. In a move clearly targeted at embarrassing the Morrison government, the statement claims Dfat has conceded it has no detail on the proposed investigation. A spokesperson said: I noticed relevant reports by Australian media, which are misleading. On 27 April, Ambassador Cheng Jingye took a phone call from DFAT Secretary Frances Adamson, I would like to highlight the content of their conversation as follows: Secretary Adamson firstly congratulated on and spoke highly of Wuhan\u2019s accomplishment that there is no longer any confirmed COVID-19 case, and appreciated the assistance rendered by the Chinese side on the purchase of medical supplies in China by eight Australian companies. Ambassador Cheng also recognized the progress achieved in Australia in fighting COVID-19 . Secretary Adamson tried her best to defend Australia\u2019s proposal about the independent review, saying the proposal neither has political motive nor targets China. She also admitted it is not the time to commence the review now and Australia has no details of the proposal. She further said that Australia does not want the matter to have any impact on Australia-China relationship. Ambassador Cheng elaborated clearly China\u2019s relevant position, stressing that no matter what excuses the Australian side has made, the fact can not be buried that the proposal is a political maneuver. Just as a western saying goes: Cry up wine and sell vinegar. Ambassador Cheng flatly rejected the concern expressed from the Australian side over his remarks during the recent AFR interview, and called on Australia to put aside ideological bias, stop political games and do more thing to promote the bilateral relations. Here\u2019s more on a third NRL player called in over alleged social distancing breaches. Good afternoon everyone. Just on the claims from Angus Taylor\u2019s office that there is a difference between accessing a report and downloading it, that\u2019s not entirely the case. The City of Sydney website itself refers to links of the annual report file as a \u201cdownload\u201d. While technically his office may not have right-clicked and saved the file, it would have still recorded the access of the document as a download \u2013 it would have made a copy of it on Taylor\u2019s or the staffer\u2019s computer, albeit not permanently. My computer, which has been the victim of not one, but two tea spills today is on 1%, so I shall hand you over to Josh Taylor for the next little while. Thanks again for joining me today. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow. As always, take care of you. The interim NRL CEO Andrew Abdo is holding a press conference on those proposed sanctions: The actions of our players that have come to light over the last couple of days have obviously been disappointing and we have decided we need to act swiftly and decisively at this point. It is important that at this difficult time that we all face, we are all under pressure and all face restrictions and we are all away from our usual circumstances whether that be people being away from work or kids having to school at home, whether it is us being away from our friends and families for a number of circumstances this is on all of us and our players are no different. They are role models in our society. We have bold and ambitious plans to return to the field as soon as we practically can and it is important that the players understand they are held to higher account. Social media has not been great for footballers Coles is lifting its purchase limits on toilet paper. We are pleased to be able to remove purchase limits at Coles on key household staples like toilet paper and paper towel, and expect to remove further limits as customer demand continues to stabilise and more categories see supply levels return to normal,\u201d a spokesperson said. Nature is beautiful. Australia\u2019s most popular premier (according to the most recent Newspoll) Mark McGowan is giving his daily update \u2013 after yesterday\u2019s public holiday polo, he is back in a suit. Today, McGowan is focused on schools: We\u2019ve got a soft start to schooling in Term 2 \u2013 a very cautious and considered approach. We\u2019re ensuring that, as school resumes, parents have choice as to whether or not to send their children \u2013 we\u2019re encouraging Year 11 and 12 to attend, and we\u2019re going to review it after the first three weeks to see if any changes, or what changes might be able to be made. It\u2019s a different way of starting school, and I\u2019d urge everyone across the community to be patient and understanding. This is a new way of doing things. We\u2019ve never been through a pandemic in our lifetimes. And the restart of schools is obviously a different experience for many people. I\u2019d just urge everyone to understand that there will be new rules in place, new requirements for hygiene and the like, and it\u2019s a time for everyone to go with it and work together and be understanding that it might not be easy, it might be difficult, but we\u2019re all in this together and we need to work together. So that\u2019s the way schools will resume. Energy minister Angus Taylor today continued to insist his office had not downloaded material used in a botched attack on Sydney lord mayor Clover Moore last September. Taylor is sticking to his statement of October 25 in which he rejected \u201coutrageous accusations made against me by the Labor Party\u201d. A spokesman for Taylor told Guardian Australia Tuesday there was a difference between a document being downloaded and being \u201caccessed\u201d. And the spokesman said the minister had not refused to be interviewed by NSW police, as suggested in news reports, but had cooperated throughout their inquiry into the affair. He said police had acknowledged this in their response to a question on notice from the NSW parliament. \u201cWe have always maintained that the report (containing exaggerated travel expenses for the council) wasn\u2019t downloaded,\u201d said the spokesman in a statement. \u201cAs per minister Taylor\u2019s statement on October 25 the report was accessed from the City of Sydney website and printed directly from the site, which evidence provided by the department in response to (federal parliament) questions on notice support.\u201d This had also been confirmed by NSW police, the spokesman said. This will be a big disappointment for a lot of people who are really, really hoping the government will change its mind and add them to the supplement list. For the record, the Guardian has approached Angus Taylor for comment and is yet to hear back Hot on the heels of Josh Addo-Carr and Latrell Mitchell\u2019s police fines for breaching social distancing regulations, another NRL star is under scrutiny with photos emerging of Nathan Cleary posing with a group of women. The photos, broadcast by the Nine Network, show the Panthers halfback with five other people, reportedly on Anzac Day. The State of Origin representative player reportedly said the group were his friends and stayed just a short time at his house before leaving. Cleary, the Nine report added, has apologised to his teammates and club but he could face sanctions with the AAP reporting the NRL is investigating the matter. Addo-Carr and Mitchell were fined $1,000 after photos showed them flouting physical distancing measures with a group of men on a farm at the weekend. ACT Health has put out its latest update \u2013 there are no new cases: There have been no new cases of Covid-19 recorded in the ACT in the past 24 hours. The ACT\u2019s total is still 106. A total of 101 cases have recovered from Covid-19 and have been released from self-isolation. There are currently no Covid-19 patients in Canberra hospitals. The remaining two (2) active cases are isolating at home with ACT Health support. The ACT has recorded three (3) deaths. The number of negative tests in the ACT is now 8242. The case that had been under investigation has now been classified as acquired overseas. The ACT now has no cases currently under investigation. Zoom had a bit of a bad reputation early on in the pandemic because of security concerns and people Zoombombing in, but Microsoft\u2019s version of the app, Teams, has now had its own problem, involving gifs. Teams has had a similar boom in usage in the past two months, with around 44 million active users on the service worldwide. Security researchers at Cyberark alerted the company last month that they were able to get control of Team users\u2019 accounts by sending them a gif. They would see the gif but wouldn\u2019t be aware it had made it possible for the person to take over their account. Microsoft patched the issue last week, but it is another reminder of the need for these video conferencing apps to be as secure as possible. Greg Hunt is asked about fake text messages: He says the AFP has been called in to investigate the hoax. Well, firstly, any misuse of telecommunications for a hoax is illegal. This case has already been referred to the federal police for investigation, and that investigation has begun, and anybody who is found responsible will be charged with a significant criminal offence. The second thing, though, is this is deeply unAustralian. At a moment when Australians have been coming together, when nearly 2.5 million Australians have downloaded and registered for the Covidsafe app, when Australians have been doing difficult things, to have a few people, or it may just be one person, who are doing something contrary to the public health messages, this isn\u2019t a game. This is about life and death. This is about saving lives and protecting lives. And so, whoever it is, they should be afraid of the law, because they are conducting a hoax which is about a very serious public health matter. But more than that, they should stop and think. It\u2019s no game, because the more people that are able to download and register, the more people who will be protected against inadvertently contracting a life-threatening disease. And that\u2019s my message to those who are at odds with the rest of the community. Stop, think, and don\u2019t do it. All right, I will thank everybody for their time. Also, just a point to keep in mind \u2013 Australia won\u2019t know for sure if all the measures have been successful or not until restrictions are relaxed and the nation avoids a second wave. I just need to check if Greg Hunt announced another death of someone who has been diagnosed with Covid-19. The evidence is that there had been 12 cases identified in the 24 hours to 6.30am this morning. That includes the fact that most significantly there was only one case from an unknown source. Only one case of community transmission across Australia. That is perhaps the most important figure I have had the privilege of raising since coming into this role and dealing with the coronavirus issue. It means that as a country we are not just flattening the curve but we are consolidating it, extending it and securing it. So the flattening of the curve has been consolidated, extended and secured. We have had now 100 cases in seven days and there are 6,727 cases reported to me by the national incidence centre and 85 lives lost, very sadly, shortly before coming to you. In terms of capacity we now have, in regards to our support for primary care and others, 75m masks have arrived in Australia and I am pleased to announce today 500,000 for the disability sector. As of 12.30pm today, 2.4 million Australians have downloaded the covid tracing app. The health minister is giving an update on the nation\u2019s \u201csentinel testing\u201d regime: I have a number of things to talk about in relation to the coronavirus update for Australia. Firstly that testing is critical to our success as a nation. We have been identified by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine as the most accurate testing nation of the 83 nations around the world which they have considered and we have one of the broadest testing regimes in the world. Critical to that is the combination of public and private respiratory clinics. This Rosebud clinic will be the 308th public clinic in Australia and that is a mixture of state and territory and commonwealth respiratory clinics. All are funded either in whole or in part by the commonwealth and together with the states we are pleased that these clinics have been able to provide support for Australians around the country. Testing allows us to identify patients and to find those people who may have been in contact with somebody that has been diagnosed. It is fundamental to saving and protecting lives. Mark Butler spoke about Angus Taylor this morning: Overnight, we have learned that when the New South Wales police sought an interview with Mr Taylor he refused that request and insisted that the police only deal with his lawyers. Also, we\u2019ve learned that New South Wales police have concluded in their analysis of the metadata surrounding the Sydney City Council\u2019s annual report that it was not downloaded by Minister Taylor\u2019s office. So, if any further evidence was required, it is now beyond any doubt that Angus Taylor has lied to the Australian people and misled the Australian parliament about the origin of this dodgy document that he circulated. Now I know this is very far from the front of people\u2019s minds during this unprecedented health crisis. But now more than ever, it is important that Australians be able to trust what their government says. And, at a time when millions of Australians are facing unprecedented pressure on their incomes and on their job security, it is simply unacceptable that Angus Taylor be able to hold his job and draw his salary as a minister of the crown when it is clearly beyond doubt he has failed to tell the truth to the Australian people. At a time when trust is more important than ever it is critically important that a minister who has been shown to tell lies to the Australian people and mislead the Australian parliament not be able to continue to hold his job. Chris Knaus has the latest on the story: Taylor has repeatedly insisted that the false document he used to wrongly attack Moore for her travel-related emissions was downloaded from the council\u2019s own website. The document Taylor relied upon was an altered version of the council\u2019s annual report, purporting to show the lord mayor had spent more than $15m on travel. The figures in Taylor\u2019s copy of the annual report were grossly inaccurate. The expenditure was actually about $6,000. Taylor has said he downloaded the document from the council\u2019s website in early September before providing it to the Daily Telegraph, which subsequently ran a piece attacking Moore\u2019s travel expenditure and associated emissions. ...NSW police referred the matter to the Australian federal police in December. The AFP considered the matter but did not investigate because it \u201cdetermined it is unlikely further investigation will result in obtaining sufficient evidence to substantiate a commonwealth offence\u201d. NSW police have also now revealed that none of the IP addresses for users who downloaded the annual report from the council\u2019s website between 6 September and 9 September belonged to Taylor or his office. \u201cNone of the IP addresses were situated in Minister Taylor\u2019s office,\u201d it said. The latest department of health update is out: On perspective, a colleague just showed me this: Perspective really can be everything: Simon Birmingham is up and speaking about the growing tensions between Australia and Beijing\u2019s ambassador, after the ambassador told the Australian Financial Review on Monday that Chinese consumers may rethink purchasing Australian products if Australia continues pursuing an independent inquiry into the origins of coronavirus and China\u2019s response. Australia\u2019s foreign affairs secretary Frances Adamson has officially expressed the government\u2019s displeasure through diplomatic channels. Birmingham says Australia won\u2019t back down: The government has made our views known, and made them clear. And we will continue to advocate for there to be a transparent global inquiry into the cause and management of Covid-19 so that we can minimise the risk of a repeat in the future, and we want to work with every country in terms of the application of such an inquiry, and we would hope that China \u2013 like any other country around the world \u2013 would see the merits in understanding how the world can be better prepared in the future to prevent and manage any such outbreak were one to occur again. The Royal Australian College of GPs has responded to the hydroxychloroquine claims: RACGP president Dr Harry Nespolon: We simply don\u2019t know if hydroxychloroquine can cure Covid-19, trials are ongoing and my understanding is that they are not looking particularly promising. We need to rely on definitive scientific evidence to determine whether this drug can be used to combat this virus. The problem here is that people may think that a cure is imminent and be lulled into a false sense of security so that they don\u2019t exercise social distancing responsibilities. Another issue is that off-label use of this medicine can have significant consequences for those who are normally prescribed the drug but who may currently not be able to access it due to inappropriate use reducing stock levels. We need to ensure there is stock available for those who need it. Please listen to the medical experts, including your local GP, on how best to handle this pandemic, not Clive Palmer.\u201d This is interesting Temporary visa holders have been one of the groups who have missed out on any assistance from the government during this pandemic, leaving individual jurisdictions to fill the gap. This is the ACT\u2019s contribution: Temporary visa holders and international students affected by Covid-19 who are ineligible for commonwealth assistance programs, will be able to access more support through a $450,000 ACT government support package. Minister for multicultural affairs and minister for tertiary education, Chris Steel, today announced a partnership between the ACT government and the ACT Refugee, Asylum Seeker and Humanitarian (Rash) Coordination Committee, the Australian Red Cross and local tertiary institutions. ... Under the new funding package, the Rash coordination committee \u2013 made up of groups working with asylum seekers including Companion House \u2013 will receive $140,000 to provide urgent support to asylum seekers living in Canberra. The Australian Red Cross will also see an extension to their existing emergency support program, receiving $160,000 to assist other temporary visa holders including people on temporary work visas and safe haven enterprise visas. The Red Cross will also work with tertiary institutions to provide $150,000 in ACT government support to international students who have been impacted by Covid-19 and fallen on to financial hardship. What we know about east coast schools: NSW: staggered return from 11 May. Queensland: review pupil-free school mandate around 15 May. Victoria: Pupil-free school mandate likely to stay in place until at least June, while increased community testing is carried out. Meghan Quinn, deputy secretary of the macroeconomic group, told the Covid-19 inquiry that around 160,000 people applied for jobseeker between 21 March and the end of that month. Labor\u2019s Murray Watt, seizes on that to argue that 160,000 people lost their jobs after restrictions on pubs bars and other businesses and the announcement of jobkeeper, on 30 March. Quinn replied \u201cthat\u2019s correct\u201d but argued that jobkeeper has already boosted consumer and business confidence. Earlier, Jenny Wilkinson defended the month gap between jobkeeper\u2019s announcement on 30 March and the government reimbursing employers on 1 May. She said it took \u201ctwo weeks to land the rules and two weeks for employers to apply\u201d which \u201cwas in our mind the earliest we could roll out a program like this\u201d. That exchange finished with this: Andrew Leigh: Can you see any situation in which a tenant was unable to pay, the landlord claimed on insurance policy and it was then within reasonable community expectations that the insurance company went back and sued the tenant for the unpaid rent? Robert Whelan: Well, I think the typical situation with insurers in that situation is that they treat each case on its merits and encourage individuals to come to them to talk through the circumstances in which they find themselves. And that\u2019s something that I think all insurers are doing increasingly, is to treat things on a case-by-case basis. And I think that\u2019s the only way, because it\u2019s a fairly hypothetical situation. Admittedly, it could happen. But at the end of the day, those individual decisions need to be taken into account for individual circumstances at the time. So I think that\u2019s really up to the insurer to determine that, find that out and engage in that conversation. Over in the insurance committee hearing, Labor\u2019s Andrew Leigh has asked whether insurance agents for landlords will chase tenants who have not paid their rent during the Covid crisis. The from the Insurance Council\u2019s Head of Risk and Operations Karl Sullivan and council CEO Robert Whelan is not overly reassuring: Leigh: Now as the crisis passes, the insurers will in legal terms be able to recover the unpaid rent from tenants. Is it your understanding that Insurance Council members will seek to pursue tenants for unpaid rent under these situations? Sullivan: That is a matter for individual insurers, but they don\u2019t have a relationship necessarily with the tenant. They have a relationship with the landlord, so I imagine that is a discussion they will have with the landlord to determine how much has the landlord been able to recoup and can that be offset against any loss of rent claim that\u2019s been made. Leigh: Are you encouraging your members to pursue tenants? Whelan: No, we\u2019re not encouraging them to do so, but it is up to individual insurers to make their own arrangements with their relationship with the landlord. But it\u2019s really again around community expectations as well. But they are contracts at the end of the day that have been entered into, and the insurers are abiding by those contracts and so too the tenants should be as well. Leigh: It hardly seems in the spirit of things though. There\u2019s a range of rent moratoriums that are being put in place as a result of Covid-19. Landlords are suffering some of that pain, and are then turning to their insurer, and you\u2019re telling me you think it would be alright if the insurer then went back and sued the tenant? Whelan: No, what I\u2019m saying is they need to take into account the community expectations and the degree to which they\u2019re able to absorb that is really their own individual decisions. That\u2019s something that the company must take onboard themselves and decide themselves. It is down to the individual companies to make those decisions. We encourage and provide information to them, but at the end of the day it\u2019s an individual company decision to make. Leigh: I think we can be pretty sure about what the community sentiment would be on this. I\u2019m just surprised that the Insurance Council doesn\u2019t have an approach to it, that you\u2019re essentially taking this hands off, \u2018it\u2019s up to our members\u2019 approach to what could turn out to be quite a serious problem. Whelan: Well, I wouldn\u2019t quite characterise it like that. We do monitor the situation and feed back what we believe are the issues that insurers should be taking into account when they are making these sorts of decisions. So it\u2019s not that we\u2019re absent in this discussion. We are participants in it obviously, because we want to make sure that the industry\u2019s reputation is held high. So that\u2019s an expectation on our behalf. And there\u2019s also a code of practise, which they\u2019re expected to abide by, which goes to issues around financial hardship and people in vulnerable positions. And that has some quite strong requirements on those particular companies to be able to abide by that code of practise. And that\u2019s entered into voluntarily by Insurance Council members and they are required to abide by, they are held accountable \u2026 Treasury official, Robert Jeremenko, has had a go at Industry Super Australia for quoting a \u201csignificantly larger\u201d estimate of the impact of withdrawing superannuation early than government figures. Liberal James Paterson said the ISA is advising a 30-year-old withdrawing $20,000 from super will see a $97,000 hit to their retirement income, whereas Asic\u2019s Moneysmart website suggests it is $43,000. Jeremenko explains the \u201cmajor reason\u201d for the discrepancy is that ISA has used nominal figures rather than real. He said: \u201cThose figures that ISA quote do not use today\u2019s dollars. That is inconsistent with what Asic has told super funds, the advice they have provided to anyone who is making statements about the impact [of super withdrawals].\u201d Jeremenko said it makes more \u201cintuitive sense\u201d and is more \u201cappropriate\u201d to use \u201ctoday\u2019s dollars\u201d to estimate the effect of the withdrawal at some point in the future. Jeremenko said using nominal figures \u201cgives a larger [perceived] hit to retirement balances\u201d but doesn\u2019t comment on ISA\u2019s motives. New Zealanders can once again order takeaway, with the country moving into its level three restrictions \u2013 which is essentially what most of Australia is under now. Jacinda Ardern says 75% of the economy will be back up running again under the lessening of restrictions: So with more people going back to work today, we need to be even more vigilant at level three to prevent any inadvertent spreading of the virus. We must continue to stay home where possible, including for work and education. Please stay regional and limit non-essential travel, even though you can expand your bubble keep it as small as possible and exclusive. Finally, if you are sick, stay home, and contact your GP or health line and get tested. It may feel like a minor symptom to you but that could be a significant issue for all of us. What level three does represent is a move towards getting the economy moving again, getting more New Zealanders back to work and opening more of our businesses. Businesses restarting at level three will see 400,000 more New Zealanders back at work, taking the total to 1 million kiwis working. New Zealand has paid out $10bn in wage subsidies. Jenny Wilkinson said there are a \u201cnumber of integrity measures\u201d administered by the ATO to prevent rorting of jobkeeper. One is that employers have to pay employees before they receive payment from the government. Another is the ATO commissioner\u2019s power to declare that a business practice is a \u201ccontrived scheme\u201d \u2013 allowing them to disqualify a business or require them to refund money to the ATO. The ATO will also check historical GST data to ensure the business meets the revenue downturn test. Wilkinson says employers are required to pay $1,500 fortnightly to employees, and employees can use a dedicated ATO hotline to complain if they are not being paid the full amount. Wilkinson also noted that an employer\u2019s decision to participate in jobkeeper \u201cdoes not remove the need to continue to follow unfair dismissal laws\u201d. Westpac will take a $2.2bn hit from the coronavirus crisis, the bank has told the stock exchange. The provisions come on top of a $1.4bn hit dealing with a lawsuit against it by financial intelligence agency Austrac and customer refunds, that Westpac announced just a fortnight ago. That brings the total new chief executive Peter King has carved off half-year results due to be announced next week to $3.6bn. The move also increases the chances Westpac will follow the lead of fellow big four bank and raise fresh capital at the same time as it brings out the half-year results. It\u2019s not unusual for new chief executives to take big hits to the bottom line in their first year in the job \u2013 it\u2019s a way of clearing the decks and drawing a line between the new regime and the old. However, the coronavirus crisis has forced King to take a much bigger hit than usual. Jenny Wilkinson, the deputy secretary of Treasury\u2019s fiscal group, has told the inquiry that 762,000 Australians have applied for early access to superannuation, 757,000 have been approved and $6.3bn is approved for release. So doing some quick maths, that means on average people are withdrawing $8,322 (out of a maximum of $10,000 this financial year) from their accounts. Wilkinson said that individuals have to tell the ATO the grounds on which they are applying for early release, and they self-identify as eligible. The ATO then applies its \u201cstandard audit and assurance processes\u201d, for example if an individual said they are eligible because they\u2019re accessing jobseeker, the ATO would check that. But that checking happens after the fact, not \u201cahead of providing an indication funds should be released\u201d because \u201cthe intention is to provide streamlined, rapid access\u201d, she said. This is just the first round \u2013 eligible people can access up to $10,000 in the next financial year as well. The cost at the back end of this policy, in terms of when people go to retire, does not seem to have been calculated as yet. This is the email the Ku-ring-gai chamber of commerce has sent to its members today. It alerts businesses that they can\u2019t coerce people to download the app. But as you\u2019ll see, the chamber is not happy about that. At all. Dear Business Owner Re Covidsafe app Yesterday you received an email suggesting that you do not permit entry to your business to someone that has not downloaded the covidsafe app. From feedback I received , I have hunted down the document that regulates the use of this app. Here is the link https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2020L00480. It is a Determination made by the Minister of Health. It says at the end that a person is not to coerce the use of the app in any way. The determination heading includes the words Emergency Requirements. This determination hardly makes the use of the app a requirement and certainly does not solve the Covid-19 emergency. The Minister of Health thus has wimped out on his duty to protect the population. In fact he should have ordered Apple and Android to compulsorily down load the app to all phones in Australia. To quote Peter Fitzsimons in the Sun Herald as Barnaby Joyce is against the app then \u201cBarnaby is usually so wrong\u201d. The government forced businesses to close and even had the police chase sunbathers down the beach. They should be using the same force to open up again. Except for the 83 Australians that have sadly died from the virus, business and its employees have borne the brunt of the fight against the virus. It is now time to help businesses to open and the covidsafe app is our best tool. The government says that they need 40% take up to make it a success. That is 10 million out of a population of about 25 million. 2 million have already downloaded the app in a day. Business needs to encourage (rather than coerce) another 8 million to download the app so that we can open our businesses again and start employing the over 1 million Australians that were thrown out of work. Get the app and lets get back to business Yours sincerely, Peter Vickers BSc BEc FCA Secretary Westpac has announced about $2bn in writedowns. Ben Butler will be telling you more about that soon. I had a chat to Peter Vickers from the Ku-ring-gai chamber of commerce this morning, after I was sent this: He says he has sent another message to businesses alerting them to the determination of the health minister, that no one can be coerced into downloading the Covid tracing app, or denied entry into businesses for not having it on their phone. But he doesn\u2019t seem happy about it, saying that council workers and police are still roaming beaches and parks to ensure social distancing measures are in place, but businesses can\u2019t check on the app. For the record, the app doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have Covid-19 \u2013 it is just a way of helping health authorities trace those you may have been in contact with if you do, or if you were in contact with someone who does (if you are with them for longer than 15 minutes) and even with restrictions slowly being relaxed, businesses are still responsible for ensuring physical distance rules apply in their storefronts, which means no more than one person per four square metres. But no one can make you download the app if you choose not to, and no one can deny you entry to a store if you don\u2019t have the app. Treasury officials have revealed that some 540,000 employers have formally registered for the jobkeeper wage subsidy scheme, covering an estimated 3.3m employees. Peter Whish-Wilson questioned why businesses have to stump up the $1,500 fortnightly payments in April before jobkeeper flows in May \u2013 was this a practical constraint or an integrity measure. Kennedy replied: \u201cIt\u2019s both.\u201d Kennedy said the take-up numbers are \u201cbroadly on track\u201d with estimates of 6m employees being covered. Other officials note the timeframe for businesses to make payments has been extended to 8 May and a number of changes to expand eligibility were unveiled on Friday. Nationals senator Perin Davey has been asking about trade with China, and whether Australia\u2019s economy will diversify or revert to type in resuming reliance on China. Kennedy replied: I think a diversification of supply chains happens naturally when we see this type of shock. We see it even in the way businesses responded to the Asian financial crisis ... in the late 1990s. Australia diversified exports to North America and other countries. When business see that they are shocked, they take up other opportunities.\u201d However, Kennedy noted it is \u201cvaluable to the Australian economy to be complementary to Chinese growth\u201d, citing the iron ore, metallurgical coal prices and export levels. He concluded Australia will both diversify and continue trade with China. \u201cThere is great economic return to Australia in continuing to support China\u2019s economic development and growth.\u201d Under Greens questioning, Kennedy said Treasury is not currently working on an assistance package for the arts and entertainment industries, and breweries, but he notes that line agencies may be. The federal parliament will return next month for a \u201ctrial\u201d after it was adjourned until August during the beginning of the Covid-19 response. With Australia\u2019s suppression rate of the virus ahead of where authorities thought it would be, that could see parliament return, as normal, a lot earlier. The 12 May sitting is one of the first steps towards that. The Centre for Public Integrity has written a briefing paper on how parliaments should sit, even if things get dicey again: The paper finds that there are examples of parliaments adapting their procedures to fit with video conference technologies, and that this could be done at a commonwealth level in line with the requirements of the Australian constitution: Constitutional requirements that parliament sit in the \u201cseat of government\u201d could be met by a core group of ministers and MPs sitting in Canberra and hosting others by video conference. The quorum of attendance of parliament outlined in the constitution could be adapted by each House to include online attendance. Wales, Scotland and the UK parliaments are holding online questions and statements, and the Welsh assembly and the European Council are trialing online voting. The UK hybrid model of online and in person attendance could meet Australian constitutional requirements and allow for greater participation of all elected representatives. Victoria will not be following New South Wales in easing some restrictions on Friday, despite Victoria having fewer confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths than its northern counterpart. NSW will allow people to have two visitors into their homes from Friday, but Victoria will keep its limits in place until May 11. Premier Daniel Andrews told reporters the situation was \u201cfragile\u201d and he didn\u2019t want to ease up restrictions too early and then be forced to bring them back in. He said the 100,000 tests for the virus over the next fortnight would give the state \u201coptions\u201d in easing restrictions but he indicated those options would not be considered until after the testing had been completed. Labor\u2019s Katy Gallagher has probed when Treasury started work on the economic stimulus/support packages, and whether Kennedy was aware more restrictions were coming on 22 March, given the second stimulus package was announced that morning. Kennedy replied it started work on 1 March, and work was continuous from then. He confirms he was aware further restrictions were coming, defending the delay until 30 March for the government to unveil the $130bn jobkeeper wage subsidy program, by noting the second package did contain income support measures. \u201cIt is an open question whether we should have advised on more extensive wage subsidy arrangements ... [sooner],\u201d he said. Kennedy argued there are advantages to not being first \u2013 because Treasury could study other countries\u2019 wage subsidy packages to ensure it didn\u2019t create an incentive to stand people down. When Gallagher probed the fact just $10bn has been distributed so far \u2013 with three times that amount to come in the next month \u2013 Kennedy replied \u201cI would regard that as a rapid payment of money\u201d. \u201cI think, from an administrative perspective, I\u2019m incredibly impressed with ATO and Services Australia [in distributing funds].\u201d You can find Steven Kennedy\u2019s whole opening statement, here. Dr Steven Kennedy says Treasury began working on the Australian response to this, from the economic point of view, on the first of March. The first economic package (since superseded several times over) was announced on 12 March. \u201cTo be honest, we never stopped working on the response from the day we started because it was unfolding,\u201d he said. The Treasury secretary, Dr Steven Kennedy, is delivering his opening statement to the Covid-19 Senate committee looking at Australia\u2019s response. He offers up some data \u2013 none of it good and all of it pointing to just how hard the next few years will be: In Australia new real-time ABS data show in accommodation and food and arts and recreation services, the number of jobs fell by 25%, 6% and 18. 7% respectively over the three weeks between 14 March and 4 April. In the June quarter, we expect to see the unemployment rate rise to around 10%. Unemployment rose to higher levels in the Great Depression, but it did that over the course of a couple of years. These movements are happening in just a couple of months. We have never seen an economic shock of this speed, magnitude and shape and reflecting this is a significant and demand shock. The supply of goods and services has been badly disrupted by the necessary social distance measures. Demand is being reduced by the associated loss in income and profits and loss of confidence. Australian governments have substantially lessened the economic impact of the social distance measures by acting decisively and early. Two people in Victoria have been diagnosed with Covid-19 in the last 24 hours. Sorry for the incorrect figures on Queensland a little bit ago \u2013 they have no new cases \u2013 I am watching a lot of press conferences at once, and the way the information is now being presented is a little haphazard because it is no longer those big numbers we had been seeing just a couple of weeks ago. Which is good news. Those insurance council updates are coming through to you now that they have the sound working, because teleconference dramas are now part of our daily lives. Insurance Council of Australia witnesses have said that landlords have made 3,000 claims for loss of rent due to Covid-19 so far. The ICA said that \u201cnearly all\u201d insurers have adjusted the triggers for claims so that an eviction notice or notice of arrears is no longer required \u2013 an important step given the national cabinet has agreed on a six-month moratorium on evictions. Instead, they\u2019re accepting application forms for government relief programs as evidence of tenants in distress. The ICA said it reminds its members of \u201ccommunity expectations\u201d but doesn\u2019t punish them if they don\u2019t adjust their policies, and nor does it advise them not to sue tenants in arrears for lost rent. Robert Whelan noted that insurers abide by their contracts and \u201cso too should tenants\u201d. Decisions to sue a tenant for rent in arrears are made on a \u201ccase-by-case basis\u201d. Queensland has reported no new people with Covid-19 in the last 24 hours. Liberal senator James Paterson was on Sky News this morning, where he was also asked about China\u2019s \u201cthreats\u201d. It\u2019s certainly inappropriate for a diplomat credentialed here in Australia to represent his country to threaten us with economic sanctions or consequences because we are simply pursuing what is in our national interest and frankly, what\u2019s in the interests of the whole world. I mean, who would not want to get to the bottom of the exact origins of the virus? We know it originated in Wuhan, but we don\u2019t know exactly how. I think it\u2019s in the interest of the entire world, in the interest of combating this in the future that we know exactly how it came about. It\u2019s very concerning that the Chinese Communist party thinks it\u2019s inappropriate that Australia would call for such a thing and thinks that it\u2019s completely fine for them to threaten us with economic consequences. Robert Whelan, the chief executive of the Insurance Council of Australia, is giving evidence to the house economics committee about what he called the \u201cworst natural disaster season on record\u201d. In his opening statement, Whelan said Australians made $4.6bn of insurance claims since September above and beyond the normal level of claims, some 242,000 claims for damage to family homes, small businesses, cars and belongings. Of that, some $2.26bn of claims related to the Black Summer bushfires, in which some communities were \u201cvirtually wiped out\u201d. Whelan also noted the \u201csevere summer hail storms\u201d that hit Canberra particularly hard. Whelan said insurers support the aims of and are responding to the recommendations of the Hayne royal commission, but adds that it found \u201cno systemic issues with general insurance industry\u201d (earlier, he noted the ICA does not cover the life insurance or private health insurance industries). Clive Palmer took out a three-page ad today, boasting about buying 32,900,000 doses of hydroxychloroquine because he is Clive Palmer and Australia has a Donald Trump-sized hole he loves to do his best to fill. A friend of the blog alerted me to this discussion on Melbourne radio 3AW. Infectious disease experts are not into it. For the record, research is being carried out, but so far, it has been found not to be an effective treatment. Also, DO NOT undergo any drug treatment without talking to a doctor. I know I shouldn\u2019t have to say that, but then again, we know people have started injecting themselves with disinfectant so you can never be too careful. Here is the whole program for that Senate committee hearing today. The select Senate committee which was set up to examine the government\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic will meet again today. Treasury is the main guest. Paul Karp will be watching that for you. Malcolm Farr has the latest Essential poll. The usual poll caveats apply. For those who were asking, this is what Anthony Albanese had to say about Mike Kelly\u2019s future when the Labor leader was asked on ABC radio this morning: Fran Kelly: Just finally, Anthony Albanese, there\u2019s many reports that the Labor member in Eden Monaro, Mike Kelly, is about to retire from parliament for ill health. Has he told you he is retiring? Albanese: Look, he is dealing with some health issues, there is no secret in that. And he is not the only member of parliament who has been dealing with health issues in recent times on both sides of the House. And it\u2019s important at times like that, that people\u2019s privacy and their capacity to deal with those health issues is dealt with. Kelly: Are you preparing for a byelection in Eden-Monaro? Albanese: What I\u2019m preparing for is parliament coming back in May. And in terms of Mike Kelly\u2019s health issues, they are well-known. They actually arise from his service in the defence force and his exposure that occurred whilst serving our nation overseas. And that\u2019s deserving of respect and deserving of something better than speculation which has been around for the last year also about Mike Kelly. Swimmers were also back in the water at Bronte and Bondi in Sydney\u2019s east. NSW police have confirmed that NRL players Josh Addo-Carr and Latrell Mitchell are being investigated for firearm breaches after the pair went camping with a group, breaking social distancing rules, and then posted about it on social media. Among those social media posts was the pair shooting firearms. So that is the next investigation. NSW police said everyone was being \u201cvery cooperative\u201d though. So there is that. But Anthony Albanese says Labor does hold common ground with the government when it comes to pushing back against China\u2019s threats of consumer retribution to get Australia to back off its calls for an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus, and China\u2019s response. Marise Payne has said Australia will not be cowed by threats of economic coercion. Albanese agrees: I certainly agree with the government\u2019s position on this. This is something that\u2019s certainly not a partisan issue. I think that not just the government, but I think Australians who are currently social distancing, who are not being able to undertake their normal activity in life, have a right to know exactly what happened here. And it\u2019s not just a matter of an academic exercise of someone writing a thesis. This is so that it never happens again. And that\u2019s why we have strongly supported the recommendations not just for an investigation into how this occurred, but also that a body, the obvious one is the World Health Organization, to be given the power to be able to go to a nation state and make inspections in a similar way to which weapons inspectors are empowered to do so. This has had a devastating impact on lives, but also on economies. And it\u2019s important that we do whatever we can to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. And I would have thought that China, along with every nation in the world, has an interest in achieving that. Some heartwarming pictures are coming from Bondi this morning of surfers reclaiming their waves. You can tell the eye of the (first and hopefully only) storm is passing because politics is starting to return to normal. And normal in Australia means we are talking about Angus Taylor. Here was Anthony Albanese on the ABC this morning: Well, one question that would be good, or one answer, more importantly, which is, \u201cWhere did the document come from that Angus Taylor or his office gave to a publication newspaper, the Daily Telegraph, that was a fraudulent document?\u201d He knows where it came from. He has told parliament that it was downloaded from the City of Sydney website. We know that isn\u2019t true. The police have confirmed that is not true. There is no evidence that it was downloaded from that site. And he should just say where it came from. This is, quite frankly, absurd that this has gone on for so long. And if he won\u2019t do it, the prime minister must make him come clean to parliament. Lying to parliament is a very serious offence. And we can\u2019t have a circumstance whereby it is just swept away like it didn\u2019t happen. Gladys Berejiklian on the NSW changes: So the biggest change from Friday for most people is that two adults can go and visit another household. Please, please do that responsibly. We trust everybody to do it responsibly. Don\u2019t take risks. We don\u2019t want to see the numbers suddenly spike up because people are being irresponsible. And I\u2019m absolutely confident that people will be responsible, because there\u2019s too much at stake. I anticipate during May, we will see more cases and that\u2019s because when you increase activity, when you see people move around more frequently, you will see more cases but the health system will be able to cope with that because we\u2019ve used this time during April to build up the capacity get the extra PPE and to make sure that we\u2019re ready, whether it\u2019s in schools, whether it\u2019s people going shopping or whether it\u2019s people now visiting houses two adults at a time. We\u2019ll make sure that we have those provisions in place. NSW Health has recorded five new cases since the last announcement. That is from 4,112 tests. NSW wants to get to 8,000 tests a day. Gladys Berejiklian says there will be a staged approach to bringing back schools but, from mid-term, schools should be back to on-site learning. That matches what Queensland has indicated it will be doing \u2013 its schools will be pupil-free until 22 May, with a decision on returns to be made in the week of 15 May, which is mid-term for that state. Victoria is still to announce its concrete return plan. Berejiklian: It will be staged for the initial fortnight, and then based on those results, we\u2019ll be able to update the community on how quickly we can have full-time attendance. Again, that will be based on how things go, but we\u2019re hopeful that students will be getting full time face-to-face teaching during and definitely by the end of term two. Berejiklian also says NSW will relax some of its physical restriction rules: From May 1, on Friday, two adults will be able to go and visit anybody else in their home on the basis of care, on the basis of reducing socialisation and everybody\u2019s mental health. We know that for many people, they\u2019ve been cooped up in their homes for a number of weeks, and with the exception of exercising, medical needs or buying what they need to or going to work, many people have been isolated in their homes. So please know that from Friday, two adults can go and visit anyone else, and I\u2019ve used the word \u201cadults\u201d to say, obviously, if you have young children, it\u2019s OK to take them with you. But a maximum of two adults will be able to visit anybody else. But I do want to stress that if you\u2019re visiting someone who is over 70 years of age, or someone with a comorbidity, you have to practice really good social distancing. If you have the mildest sniffle, do not go and visit anybody. If you\u2019re feeling slightly unwell or fatigued, don\u2019t risk it. On whether or not Mike Kelly will announce his retirement (Kelly has been unwell for sometime, after suffering severe dehydration while serving in the Middle East), sparking a byelection Labor is in no way guaranteed to win, Anthony Albanese says Kelly deserves privacy to make his own decisions about his future. Anthony Albanese is speaking to Fran Kelly on ABC radio about this story: He says Labor will pursue it in parliament, and while the doctored documents have not been the opposition\u2019s focus during the pandemic response, questions still need to be asked. Albanese says trust is a fundamental underpinning of Australia\u2019s democracy. Josh Frydenberg and Mathias Cormann will make a statement to parliament about the impact on the economy from the coronavirus measures: Given the high degree of uncertainty around the economic impact of the coronavirus on the domestic and international economies, last month the Government took a decision to release the 2020-21 Budget on 6 October 2020. In the interim, the Government has continued to provide updates on the fiscal position through the release of the Australian Government General Government Sector Monthly Financial Statements. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) is also releasing additional and more frequent information to enhance understanding of the social and economic impacts of the coronavirus. Building on these updates, the Treasurer will provide a Ministerial Statement to the House of Representatives and the Minister for Finance to the Senate on 12 May 2020. The statement will outline the impact of the coronavirus on the economy and the Government\u2019s actions to date. The Government will also provide an economic update on the economic and fiscal outlook in June, following the release of the March quarter National Accounts. The Morrison government will give $95m to zoos, wildlife parks and aquariums suffering from the downturn in tourism owing to Covid-19. Although privately operated zoos are eligible for wage subsidies, the tourism minister, Simon Birmingham, has cited their high operating costs caring for animals as the reason for the government to turn from jobkeeper to zookeeper. Under the plan, exhibiting zoos, aquariums and wildlife sanctuaries can apply for payments of up to $1m. The bailout package comes from a $1bn relief and recovery fund for sectors disproportionately affected by Covid-19 administered by Michael McCormack\u2019s infrastructure and regional development department. The fund has paid to underwrite commercial airlines ($198m), supported smaller regional airlines ($100m) and provided air freight to agriculture and fishery industries ($110m). Birmingham said: This will be a lifeline for these popular tourism attractions across Australia who have had many of their revenue streams dry up during this crisis. It\u2019s absolutely crucial our iconic zoos and aquariums can still operate on the other side and play a major role in helping our tourism industry to recover from this. We know our world-class zoos and aquariums are major tourism drawcards for many our major cities and regional centres across Australia, with over 20 million visitors walking through the gates each year. We also shouldn\u2019t underestimate the huge positive flow-on effects our zoos and aquariums provide to our economy. They bring thousands of visitors into communities who then spend millions of dollars visiting other attractions, sleeping in our hotels and dining in our restaurants. Apparently zoos can face costs of up to $500,000 to maintain a large chimpanzee exhibit, such as at Taronga zoo in Sydney, or Monarto zoo in South Australia. A large herd of elephants at a zoo like Melbourne or Western Plains will eat more than $100,000 in hay a year. A single lion needs about $250 in red meat a week, or $13,000 worth of red meat in a year. Anglicare has just announced the death of a seventh resident from its western Sydney Newmarch House facility: Anglicare Sydney is saddened to announce the death of a resident at Newmarch House last night, who had tested positive for COVID-19. The family has been contacted as have all relevant authorities. This is a very sad time for the family but also for the residents and staff who knew this resident well. \u201cThis coronavirus pandemic has been unprecedented in terms of its scale and impact across the world. But more importantly we know what a devastating effect it is having on older people,\u201d said CEO Grant Millard. The challenge of containing this virus has been significant but just as challenging has been finding the best ways to support residents and families with the distress that this pandemic is causing in our residential aged care facilities. \u201cAnglicare\u2019s key focus at the moment is to provide a safe and secure home for our residents. All our energies are directed at eliminating this virus from Newmarch House.\u201d Our thoughts and prayers are with this particular Newmarch family today as they come to terms with their loss. Happy Tuesday. Schools are back across the country but the debate about whether pupils should be on-site continues, despite most jurisdictions hinting at a plan for how that will happen. In the UK things became a little more complicated for children, in terms of Covid-19, which will no doubt play into the debate here. Newspoll has looked at the personal popularity of the state leaders and they\u2019ve all seen a boost \u2013 but none quite like WA\u2019s Mark McGowan, who now holds an approval rating of 89%. And all it took was finally closing WA\u2019s borders. On the flip side, Annastacia Palaszczuk in Queensland saw a bump but still had the lowest personal approval rating of the state leaders, at 55%. That state is headed to an election in October. Elsewhere, more than 2 million Australians have downloaded the government\u2019s Covid tracing app. That comes as the chief medical officer again warns that even with restrictions lifted, without a vaccine, Australians won\u2019t be going back to what they knew as normal life. But slowly, little things which mean a lot are opening up. Bondi should be open for swims/surfs, the Northern Territory will be opening its parks, WA will allow gatherings of up to 10 people and, in Queensland, you can have picnics and drives again (soon). But the list of industries and sectors impacted continues to grow \u2013 the federal government has just announced it will be spending $95m on keeping zoos afloat. We\u2019ll have all the day\u2019s events and more as they pop up. You have Amy Remeikis with you for most of the day. Ready?",

Upon his return, Trump revealed his administration was conducting \u201cserious investigations\u201d into China\u2019s handling of the disease outbreak, and would most likely seek \u201cvery substantial\u201d damages from Beijing over the pandemic. The president\u2019s Rose Garden performance was nonetheless subdued compared to his briefing last Thursday, when he appeared to suggest treating Covid-19 with disinfectant injections. As David Smith writes: For White House aides and Republican allies, it was reportedly the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back: these daily briefings had become a political liability that could cost Trump the presidential election. Did the EU downplay its China report? The bloc\u2019s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, is facing allegations that a report on Chinese disinformation over the virus outbreak was watered down after pressure from Beijing. The pandemic portends a grim decade for women worldwide Experts have predicted a 20% rise in cases of domestic violence around the world during the coronavirus crisis: an additional 15m cases for every three months that lockdowns are extended.

Elsewhere in the world \u2026 New Zealand has started to relax its strict lockdown, allowing residents to travel to work, order takeaway food and spend more time outdoors. Nigeria\u2019s president announced a two-week lockdown in the city of Kano, where officials have denied that a sudden rise in fatal cases of pneumonia is related to the coronavirus. Tokyo\u2019s plan to host the Olympics a year late, in 2021, will be \u201cdifficult\u201d, according to the head of the Japan Medical Association, who said he was \u201cpessimistic\u201d about the prospect. Trump\u2019s court takeover Amid a noisy presidency, it has been a quiet project.

For the Guardian\u2019s new series, Trump\u2019s court takeover, McCarthy also explains how the president went about delivering conservative courts, thus earning the unwavering loyalty of his evangelical base. As the judge Shira A Scheindlin argues, that represents a giant step backwards for the country: When I was appointed to the bench I was 48. I had been a federal prosecutor, a defense lawyer, and had handled many civil cases in trial and appellate courts. That experience was invaluable.

      "bodyText": "Politicians and experts have called for urgent action to create more space for walking and cycling during lockdown in the UK, and to avoid a \u201cnightmare\u201d rise in traffic as restrictions on movement are lifted. Many cities around the world are taking action to reallocate road space away from motor vehicles to provide safe routes for sustainable travel. After the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, Chris Whitty, suggested physical distancing may last for the rest of the year, Manchester announced plans to protect space for those on foot and cycles, but most UK councils have not yet taken any action. Experts fear a return to heavily congested roads when the lockdown is lifted could be damaging, as it is thought air pollution is likely to exacerbate Covid-19 problems. Furthermore, a rise in extreme speeding during the lockdown, has led experts to suggest motor traffic could prove disproportionately lethal during the pandemic and urge authorities to make changes to city streets. Ruth Cadbury, a Labour MP and co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group for cycling and walking, said action was needed to avoid a \u201cnightmare\u201d on the roads as restrictions are lifted. \u201cI think people are going to rush back and to their cars where they would have gone to public transport, understandably fearing infection,\u201d said Cadbury. \u201cIt won\u2019t take long before our urban streets in particular, in our towns and city centres are more congested than ever, so we will end up with a nightmare situation.\u201d The World Health Organization says cycling and walking are among the best ways to practise physical distancing. Cadbury said local authorities could allocate road space for walking and cycling via temporary or emergency traffic orders, bringing forward existing plans or targeting key commuter routes, including to hospitals. She said guidance from government would help. The government recently announced a minor relaxation of traffic regulation orders (TRO) allowing local authorities to close roads without the need to advertise measures in local media. However, Dr Rachel Aldred, at the University of Westminster, said councils had little experience of TROs and some fear legal challenges if they try to make such changes.

Duncan Dollimore, Cycling UK head of campaigns, said pop-up walking and cycling space, as Milan is planning, could relieve pressure on public transport and help people maintain social distancing. More than 3,000 people have written to their councils calling for such measures since Thursday. \u201cWhen lockdown is relaxed, people will need more space to keep safe so it\u2019s essential councils introduce measures to make cycling and walking safer and social distancing easier right now in preparation for this time,\u201d he said. Chris Heaton-Harris, the cycling minister, said cycling and walking were good ways for people \u201cto get active and help their mental and physical health\u201d. \u201cTo help encourage more cycling and walking, DfT issued guidance to make it easier for local authorities to make changes under traffic regulation orders,\u201d he said.",

Latest figures from grocery analysts Kantar show shoppers spent \u00a3524m more on groceries so far in April, despite the fact that the number of supermarket visits dropped sharply. There was also a near 40% increase in convenience store sales as people turned to local shops to satisfy their daily needs. Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: \u201cPeople are spending more time at home and eating fewer meals out of the house, which has led to a strong growth in take-home grocery sales.\u201d However physical distancing meant spending in other parts of the store, such as on clothing and takeaway fare such as sandwiches, salads and coffee, had collapsed, he said. Before the coronavirus struck Britons were increasingly doing small top-up shops but the return of the big shop was confirmed by the Tesco chief executive, Dave Lewis, who said the number of transactions in its stores had nearly halved in April but that the amount being bought on each trip had doubled. On average, British households went food shopping 14 times in April, which compares with 17 trips in more normal times.

In recent months, China\u2019s central bank has stepped up its development of the e-RMB, which is set to be the first digital currency operated by a major economy. It has reportedly begun trials in several cities, including Shenzhen, Suzhou, Chengdu, as well as a new area south of Beijing, Xiong\u2019an, and areas that will host some of the events for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. State-media outlet China Daily said it had been formally adopted into the cities\u2019 monetary systems, with some government employees and public servants to receive their salaries in the digital currency from May. Sina News said the currency would be used to subsidise transport in Suzhou, but in Xiong\u2019an the trial primarily focused on food and retail. A screenshot purported to be of the app required to store and use the digital currency has been circulating since mid-April. Some reports also claim businesses including McDonald\u2019s and Starbucks have agreed to be part of the trial, however in a statement Starbucks told the Guardian it was not a participant. McDonald\u2019s been contacted for comment. Digital payment platforms are already widespread in China, namely Alipay, owned by Alibaba\u2019s Ant Financial, and WeChat Pay, owned by Tencent, but they do not replace existing currency. Xu Yuan, associate professor at Peking University\u2019s national development research institute, told broadcaster CCTV that because cash transactions were offline and transaction data from existing payment platforms was scattered, the central bank was unable to monitor cash flow in real time. \u201cAlthough there is little change from the perspective of user use, from the perspective of central bank supervision, future forms of finance, payment, business and social governance etc, this is the biggest thing ever.\u201d On 17 April, the digital currency research institute at the People\u2019s Bank of China, which is developing the system, said the research and development of a digital renminbi was \u201cadvancing steadily\u201d and top-level design, functional research and development, and debugging had largely been completed, according to a CCTV report.

      "body": "<p>At this stage in the coronavirus crisis, the government seems to have made error after error. The UK was slow to enforce a lockdown that seemed inevitable, shortages of personal protective equipment contributed to unnecessary deaths and it seems <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/why-the-uk-is-finding-it-so-hard-to-reach-100000-covid-19-tests-a-day\">doubtful</a> the government will meet its self-imposed target of 100,000 tests per day by the end of this week. While other European leaders have laid out roadmaps for how they plan to lift the lockdown, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/23/europe-is-easing-coronavirus-lockdowns-the-uks-failures-have-never-been-so-stark\">explaining the science informing their respective approaches</a>, the UK\u2019s own exit strategy remains unclear. Until the identities of 23 members of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/coronavirus-whos-who-on-secret-scientific-group-advising-uk-government-sage\">were revealed by the Guardian</a>, they were shrouded in secrecy.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is no such thing as the 'best science available'. Scientists regularly disagree</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet at every turn, the government has told us that it is \u201cfollowing the science\u201d. Its strategy, we are told, is informed by the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/scientists-criticise-uk-government-over-following-the-science\">best science available</a>\u201d. Though scientific evidence can be a sound justification for government action (or inaction), the relationship between science, politics and society is far more complex than the government would have us believe.</p> <p>To begin with, there is no such thing as the \u201cbest science available\u201d. Scientists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/05/1918-flu-pandemic-coronavirus-drug-trials-scientists-treatments-evidence\">regularly disagree</a> about different issues, from theoretical approaches to methodologies and findings, and decisions about what <em>kind</em> of scientific advice is taken into account are highly political. The individuals, disciplines and institutions that are invited to the table reflect the distribution of research funds, prestige and influence, as well as the values and objectives of politicians and policymakers. When it came to austerity, for example, the former coalition government ignored the warnings of many macroeconomists in favour of evidence that supported its worldview. If there is no \u201cmagic money tree\u201d, there is certainly no magic \u201cbest science\u201d tree either.</p> <p>The purpose of scientific advisory committees such as Sage is to distil existing scientific research so it can inform policy. But the remit of such advice is limited by the questions that politicians ask in the first place. In emergency situations, these questions sound less like \u201cWhat is the best science on [X]?\u201d and more like \u201cWhat kind of intervention is likely to prevent [Y]?\u201d What policymakers choose to prioritise at these moments is a matter of political judgment. Is it the lives of the elderly and the ill? Is it the economy? Or is it political approval ratings? These decisions matter. It also matters what questions politicians <em>don\u2019t</em> ask, such as whether coronavirus will disproportionately affect people from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/bame-groups-hit-harder-covid-19-than-white-people-uk\">black and ethnic minority communities</a>, or whether the effects of lockdown will be worse for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/27/domestic-abuse-surge-coronavirus-lockdown-lasting-impact-mps\">women</a>.</p> <p>Politicians tend to favour the kind of science that aligns with their existing preferences. In the worst case, this can lead to cherrypicking data, pejoratively called \u201cpolicy-based evidence\u201d. But it needn\u2019t be that extreme. For instance, studies suggesting a very high transmission rate for Covid-19 have been coming out of China since January, and Neil Ferguson, whose team was behind the study cited as precipitating Britain\u2019s <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-britain-research/sobering-covid-19-study-prompted-britain-to-toughen-its-approach-idUKKBN2141EI\">change of course in managing the pandemic</a>, first sent his report to a Cobra meeting <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/coronavirus-38-days-when-britain-sleepwalked-into-disaster-hq3b9tlgh\">on 24 January</a>. In February, studies suggesting that a substantial proportion of Covid-19 cases may be asymptomatic appeared in scientific journals. Evidence supporting general social distancing was already there. It took a political change of direction for this kind of data to be presented as \u201c<em>the</em> science\u201d.</p> <p>This tells us something important about the social nature of scientific knowledge. Scientific models are estimates, not oracles. Scientists can tell politicians the conditions under which their models are likely to work, but they are not responsible for creating those conditions. Blaming epidemiologists for the consequences of the government\u2019s Covid-19 strategy is like blaming climate scientists for not preventing the climate crisis. Scientists can provide evidence, but acting on that evidence requires political will.</p> <p>When it comes to policymaking, economic and political considerations tend to take precedence. Britain\u2019s delay in enforcing a lockdown was at least in part due to the desire to postpone, if not avoid, an economic recession. The government\u2019s decision to keep schools open was motivated by its desire to allow people to keep working. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/uk-missed-three-chances-to-join-eu-scheme-to-bulk-buy-ppe\">refusal to join the EU PPE procurement scheme</a> was probably intended to favour local suppliers, as well as to avoid being seen as not \u201cdelivering\u201d Brexit.</p> <p>The one kind of \u201cscience\u201d whose role in the government\u2019s response isn\u2019t clear is the science of surveying and shaping public opinion.

      "bodyText": "At this stage in the coronavirus crisis, the government seems to have made error after error. The UK was slow to enforce a lockdown that seemed inevitable, shortages of personal protective equipment contributed to unnecessary deaths and it seems doubtful the government will meet its self-imposed target of 100,000 tests per day by the end of this week. While other European leaders have laid out roadmaps for how they plan to lift the lockdown, explaining the science informing their respective approaches, the UK\u2019s own exit strategy remains unclear. Until the identities of 23 members of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) were revealed by the Guardian, they were shrouded in secrecy. Yet at every turn, the government has told us that it is \u201cfollowing the science\u201d. Its strategy, we are told, is informed by the \u201cbest science available\u201d. Though scientific evidence can be a sound justification for government action (or inaction), the relationship between science, politics and society is far more complex than the government would have us believe. To begin with, there is no such thing as the \u201cbest science available\u201d. Scientists regularly disagree about different issues, from theoretical approaches to methodologies and findings, and decisions about what kind of scientific advice is taken into account are highly political. The individuals, disciplines and institutions that are invited to the table reflect the distribution of research funds, prestige and influence, as well as the values and objectives of politicians and policymakers. When it came to austerity, for example, the former coalition government ignored the warnings of many macroeconomists in favour of evidence that supported its worldview. If there is no \u201cmagic money tree\u201d, there is certainly no magic \u201cbest science\u201d tree either. The purpose of scientific advisory committees such as Sage is to distil existing scientific research so it can inform policy. But the remit of such advice is limited by the questions that politicians ask in the first place. In emergency situations, these questions sound less like \u201cWhat is the best science on [X]?\u201d and more like \u201cWhat kind of intervention is likely to prevent [Y]?\u201d What policymakers choose to prioritise at these moments is a matter of political judgment. Is it the lives of the elderly and the ill? Is it the economy? Or is it political approval ratings? These decisions matter. It also matters what questions politicians don\u2019t ask, such as whether coronavirus will disproportionately affect people from black and ethnic minority communities, or whether the effects of lockdown will be worse for women. Politicians tend to favour the kind of science that aligns with their existing preferences. In the worst case, this can lead to cherrypicking data, pejoratively called \u201cpolicy-based evidence\u201d. But it needn\u2019t be that extreme. For instance, studies suggesting a very high transmission rate for Covid-19 have been coming out of China since January, and Neil Ferguson, whose team was behind the study cited as precipitating Britain\u2019s change of course in managing the pandemic, first sent his report to a Cobra meeting on 24 January. In February, studies suggesting that a substantial proportion of Covid-19 cases may be asymptomatic appeared in scientific journals. Evidence supporting general social distancing was already there. It took a political change of direction for this kind of data to be presented as \u201cthe science\u201d. This tells us something important about the social nature of scientific knowledge. Scientific models are estimates, not oracles. Scientists can tell politicians the conditions under which their models are likely to work, but they are not responsible for creating those conditions. Blaming epidemiologists for the consequences of the government\u2019s Covid-19 strategy is like blaming climate scientists for not preventing the climate crisis. Scientists can provide evidence, but acting on that evidence requires political will. When it comes to policymaking, economic and political considerations tend to take precedence. Britain\u2019s delay in enforcing a lockdown was at least in part due to the desire to postpone, if not avoid, an economic recession. The government\u2019s decision to keep schools open was motivated by its desire to allow people to keep working. The refusal to join the EU PPE procurement scheme was probably intended to favour local suppliers, as well as to avoid being seen as not \u201cdelivering\u201d Brexit. The one kind of \u201cscience\u201d whose role in the government\u2019s response isn\u2019t clear is the science of surveying and shaping public opinion. The evidence list of SPI-B, the Sage subcommittee on behavioural and social interventions, lists 16 polls and surveys conducted between January and March, tracking risk awareness, perception, and public approval for different kinds of governmental interventions. Of course, it is possible to argue public approval is necessary for measures to be effective: if people disagree with certain measures they are more likely to evade them. But this ignores one important aspect about the relationship between science, politics and public opinion: people\u2019s opinions about science are shaped by how facts are presented in official guidelines and in the media. In this sense, public health advice \u2013 which, throughout most of March, focused on handwashing and isolation of symptomatic cases \u2013 might have led to a self-fulfilling prophecy: if people believed the official guidelines, it is not surprising they would have been reluctant to support stricter lockdown and social distancing. It was only after a number of independent experts, including the editor of the Lancet, Richard Horton, started openly questioning the government\u2019s strategy, that public opinion overwhelmingly shifted in favour of a lockdown. As long as both the results of these surveys and the Sage and Cobra minutes remain confidential, there is no way to tell exactly how the perception of public approval for different kinds of measures shaped the government\u2019s strategy. But focusing attention only on one element in this chain \u2013 \u201cthe science\u201d \u2013 eschews questions of political responsibility. How science is turned into policy depends upon political and economic calculations, as well as on the moral and ideological commitments of politicians, political parties and policy advisers.

      "body": "<p>Just two months ago in the Cabinet Room of the White House, sitting at a table surrounded by a handful of his black supporters, Donald Trump once again praised his job creation record. \u201cBlack people right now are having the best, statistically, the best numbers that you\u2019ve ever had, and it\u2019s really an honor,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody has done more for black people than I have. Nobody has done more.\u201d</p> \n<p>That was 27 February and Trump was also still claiming he had done an \u201cincredible job\u201d with the looming coronavirus pandemic. Now the virus has led 26 million Americans to file for unemployment. While the US Bureau of Labor Statistics will not release unemployment figures broken down by race until the beginning of next month, economists are certain that black Americans are suffering the brunt of Covid-19\u2019s economic impact and will probably suffer the most dramatic consequences of the looming recession.</p> \n<p>Even before Covid-19 hit the US in full force and as the overall unemployment rate hit record lows, black Americans had an unemployment rate that was almost twice the national rate.</p> \n<p>In February 2020 when the overall unemployment rate was 3.5%, a 50-year-low, the black unemployment rate was 5.8%. The white unemployment rate was 3.1%.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe usual relationship that we see between the national unemployment rate and the black unemployment rate is typically really close to a two to one,\u201d said Valerie Wilson, director of the Economic Policy Institute\u2019s program on race, ethnicity and the economy.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhatever is being projected for the national unemployment rate, in most instances, we expect to see something close to twice that for black Americans.\u201d</p> \n<p>This was true for unemployment figures during the Great Recession. The overall unemployment rate <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/193290/unemployment-rate-in-the-usa-since-1990/\">peaked</a> at 9.6% in 2010. For black Americans, it was <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/194151/unemployment-rate-of-african-americans-in-the-us-since-1990/?mod=article_inline\">16%</a>.</p> \n<p>William Rodgers, former chief economist at the US Department of Labor, has estimated that the real unemployment rate for African Americans may have reached 19% in March.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe reason why African Americans bear the brunt of downturns more is that when firing decisions start to occur the least educated and those with the least experience tend to be let go first. There is also continued discrimination in the workplace,\u201d Rodgers said.</p> \n<p>Economists who focus on race have long said that this \u201clast hired, first fired\u201d phenomenon dramatically affects black Americans more than any other group in the US due to the country\u2019s history of racism and segregation of black Americans in the work sector.</p> \n<p>Workers of color, particularly black Americans, have long been <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/race/reports/2019/08/07/472910/systematic-inequality-economic-opportunity/\">overrepresented</a> in the lowest-paying service and domestic occupations, such as taxi drivers and restaurant servers. Working in these fields leads to lower wages \u2013 black Americans have the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/visualizations/2019/demo/p60-266/figure2.pdf\">lowest median wage</a> of any racial group in the US \u2013 and the jobs are often seen as the most expendable during an economic downturn.</p> \n<p>Those who got to keep their jobs during the last recession saw little relief even after the recession\u2019s recovery period. Even with a low unemployment rate, wage growth for low-wage workers, especially for black workers, has been slow. Black Americans have seen the <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/state-of-american-wages-2018/\">slowest wage growth </a>compared with other groups of Americans, reaching a growth rate that was four times slower at certain wage distribution levels, according to a 2018 Economic Policy Institute report.</p> \n<p>\u201cEven though overall on aggregate we were in a better position, many of the underlying weaknesses of our economy were still there \u2013 inequality both on class and race,\u201d Wilson said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"72b3a7ee270f21d1c16cd75ec5cceaf97ebef309\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72b3a7ee270f21d1c16cd75ec5cceaf97ebef309/0_158_4763_2860/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A policeman directs a citizen where to pick up an unemployment form in Miami, Florida, earlier this month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A policeman directs a citizen where to pick up an unemployment form in Miami, Florida, earlier this month.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michele Eve Sandberg/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Low wages have a ripple effect on a family\u2019s ability to save money and build wealth.</p> \n<p>For Yolanda Murray of Detroit, Michigan, not having savings meant weeks of panic trying to figure out how she was going to pay the bills that came on 1 April after she was furloughed from her job at a hotel.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou got the rent, the bills, you got the car insurance, you got groceries and disinfectant supplies \u2026 It\u2019s like how am I going to maintain all of this?\u201d Murray said. Weeks after she filed her application for unemployment insurance, payments started coming in and Murray was able to pay her bills again.</p> \n<p>But Murray has long-term concerns about what an upcoming recession could mean for her. Just a year and a half ago, in October 2018, Murray and her unionized co-workers spent 28 days striking for higher wages and better healthcare. At the time, workers at the hotel had not had wage rises since before the last recession, and healthcare costs were so expensive that Murray could only afford to cover herself, leaving her two children out of her plan.</p> \n<p>The workers reached a deal with the hotel, and she was able to get her children under her healthcare plan, but Murray is worried about what an economic downturn would mean for her and her co-workers. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to see us go backwards right now,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s repeated claims that he has been the best president for African Americans was repeatedly pegged to falling unemployment numbers. But those numbers only tell a partial story, as work by Rodgers and others has shown.</p> \n<p>Black families are especially vulnerable to economic downturns because they lack the savings that can act as a buffer against unexpected layoffs or lost wages. And during the last recovery they lost ground against their white peers.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/recent-trends-in-wealth-holding-by-race-and-ethnicity-evidence-from-the-survey-of-consumer-finances-20170927.htm\">median net worth</a> of black families is $17,600, compared with $171,000 for white families. A white family is likely to have $10 for every $1 a black family has. The percentage of black families that have a net worth at or below zero dollars is 10 points higher than the percentage of white families in the same financial situation \u2013 19% compared with 9%, respectively. And the black homeownership rate is the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/data/charts/fig08.pdf\">lowest</a> of any racial group in the US and has consistently been about 30% <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/data/histtabs.html\">lower</a> than the white homeownership rate over the years, even as the economy was getting stronger.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"344bdc4b-6f96-4fbb-b794-31be5382176e\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TKqymsBdllg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWealth allows you to respond to that unexpected health emergency, that broken hole in the tire you have to replace. It also allows you to buy a home, put your kids through school,\u201d said Danyelle Solomon, vice-president of the race and ethnicity program at the Center for American Progress<strong>.</strong></p> \n<p>Having less wealth also has some dire health consequences. Experts agree that being poor has costly effects on a person\u2019s health: for adults living in extreme poverty, being poor can <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/1/9/16860994/life-expectancy-us-income-inequality\">cost up</a> to 15 years of life expectancy.</p> \n<p>It is no surprise, then, that black Americans \u2013 who are less likely to be <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/disparities-policy/issue-brief/changes-in-health-coverage-by-race-and-ethnicity-since-the-aca-2010-2018/\">insured</a> and more likely to have <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2017/16_0241.htm\">existing health conditions</a> than their white counterparts \u2013 have seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/its-a-racial-justice-issue-black-americans-are-dying-in-greater-numbers-from-covid-19\">higher death rates</a> due to Covid-19 compared with any other group in the US. Black Americans made up 25% of <a href=\"https://www.apmresearchlab.org/covid/deaths-by-race\">deaths</a> from Covid-19 in the US though they make up a little under 13% of the US population.</p> \n<p>\u201cNational emergencies, pandemics, epidemics, what they do is they spotlight inequality,\u201d Solomon said. \u201cWhat we see in Covid-19 is no different. It\u2019s highlighting racial disparities at every single level that have been with our society for a very long time.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Just two months ago in the Cabinet Room of the White House, sitting at a table surrounded by a handful of his black supporters, Donald Trump once again praised his job creation record. \u201cBlack people right now are having the best, statistically, the best numbers that you\u2019ve ever had, and it\u2019s really an honor,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody has done more for black people than I have. Nobody has done more.\u201d That was 27 February and Trump was also still claiming he had done an \u201cincredible job\u201d with the looming coronavirus pandemic. Now the virus has led 26 million Americans to file for unemployment. While the US Bureau of Labor Statistics will not release unemployment figures broken down by race until the beginning of next month, economists are certain that black Americans are suffering the brunt of Covid-19\u2019s economic impact and will probably suffer the most dramatic consequences of the looming recession. Even before Covid-19 hit the US in full force and as the overall unemployment rate hit record lows, black Americans had an unemployment rate that was almost twice the national rate. In February 2020 when the overall unemployment rate was 3.5%, a 50-year-low, the black unemployment rate was 5.8%. The white unemployment rate was 3.1%. \u201cThe usual relationship that we see between the national unemployment rate and the black unemployment rate is typically really close to a two to one,\u201d said Valerie Wilson, director of the Economic Policy Institute\u2019s program on race, ethnicity and the economy. \u201cWhatever is being projected for the national unemployment rate, in most instances, we expect to see something close to twice that for black Americans.\u201d This was true for unemployment figures during the Great Recession. The overall unemployment rate peaked at 9.6% in 2010. For black Americans, it was 16%. William Rodgers, former chief economist at the US Department of Labor, has estimated that the real unemployment rate for African Americans may have reached 19% in March. \u201cThe reason why African Americans bear the brunt of downturns more is that when firing decisions start to occur the least educated and those with the least experience tend to be let go first. There is also continued discrimination in the workplace,\u201d Rodgers said. Economists who focus on race have long said that this \u201clast hired, first fired\u201d phenomenon dramatically affects black Americans more than any other group in the US due to the country\u2019s history of racism and segregation of black Americans in the work sector. Workers of color, particularly black Americans, have long been overrepresented in the lowest-paying service and domestic occupations, such as taxi drivers and restaurant servers. Working in these fields leads to lower wages \u2013 black Americans have the lowest median wage of any racial group in the US \u2013 and the jobs are often seen as the most expendable during an economic downturn. Those who got to keep their jobs during the last recession saw little relief even after the recession\u2019s recovery period. Even with a low unemployment rate, wage growth for low-wage workers, especially for black workers, has been slow. Black Americans have seen the slowest wage growth compared with other groups of Americans, reaching a growth rate that was four times slower at certain wage distribution levels, according to a 2018 Economic Policy Institute report. \u201cEven though overall on aggregate we were in a better position, many of the underlying weaknesses of our economy were still there \u2013 inequality both on class and race,\u201d Wilson said. Low wages have a ripple effect on a family\u2019s ability to save money and build wealth. For Yolanda Murray of Detroit, Michigan, not having savings meant weeks of panic trying to figure out how she was going to pay the bills that came on 1 April after she was furloughed from her job at a hotel. \u201cYou got the rent, the bills, you got the car insurance, you got groceries and disinfectant supplies \u2026 It\u2019s like how am I going to maintain all of this?\u201d Murray said. Weeks after she filed her application for unemployment insurance, payments started coming in and Murray was able to pay her bills again. But Murray has long-term concerns about what an upcoming recession could mean for her. Just a year and a half ago, in October 2018, Murray and her unionized co-workers spent 28 days striking for higher wages and better healthcare. At the time, workers at the hotel had not had wage rises since before the last recession, and healthcare costs were so expensive that Murray could only afford to cover herself, leaving her two children out of her plan. The workers reached a deal with the hotel, and she was able to get her children under her healthcare plan, but Murray is worried about what an economic downturn would mean for her and her co-workers. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to see us go backwards right now,\u201d she said. Trump\u2019s repeated claims that he has been the best president for African Americans was repeatedly pegged to falling unemployment numbers. But those numbers only tell a partial story, as work by Rodgers and others has shown. Black families are especially vulnerable to economic downturns because they lack the savings that can act as a buffer against unexpected layoffs or lost wages. And during the last recovery they lost ground against their white peers. The median net worth of black families is $17,600, compared with $171,000 for white families. A white family is likely to have $10 for every $1 a black family has. The percentage of black families that have a net worth at or below zero dollars is 10 points higher than the percentage of white families in the same financial situation \u2013 19% compared with 9%, respectively. And the black homeownership rate is the lowest of any racial group in the US and has consistently been about 30% lower than the white homeownership rate over the years, even as the economy was getting stronger. \u201cWealth allows you to respond to that unexpected health emergency, that broken hole in the tire you have to replace. It also allows you to buy a home, put your kids through school,\u201d said Danyelle Solomon, vice-president of the race and ethnicity program at the Center for American Progress. Having less wealth also has some dire health consequences. Experts agree that being poor has costly effects on a person\u2019s health: for adults living in extreme poverty, being poor can cost up to 15 years of life expectancy. It is no surprise, then, that black Americans \u2013 who are less likely to be insured and more likely to have existing health conditions than their white counterparts \u2013 have seen higher death rates due to Covid-19 compared with any other group in the US. Black Americans made up 25% of deaths from Covid-19 in the US though they make up a little under 13% of the US population. \u201cNational emergencies, pandemics, epidemics, what they do is they spotlight inequality,\u201d Solomon said. \u201cWhat we see in Covid-19 is no different. It\u2019s highlighting racial disparities at every single level that have been with our society for a very long time.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>For Malcolm Kitts, the question was rhetorical. Would he \u2013 his godson, Daniel, asked him \u2013 like a nice surprise? Kitts, a 62-year-old Tottenham fanatic from Essex, has been to hell and back. A diabetic, he spent 10 days in a medically induced coma as his body fought against Covid\u201119, viral pneumonia and sepsis. Even the doctors could not explain how he survived. Kitts was dubbed \u201cthe walking miracle of Basildon hospital\u201d. So, yes, he would bloody love a nice surprise.</p> <p>Daniel told him to click the video message on his phone, which Kitts did and, rather abruptly, there was one of his Spurs heroes talking to him. It was Harry Winks, addressing him personally and saying how happy he was that Kitts was feeling better. Everybody at Spurs was thinking of him, Winks added, and, hopefully, they would soon see him at the stadium.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/27/football-not-restart-until-strain-nhs-eases-says-watford-chairman-scott-duxbury\">Football must not restart until strain on NHS eases, says Watford chairman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Footballers are regularly asked for these sort of messages. In happier days they could be for the groom at a wedding, for example, but the common thread is the astonishment they provoke, the disproportionate intensity of the emotion, the almost childlike joy.</p> <p>Winks is 24 and those who know him will highlight his humility and boy-next-door normality. But because of what he does he has extraordinary influence and, at times like these, it is heartwarming to see how even the simplest of gestures from him or a fellow player can lift the spirits. Members of Winks\u2019s profession have done some daft things during lockdown yet it is worth remembering they consistently use their profile in positive ways, which is not always reported.</p> <p>\u201cIt put such a smile on my face,\u201d Kitts says. \u201cThe amount of love involved with it is crazy. I\u2019ve sent it to all my Spurs fan friends and they were just amazed. Harry, that was a bit special. I\u2019m smiling again now. I\u2019ve played it over and over. I\u2019m a 62\u2011year\u2011old man! What\u2019s that all about?\u201d</p> <p>Kitts\u2019s wife, Tina, has an anecdote to offer context. \u201cMalcolm works as a wedding DJ but 15, 20-odd years ago he was a bedroom fitter and his company got a call from Glenn Hoddle, who wanted all his bedrooms fitted out,\u201d she says. \u201cSo the company asked Malcolm if he\u2019d like to do the job. He was just in awe. \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019m going to meet Glenn Hoddle.\u2019 It was the same reaction when he got the Harry Winks video. His face was a picture. It meant the world.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4901bfb402cc1b8b8040297074680eb3c5feaa24\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4901bfb402cc1b8b8040297074680eb3c5feaa24/0_0_2139_1424/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harry Winks in action for Tottenham in March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harry Winks in action for Tottenham in March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Holly Allison/TPI/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Kitts and his family, the nightmare started when he was gripped by severe head pain on 15 March \u2013 the symptom that had accompanied a bout of viral pneumonia 16 years previously. He was admitted to hospital two days later and, by 21 March, his breathing had deteriorated. It is unclear whether the coronavirus infection came before or after the pneumonia, with the sepsis deepening the worry.</p> <p>Kitts was taken to the critical care unit, attached to a ventilator and put into the coma but not before he knew there was a 50% chance he would not wake up.</p> <p>\u201cI thought I was dead when they told me they were going to put me in a coma,\u201d Kitts says. \u201cI had a 50% chance of coming out \u2013 I knew that from what I\u2019d heard doctors and nurses saying. I phoned Tina, who was isolating with our youngest son, Mark, at his flat and I just told her that my breathing had gone down and they needed to put me into a coma. I didn\u2019t tell her about the 50% chance.</p> <p>\u201cI got really emotional because me and Tina have been together since we were 15 so I asked her to put Mark on, who I can be stronger with. I said to him: \u2018Look after mum,\u2019 and he said: \u2018Yeah, she\u2019ll be fine here at mine \u2013 I\u2019ll put you back to her.\u2019 He didn\u2019t have a clue. It was quite amusing when you think about it. I just said to Tina: \u2018Love you and I\u2019ll see you soon.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>After five days the doctors revived Kitts to see whether he could breathe on his own but he could not. He was put back into a coma and it looked as if he was slipping away. For Tina, the helplessness was as acute as the anguish. \u201cIt was just the thought of he\u2019s going to die and I can\u2019t be with him, I can\u2019t hold his hand.\u201d</p> <p>Yet Kitts\u2019s condition stabilised and he was brought round successfully on 31 March. He remained in critical care for four more days before being moved to high dependency and then the general ward. The nurses applauded him when he was discharged on 10 April.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email. </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kitts had no coordination after he came to and, to use his words, he was lying there \u201cpicking stars out of the sky\u201d. He did not know who Tina was, at first, and he struggled to differentiate between dreams and reality. On the drive away from hospital his eyes were opened wide to the lockdown, which was not in force before his coma. \u201cIt was like The Walking Dead,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Kitts\u2019s daughter, Nikki, has bought him a Spurs shirt with \u201cSurvivor\u201d across the back and, together with a return to normality, what he most wants is to provide hope for families affected by Covid-19.</p> <p>Tina has the final word. \u201cYou need that positivity. I know I did when Malcolm was critical on the ventilator. It\u2019s been beyond words, the darkest days we\u2019ve ever had, but I just think he had too much to live for \u2013 a wonderful family and too many Spurs matches he wanted to see.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "For Malcolm Kitts, the question was rhetorical. Would he \u2013 his godson, Daniel, asked him \u2013 like a nice surprise? Kitts, a 62-year-old Tottenham fanatic from Essex, has been to hell and back. A diabetic, he spent 10 days in a medically induced coma as his body fought against Covid\u201119, viral pneumonia and sepsis. Even the doctors could not explain how he survived. Kitts was dubbed \u201cthe walking miracle of Basildon hospital\u201d. So, yes, he would bloody love a nice surprise. Daniel told him to click the video message on his phone, which Kitts did and, rather abruptly, there was one of his Spurs heroes talking to him. It was Harry Winks, addressing him personally and saying how happy he was that Kitts was feeling better. Everybody at Spurs was thinking of him, Winks added, and, hopefully, they would soon see him at the stadium. Footballers are regularly asked for these sort of messages. In happier days they could be for the groom at a wedding, for example, but the common thread is the astonishment they provoke, the disproportionate intensity of the emotion, the almost childlike joy. Winks is 24 and those who know him will highlight his humility and boy-next-door normality. But because of what he does he has extraordinary influence and, at times like these, it is heartwarming to see how even the simplest of gestures from him or a fellow player can lift the spirits. Members of Winks\u2019s profession have done some daft things during lockdown yet it is worth remembering they consistently use their profile in positive ways, which is not always reported. \u201cIt put such a smile on my face,\u201d Kitts says. \u201cThe amount of love involved with it is crazy. I\u2019ve sent it to all my Spurs fan friends and they were just amazed. Harry, that was a bit special. I\u2019m smiling again now. I\u2019ve played it over and over. I\u2019m a 62\u2011year\u2011old man! What\u2019s that all about?\u201d Kitts\u2019s wife, Tina, has an anecdote to offer context. \u201cMalcolm works as a wedding DJ but 15, 20-odd years ago he was a bedroom fitter and his company got a call from Glenn Hoddle, who wanted all his bedrooms fitted out,\u201d she says. \u201cSo the company asked Malcolm if he\u2019d like to do the job. He was just in awe. \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019m going to meet Glenn Hoddle.\u2019 It was the same reaction when he got the Harry Winks video. His face was a picture. It meant the world.\u201d For Kitts and his family, the nightmare started when he was gripped by severe head pain on 15 March \u2013 the symptom that had accompanied a bout of viral pneumonia 16 years previously. He was admitted to hospital two days later and, by 21 March, his breathing had deteriorated. It is unclear whether the coronavirus infection came before or after the pneumonia, with the sepsis deepening the worry. Kitts was taken to the critical care unit, attached to a ventilator and put into the coma but not before he knew there was a 50% chance he would not wake up. \u201cI thought I was dead when they told me they were going to put me in a coma,\u201d Kitts says. \u201cI had a 50% chance of coming out \u2013 I knew that from what I\u2019d heard doctors and nurses saying. I phoned Tina, who was isolating with our youngest son, Mark, at his flat and I just told her that my breathing had gone down and they needed to put me into a coma. I didn\u2019t tell her about the 50% chance. \u201cI got really emotional because me and Tina have been together since we were 15 so I asked her to put Mark on, who I can be stronger with. I said to him: \u2018Look after mum,\u2019 and he said: \u2018Yeah, she\u2019ll be fine here at mine \u2013 I\u2019ll put you back to her.\u2019 He didn\u2019t have a clue. It was quite amusing when you think about it. I just said to Tina: \u2018Love you and I\u2019ll see you soon.\u2019\u201d After five days the doctors revived Kitts to see whether he could breathe on his own but he could not. He was put back into a coma and it looked as if he was slipping away. For Tina, the helplessness was as acute as the anguish. \u201cIt was just the thought of he\u2019s going to die and I can\u2019t be with him, I can\u2019t hold his hand.\u201d Yet Kitts\u2019s condition stabilised and he was brought round successfully on 31 March. He remained in critical care for four more days before being moved to high dependency and then the general ward. The nurses applauded him when he was discharged on 10 April. Kitts had no coordination after he came to and, to use his words, he was lying there \u201cpicking stars out of the sky\u201d. He did not know who Tina was, at first, and he struggled to differentiate between dreams and reality. On the drive away from hospital his eyes were opened wide to the lockdown, which was not in force before his coma. \u201cIt was like The Walking Dead,\u201d he says. Kitts\u2019s daughter, Nikki, has bought him a Spurs shirt with \u201cSurvivor\u201d across the back and, together with a return to normality, what he most wants is to provide hope for families affected by Covid-19. Tina has the final word. \u201cYou need that positivity. I know I did when Malcolm was critical on the ventilator. It\u2019s been beyond words, the darkest days we\u2019ve ever had, but I just think he had too much to live for \u2013 a wonderful family and too many Spurs matches he wanted to see.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>A surge in gun-related Google searches and estimated gun sales in the US during the worst public health emergency in modern history could lead to higher suicide rates, experts have warned.</p> <p>From early March to mid-April, when the US began to experience the full force of Covid-19, its residents conducted roughly 2.1m Google searches about buying and cleaning guns, according to <a href=\"https://everytownresearch.org/covid-search/\">research</a> conducted by Everytown for Gun Safety and shared exclusively with the Guardian. Those numbers signaled a 158% increase from what would have been expected absent the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>Estimated gun sales also soared to 2.58m in March, <a href=\"http://smallarmsanalytics.com/v1/pr/2020-04-01.pdf\">Small Arms Analytics and Forecasting</a> reported, an 85.3% jump from the same time last year.</p> <p>\u201cThis unprecedented spike in new guns in people\u2019s homes and this Googling about taking people\u2019s guns out of storage, combined with this drastic increase in unemployment, presents a huge risk for a collateral public health crisis, which is firearm suicide,\u201d said Sarah Burd-Sharps, director of research at Everytown.</p> <p>Suicides already account for almost two-thirds of gun-related fatalities in the US, and <a href=\"https://annals.org/aim/article-abstract/2756854/suicide-case-fatality-rates-united-states-2007-2014-nationwide-population\">nearly 90%</a> of suicide attempts using firearms end in death, compared with 4% where a gun isn\u2019t used. <a href=\"https://annals.org/aim/article-abstract/2756854/suicide-case-fatality-rates-united-states-2007-2014-nationwide-population\">Although the lion\u2019s share</a> of suicide attempts don\u2019t include guns, <a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-031811-124636#_i10\">research</a> suggests those that do comprise the majority that are ultimately fatal.</p> <p>Now, because of Covid-19, the economy has been devastated, victims of child abuse and domestic violence are trapped at home with their perpetrators and, generally, people are physically distanced and socially isolated. All of these phenomena pose risks for suicide, said Nadine J Kaslow, a professor at the Emory University school of medicine and a former president of the American Psychological Association.</p> <p>Some places are already seeing that the crisis around Covid-19 may be exacerbating suicidal tendencies. In Portland, Oregon, for example, suicidal calls to police jumped 23% in the early days of the pandemic, <a href=\"https://www.oregonlive.com/coronavirus/2020/03/calls-from-suicidal-people-to-911-are-rising-portland-police-say-coronavirus-could-be-fueling-anxiety.html\">even as call rates dropped overall</a>.</p> <p>\u201cObviously, not everybody who gets a firearm is going to use it to take their own life. People are getting these firearms for lots of different reasons. But it\u2019s [a] subgroup of people, and it\u2019s a subgroup we have to be, in my opinion, very concerned about,\u201d said Kaslow.</p> <p>Burd-Sharps found that when she and her team first pulled Google search data, the states with the greatest surges in gun-related searches were at that time considered to be, or be close to, Covid-19 hotspots. Many of them, including New York, California and Connecticut, usually have <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/gun-ownership-rates-by-state/\">low gun ownership rates</a>, compared with the rest of the nation.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/us-gun-purchases-coronavirus-record\">Anecdotal evidence</a> also suggests that many of the buyers were first-time gun owners. That distribution matters because, say, adding a fifth gun to an already armed household isn\u2019t the same as exposing an entire family to a new and potentially deadly weapon, explained Matt Miller, a professor of health sciences and epidemiology at Northeastern University.</p> <p>\u201cTo the extent that there are new gun owners, those new gun owners are now putting themselves and everyone in their home at substantially higher risk of dying by suicide,\u201d said Miller.</p> <p>Before the pandemic, roughly <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5993703/\">one in three US households </a><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5993703/\">owned a gun</a>, and even exponential spikes in gun sales on a temporary basis would be a \u201cdrop in the ocean with respect to the total number of guns in civilian hands\u201d, Miller countered.</p> <p>\u201cTo look for marginal effects of new guns or other types of exposure changes is sort of to miss the forest for the trees,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Others, however, are genuinely alarmed by the trend of people buying guns or bringing them out of storage during a pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s little doubt that we\u2019re gonna see increased rates of domestic violence. There\u2019s little doubt that we\u2019re gonna see increased rates of child abuse occurring. There\u2019s little doubt that we\u2019re going to see people get into socio-economically dire situations,\u201d said Eric Fleegler, a physician and researcher at Boston children\u2019s hospital.</p> <p>\u201cThe presence of guns takes any toxic environment like that and puts a higher risk on things,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Fleegler warned in a recent analysis that the US is \u201c<a href=\"https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2765237/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-firearms-united-states-epidemic-suicide\">primed for a suicide epidemic triggered by C</a><a href=\"https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2765237/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-firearms-united-states-epidemic-suicide\">ovid-19</a>\u201d, a tragedy that\u2019s both \u201cpredictable and preventable\u201d, partially by limiting gun access. And, he said, the consequences of guns being so readily available during a time of crisis could far outlast a single pandemic, a warning echoed by other experts.</p> <p>\u201cGuns are a durable item,\u201d Fleegler said. \u201cThey last for years, decades. And the risk associated with them will last as well.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is <a href=\"tel:%28800%29%20273-8255\">1-800-273-8255</a>. In the UK the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14.

      "bodyText": "A surge in gun-related Google searches and estimated gun sales in the US during the worst public health emergency in modern history could lead to higher suicide rates, experts have warned. From early March to mid-April, when the US began to experience the full force of Covid-19, its residents conducted roughly 2.1m Google searches about buying and cleaning guns, according to research conducted by Everytown for Gun Safety and shared exclusively with the Guardian. Those numbers signaled a 158% increase from what would have been expected absent the coronavirus pandemic. Estimated gun sales also soared to 2.58m in March, Small Arms Analytics and Forecasting reported, an 85.3% jump from the same time last year. \u201cThis unprecedented spike in new guns in people\u2019s homes and this Googling about taking people\u2019s guns out of storage, combined with this drastic increase in unemployment, presents a huge risk for a collateral public health crisis, which is firearm suicide,\u201d said Sarah Burd-Sharps, director of research at Everytown. Suicides already account for almost two-thirds of gun-related fatalities in the US, and nearly 90% of suicide attempts using firearms end in death, compared with 4% where a gun isn\u2019t used. Although the lion\u2019s share of suicide attempts don\u2019t include guns, research suggests those that do comprise the majority that are ultimately fatal. Now, because of Covid-19, the economy has been devastated, victims of child abuse and domestic violence are trapped at home with their perpetrators and, generally, people are physically distanced and socially isolated. All of these phenomena pose risks for suicide, said Nadine J Kaslow, a professor at the Emory University school of medicine and a former president of the American Psychological Association. Some places are already seeing that the crisis around Covid-19 may be exacerbating suicidal tendencies. In Portland, Oregon, for example, suicidal calls to police jumped 23% in the early days of the pandemic, even as call rates dropped overall. \u201cObviously, not everybody who gets a firearm is going to use it to take their own life. People are getting these firearms for lots of different reasons. But it\u2019s [a] subgroup of people, and it\u2019s a subgroup we have to be, in my opinion, very concerned about,\u201d said Kaslow. Burd-Sharps found that when she and her team first pulled Google search data, the states with the greatest surges in gun-related searches were at that time considered to be, or be close to, Covid-19 hotspots. Many of them, including New York, California and Connecticut, usually have low gun ownership rates, compared with the rest of the nation. Anecdotal evidence also suggests that many of the buyers were first-time gun owners. That distribution matters because, say, adding a fifth gun to an already armed household isn\u2019t the same as exposing an entire family to a new and potentially deadly weapon, explained Matt Miller, a professor of health sciences and epidemiology at Northeastern University. \u201cTo the extent that there are new gun owners, those new gun owners are now putting themselves and everyone in their home at substantially higher risk of dying by suicide,\u201d said Miller. Before the pandemic, roughly one in three US households owned a gun, and even exponential spikes in gun sales on a temporary basis would be a \u201cdrop in the ocean with respect to the total number of guns in civilian hands\u201d, Miller countered. \u201cTo look for marginal effects of new guns or other types of exposure changes is sort of to miss the forest for the trees,\u201d he said. Others, however, are genuinely alarmed by the trend of people buying guns or bringing them out of storage during a pandemic. \u201cThere\u2019s little doubt that we\u2019re gonna see increased rates of domestic violence. There\u2019s little doubt that we\u2019re gonna see increased rates of child abuse occurring. There\u2019s little doubt that we\u2019re going to see people get into socio-economically dire situations,\u201d said Eric Fleegler, a physician and researcher at Boston children\u2019s hospital. \u201cThe presence of guns takes any toxic environment like that and puts a higher risk on things,\u201d he added. Fleegler warned in a recent analysis that the US is \u201cprimed for a suicide epidemic triggered by Covid-19\u201d, a tragedy that\u2019s both \u201cpredictable and preventable\u201d, partially by limiting gun access. And, he said, the consequences of guns being so readily available during a time of crisis could far outlast a single pandemic, a warning echoed by other experts. \u201cGuns are a durable item,\u201d Fleegler said. \u201cThey last for years, decades. And the risk associated with them will last as well.\u201d \u2022 In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In the UK the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14. Other international suicide helplines can be found at www.befrienders.org.",

      "body": "<p>Covid-19 is proving to be a many-headed monster. And though most people will steadily improve and recover, a small percentage (up 4%) suffer a precipitous, unpredicted and sometimes delayed decline. Experts are warning that waiting for the \u201cclassic\u201d symptoms \u2013 difficulty in breathing and high fever \u2013 may mean that some cases of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/20/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-testing-pneumonia.html\">pneumonia </a>and other complications may be missed. But how do you know whether you\u2019re the one who will need hospitalisation? Will you end up in ICU? How do you know when you\u2019re out of the woods? And are there any specific ways of assessing whether you\u2019re getting better or worse?</p> <p>Most of us can put up with the sweats, aches, cough and deep fatigue for a few days if we know that we\u2019ll turn the corner and begin a couple of weeks of gradual recovery. Michael, a 27-year-old coronavirus patient, told me: \u201cAt first, it was like wading through a sea of treacle just to reach the loo. I felt like a small child was sitting on my chest so that breathing was really hard work. Then after a couple of days, my breathing eased and I could potter around my flat like my grandmother does, though a bit slower. The thought of going out for a 5K run, which I used to do in about 24 minutes, still feels impossible. But I\u2019m in my third week and I can feel that I\u2019m on the mend. I wish that someone had told me that it would take this long because not knowing is really scary.\u201d</p> <p>As Michael\u2019s GP, I would have been the obvious person to advise him on what to expect. But the truth is that the presentations, complications and consequences of this novel virus are still unfolding; the initial phone triage pathway that doctors like me were advised to follow at the start of the crisis was pragmatic and generally safe but didn\u2019t cover the myriad exceptions to the rule that have since become apparent.</p> <p>One concern is that pneumonia can develop, which only causes symptoms of shortness of breath once it is at an advanced stage. Pneumonia occurs when the tiny air sacs in the lungs (alveoli) become inflamed by a virus, bacteria, fungus or irritant particle and fill with fluid or pus, making it hard to breathe. Too little oxygen in the lungs means that the blood can\u2019t pick up enough to carry to every organ and cell in the body (resulting in a condition called hypoxia). Sustained hypoxia causes organ failure and cell death. Administering oxygen via a mask or CPAP machine can help at first but if the alveoli are too bunged up then no amount of oxygen will help and mechanical breathing assistance (ventilation) becomes necessary.</p> <p>It can be hard to know when a chest infection that affects bigger airways but leaves the alveoli able to function is developing into a potentially dangerous pneumonia. Pointers are a temperature over 37.8C, a pulse rate over 100 beats per minute, crackling sounds heard through a stethoscope and oxygen saturation levels in the blood lower than 95%. A chest X-ray or CT scan may also show abnormalities that point to pneumonia. But none of these is entirely reliable on its own; for example, your pulse rate may be high if you\u2019re unfit, anxious, have just consumed caffeine or have a fever from any cause.</p> <p>Oxygen saturation levels are a measure of how much oxygen is getting round your body and can be fairly reliably assessed with a little gadget called a pulse oximeter that clips on to your finger. Two wavelengths of lights are emitted by an LED inside the device on one side of the finger. The light that passes through the fingertip is measured and the amount that has been absorbed by the oxygen in the blood is calculated to give an oxygen saturation \u2013 or \u201csats\u201d \u2013 reading. A figure is displayed, which is the percentage of the maximum amount of oxygen that the blood should carry, and the ingenious little gadget \u2013 which runs on one AAA battery \u2013 also displays heart rate.</p> <p>Pulse oximetry is a useful adjunct in deciding who needs treatment, admission to hospital, oxygen therapy, a transfer to intensive care, ventilation and then, at the other end of the tunnel, who can be safely discharged home and reassured that they\u2019re on the mend. Oximeters don\u2019t work well if your hands are cold, you have shellac on your nails or the battery is flat.</p> <p>Anyone who is too breathless to complete a sentence, has severe chest pain, is drowsy, confused or unable to stand up due to dizziness will need urgent assessment, usually with a 999 call. Relying on a sats measurement isn\u2019t safe if you\u2019re clearly seriously unwell and deteriorating. But in a more borderline call, a sats reading of over 96%, a heart rate under 90 beats per minute and a respiratory rate of under 20 breaths per minute are reassuring.</p> <p>GP surgeries have been given pulse oximeters to lend to patients at home to monitor their progress either as the infection is developing or as recovery kicks in.

The message is that this Hydra of a virus can present in insidious ways, especially in the frail and elderly.

I didn't really find that, but through the process of doing that podcast, I grew a network that I found very useful, that I met in my search, the people I interviewed. And how it started to feel like an open source network: this is my experience, this is how we handled it, kind of thing. And even better for its lack of hierarchy, the mentor-mentee hierarchy didn't exist in that sense.

And he said: painting was the only medium in which I couldn't cause people harm. I thought that was brilliant \u2013&#xa0;the characters in his paintings are so subjective, no one could take ownership of them or be hurt by them. I don't actually think that about my own songs, though I've had one experience when someone thought a song was about themselves, and confronted me about it, and all it did was kind of... I had think about it for a few years. As somebody sort of writing creative non fiction, for someone to intrude and insist on their participation in it, is really unhelpful.

On this album, I felt no pressure to do anything other than very simple instrumentation and production, and I think that was nice, a relief for me \u2013&#xa0;Lump covers that entire area now. And how one decides what is the appropriate songwriting or production tool to use, I listen to a particular era of music, music made in 1969, I collect records made in 1969.

I felt huge pressure to keep up with him when I was recording with him, and since then, seeing how he understands music sort of propels my form of what I take out of musical inspiration.

I loved the process of making Short Movie and self-producing, but you need someone to steer the ship with you, you shouldn't always rely on your own opinion. So I had an incredible engineer, and it was interesting; having worked with Blake Mills who was an extraordinarily detailed producer, I'd never seen anyone work so hard. </p> <p>It was a trip, a little experiment.

You have the practical challenge of getting somewhere and the gratification of the experience of playing live. The best place to do it is America - every town has its live music scene. Because of the way radio is set up in the US, it's amazing, it's so specific, so usually when I'm touring the US I go to the radio station in the morning, sell my wares, and the people at the stations are huge music fans who do it because they love it.

      "bodyText": "Mannymanpreet asks Thank you for the new album - it was an unexpected treat. Would you like to share the story behind your song The Valley? Understandable if not. It\u2019s a beautiful song regardless, and Semper Femina in general was a good support system for me during a breakup at the time. deepakm says I\u2019m hugely enjoying your new album. I would love to know how important the aesthetic side of the album is to you. From the music videos to the art cover, does this allow you to visualise the spirit of the music to the audience? Keep up the great work! HaydenLoopX says As a 20-year-old who went through a terrible heartbreak, your album I Speak Because I Can affected me in an unimaginable way. Never have lyrics of songs affected me so deeply and personally, and I went away by myself and bawled my eyes out to your music. How do you deal with heartbreak? RoryHorne asks When playing live, you sometimes change the lyrics to your older songs, singing alternative lines. Do you enjoy reimagining or altering the songs we hear on the records years down the line? Is that to keep them fresh for yourself, for the audience, or both? saral167 asks What are some of your favourite books? HaloSita asks What song do you sing in the shower? Or a song you tend to hum without thinking. GraceLH asks Across all of your albums, you reference God and the devil a lot in your lyrics. Has religion influenced you? You\u2019ve done some small acting projects here and there which have been a nice surprise. How did they come about and would you continue with acting? You have said that you tried out distancing yourself from the \u201cmusician identity\u201d. How difficult was it and what did you learn from that experience? passingby01 asks I am using Covid-19 to teach myself the guitar. Do you play any other instruments, if so which ones? And is there an instrument you don\u2019t yet play but wish you did and why? RachelGreen asks Thank you for this beautiful album - as a mother of two young girls you have articulated many of the feelings and thoughts I had about raising fearless daughters. No doubt it\u2019ll become part of our family soundtrack. I was wondering about mentoring - as a big Dylan fan I\u2019ve read about his visiting Guthrie early in his career and recently heard Jack White discussing Dylan mentoring him - I was wondering if any artists (male or female) have been active mentors to you and whether you have in turn mentored anyone else? blackbird02 asks Are there things/topics in your life you really would love to write a song about but have the feeling that you fail to put them into words and music, maybe because it\u2018s too hurtful or just not doable? If so, are you able to put them aside and write about other things? WarringtonBomble asks Can you name a record you love that people wouldn\u2019t expect you to love? Rasthky asks There have been a load of unreleased tracks doing the rounds on YouTube - Bleed Me Dry, One Day Soon, and that lovely track at the end of the Woman Driver short movie (pun!), Rest My Troubles Away - will you revisit these, or release them at any point? BrightSlumber asks You have generously been giving guitar lessons during the lockdown, something I have enjoyed immensely (thank you). You frequently use non-standard guitar tunings, what is your favourite and why? billyocean asks Would you ever be bold enough to wear triple denim? reed87 asks What would you consider to be the best song you\u2019ve written? norman2 asks How do you approach balancing experimentation versus simplicity with songwriting/production? Is it a gut feeling or do you look to other artists for guidance? Harssh asks I always wonder at what point after you start making records do you stop learning more about your instrument or about music. Do you still regularly try to learn new techniques about playing the guitar, or learn something different simply as a student? EmilyeWright says Hi from Canada! Your music is a big creative inspiration for me; right now I\u2019m writing about introverts. You seem to be quite a confident introvert and I was wondering if you had any advice on how to be confident in your quietness? Gookov18h asks What\u2019s your favourite classical tune? Daisy_13h asks I read an interview where you spoke about how songs can sometimes be prophetic. Do you have any ideas about how or why this phenomenon happens? poshboysout asks Congratulations on the new album - another great work! After more than a decade of success, what would you say was your main motivation? Are you looking for commercial success, taking each album at a time or maybe aware of creating a great legacy of work that we can all look back on? Isaacstuart asks Your new album is my favourite of 2020. Could you talk about the process of recording the album? Do you have the instrumentation mapped out in your \u2018demos\u2019 before you go in or do you discuss with a producer beforehand? How do you find the overall process? MSWarren says How has your relationship with playing live changed? And do you have a favourite venue? They always seem to be carefully chosen. Do you have books, poems, art works etc. you return to (when creating new music or otherwise)? Laura Marling is with us - online - now! While many musicians have pushed back their planned album releases mid-pandemic, others such as Fiona Apple and Charli XCX have recognised that, actually, fans might quite enjoy hearing a familiar voice at this point in time. Among them is Laura Marling, who released her new album, Song for Our Daughter, in early April, several months ahead of schedule. While it has precisely nothing to do with the coronavirus, it\u2019s an album suited to the potential for self-reflection that this time can offer, finding Marling \u2013 the one-time teenage prodigy now 30 years old \u2013 assessing her history and landing upon a version of femininity that fits. \u201cThose first two albums were a woman thinking, \u2018Why is this my lot in life?\u2019\u201d she told the Independent recently. \u201cAs I\u2019ve got older, I\u2019ve changed that to: \u2018That won\u2019t be my lot in life. I won\u2019t be reduced to a cultural trope.\u2019 I was indulging in the tragedy, and now that I\u2019m 30, I\u2019ve put reins on those demons and I\u2019m driving them myself. I\u2019m not just a victim.\u201d On the album \u2013 her seventh \u2013 she projects these revelations on to her future daughter, wondering what kind of experiences she will have. It\u2019s classic Marling \u2013 rich with a sense of her own songwriterly mythology, both cryptic and bracing \u2013 yet also her most realised work yet. You can ask Marling about any of that, her collaborations with Tunng\u2019s Mike Lindsay as Lump, her love of Seinfeld, Little Women and Instagram comedy, taking inspiration from Paul McCartney\u2019s 1970s solo output \u2013 or indeed, anything else that takes your fancy \u2013 when she submits to the Guardian webchat experience from noon to 1pm BST on Tuesday 28 April. (Usually these take place in our office \u2013 the celeb unspooling their best yarns while Ben or I type frantically \u2013 but obviously, lockdown means it\u2019ll be a video chat-facilitated interaction.) Post your questions in the comments and we\u2019ll see you on Tuesday.",

People attending a number of drive-in facilities reported being left with no choice but to take their own swabs, having expected the procedure to be carried out by a trained professional. James Collins, a carer at a home for vulnerable adults in Lincoln who has been self-isolating with a cough, said he waited for five hours for a test at Robin Hood airport in Doncaster on Saturday after a two-hour round trip to get there. Collins, who described the experience as \u201cthe worst seven hours of my life\u201d, was surprised to be told to swab himself. \u201cI\u2019m scared I haven\u2019t done the test right,\u201d he said after testing negative. \u201cIf I wanted to do it myself I would have gone for a home test.\u201d At Doncaster and elsewhere, security guards patrolled the lanes warning motorists not to take photos or videos and not to open their windows. Drivers could communicate with marshals only by phone, using numbers written on signs. There were some portable toilets, but after a single use they were sealed, awaiting cleaning. Motorists waited in three separate queues before being handed their tests. Serco, which runs nine centres including Doncaster, said the longest recorded wait was two hours, adding: \u201cSerco is managing the site facilities at some of the Covid-19 test facilities. The sites are becoming increasingly busy and we are working hard to get people through the centres as quickly as possible.\u201d Anna Wittekind, a nutritionist who has been off work with chest and stomach pains for 12 days over the last month, said she and her husband, who works for the NHS, had waited three hours in the heat at a drive-in facility. Her result arrived quickly and was negative. \u201cI have no idea whether I managed to take a good enough swab, so it may have all been a waste of time,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt for the poor souls working there, but the organisation was abysmal.\u201d A worker at the Lighthouse laboratory in Milton Keynes, which was opened by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, this month as one of three \u201cmegalabs\u201d created to support the testing initiative, said she was concerned about safety and lost results. She claimed the lab, which is capable of processing up to 10,000 tests in 24 hours, had received hundreds of swabs in vials that either were leaking or were not sealed in two bags as required, meaning the couriers and technicians handling them risked contamination. Other swabs had arrived with labelling errors, so that the results were unlikely to reach the person tested. \u201cWe do feed these problems back to the test sites and some improve,\u201d she said, \u201cbut some are consistently poor and in some cases this goes beyond just making our lives difficult to actively endangering us or the reliability of results.\u201d Steve Fay, a physiotherapist in respiratory care in Leicester, said he was seen at a centre in Nottingham operated by Boots on 1 April. Having been told that the result would take up to two days, he was left waiting for more than a week. His wife, who works as an NHS nurse and had her test at the same time as him, had to wait even longer. After chasing with 14 emails, Fay was eventually referred to Deloitte, where he received a response from a management consultant in the firm\u2019s \u201crisk advisory\u201d team. \u201cI threatened to make this public when suddenly a reply in one hour and a result an hour later,\u201d said Fay. \u201cThe tests both came back as negative. Personally I\u2019m very doubtful of this test because we both had the symptoms.\u201d A spokesman for Deloitte said: \u201cDeloitte has a specialist health sector practice, which includes a large number of staff with operational healthcare experience. This is the group who is at the core of our work, supplemented where appropriate with individuals with technical skills relevant to the work we are doing.\u201d Boots said it managed the Nottingham site but had \u201cno role in processing the results\u201d. Sodexo said it too was not responsible for getting test results to workers. The Department of Health and Social Care, which is responsible for administering the national network, said the latest records showed more than 90% of people tested up to 21 April received their results within two days.",

      "bodyText": "The political whirlwind convulsing Brazilian politics has intensified with the supreme court approving an investigation into explosive allegations that the president, Jair Bolsonaro, illegally attempted to interfere in the federal police. \u201cThe president of the republic \u2026 is also subject to the laws, just like any other of the country\u2019s citizens,\u201d the supreme court judge Celso de Mello noted in his decision on Monday night. \u201cNo one, absolutely no one, is entitled to infringe and show contempt for our country\u2019s laws and constitution.\u201d In a separate blow, a judge gave the federal government 48 hours to hand over the results of two Covid-19 tests Bolsonaro took last month but has refused to publish. More than 20 members of a delegation Bolsonaro took to meet Donald Trump in early March were infected, fuelling suspicions that Brazil\u2019s president \u2013 whose handling of the coronavirus crisis has been widely criticised \u2013 had also been contaminated. Claims that Bolsonaro had improperly tried to meddle in Brazil\u2019s equivalent to the FBI were made last Friday by Sergio Moro, the outgoing justice minister. As he resigned from Bolsonaro\u2019s cabinet, Moro issued a potentially devastating parting shot: publicly accusing his former boss of wanting to replace the head of the federal police with someone more amenable to discussing police business and sharing intelligence reports with the president. \u201cI said this would be political interference and he said it would indeed be,\u201d claimed Moro, a former judge who many suspect harbours presidential ambitions of his own. Two prominent Brazilian newspapers, the Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo and Correio Braziliense, have claimed Bolsonaro\u2019s desire to remove the federal police director was driven by the knowledge that investigators examining the criminal dissemination of fake news were closing in on his son Carlos Bolsonaro. Federal police investigators in Rio de Janeiro are also investigating another of the president\u2019s sons, Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro, for suspected corruption and ties to Rio\u2019s mafia. On Tuesday, Bolsonaro\u2019s pick for the new federal police director was officially announced: the intelligence chief Alexandre Ramagem, who is a friend of Carlos Bolsonaro. The appointment is expected to face legal challenges. The far-right president and his sons deny the accusations against them. On Tuesday, Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo claimed Moro would hand audio recordings to investigators as part of the inquiry into the president\u2019s behaviour. The possible crimes for which Bolsonaro will be investigated reportedly include fraudulent misrepresentation, obstruction of justice and passive corruption. Moro will be investigated for so-called \u201ccrimes against honour and reputation\u201d, which include calumny and defamation. Bolsonaro\u2019s opponents \u2013 who decry his assaults on the environment, the arts and Brazil\u2019s democracy \u2013 hope the investigation could eventually provide grounds for his impeachment. A poll on Monday suggested nearly half of Brazilians wanted Bolsonaro to resign \u2013 up from 37% last month, while 38% thought it was impossible to trust anything he said. However, the poll also showed Bolsonaro continuing to enjoy the support of 33% of voters \u2013 a reality that suggests impeachment is unlikely in the short term. When the former leftist president, Dilma Rousseff, was impeached in 2016 her support had collapsed to only around 13%. \u201cHe has already committed numerous crimes of responsibility \u2013 but for impeachment you need votes,\u201d admitted Marcelo Freixo, a leftwing congressman from the Socialism and Liberty party. \u201cThe whole of the left in parliament has 134 representatives. Bolsonaro has 210 on his side,\u201d Freixo added. \u201cI favour impeachment but being in favour of impeachment isn\u2019t enough. You need the votes.\u201d Eliane Cantanh\u00eade, a columnist for the Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo, predicted Bolsonaro would pay a heavy price for creating a political crisis at the very moment Brazil needed to focus on the coronavirus pandemic, which has now killed 4,603 Brazilians. \u201cIt\u2019s insane ... It\u2019s almost as if he\u2019s asking to be impeached,\u201d she said. But Cantanh\u00eade said she still was not convinced there was currently enough political or public support for such a move. \u201cCan you imagine an impeachment at this juncture? It would be very, very traumatic \u2013 especially with the economy crumbling and everything upside down.\u201d Kim Kataguiri, a rightwing congressman who has been pushing for the release of Bolsonaro\u2019s coronavirus test results, said the Brazilian people had a right to the truth. \u201cThis is a matter of public interest and must not be hidden \u2026 We need clarity,\u201d said Kataguiri, who supported Bolsonaro before his 2018 election but has since turned on the president. Bolsonaro, who has faced global condemnation for repeatedly undermining the social distancing guidelines promoted by his own health ministry, made no immediate comment about the supreme court investigation. Instead the pro-gun populist ventured out of his presidential palace in the capital, Bras\u00edlia, on Tuesday to visit a shooting range. In a video later posted on his official Facebook page, a grinning Bolsonaro appeared examining a bullet-riddled target. \u201cPretty good, eh?\u201d he says.",

Marsha de Cordova, the shadow secretary of state for women and equalities, said it was unacceptable that people were having to choose accessing the internet and buying food. \u201cThere is no more crucial time to ensure that everyone is connected and has access to the digital services, wifi and resources that they need,\u201d she says. \u201cThe government must act now to reduce unequal provisions of phone and internet service during this crisis and ensure that no one is left behind as a result of digital exclusion.\u201d The government has recently launched a range of initiatives to try to tackle digital exclusion exacerbated by the pandemic. These include pledges to provide some disadvantaged teenagers with laptops and a new campaign, Devicesdotnow, that asks businesses to donate devices, sims and mobile hotspots. \u201cWe recognise the importance of people being connected and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve already taken action to broker a major deal with the mobile and broadband companies to provide essential support for vulnerable consumers who may be affected by coronavirus,\u201d said a spokesperson for the the department of digital, culture, media and sport. Yet anti-poverty groups such as the Aple Collective, a network of people who have experienced poverty, say not enough is being done. \u201cWe welcome the positive and compassionate moves being made by government and the telecommunications industry to seek to buffer the effects of Covid-19 on those on low incomes,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cHowever, what is little mentioned so far are the voices and responses from those who are completely excluded from the digital world.\u201d",

Other countries such as France have plans to ban dividends from companies receiving state support. \u201cThere is no room for profits when precious resources are scarce and our key workers are on the frontline fighting the pandemic \u2013 with many losing their lives in the call of duty,\u201d said Rehana Azam, national secretary at the GMB union, which represents some healthcare workers. David Hare, the chief executive of the Independent Healthcare Providers Network, a lobby group for the industry, said: \u201cAs part of the recent historic deal whereby independent hospitals have put nearly all their capacity at the disposal of the NHS in responding to coronavirus, the public should be reassured that these additional resources are being reimbursed \u2018at cost\u2019 meaning no profit will be made.\u201d Private hospitals owners and shareholders, their lenders and landlords stand to benefit from the deal more than the NHS, according to Vivek Kotecha, a researcher at the Centre for Health and the Public Interest, an independent thinktank. He said the deal was \u201cin effect a bailout\u201d and warned that the companies may still be able to pay bonuses once the NHS had ceded control. Shares in Spire Healthcare Group, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, surged after the deal was announced in March. It acknowledged that the deal would provide it \u201csufficient liquidity and financial stability\u201d to weather the outbreak, leaving it in a \u201cstrong position\u201d to bounce back when it can restart non-NHS treatments. The Department of Health and Social Care declined to comment.",

April\u2019s monthly health check of high street and online sales from the CBI reported that two-thirds of businesses had been adversely affected by the pandemic and almost all said they were experiencing cashflow problems. The employers\u2019 organisation\u2019s distributive trades survey polled 70 retailers in the three weeks after the UK economy\u2019s enforced closure was announced and found that 71% said activity was down on a year earlier, compared with 16% reporting an increase. The balance of \u201355 points was the joint lowest since the survey was first published in 1983 and only matched by December 2008, shortly after the near-collapse of the global banking system.

A balance of -54 percentage points said they anticipated a fall in annual sales in May \u2013 the weakest expectations in the survey\u2019s history. According to the survey, which was carried out between 27 March and 15 April: 67% of retailers said the Covid-19 outbreak was having a significant negative impact on their sales. 39% of retailers reported a total shutdown of UK activity due to the outbreak. 44% of retailers reported furloughing staff, while 8% reported permanent staff layoffs. 96% of retailers reported cashflow difficulties, with 40% facing difficulties meeting tax liabilities.

The collapse in oil demand due to the coronavirus pandemic drove BP to a $628m (\u00a3505m) loss for the first quarter, compared with a profit of $2bn in the same period last year. BP said the \u201cexceptionally challenging\u201d market conditions caused the company\u2019s underlying replacement cost profits, its preferred profit metric, to tumble by two-thirds to $791m for the quarter compared with $2.35bn last year. The oil giant told investors it faces an \u201cexceptional level of uncertainty\u201d and the risk of \u201cmore sustained consequences\u201d ahead, including higher debt, lower spending and cuts to its workforce.

The oil market crisis, which has caused prices to plummet to 21-year lows and even turn negative in the US, has emerged as BP prepares to undertake a major corporate overhaul to push it towards an ambition to be \u2018net zero\u2019 by 2050. Looney told the Guardian that no BP employees will leave the company over the next three months although job cuts are expected by the end of the year as part of the planned restructuring which remains on track.

      "bodyText": "On the 14th day of each month, the relatives of some of those who died in the collapse of Genoa\u2019s Morandi bridge tie flowers to railings close to the site of the disaster. \u201cWe live in different places and so haven\u2019t always managed to get there every month,\u201d said Egle Possetti, whose sister, brother-in-law, niece and nephew were among the 43 killed on 14 August 2018. \u201cBut there\u2019s a woman in Genoa who brings flowers on behalf of all of us.\u201d Only March was skipped, owing to Italy going into the coronavirus lockdown, while on 14 April the woman who brings the flowers did so wearing a face mask. The tribute has brought a regular reminder of the tragedy to the team of more than 500 building a new bridge in the coastal city, who on Tuesday inaugurated the structure in a ceremony led by the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, after the last 44-metre span was hoisted into place. It is expected to open to traffic in July. Work on the site continued during the peak of the pandemic, albeit under strict safety regulations, on what is considered a strategic commercial project linking Italy to France. Construction had begun in earnest in August 2019 shortly after what remained of the bridge was demolished. Its completion provides a rare moment of hope in a country where nearly 27,000 have died from coronavirus. \u201cGenoa is a model for Italy,\u201d Conte said on Tuesday. \u201cAnd it teaches us that the greatest act of love is when we commit to restarting together. Genoa radiates a light that gives hope to the whole of Italy.\u201d Drawings for the new bridge were donated by Renzo Piano, the Genoa-born architect who designed the Shard in London. Piano\u2019s design for the structure, stretching 1km across the Polcevera valley, includes solar panels mounted along each side to generate electricity needed to power its lights and sensors. Experts and residents long had concerns over the safety of its predecessor for decades before its collapse and the new bridge\u2019s safety and durability has been prioritised, with robots deployed to inspect its solidity and conduct regular maintenance. \u201cSince construction began, we have been working day and night.

Coronaviruses are a large family of them which may cause illness in animals or humans. , 2:A - The virus itself is called Sars-CoV-2. The disease it causes in humans is named Covid-19. WHO guidelines advise against naming diseases after geographical regions or specific animals, to avoid stigmatisation. This is why it was controversial when some world leaders insisted on referring to Covid-19 as the 'Chinese virus' or 'Wuhan flu' after the city where it was first encountered, 3:C - The 19 is a designation of when the virus was identified, 4:C - The WHO website states: 'Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment. Around 1 out of every 5 people who gets Covid-19 becomes seriously ill'. However, this number can, of course, only be calculated using the information that we have on the number of people who have tested positive, so it may not be accurate if there are large numbers of infected but untested people in the population., 5:C - Blurred vision is not listed by the WHO as a symptom. However, it does appear that the coronavirus can affect the human senses - many people who have had the illness have reported losing their sense of taste and/or smell., 6:B - Soap loosens the lipids in the virus membrane, causing its structure to collapse and making the virus inactive. Alcohol-based hand sanitiser is still useful for removing the virus if soap and warm water is unavailable, but it is not as effective, 7:B - That's tiny, to say the least. , 8:C - When virus-ridden particles are inhaled they come into contact with cells lining the throat and larynx. These cells have large numbers of receptors \u2013 known as Ace-2 receptors \u2013 on their surfaces and the virus locks on to these, 9:A - RNA is found in nature as a single strand folded on to itself, rather than a paired double strand like DNA, 10:A - Yes, it has been detected on a surface up to three days after initial contamination according to one study - and as long as seven days according to another. That's why it is important to keep washing your hands, and to avoid touching your face as much as possible, 11:C - Correct. Ebola is not caused by a type of coronavirus. Sars is a pneumonia-like coronavirus that first emerged in 2002. Eight months later it had resulted in 8,098 cases and 774 deaths in 26 countries. Mers developed in 2012 and has so far caused around 2,500 cases and more than 800 deaths., 12:C - The R number is the effective reproduction number. An R number above one means that for every person with the virus, on average more than one other person will catch it. This leads to runaway growth of the virus within the population. Governments want an R number of less than one, which means some infected people are not passing on the virus, and this will slow and reduce its spread., 13:A - The infection comes in via the airways and spreads to the lungs. The more dangerous symptoms are caused when dead cells and antibodies flood the lungs with fluid and debris while trying to fight off the virus. This drastically reduces the amount of oxygen that can be supplied to the rest of the body. However, there is increasing evidence of the virus causing damage to other organs, particularly the heart, 14:A - It does now. The advice has changed. In the UK, the NHS says: 'The Commission on Human Medicines has now confirmed there is no clear evidence that using ibuprofen to treat symptoms such as a high temperature makes coronavirus worse. You can take paracetamol or ibuprofen to treat symptoms of coronavirus. Try paracetamol first if you can, as it has fewer side effects than ibuprofen and is the safer choice for most people.'</p>\n    <h3 class=\"quiz__scores-title\">Scores</h3>\n    <ol class=\"quiz__scores\" data-result-groups-length=\"3\">\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\"Excellent effort\" data-share=\"I got _/_ in the Guardian coronavirus quiz\" data-min-score=\"6\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">6 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\">Excellent effort</p></li>\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\"Could do better\" data-share=\"I got _/_ in the Guardian coronavirus quiz\" data-min-score=\"0\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">0 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\">Could do better</p></li>\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\"Great result - you've clearly been paying attention\" data-share=\"I got _/_ in the Guardian coronavirus quiz\" data-min-score=\"11\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">11 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\">Great result - you've clearly been paying attention</p></li>\n    </ol>\n   </div> \n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>There</em><em> are no prizes \u2013 the quiz is just a different way to present some of </em><em>the facts from our </em><em>explanatory content in a </em><em>way that might surprise you or refresh your memory.

As of 23 April, more than 21,800 healthcare workers had contracted the coronavirus and 71 have died, according to a House education and labor committee staffer briefed by the CDC.</p> <p>The allowance for surgical masks made more sense when scientists initially thought the virus was spread by large droplets.

      "bodyText": "With crucial protective gear in short supply, federal authorities are saying health workers can wear lower-grade surgical masks while treating Covid-19 patients \u2013 but growing evidence suggests the practice is putting workers in jeopardy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently said surgical masks are \u201can acceptable alternative\u201d to highly protective N95 respirators unless workers are performing intubations or other procedures on patients with Covid-19 that could unleash high volumes of virus particles. But scholars, not-for-profit leaders and former regulators in the specialized field of occupational safety say relying on surgical masks \u2013 which are considerably less protective than N95 respirators \u2013 is almost certainly fueling illness among frontline health workers, who probably make up about 11% of all known Covid-19 cases. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt in my mind that that\u2019s one of the reasons that so many healthcare workers are getting sick and many are dying,\u201d said Jonathan Rosen, a health and safety expert who advises unions, states and the federal government. As of 23 April, more than 21,800 healthcare workers had contracted the coronavirus and 71 have died, according to a House education and labor committee staffer briefed by the CDC. The allowance for surgical masks made more sense when scientists initially thought the virus was spread by large droplets. But a growing body of research shows that it is spread by minuscule viral particles that can linger in the air as long as 16 hours. A properly fitted N95 respirator will block 95% of tiny air particles \u2013 down to 0.3 micron in diameter, which are the hardest to catch \u2013 from reaching the wearer\u2019s face. But surgical masks, designed to protect patients from a surgeon\u2019s respiratory droplets, aren\u2019t effective at blocking particles smaller than 100 microns, according to the mask maker 3M. A Covid-19 particle is smaller than 0.1 micron, according to South Korean researchers, and can pass through a surgical mask. The CDC\u2019s recent advice on surgical masks contrasts with another CDC web page that says surgical masks do \u201cNOT provide the wearer with a reliable level of protection from inhaling smaller airborne particles and is not considered respiratory protection\u201d. Research from other nations hit hard by the virus confirms the concern. A report published earlier this month examined data from two hospitals in South Korea, and found that surgical masks \u201cseem to be ineffective in preventing the dissemination\u201d of coronavirus particles. A 2013 Chinese study found that twice as many health workers, 17%, contracted a respiratory illness if they wore only a surgical mask while treating sick patients, compared with 7% who continuously used an N95, per a study in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. Yet many health facilities, citing the CDC guidelines and scarce supply, are providing N95s in only limited medical settings. Earlier this month, the national Teamsters Union reported that 64% of its healthcare worker membership \u2013 which includes people working in nursing homes, hospitals and other medical facilities \u2013 could not get N95 masks. At Michigan Medicine, one of the largest hospitals in the state, employees don\u2019t get N95s except for performing specific procedures on Covid-positive patients \u2013 such as intubating \u2013 or treating them in the ICU, said Katie Scott, an RN at the hospital and vice-president of the Michigan Nurses Association. Employees who otherwise treat Covid-19 patients receive surgical masks. That matches CDC protocol, but leaves nurses like Scott \u2013 who has read the research on surgical masks versus N95s \u2013 feeling exposed. \u201cWe are at a risk of getting this virus and we are at a risk of bringing it home to our families,\u201d Scott said. At Michigan Medicine, employees are not allowed to bring in their own protective equipment, according to a complaint the nurses\u2019 union filed with the Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Scott said friends and family have mailed her personal protective equipment (PPE), including N95 masks. It sits at home while she cares for patients. \u201cTo think I\u2019m going to work and am leaving this mask at home on my kitchen table, because the employer won\u2019t let me wear it,\u201d Scott said. \u201cYou feel sacrificial in a way.\u201d News reports from Kentucky to Florida to California have documented nurses facing retaliation or pressure to step down when they have brought their own N95 respirators. A spokesperson for Michigan Medicine declined to answer questions about the hospital\u2019s protective equipment protocols. In New York, the center of the US\u2019s outbreak, nurses across the state report receiving surgical masks, not N95s, to wear when treating Covid-19 patients, according to a court affidavit submitted by Lisa Baum, the lead occupational health and safety representative for the New York State Nurses Association (NYSNA). So far, at least 16 NYSNA members have died from the coronavirus, and more than 1,000 have tested positive, according to union estimates. National Nurses United has pushed Washington lawmakers to pass legislation that would ramp up production of N95s by compelling the White House to invoke the Defense Production Act, a Korean war-era law that allows the federal government, in an emergency, to direct private business in the production and distribution of goods. It is also calling on Congress to require that Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Osha) put forth an emergency temporary standard to mandate that employers provide healthcare workers with protective equipment, including N95s masks, when they interact with patients suspected to have Covid-19. \u201cNurses are not afraid to care for our patients if we have the right protections,\u201d said Bonnie Castillo, the executive director of National Nurses United, \u201cbut we\u2019re not martyrs sacrificing our lives because our government and our employers didn\u2019t do their job.\u201d",

And if no one was going to blow the bugle, I would feel much better if I was a bugle blower last December and January \u2026 I would feel better sitting here today saying, \u2018I blew the bugle about Wuhan province in January.\u2019 I can\u2019t say that.\u201d Cuomo\u2019s handling of the outbreak has nonetheless met with widespread approval, even fueling talk of an unlikely presidential run \u2013 speculation he has consistently turned down. The governor has given daily media briefings widely praised and contrasted with those delivered by Donald Trump at the White House, and demonstrated a grip on governance of his state that has kept it on lockdown while he manages its often fractious relationship with the federal government. Still, questions are increasingly being asked about whether New York\u2019s heavy death toll might have been avoided. Cuomo first voiced fears the New York healthcare system would be overwhelmed but that has not turned out to be so. \u201cI don\u2019t think New Yorkers feel or Americans feel that government failed them here,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cI think they feel good about what government has done \u2026 their healthcare system did respond. This was not Italy, with all due respect \u2026 There were not people in hallways who didn\u2019t get healthcare treatment.\u201d Cuomo also said he thought the US would be better prepared for the next such public health crisis. \u201cThis will change society,\u201d he said. \u201cSociety will not allow this to happen again. They will want to be more prepared. They will want to move more quickly. And government will follow that social instinct.\u201d Cuomo is now considering how to reopen the state economy, a process he has indicated will be done in stages.",

      "body": "<p>It might seem a bit basic to choose a Roald Dahl classic as the book I most loved as a kid. I might have picked something a bit more obscure, a little more erudite. Is there a War and Peace for under-10s? And if so, why aren\u2019t I pretending that I devoured it?</p> <p>But the truth is, The Twits \u2013 the bright yellow of my 1982 Puffin edition in particular \u2013 is the book most seared into my early memory. Intriguingly, because I am not someone who has taken to audiobooks, I was introduced to The Twits by my sister who read it to me; clearly my enjoyment was not diluted by that fact. My sister read while we were in the back of a car driving down a motorway. (Even typing that makes me feel nauseous. Perhaps children are immune to the seasickness of words unanchored on a page?)</p> <p>I know that it was night-black outside and raining heavily, and that we were hours late, after getting lost on the way back from a weekend camping trip. The panic of my father radiating in the car like cologne; The Twits being read to me as distraction.</p> <p>What did I love so much about it? That first time, the sheer <em>antics</em>. The book is skinnier than a newspaper produced in coronavirus times, but its 87 pages pack in japes galore and an overstuffed box of pranks. Not to put too fine a point on it, but I am someone who will print out giant photographs of my own face and stick them to the walls of my boss\u2019s office when she\u2019s out. I am 30 years old.</p> <p>The tricks Dahl\u2019s characters play are not so benign, of course. The book is the story of a married couple, Mr and Mrs Twit, who despise each other. They are spiteful and vindictive and both hideously ugly but \u2013 an important lesson here \u2013 they are physically disgusting because their inner souls are awful. As Dahl puts it: \u201cIf a person has ugly thoughts, it begins to show on the face \u2026 A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly.\u201d</p> <p>The only joy the Twits get is from doing the dirty on each other, playing grotesque tricks including mixing worms into spaghetti, throwing frogs into the other\u2019s bed, and lengthen their chair legs to make it appear as though one has shrunk. They are horrid to each other, but in thoroughly entertaining ways. </p> <p>The adult me is a great fan of dark humour and I do wonder if this budding element of my personality was what responded to The Twits. Knowing much more about Dahl now, the undeniably unpalatable elements of his person such as his <a href=\"https://www.theweek.co.uk/97631/was-roald-dahl-anti-semitic\">well documented antisemitism</a>, make it slightly more difficult to appreciate the dark undercurrents in his fiction.

      "bodyText": "It might seem a bit basic to choose a Roald Dahl classic as the book I most loved as a kid. I might have picked something a bit more obscure, a little more erudite. Is there a War and Peace for under-10s? And if so, why aren\u2019t I pretending that I devoured it? But the truth is, The Twits \u2013 the bright yellow of my 1982 Puffin edition in particular \u2013 is the book most seared into my early memory. Intriguingly, because I am not someone who has taken to audiobooks, I was introduced to The Twits by my sister who read it to me; clearly my enjoyment was not diluted by that fact. My sister read while we were in the back of a car driving down a motorway. (Even typing that makes me feel nauseous. Perhaps children are immune to the seasickness of words unanchored on a page?) I know that it was night-black outside and raining heavily, and that we were hours late, after getting lost on the way back from a weekend camping trip. The panic of my father radiating in the car like cologne; The Twits being read to me as distraction. What did I love so much about it? That first time, the sheer antics. The book is skinnier than a newspaper produced in coronavirus times, but its 87 pages pack in japes galore and an overstuffed box of pranks. Not to put too fine a point on it, but I am someone who will print out giant photographs of my own face and stick them to the walls of my boss\u2019s office when she\u2019s out. I am 30 years old. The tricks Dahl\u2019s characters play are not so benign, of course. The book is the story of a married couple, Mr and Mrs Twit, who despise each other. They are spiteful and vindictive and both hideously ugly but \u2013 an important lesson here \u2013 they are physically disgusting because their inner souls are awful. As Dahl puts it: \u201cIf a person has ugly thoughts, it begins to show on the face \u2026 A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly.\u201d The only joy the Twits get is from doing the dirty on each other, playing grotesque tricks including mixing worms into spaghetti, throwing frogs into the other\u2019s bed, and lengthen their chair legs to make it appear as though one has shrunk. They are horrid to each other, but in thoroughly entertaining ways. The adult me is a great fan of dark humour and I do wonder if this budding element of my personality was what responded to The Twits. Knowing much more about Dahl now, the undeniably unpalatable elements of his person such as his well documented antisemitism, make it slightly more difficult to appreciate the dark undercurrents in his fiction. But I definitely found the macabre, sinister and disturbing aspects of his work refreshing. There are lighter elements too, because Dahl was so good at this mix of light and shade. Rereading The Twits now, I was reminded that there is also a lesson in it: how we can overcome our differences and achieve common goals by being kind to one another. In the book, a family of former circus monkeys trapped in a cage befriends a treeful of birds, and warns them when they are in danger (and vice versa). There are other books of Dahl\u2019s I remember enjoying as a child: George\u2019s Marvellous Medicine (my second favourite), Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, James and the Giant Peach (originally, by the way, a giant cherry), and very much so, his memoir, Boy.

It also supports eradication of existing diseases such as malaria and polio and promotes global public health.</p>\n    <p>While its role on emerging diseases is most familiar in the developed world, its practical involvement is far more marked in the global south, where it has been working to expand basic healthcare, support vaccination and sustain weak and often stressed health systems through its emergencies programmes.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why is the WHO under fire from Trump?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Trump has presented the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/against-humanity-trump-condemned-for-who-funding-freeze\">freezing of US funding to the WHO</a>&nbsp;as a direct response to what he claims was its slow reaction in raising the alarm over the global threat from the coronavirus and being too \u201cChina-centric\u201d in its response. The allegation that the WHO was slow to warn of the risk of human-to-human transmission, and that it failed to cross-examine Chinese transparency early on, is largely not borne out by the evidence. And the organisation\u2019s funding was already in his sights on 7 February,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/02/10/trump-world-health-organization-funding-coronavirus-state-department-usaid-budget-cuts/\">when his administration was suggesting cutting the US contribution</a>&nbsp;by half.</p>\n    <p>The WHO, to whom the US theoretically contributes roughly 10-15% of its budget as its largest contributor, has been appealing for an extra $1bn to help fight the coronavirus. While the suspension of funding by the US for 60-90 days is relatively small \u2013 not least because the US is so far in arrears in its annual payments \u2013 the potential for a general US withdrawal from global health funding under the cover of this announcement would be very serious and felt most profoundly in places that need the most support.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterbeaumont\"><b>Peter Beaumont</b></a>&nbsp;<i>and</i>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\"><b>Sarah Boseley</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThis is an entire generation\u2019s appointment with destiny. No one can be truly safe unless the disease is tackled, wherever it takes hold,\u201d Brown said.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf we are to stop this in its tracks, our interventions will only be as effective as the weakest link in the global chain. So, if any issue is a candidate for multilateral global action, then it must be our response to this pandemic.\u201d</p> \n<p>Brown, Labour prime minister between 2007 and 2010, has helped organise a virtual pledging conference next Monday and persuaded seven major funders \u2013 the UK, the EU, France, Germany, Japan, Norway and Saudi Arabia \u2013 to take part.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2dc9bd5a070de583bce359a30df6705f95a2ce89\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2dc9bd5a070de583bce359a30df6705f95a2ce89/0_354_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gordon Brown\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gordon Brown: \u2018This is an entire generation\u2019s appointment with destiny\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The summit was agreed following a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/coronavirus-global-leaders-urge-g20-to-tackle-twin-health-and-economic-crises\">recent letter</a> \u2013 signed by 200 economists, health professionals, former presidents and prime ministers \u2013 urging far greater global cooperation.</p> \n<p>Brown added that the world was on the cusp of a \u201clife or death\u201d moment and it was vital that the US and China supported the plan to pay for vaccines, test kits and treatments in developing countries.</p> \n<p>Thirty-four countries in Africa spend less than $200 a head per year on healthcare, and the former prime minister said they needed help to improve their health systems.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Failure to come up with a multilateral response would risk the pandemic taking hold in poorer parts of the world and subsequently being reimported into richer nations.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe health of each depends on the health of all. Local solutions everywhere are only as good as the global response,\u201d Brown said.</p> \n<p>\u201cTo that end, we must outlaw the ugly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/25/once-we-have-a-vaccine-how-will-it-be-shared-fairly-around-the-world\">\u2018vaccine nationalism\u2019</a> that seems to be setting in. Restricting new vaccines to those who can afford them will condemn millions to enduring multiple waves of the illness. We must also crack down on medical piracy, whereby, instead of joining a coordinated international effort to increase their global supply, a few countries seek, by whatever means, to monopolise testing kits, ventilators and personal protective equipment.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>So far, poor countries have not been as badly hit by the pandemic as advanced countries, but the United Nations has estimated that Covid-19 could cost between 300,000 and 3 million lives in Africa.</p> \n<p>Brown said: \u201cWhile America and China are offering bilateral aid, they are sitting out the main push for global health coordination.</p> \n<p>\u201cGlobal interventions may feel far removed from the tasks we all face as individuals, families and local communities in getting through this crisis.

      "bodyText": "Gordon Brown has challenged Donald Trump and Xi Jinping to recognise the \u201cdeadly urgency\u201d of joining a global push to help poor countries combat Covid-19 and warned the world\u2019s two biggest economies that go-it-alone strategies will end in failure. The former prime minister \u2013 who orchestrated the international response to the global financial crisis of 2008-09 \u2013 said Washington and Beijing could not afford to sit out a multilateral effort designed to raise $8bn (\u00a36.4bn) to strengthen the health systems of developing nations. \u201cThis is an entire generation\u2019s appointment with destiny. No one can be truly safe unless the disease is tackled, wherever it takes hold,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIf we are to stop this in its tracks, our interventions will only be as effective as the weakest link in the global chain. So, if any issue is a candidate for multilateral global action, then it must be our response to this pandemic.\u201d Brown, Labour prime minister between 2007 and 2010, has helped organise a virtual pledging conference next Monday and persuaded seven major funders \u2013 the UK, the EU, France, Germany, Japan, Norway and Saudi Arabia \u2013 to take part. The summit was agreed following a recent letter \u2013 signed by 200 economists, health professionals, former presidents and prime ministers \u2013 urging far greater global cooperation. Brown added that the world was on the cusp of a \u201clife or death\u201d moment and it was vital that the US and China supported the plan to pay for vaccines, test kits and treatments in developing countries. Thirty-four countries in Africa spend less than $200 a head per year on healthcare, and the former prime minister said they needed help to improve their health systems. Failure to come up with a multilateral response would risk the pandemic taking hold in poorer parts of the world and subsequently being reimported into richer nations. \u201cThe health of each depends on the health of all. Local solutions everywhere are only as good as the global response,\u201d Brown said. \u201cTo that end, we must outlaw the ugly \u2018vaccine nationalism\u2019 that seems to be setting in. Restricting new vaccines to those who can afford them will condemn millions to enduring multiple waves of the illness. We must also crack down on medical piracy, whereby, instead of joining a coordinated international effort to increase their global supply, a few countries seek, by whatever means, to monopolise testing kits, ventilators and personal protective equipment.\u201d So far, poor countries have not been as badly hit by the pandemic as advanced countries, but the United Nations has estimated that Covid-19 could cost between 300,000 and 3 million lives in Africa. Brown said: \u201cWhile America and China are offering bilateral aid, they are sitting out the main push for global health coordination. \u201cGlobal interventions may feel far removed from the tasks we all face as individuals, families and local communities in getting through this crisis. But if governments do not see beyond their borders and do more to coordinate an international response, we will all suffer.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Campaigners said they would press the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to publish in full a secret review of the UK\u2019s preparations to deal with a flu-like pandemic after a partial leak revealed it had warned the country was not ready to cope. Exercise Cygnus, a 2016 dry run to test how the UK would respond, specifically warned that social care would struggle in a pandemic crisis but did not discuss in detail the need for testing or protective equipment for carers. Elements of the 57-page document were leaked to the Sun on Tuesday but the full document remains secret, prompting renewed calls from an NHS doctor, Moosa Qureshi, and his lawyers Leigh Day for the government to release it without delay. According to the newspaper, the report\u2019s author, Helen Shirley-Quirk, the then director for emergency preparedness and health protection policy at the Department of Health, wrote: \u201cThe UK\u2019s preparedness and response is not currently sufficient to cope with the extreme demands of a severe pandemic.\u201d The full document, written in 2017, recognised that a pandemic outbreak was \u201cthe most significant civil emergency risk\u201d facing the UK. It was shared around the government, but ministers have refused to make it public amid concerns that its conclusions could frighten the public. Cygnus took place over three days in October 2016 and was led by Dame Sally Davies, the then chief medical officer for England. The document concluded: \u201cThe exercise did show that the UK\u2019s capability to respond to a worst case pandemic influenza should be critically reviewed.\u201d Campaigners led by Qureshi, a member of the whistleblowers campaign group 54000 Doctors, first called for Cygnus to be made public over the weekend, arguing that publication would allow the public to see whether its recommendations had been properly followed through. A crowdfunding page to help commence judicial review proceedings has already raised more than \u00a333,000 of the \u00a350,000 required to meet legal fees. Members of Qureshi\u2019s legal team indicated that the latest leaks highlighted the need to get the full document into the public domain. \u201cThe Government\u2019s position is now untenable,\u201d Qureshi added. Hancock told LBC radio on Tuesday morning that he had been advised by officials that the lessons of Cygnus had been taken on board, when reports of the existence of the secret exercise began circulating a month ago. \u201cI asked my officials to go back when this first came up in the press a few weeks ago and check that everything that was recommended was done and that\u2019s the assurance that I got,\u201d the minister said, adding the exercise took place \u201cbefore my time\u201d, when Jeremy Hunt was health secretary. The latest leak includes some further details. Cygnus warned that social care could be at risk of collapse, partly because it was expected that the NHS would discharge elderly patients into increasingly crowded care homes. It concluded that an NHS under severe pressure would have to concentrate its efforts on treating younger and fitter patients through a process of \u201cpopulation triage\u201d \u2013 and that as many of half of health service staff could be off sick. But there was only one reference to personal protective equipment \u2013 a recommendation that more distribution points were needed around the country \u2013 suggesting the issue that has dogged the NHS in the current crisis was not deemed a high priority in the dummy exercise. Hancock said the UK\u2019s preparations were \u201cwere amongst the most extensive in the world\u201d. But he added there were also limits to what could be done in advance, particularly given that Cygnus was focused on a future outbreak of flu, not coronavirus. \u201cYou can\u2019t prepare for a virus that is itself new by its nature,\u201d the minister said.",

Nature\u2019s role in the wellbeing and happiness of billions of people will be more important than ever. While urbanisation is a major driver of biodiversity loss,&nbsp;many conservationists and town planners are trying to make built-up areas more nature-friendly. The role of green spaces in urban areas has even been formalised in a draft UN agreement to halt and reverse biodiversity loss, often referred to as the Paris agreement for nature.<br></p>\n    <p>The Covid-19 outbreak has seen cities and towns across the world go into lockdown which has enabled wildlife such as wild boar, deer, monkeys, foxes and even lions to venture into territory previously dominated by humans. It has also offered us the chance to notice and appreciate the natural world in cities in an unprecedented way.<br></p>\n    <p>In this special series of reports we'll be looking at how animals and plants adapt to city life, what to look out for right now and how we can encourage more wild cities in the future.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Since lockdown, gardening has turned into a survival impulse.

The death is crazy, how people are dying all over the world. In our lifetime we haven\u2019t seen anything like this \u2026 My wish is that this is a true shift, and that people go out and design the lives they want to live.\u201d The transition will take time. \u201cThis is not Jack and the beanstalk, you don\u2019t throw the seed in the ground and then two days later you have a peach tree. That\u2019s the thing \u2013 people need to realise that,\u201d says Finley, who estimates that the City of Los Angeles owns 26 square miles of vacant land \u2013 equivalent to 20 Central Parks. For Finley, self-isolation means getting lots of jobs done in the garden. Some things he can control (such as bearded iris, which are in bloom) and some things he can\u2019t (pesky cabbage moths). He didn\u2019t expect his 2010 protest to end up like this. \u201cThe world came to me,\u201d he says. In light of the pandemic, governments must invest more in encouraging people to be self-sustaining, he says. \u201cI don\u2019t like to use \u2018hope\u2019, I like to use the word \u2018opportunity\u2019. To hell with hope. It\u2019s not for hope to change it. It\u2019s the opportunity to make shit happen \u2026 A lot of the governments and municipalities need to put money into this, which they haven\u2019t,\u201d he says. Hyper-local planting is a reminder that life continues \u2013 it\u2019s a distraction that can help maintain mental and physical health in a time when just popping out for milk could be deadly. \u201cPeople looked at my garden like \u2018your little hobby\u2019 or something, now people realise this is no damn hobby, this is life and death. This is our revolution,\u201d says Finley.

      "body": "<p><br>Three days before the UK went into lockdown and the world changed beyond all recognition, I had to catch a train from London to Edinburgh with my six-year-old autistic son, two-year-old daughter and partner. We were travelling back to Scotland a week later than planned after a harrowing visit with my parents. My mother, who has metastatic breast cancer, had ended up in intensive care just as the first UK deaths from coronavirus were being announced. She was still in hospital when we left. Now, somehow, I needed to make the magical transformation from daughter to mother, get my head in gear and get my children home before the journey I had been routinely making for 20 years became, at worst, impossible or, at best, freighted with risk.</p> <p>Two days earlier, my partner had tried to take him home to give me a little more time with my mum, but at King\u2019s Cross he had a meltdown and refused to get on the train. It is perhaps one of the great understatements of my life to say that my nerves were jangling.</p> <p>The usual questions replayed on a loop composed by anxiety. Would he get in the taxi or run away? (He would get in the taxi.) Would he be able to cope with the sensory overload of the platforms at King\u2019s Cross? (Yes.) Would there be time to grab a coffee and sandwich? (Of course not.) Now, suddenly, there was a new strain of questions. Would the train be too busy for us to keep our distance from other passengers? Would there be handwash in the toilets, and would we be able to get our son to use it? And when we got home, would we be able to get the handful of foods he eats or would the Birds Eye Chicken Dippers have been emptied from Tesco?</p> <p>We families of autistic children are a resilient bunch. We have learned the high art of appearing calm as we work our arses off to make this noisy, intolerant and unpredictable world habitable for our children. We are like the people who paint the rooms before the Queen enters them, forever one step ahead of our little rulers, trying to make their passage through life smoother, better, happier. We are fighters. And it turns out these skills are extremely handy in a global pandemic.</p> <p>Self-isolation is, for many families, an overdramatic descriptor of daily life. Physical distancing often comes with the territory. My son used to have a habit of screaming, \u201cSAY GOODBYE!\u201d to any friend I ran in to on the street until I had no choice but to carry out his orders. Don\u2019t get me wrong. He loves people, but he needs to know when they\u2019re coming.</p> <p>His passions before the pandemic were school, a special-needs family swimming session every Saturday, watching the trains from a nearby McDonald\u2019s car park with a McFlurry and chips, the play park, the local ice-cream shop and going to visit \u201cAjji and Tata\u201d (my parents) in London. None of this is possible now. And like many autistic people, my son struggles with change and chronology. So according to neurotypical reasoning, life under lockdown would be especially hard for him. This is why it\u2019s a relief that the UK coronavirus rules have been relaxed for people with autism and learning disabilities, which means families like ours can leave our homes for exercise more than once a day and travel beyond our local area if necessary. And sometimes, for us, it is. My son might be pro-physical distancing as a rule of thumb, but he doesn\u2019t know how to keep two metres apart from anyone. He has a deep sensory love of running his body and hands along railings and walls. The world is now a minefield.</p> <p>Yet he is coping brilliantly. New routines have been laid down, quickly and organically. Every day he scoots three circuits of our local park with his \u201cbabuga\u201d (our son\u2019s name for his other mother: its etymological root is \u201cbike\u201d\u2026 don\u2019t ask). He doesn\u2019t notice people wearing masks, perhaps because he struggles with facial recognition, perhaps because this simply isn\u2019t the way his brain identifies humans. In the morning, we act out The Tiger Who Came to Tea in his bedroom (his sister is daddy, I\u2019m the tiger, my son, naturally, is EVERYONE). In the afternoon he jumps up and down on our coal box, and we shout at him ineffectually. He says hello to Ajji and Tata on the phone: my mother is back at home thanks to the everyday miracle of NHS social care we are only now beginning to acknowledge. There is screen time, the building of train tracks and ceaseless reciting of the alphabet.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>His autistic logic results in a Zen-like acceptance of our new reality that no mindfulness course could teach</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I wouldn\u2019t call any of it home-schooling exactly, unless doing a roly-poly on to a cherry tomato is on the curriculum, but his progress continues at its own idiosyncratic and spellbinding pace. And witnessing the flowering of my son\u2019s relationship with his sister has been one of the happiest experiences of my life. As well as being deeply challenging, lockdown is a tender lesson in what really matters not just to my son but to all small children. Home. The family unit. A cup of popcorn on the sofa in front of Paddington 2. The little things. We never did big birthday parties or trips to the museum so this collective simplifying of our days is already familiar to us. What\u2019s amazing is not how much is lost, but how much is gained when restrictions are imposed upon us.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll go back to school on \u2026 Monday? Tuesday?\u201d This is what my son says every day, though it\u2019s unclear if he is genuinely asking or just likes the repetition of the days of the week. The point is he\u2019s fine with it. School is closed. It would be impossible for him to go until it\u2019s open again. And that\u2019s that. His autistic logic results in a Zen-like acceptance of our new reality that no mindfulness course could teach. Meanwhile, my neurotypical two-year-old is asking why people are wearing masks. Fear of the world beyond our front gate is creeping in. The other day, she breathed a sigh of relief when we turned on to an empty street and said softly from her buggy: \u201cIt\u2019s nice and quiet here.\u201d</p> <p>One of the paradoxes of lockdown in a city is the horizons that have broadened overnight. Our street now has the requisite WhatsApp group filled with everyday gallantry and pledges to hold a street party once this is all over. I told this group my son is autistic and favours a particular brand of margherita pizza if anyone spotted one. A neighbour, whom I probably still wouldn\u2019t recognise if I saw her, promptly delivered two large pizzas to our doorstep and refused payment, saying her nephew was autistic and had a similarly restricted diet. The following week another pizza appeared from \u201cNo 18\u201d. I don\u2019t think any of them knew our son was autistic before this crisis. They probably saw him careering down our street barefoot or loudly reciting the numbers on their front door in his phase when he had to \u201cdo my numbers\u201d before coming home. Perhaps they drew their own conclusions. Now they know they are responding not just with kindness but pizzas. And disclosures of their own.</p> <p>Meanwhile, my son continues to meet the precariousness of life with courage, humour and idiosyncrasy. In my admittedly limited and neurotypical experience, lockdown is both harder and easier for him than I might have expected. Not that I have many expectations. Another skill acquired from parenting my son \u2013 and no one on this ravaged planet has taught me more than this particular six-year-old boy \u2013 is to expect nothing beyond having every single one of your assumptions challenged. There may be no going back to how things were, but there is no going forward either. According to my son\u2019s watertight logic, now is the only place to be.</p>",

New routines have been laid down, quickly and organically. Every day he scoots three circuits of our local park with his \u201cbabuga\u201d (our son\u2019s name for his other mother: its etymological root is \u201cbike\u201d\u2026 don\u2019t ask). He doesn\u2019t notice people wearing masks, perhaps because he struggles with facial recognition, perhaps because this simply isn\u2019t the way his brain identifies humans. In the morning, we act out The Tiger Who Came to Tea in his bedroom (his sister is daddy, I\u2019m the tiger, my son, naturally, is EVERYONE). In the afternoon he jumps up and down on our coal box, and we shout at him ineffectually. He says hello to Ajji and Tata on the phone: my mother is back at home thanks to the everyday miracle of NHS social care we are only now beginning to acknowledge. There is screen time, the building of train tracks and ceaseless reciting of the alphabet. I wouldn\u2019t call any of it home-schooling exactly, unless doing a roly-poly on to a cherry tomato is on the curriculum, but his progress continues at its own idiosyncratic and spellbinding pace. And witnessing the flowering of my son\u2019s relationship with his sister has been one of the happiest experiences of my life. As well as being deeply challenging, lockdown is a tender lesson in what really matters not just to my son but to all small children. Home. The family unit. A cup of popcorn on the sofa in front of Paddington 2. The little things. We never did big birthday parties or trips to the museum so this collective simplifying of our days is already familiar to us. What\u2019s amazing is not how much is lost, but how much is gained when restrictions are imposed upon us. \u201cI\u2019ll go back to school on \u2026 Monday? Tuesday?\u201d This is what my son says every day, though it\u2019s unclear if he is genuinely asking or just likes the repetition of the days of the week. The point is he\u2019s fine with it. School is closed. It would be impossible for him to go until it\u2019s open again. And that\u2019s that. His autistic logic results in a Zen-like acceptance of our new reality that no mindfulness course could teach. Meanwhile, my neurotypical two-year-old is asking why people are wearing masks. Fear of the world beyond our front gate is creeping in. The other day, she breathed a sigh of relief when we turned on to an empty street and said softly from her buggy: \u201cIt\u2019s nice and quiet here.\u201d One of the paradoxes of lockdown in a city is the horizons that have broadened overnight. Our street now has the requisite WhatsApp group filled with everyday gallantry and pledges to hold a street party once this is all over. I told this group my son is autistic and favours a particular brand of margherita pizza if anyone spotted one. A neighbour, whom I probably still wouldn\u2019t recognise if I saw her, promptly delivered two large pizzas to our doorstep and refused payment, saying her nephew was autistic and had a similarly restricted diet. The following week another pizza appeared from \u201cNo 18\u201d. I don\u2019t think any of them knew our son was autistic before this crisis. They probably saw him careering down our street barefoot or loudly reciting the numbers on their front door in his phase when he had to \u201cdo my numbers\u201d before coming home. Perhaps they drew their own conclusions. Now they know they are responding not just with kindness but pizzas. And disclosures of their own. Meanwhile, my son continues to meet the precariousness of life with courage, humour and idiosyncrasy. In my admittedly limited and neurotypical experience, lockdown is both harder and easier for him than I might have expected. Not that I have many expectations. Another skill acquired from parenting my son \u2013 and no one on this ravaged planet has taught me more than this particular six-year-old boy \u2013 is to expect nothing beyond having every single one of your assumptions challenged. There may be no going back to how things were, but there is no going forward either. According to my son\u2019s watertight logic, now is the only place to be.",

      "bodyText": "An NHS app that alerts users to recent contacts who are infected with coronavirus will be ready for deployment within three weeks, according to the chief executive of NHSX, the digital arm of the health service. Matthew Gould told MPs on the Commons science and technology committee on Tuesday that the contact-tracing app would be trialled in a \u201csmall area\u201d and available for use next month provided it performed well. But while the app will be ready in two to three weeks, its widespread rollout will depend on the strategy ministers adopt around easing the lockdown and the availability of testing, which is crucial for the app\u2019s success. Ministers are working through proposals on how to refine the lockdown over the coming weeks without allowing the reproduction rate of the virus to rise above one, the point at which infections would rise again. \u201cWe are, I hope, on course to have the app ready for when it will be needed, at the moment when the country looks for the tools to come out of lockdown safely,\u201d Gould told MPs. The NHS app uses short-range bluetooth signals to record when people are in close proximity for a specified period of time. It then issues automated alerts to those at risk whenever a fellow user records a positive test for the virus. The alerts will not disclose who has triggered the warning, but will advise contacts to seek a test or self-isolate. The app\u2019s developers have built the system around a \u201ccentralised\u201d platform following discussions with advisers including GCHQ\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre. In the centralised model, contacts are represented by an \u201cidentifier\u201d and matched on a central computer. The approach contrasts with that being taken by Google and Apple for a similar contact-tracing app where matches are performed on users\u2019 mobile phones. The tech firms claim their approach is more secure because there is no central server that governments or hackers can access to track people and those they meet. Prof Lilian Edwards, an expert in internet law at Newcastle University, told MPs that the centralised approach raised questions about privacy. \u201cThere\u2019s an intrinsic risk in building any kind of centralised index of the movement of the entire population which might be retained in some form beyond the pandemic,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a precedent of other pandemics leading to a mass land grab in extensive state surveillance, that is my worry.\u201d She added, however, that the \u201cdevil is in the detail\u201d. Gould said there were \u201ca series of protections\u201d that meant people should be confident that their privacy would be respected when using the app and that the data would only be used to control the outbreak and for NHS care and research. He warned that without a public awareness campaign, it would be \u201ctough\u201d to get enough people, estimated at 80% of smartphone users, to use the app. \u201cThe message needs to be: \u2018If you want to keep your family and yourselves safe, if you want to protect the NHS and stop it being overwhelmed and at the same time we want get the country back and get the economy moving, the app is going to be an essential part of the strategy for doing that,\u2019\u201d he said.

Think of this repertory company of cabinet ministers as the Good News Bears. You can certainly always rely on a scenery-chewing performance by Matt Hancock, whose overacting increasingly rivals even some of the Harry Potter cast. Hancock doesn\u2019t so much play to the back row as to the international space station.</p> <p>As for the press they\u2019re getting, the government is preposterously lucky with some of its critics. The 1918 Spanish flu pandemic \u2013 which possibly originated in North America \u2013 was called the Spanish flu because the country seemed particularly hard hit by the disease. It wasn\u2019t. The Spanish newspapers had just <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/coronavirus-spanish-flu-1918-pandemic-from-spain\">faithfully reported its devastating effects</a>. Unlike Spain, a neutral power in the first world war, countries like the UK and the US were saddled with legislation banning reporting that lowered morale. This led to what is often classed as a catastrophic failure of the fourth estate. Vital health reporting was relegated to dismissive paragraphs, so mass gatherings went ahead and the bitterest harvest was reaped. Meanwhile, papers such as the Washington Times went big on things like a picture of a soldier chasing a turkey wearing a fez, beneath the headline THANKSGIVING IS COMING! Thanksgiving was a month away at the time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/boris-johnson-is-trying-to-mug-us-off\">Boris Johnson is trying to mug us off | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We don\u2019t have censorship in the current pandemic, of course. So there is no legal reason the Sun should run the death toll as a tiny disease particle on page one, failing to attach itself to the vast headline announcing \u201cPUBS SHUT TILL XMAS\u201d. Presumably, the approach is popular.</p> <p>So a lot of people think journalists aren\u2019t asking enough tough questions \u2013 and even more think they shouldn\u2019t be asking questions at all. For them, the only tolerable debate is the lockdown debate \u2013 which palpably suits the government. The Good News Bears love the lockdown debate. Why wouldn\u2019t they? Every second you\u2019re having the lockdown debate is a second you\u2019re not having the debate that starts \u201chow in the name of our necrotic self-respect are we on course to be the worst-hit country in Europe when we had so much warning?\u201d Ah well. Perhaps these are not deemed seemly British discussions. Or to put it another way, you won\u2019t catch us getting mugged by reality.</p> <p>\u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Never mind the belated U-turn on locking down, never mind the abandonment of contact tracing, never mind that the government ignored a warning from its own advisers to stockpile crucial kit, leaving it without essential pandemic supplies when the virus hit, never mind that not counting deaths outside hospitals places the toll somewhere north of double the current official figures. Instead, imagine these and other unfortunate matters being nailed and padlocked into crates, to be stored in the vast government warehouse at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark. As the blustering bureaucrat lies to Indiana Jones, they have \u201ctop men\u201d working on this stuff. Our own government\u2019s \u201ctop men\u201d emerge daily at 5pm from the double doors at Downing Street, which is just a puff of dry ice short of a performance we might call Sars in Their Eyes. Think of this repertory company of cabinet ministers as the Good News Bears. You can certainly always rely on a scenery-chewing performance by Matt Hancock, whose overacting increasingly rivals even some of the Harry Potter cast. Hancock doesn\u2019t so much play to the back row as to the international space station. As for the press they\u2019re getting, the government is preposterously lucky with some of its critics. The 1918 Spanish flu pandemic \u2013 which possibly originated in North America \u2013 was called the Spanish flu because the country seemed particularly hard hit by the disease. It wasn\u2019t. The Spanish newspapers had just faithfully reported its devastating effects. Unlike Spain, a neutral power in the first world war, countries like the UK and the US were saddled with legislation banning reporting that lowered morale. This led to what is often classed as a catastrophic failure of the fourth estate. Vital health reporting was relegated to dismissive paragraphs, so mass gatherings went ahead and the bitterest harvest was reaped. Meanwhile, papers such as the Washington Times went big on things like a picture of a soldier chasing a turkey wearing a fez, beneath the headline THANKSGIVING IS COMING! Thanksgiving was a month away at the time. We don\u2019t have censorship in the current pandemic, of course. So there is no legal reason the Sun should run the death toll as a tiny disease particle on page one, failing to attach itself to the vast headline announcing \u201cPUBS SHUT TILL XMAS\u201d. Presumably, the approach is popular. So a lot of people think journalists aren\u2019t asking enough tough questions \u2013 and even more think they shouldn\u2019t be asking questions at all. For them, the only tolerable debate is the lockdown debate \u2013 which palpably suits the government. The Good News Bears love the lockdown debate. Why wouldn\u2019t they? Every second you\u2019re having the lockdown debate is a second you\u2019re not having the debate that starts \u201chow in the name of our necrotic self-respect are we on course to be the worst-hit country in Europe when we had so much warning?\u201d Ah well. Perhaps these are not deemed seemly British discussions. Or to put it another way, you won\u2019t catch us getting mugged by reality. \u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "MPs are to try to outlaw the courtroom murder defence of \u201crough sex gone wrong\u201d during parliamentary debates on the domestic abuse bill, as cases of domestic violence soar during the coronavirus lockdown. The repeatedly delayed legislation came before MPs on Tuesday amid calls for a specific ban on \u201cnon-fatal strangulation\u201d, and threats of legal action over the provision of accommodation for domestic abuse survivors during the pandemic. The government has promised to look at what has been called the \u201cfifty shades\u201d defence to murder during sex, but has not yet announced any detailed legislative wording to introduce a ban. An amendment backed by the Labour MP Harriet Harman and the Conservative MP Mark Garnier is likely to be the focus of efforts to prevent anyone charged with murder escaping justice by alleging that the victim had consented to sex games. Harman urged MPs in the Commons on Tuesday to \u201cstop this injustice\u201d of the sex game defence, which means a man who admits to causing injuries that kill a woman \u201cliterally gets away with murder\u201d. \u201cThis is a double injustice. Not only does he kill her but he drags her name through the mud. It causes indescribable trauma for the bereaved family who \u2026 see the man who killed her describe luridly what he alleges are her sexual proclivities. She of course is not there to speak for herself. He kills her and then he defines her.\u201d The justice secretary, Robert Buckland, told MPs the government hoped to present a solution to end the \u201crough sex defence\u201d by the report stage of the bill but did not disclose any details. The campaign to change the law has been led by the organisation We Can\u2019t Consent to This which has calculated that more than 20 women a year are injured or killed when it is claimed that sex games have gone wrong. The organisation also supports a call by the Centre for Women\u2019s Justice (CWJ) for MPs to include a new offence of \u201cnon-fatal strangulation\u201d in the domestic abuse bill. Harriet Wistrich, the director of the CWJ, said: \u201cOffenders are getting away with little or no punishment for this terrifying and dangerous offence. Police and prosecutors are not taking this offending sufficiently seriously. A simple amendment to the domestic abuse bill, making non-fatal strangulation a specific serious offence, could provide a remedy and help reduce femicide.\u201d The bill also contains clauses requiring domestic abusers to take polygraph tests \u2013 commonly referred to as lie detector tests \u2013 on release, and regulations to ban perpetrators from cross-examining victims during family court proceedings. The new attorney general, Suella Braverman, told the Commons extra funds were being made available to frontline services dealing with victims of domestic abuse during the coronavirus crisis. She reminded those in danger that \u201cthey will not be breaking the law if they flee their home [during the lockdown] and seek help outside\u201d. MPs were also told that police in London are making 100 arrests a day in relation to domestic abuse cases. A survey published by Women\u2019s Aid on Tuesday found that more than two-thirds of survivors said domestic abuse was escalating under lockdown, with 72% saying their abuser had more control over their life since the Covid-19 crisis. More than three-quarters (78%) of survivors, the survey found, reported that Covid-19 had made it harder for them to leave their abuser. In a related development, Southall Black Sisters and the Public Interest Law Centre are launching a legal challenge against Robert Jenrick, the housing, communities and local government secretary, \u2013for the department\u2019s \u201cfailure to provide emergency funding for adequate accommodation for domestic abuse survivors during the Covid-19 crisis\u201d. The organisations said: \u201cBetween 23 March and 12 April 2020, the number of recorded killings of women rose from a weekly average of two deaths per week to an average of five deaths per week, a total of 16 killings within a three-week period. \u201cDuring lockdown, the Metropolitan police have arrested an average of 100 people a day for domestic abuse-related offences and have received a 30% rise in domestic abuse calls.\u201d A government spokesperson said: \u201cOur [domestic abuse] bill will better protect victims, making sure they have the support they need whilst more offenders are brought to justice.

      "body": "<p>Changes to legal protections for children in care, introduced by the UK government as an emergency response to the coronavirus crisis, have been condemned as \u201cderegulation on steroids\u201d by children\u2019s rights campaigners.</p> <p>Activists described the decision to relax 10 key sets of regulations, developed over decades to protect the most vulnerable children in society, as an \u201coutrageous assault on safeguards\u201d and warned that children would be harmed.</p> <p>One of the key relaxations, which came into force last Friday, is the removal of the requirement for a social worker to visit \u2013 or even telephone \u2013 a child in care every six weeks, reducing it to \u201cas soon as is reasonably practicable\u201d.</p> <p>The requirement for a six-monthly review of a child\u2019s care, introduced following the manslaughter of the 12-year-old <a href=\"https://www.communitycare.co.uk/2007/01/10/what-have-we-learned-child-death-scandals-since-1944/\">Dennis O\u2019Neill </a>by his foster carers in 1944, has been similarly relaxed, and adoption and fostering panels which allow for independent scrutiny have become optional.</p> <p>The government says the measures are temporary \u2013 expiring on 25 September \u2013 and will allow overstretched children\u2019s services greater flexibility, but there are fears that the coronavirus crisis is being used as an excuse to relax children\u2019s social care duties and the expiry date could be revoked.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s Tulip Siddiq has written to the children\u2019s minister Vicky Ford calling on the government to publish data to show the impact on vulnerable children. Her Labour colleague Emma Lewell-Buck has posted a series of <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-question/Commons/2020-04-27/40635/\">parliamentary questions</a> to find out more about the process which led to the amendments. \u201cThey are using this pandemic to experiment with vulnerable children,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The measures were introduced by the government as part of emergency coronavirus legislation, via a <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/445/contents/made\">statutory instrument</a>. Campaigners are concerned there was no public consultation or parliamentary scrutiny and they say many of the changes have been proposed by the government before.</p> <p>Carolyne Willow, the director of <a href=\"https://article39.org.uk/news/\">Article 39</a>, a charity that campaigns for the rights of children in institutional settings, said it was \u201cderegulation on steroids\u201d. </p> <p>She said: \u201cThis outright assault on safeguards protecting the most vulnerable children is outrageous. Safeguards are there to protect children from harm, so it goes without saying that these changes forced through without any public consultation or parliamentary scrutiny will harm children.</p> <p>\u201cThe government has produced no evidence to back up its claim that changes to 10 different sets of regulations are in response to the pressures of lockdown. It has also conveniently omitted to mention that this is the fourth time since 2016 that ministers have tried to impose mass deregulation in children\u2019s social care.\u201d</p> <p>Enver Solomon, the chief executive of Just for Kids Law, added: \u201cAt this time of national crisis, in its role as corporate parent the government should be going the extra mile for every child in care. It\u2019s astonishing that isn\u2019t the case and truly shocking that instead government has chosen to weaken the support offered to some of the country\u2019s most vulnerable children.\u201d</p> <p>There is growing concern about vulnerable children during lockdown.

      "bodyText": "Changes to legal protections for children in care, introduced by the UK government as an emergency response to the coronavirus crisis, have been condemned as \u201cderegulation on steroids\u201d by children\u2019s rights campaigners. Activists described the decision to relax 10 key sets of regulations, developed over decades to protect the most vulnerable children in society, as an \u201coutrageous assault on safeguards\u201d and warned that children would be harmed. One of the key relaxations, which came into force last Friday, is the removal of the requirement for a social worker to visit \u2013 or even telephone \u2013 a child in care every six weeks, reducing it to \u201cas soon as is reasonably practicable\u201d. The requirement for a six-monthly review of a child\u2019s care, introduced following the manslaughter of the 12-year-old Dennis O\u2019Neill by his foster carers in 1944, has been similarly relaxed, and adoption and fostering panels which allow for independent scrutiny have become optional. The government says the measures are temporary \u2013 expiring on 25 September \u2013 and will allow overstretched children\u2019s services greater flexibility, but there are fears that the coronavirus crisis is being used as an excuse to relax children\u2019s social care duties and the expiry date could be revoked. Labour\u2019s Tulip Siddiq has written to the children\u2019s minister Vicky Ford calling on the government to publish data to show the impact on vulnerable children. Her Labour colleague Emma Lewell-Buck has posted a series of parliamentary questions to find out more about the process which led to the amendments. \u201cThey are using this pandemic to experiment with vulnerable children,\u201d she said. The measures were introduced by the government as part of emergency coronavirus legislation, via a statutory instrument. Campaigners are concerned there was no public consultation or parliamentary scrutiny and they say many of the changes have been proposed by the government before. Carolyne Willow, the director of Article 39, a charity that campaigns for the rights of children in institutional settings, said it was \u201cderegulation on steroids\u201d. She said: \u201cThis outright assault on safeguards protecting the most vulnerable children is outrageous. Safeguards are there to protect children from harm, so it goes without saying that these changes forced through without any public consultation or parliamentary scrutiny will harm children. \u201cThe government has produced no evidence to back up its claim that changes to 10 different sets of regulations are in response to the pressures of lockdown. It has also conveniently omitted to mention that this is the fourth time since 2016 that ministers have tried to impose mass deregulation in children\u2019s social care.\u201d Enver Solomon, the chief executive of Just for Kids Law, added: \u201cAt this time of national crisis, in its role as corporate parent the government should be going the extra mile for every child in care. It\u2019s astonishing that isn\u2019t the case and truly shocking that instead government has chosen to weaken the support offered to some of the country\u2019s most vulnerable children.\u201d There is growing concern about vulnerable children during lockdown. Schools have remained open to them, as well as children of key workers, to provide some protection but the numbers attending are small. Latest figures show 10% of children \u201cin need\u201d and those with education, health and care plans are turning up at school \u2013 up from 5% earlier in the pandemic. A Department for Education spokesperson said: \u201cWhile the vast majority of statutory duties remain unchanged, we have reviewed our regulations to allow some temporary flexibility, to be used where absolutely necessary, to help reduce pressure on the system and enable children\u2019s services to continue to support vulnerable children during the coronavirus outbreak.\u201d",

This is the problem when the dumbest person in the room thinks they\u2019re the smartest person.</p> <p>\u201cI almost don\u2019t even blame Trump, because there\u2019s no way he even understands what bleach is,\u201d Noah continued. \u201cLike, do you think Donald Trump has ever cleaned anything in his life? Do you think he has ever actually used disinfectant? Cleaning supplies might as well be magical potions to him.\u201d Noah broke out his Trump impression: \u201cI dropped a hamburger on the carpet, then some Mexican lady came in with some Clorox, sprayed it on the carpet, said some spell in Spanish, and then it was gone.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/24/trevor-noah-trump-coronavirus-stephen-colbert-jimmy-kimmel\">Trevor Noah: Trump 'seems to think of chaos as an essential service'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re some random guy on the internet with 12 followers, you can say shit like this and it really doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Noah explained. \u201cBut Donald Trump is not just some random guy.\u201d And in what Noah is now calling \u201cthe pandumbic\u201d, Trump\u2019s comments have had significant fallout, such as upticks in calls to state poison control hotlines, and the release of warnings from cleaning supply companies to <em>not eat bleach.</em></p> <p>\u201cYep, this is where we are now: authorities have to respond to the president\u2019s ideas the same way they do to viral TikTok challenges,\u201d said Noah.

      "bodyText": "Time for a recap. European stock markets have hit their highest levels in seven weeks, despite another torrent of bad economic data. Hopes that the Covid-19 lockdowns will soon ease have lifted shares again today, with Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 gaining almost 2% and solid gains across Europe. The rally came despite a series of grim reports, that confirmed the world economy is entering a deep recession. US consumer confidence suffered a record plunge, hitting its lowest level in five years. Americans reported that their current economic situation has worsened dramatically this month, although they\u2019re a little more optimistic about the future than a month ago UK retailers reported that sales had taken a dive in April, with even grocers saying turnover was lower than a year ago (after a surge in March). With lockdowns likely to be lifted gradually, UBS forecast that the eurozone recession would be even deeper than first thought. With energy demand weak, the oil price came under further pressure. The price of a barrel of US crude oil for June delivery is currently down 6.5% at $11.95 per barrel. Oil giant BP reported that its earnings plunged in the first three months of this year, due to low oil prices. It said Covid-19 was helping to create an unprecedented crisis for the energy industry. Banking group HSBC also shone a light on the economic cost of the crisis, by putting aside $3bn to cover bad loans - and warning the bill could reach $11bn. Goodnight. GW Earlier today, UK\u2019s financial watchdog fired a warning shot at Britain\u2019s banks not to pressure corporate clients to give them work in return for financial assistance in the crisis. The FCA suspects that some banks have been demanding to take part in lucrative jobs such as share sales, in return for agreeing to emergency loans. Pretty unprofessional if so! Europe\u2019s investors have shaken off the latest weak economic data, pushing shares higher across the region. Trading has just ended, with Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 up 111 points of 1.9% at 5958, a seven-week high. Lloyds Bank was the top performer today, gaining almost 9% (up to the giddy heights of 33p), followed by JD Sports (up 8.5%). Cruise operator Carnival gained 8%. The Europe-wide Stoxx 600 index closed 1.5% higher, with all the major indices up. France\u2019s CAC gained 1.3%, as prime minister Edouard Philippe outlined plans to ease its lockdown from May 11. Schools will gradually reopen and businesses will be free to resume operations, Philippe told parliament. However, restaurants and cafes will remain closed until at least early June and professional sports, including soccer, will not begin again until the autumn. Interestingly.... the rally on Wall Street is somewhat fizzling out. The Dow is now down 0.25%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq index has dropped by 1%. Perhaps investors are fretting that today\u2019s slump in consumer confidence doesn\u2019t bode terribly well for the economy this year. Especially as stocks have already rebounded strongly in recent weeks.... Here\u2019s a neat chart showing the recent divergence between the US stock market and consumer confidence. We\u2019ll find out in a month\u2019s time whether they\u2019ve converged again - either through a drop in stocks or a rise in confidence.... (or maybe both!) US economist David Rosenberg feels the plunge in US consumer confidence is rather at odds with the recent stock market rally. Economist Rupert Seggins feels Americans aren\u2019t nearly anxious enough! There is one glimmer of hope in the US consumer confidence report -- Americans are a little less pessimistic than a month ago. The \u2018future expectations\u2019 index, which asks people how they feel about the next six months, actually improved to 93.8 from 86.8 in March. That suggests that the US public may be looking forward to lockdown rules being lifted soon. But it was more than cancelled out by the record slump in how people feel about the economy right now (the current conditions index, which plunged to 76.4 from 166.7). Stock markets have actually pushed higher since the US consumer confidence figures were released. The UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index is now up 124 points or 2% at 5969 points, on track to close at its highest level in seven weeks. Roughly one in six Americans expect their income to decline over the next six months, today\u2019s consumer confidence report shows. Oof! US consumer confidence has plunged to its lowest level in nearly six years, as the Covid-19 pandemic spooks Americans. The Conference Board\u2019s Consumer Confidence Index has slumped to 86.9 for April, the lowest since June 2014. That\u2019s down from 120 points in March -- a truly dramatic (but not unsurprising) slide. The Conference Board\u2019s assessment of the current economic situation fell especially sharply - in response to the surge in jobless claims across America, and the widespread lockdowns of factories and offices. Wall Street has hit a near seven-week high at the start of trading, matching the move in London today. The Dow Jones industrial average has risen by 314 points, or 1.3%, to 24,448, its highest level since Wednesday 11th March (during the worst week of the 2020 crash). Investors seem to be increasingly optimistic that the lockdowns which have caused such economic pain in recent weeks will ease soon, with the massive central bank money-printing operations likely to support asset prices too. America\u2019s trade deficit has widened, partly due to a collapse in sales of new cars and industrial equipment to overseas customers. The Commerce Department has reported that the gap between the goods bought and sold by the US expanded by 7.2% last month to $64.2bn. Although Americans did buy less from abroad, that was more than countered by a drop in exports. Reuters has the details: In March, goods imports dropped 2.4% to $191.9 billion after decreasing 2.5% in February. There were sharp decreases in imports of consumer goods and motor vehicles and parts. Imports of food, industrial supplies and capital goods rose last month. Exports of goods tumbled 6.7% to $127.6 billion in March. There was a broad decline in exports last month, with shipments of industrial supplies dropping 7.5% and motor vehicles and parts plummeting 17.8%. The volume of cargo being transported around the world by air tumbled by 15% in March, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), less than during the global financial crisis in 2008 when volumes fell by 23%. Airlines suffering a 30% decline in passenger travel are quickly trying to repurpose passenger aircraft, or bring freight airplanes out of storage in order to fly goods including medical supplies and pharmaceuticals around the world, according to the industry body. However IATA expects the volume of cargo flown around the world to fall during 2020 as the expected recession reduces consumers\u2019 demand for goods. Sales at mining and construction equipment maker Caterpillar have been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic. Caterpillar has reported that sales slumped by 21% in the first three months of 2020, as the global economy seized up. Revenues fell to $10.6bn, down from $13.5bn, due to \u201clower end user demand\u201d Profit fell sharply too, from $2.94 per share a year ago to $1.60 per share -- below forecasts of $1.69. Caterpillar is not providing any full-year 2020 guidance due to uncertainties surrounding the pandemic. Here\u2019s our news story on April\u2019s retail sales figures: The recent recovery in stock markets came after central banks and governments launched huge new rescue packages to help businesses and individuals survive the lockdown. This video explainer runs through the various schemes, and explains the risks.... More gloom: The U.K. economy isn\u2019t expected to return to its pre-coronavirus peak until the end of next year. The National Institute for Economic and Social Research has predicted that the UK economy will shrink by 30% during the lockdown, and not return to the levels of Q4 2019 until the last quarter of 2021. Marketwatch has more details. Despite all the bad news this morning, Britain\u2019s stock market has just hit its highest level in nearly seven weeks. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares is rallying hard, up 94 points or 1.6% at 5941 points. That\u2019s its highest level since Wednesday March 11 (the day before the index suffered its worst day since 1987). Retail group JD Sports is the top riser, up 8%, followed by Barclays (+7%) and exhibitions group Informa (+7%). European markets are higher too, with the Stoxx 600 now up 1.5% today. Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB has gained 2.5%. Investors appear to be wagering that Covid-19 lockdown measures will ease soon, and that companies will recover from this year\u2019s trauma. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, explains: \u201cFurther gains for the FTSE 100 look odd on a morning when major components like BP and HSBC report poor earnings, but for the most part the gainers in the index are those that will see an upturn in activity as lockdowns ease across most of the globe, if perhaps not yet in the UK. This continues the theme from yesterday\u2019s session, when it seemed as if the whole world was looking to a post-coronavirus environment, when some semblance of normality may return.\u201d These charts from the CBI\u2019s \u2018distributive trades\u2019 survey show how retail sales slumped this month - both in stores (where open) and online. Newflash: UK retailers have suffered their joint-biggest ever fall in sales, after many were forced to shut their doors because of the pandemic. A survey conducted by the CBI, which represents UK businesses, found that 71% of retailers saw a drop in sales this month, compared to a year ago. Just 16% saw a rise. That gives a net balance of -55%, matching the previous low in December 2008 (after the financial crisis). The CBI says: Retailers reported a steep drop in sales in the year to April \u2013 matching the decline in December 2008, marking the joint sharpest fall since the survey began in July 1983. Two-thirds of retailers reported that the coronavirus is having a significantly negative impact on their domestic sales, with 39% saying they had shutdown completely. Some 44% have temporarily laid off staff, with 8% making permanent job cuts. Alarmingly, nearly all retailers (96%) reported cash flow difficulties (96%), with a third saying they were struggling to access external finance. And every sector of retail reported that sales in April were weaker than a year ago. The CBI says: Every sub-sector reported a negative balance in April, including grocers (balance of -27% from +94%) and specialist food &amp; drinks (-4% from +42%) which both reported strong growth in March. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI Chief Economist, explains: \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that the lockdown is hitting retailers hard. Two fifths have shut up shop completely for now. And sales of groceries and other essentials also fell, suggesting households may have been dipping into stockpiles built up prior to the lockdown or tightening their belts more generally as incomes take a hit. \u201cAlthough the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of employees in retail remain at risk, there are encouraging signs that the Government\u2019s Job Retention Scheme is providing genuine relief, with many opting for temporary rather than permanent lay-offs. \u201cContinued support for retailers to cover their fixed costs will be vital for ensuring that businesses are able to re-open when it\u2019s safe and appropriate to do so.\u201d The survey took place between 27 March and 15 April. Charts to follow.... A new report from Resolution Foundation shows that women, low-paid workers, younger employees and parents are being hit particularly hard by the Covid-19 pandemic. They\u2019ve calculated that women make up a majority of \u2018key workers\u2019, which means they run a greater risk of exposure to the virus as they\u2019re not isolating. Those key workers are often relatively lowly paid. The economic impact of the virus isn\u2019t being shared equitably either. If you\u2019re badly paid, or a younger adult, you\u2019re more likely to have lost your job or been furloughed. Resolution\u2019s report says: Key workers are disproportionately likely to be female, with employed women more than twice as likely to be in this group as employed men. Parents are more likely to be key workers than non-parents, and mothers even more so; 39 per cent of working mothers were key workers before this crisis began, compared to just 27 per cent of the working population as a whole. Workers in shutdown sectors are the lowest paid across the workforce. Typical pay for workers in shutdown sectors is less than half that of those able to work from home \u2013 \u00a3348 a week compared to \u00a3707 a week. Those in shutdown sectors are younger \u2013 their average age of 39 is four years below the average age of those who can work from home. Differences are even more pronounced at the very bottom of the age distribution: nearly two in five of every 16-24-year old who works are in these sectors and for those born after 2000 this figure is over than three-fifths. Resolution make another point that may resonate with older millennials -- the people born in the early 1980s are the most likely to be parents of children under nine. So they may now be trying to juggle home work with home teaching. It should not be forgotten that this is the same cohort of adults who experienced the sharpest deterioration in cohort-on-cohort pay progress in the aftermath of the financial crisis. UBS has slashed its forecast for the eurozone economy this year, and now sees an even deeper recession. It now fears that euro area GDP will contract by 6.1% this year, compared with a previous forecast of a 4.5% decline. Italy and Spain will be hardest hit, predicts, given the scale of their lockdowns. UBS revised its forecasts down due to two factors: the latest economic surveys, such as the manufacturing and service sector PMIs, have been even more grim than feared The easing of Covid-19 lockdowns will be more gradual than thought, with economic restrictions will be largely lifted only by end-June. UBS adds: We believe the economic damage across European countries will vary according to (a) the length and strictness of the shutdown; (b) the relative exposure to the most affected (services) sectors; and (c) the size of the economic policy response. We continue to project the largest decline in real GDP in Italy (-7.7%, revised from -5.0%) followed by +4.4% in 2021 (previously +1.9%). We expect Spanish real GDP to decline by 6.9% this year (previously -4.0%) and rise by 4.7% in 2021 (up from 2.5%). We have cut our 2020 GDP projection for Germany to -6% (from -4.7%) and now forecast 4.5% for 2021 (previously 1.8%). We expect French GDP to decline by 6.3% this year (revised from -4.3%), then grow by 3.9% in 2021 (up from 1.9%). Outside of the Eurozone, we now expect UK GDP to contract by 5.6% in 2020 (-3.9% previously) before rebounding by 4.0% in 2021 (up from 1.5%). For Switzerland, we now project a 4.6% decline this year (down from -3%), followed by +3.9% (2.2% before) in 2021. A new global survey by Ipsos MORI has found that Britons are particularly reluctant for the Covid-19 lockdown to end before the virus is under control. Just 22% of people in the UK agreed with the suggestion that the economy and business should be reopened even if the coronavirus was not contained. That\u2019s the lowest out of the 14 major countries surveyed. Some 70% of people opposed the idea - joint highest, along with Canada. Conversely, people in China and Russia were keenest to get back to normality even if the outbreak was still running. Yesterday, Boris Johnson said it was too early to start to lift the UK\u2019s restrictions - this poll suggests the public are comfortable with that. Gideon Skinner, Head of Political research at Ipsos MORI says: \u201cOur latest polling across 14 countries show that Britons are the most cautious when it comes to reopening the economy, being the least keen for businesses to reopen if the Coronavirus is not contained. Furthermore, seven in ten Britons say that they will be nervous about leaving the house after the lockdown eases. These suggest that the turnaround in the economy might not be quite so fast as hoped for.\u201d BP\u2019s CEO Bernard Looney has warned that the oil giant will start to cut jobs around the world by the end of the year, as it tries to become more competitive. The FT\u2019s Anjli Raval has the details: Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, has dug into BP\u2019s latest results to show how the oil price slump has hurt its finances: \u201cBP has stuck with its dividend despite the turmoil currently wracking oil markets. However that\u2019s coming at significant cost. Net debt shot up some $6bn this quarter and the group\u2019s upper gearing limit is rapidly disappearing into the rear-view mirror. Negative free cash flow means the balance sheet would be deteriorating even without the dividend, and with a sizeable expense related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill expected next quarter, things look set to get worse before they get better. Some drastic cuts to capital expenditure should help ease the pressure for now, and $32bn of liquidity gives the group some breathing space, but longer term the group needs higher oil prices or lower operating costs, and ideally both. Oil prices are outside the group\u2019s control, and with demand for fuel at BP\u2019s petrol stations down 50% and aviation fuel demand down 80% it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess how long they will take to normalise. However, operating costs are something the group can influence. Unemployment in Spain rate has risen, in another sign of the economic pain in Europe The Spanish jobless rate rose to 14.41% in the first quarter of 2020, up from 13.78% in October-December. Spain introduced a national lockdown in mid-March, by which time tourism was already suffering from the Covid-19 pandemic. The US crude oil price is continuing to slide today. A barrel of West Texas Intermediate for June delivery is now changing hands at just $10.58 per barrel, down $2.2 today. That contract expires in around three weeks - meaning anyone holding it has to actually collect the oil then. That means we risk a repeat of last week\u2019s turmoil, when the May crude contract turned negative as it neared the expiry point. David Miller, investment director at Quilter Cheviot, explains: We have become used to negative interest rates, but negative oil is hard to comprehend. Supply is exceeding demand to such an extent that storage tanks are full. Dumping is unacceptable and so those who own the excess had to pay others to take the nasty black stuff away from them. There will be casualties, but it is too early to tell at the moment whether these will number countries, oil companies, banks or specialist funds. Suffice to say that this could be the shape of things to come. Charlie Kronick, oil finance analyst for Greenpeace UK, isn\u2019t impressed that BP is still paying shareholders a dividend. He argues that BP should be investing more to fight the climate emergency, not giving shareholders a payout: \u201cToday as profits tumble BP is shaping the future of the company, but more importantly the future of the climate. BP and the rest of the oil industry are still running the sector like a pyramid scheme, betting that demand will bounce back from every downturn and high dividends will distract investors from the underlying weaknesses of the business. \u201cBy sticking with a business as usual dividend payout, BP is ignoring the severity of the multiple crises we now face. Given the company\u2019s plunging profits, dividends are not mandatory and can\u2019t take precedence over investment in clean renewable energy crucial to a more resilient climate and economy. Our society\u2019s response to the COVID challenge has been to come together to help each other, but BP continues to prioritise pacifying shareholders over investing where it is really needed. Banking giant HSBC has also been hurt badly by Covid-19. HSBC reported a 48% plunge in pre-tax profits in the last quarter, as it was forced to put $3bn aside to cover bad debts caused by the pandemic. The bank warned this morning: \u201cThe outlook for world economies in 2020 has substantially worsened in the past two months. The impact and duration of the Covid-19 crisis will likely lead to higher ECL [expected credit losses] and put pressure on revenue due to lower customer activity levels and reduced global interest rates.\u201d UK high-street chain Marks &amp; Spencer is shoring up its finances, after being hit hard by the Covid-19 lockdown. M&amp;S has told the City that it probably won\u2019t pay a dividend for the current financial year, which will save \u00a3210m. The company has also persuaded its banks to relax, or remove, some of the conditions on its \u00a31.1bn credit facility. Plus, it has been approved to tap the UK Government\u2019s Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF) -- designed to give liquidity to large companies. This gives M&amp;S \u201csignificant undrawn credit available for the 18 months ahead\u201d. The firm also warned that the coronavirus lockdown is hurting its business badly: We are planning for the Clothing &amp; Home business to be severely constrained during lockdown and highly uncertain trading conditions in a prolonged exit period. In the absence of a clear basis for forecasting, our scenario planning and stress tests are based on materially subdued trading for the balance of 2020 in Clothing &amp; Home. M&amp;S benefits from having a strong food business and the transition to Ocado supply is on track to proceed in September to form a multi-channel food operation. However, Food trading has been adversely affected by lockdown due to the closure of cafes and slowdown in travel and some city centre locations. Shares in BP have dropped 1.6% at the start of trading, down 5.1p to 308.7p. That\u2019s despite relief that the firm is paying a dividend, and that its underlying profits were better than feared (although still down sharply, to $791m from $2.35bn a year ago). As you can see, BP\u2019s headline loss was a whopping $4.4bn. But that\u2019s partly because the value of the oil in its inventories has slumped. The \u2018underlying RC\u2019, or replacement cost, figure strips that out. Why is the underlying RC measure relevant? Because it allows BP to show how well, or badly, its operations performed - without a fluctuating oil price flattering or flattening its results. BP\u2019s business is in two parts -- one arm finds crude oil and gets it out of the ground, while the other arm refines it for consumers. So a weak oil price is bad for its upstream business (its product is less valuable) but good for the downstream arm (its raw materials cost less). Of course, a situation of weak oil prices and weak consumer demand is bad for both wings of BP..... Some snap reaction to BP\u2019s results: BP also warns that the coronavirus pandemic makes it very hard to forecast how the oil price will change: Looking forward, there remains an exceptional level of uncertainty regarding the near-term outlook for prices and product demand, particularly while many economies remain under lockdown. There is the risk of more sustained consequences depending on the efforts of governments and the public and private sectors to manage the health, economic and financial stability effects of the pandemic. Despite the slump in oil prices, and profits, BP is still paying a dividend for the last quarter. Investors will get 10.5 cents per share, a relief when so many other FTSE 100 companies have suspended their dividend. Just in: Oil giant BP has warned that it faces an unprecedented challenge, as it reports a slump in profits. Bernard Looney, BP\u2019s chief executive officer, told shareholders that the COVID-19 pandemic had helped to create an exceptionally challenged commodity environment. BP\u2019s latest financial results, just released, show that it made a loss of $4.365bn in the first quarter of this year, down from a profit of $2.9bn a year ago. On an underlying basis, BP\u2019s replacement cost profit (a better way of measuring oil companies), plunged by two-thirds to $791m (more than the City expected). That shows the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, and the Saudi-Russia oil price war which also drove prices down this year. Looney says: This extraordinary time for the world demands extraordinary responses. And thankfully we are seeing that just about everywhere we look around the world. Our industry has been hit by supply and demand shocks on a scale never seen before, but that is no excuse to turn inward. BP, like many other companies, is stepping up and extending a helping hand to those in need. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The oil price is crashing again, as weak demand leaves producers struggling to find anywhere to store crude. A barrel of US crude oil for delivery in June now costs you just $11.20 per barrel this morning, down from $12.78 yesterday -- and $60 back in January. Brent crude, the international benchmark, has sunk by 4% to $19.20 - back towards the 21-year lows struck last week. That\u2019s dampening the mood in the markets today, after solid gains on Monday. The selloff is fuelling worries that US crude oil prices could fall below zero again, if suppliers become desperate to shift stocks. Traders are looking nervously at Cushing, Oklahoma -- the hub of America\u2019s oil industry -- for signs that its tanks are full to the brim. As Harry Tchilinguirian, global oil strategist at BNP Paribas in London, told the Reuters Global Oil Forum yesterday: \u201cThe market is very concerned of a repeat of negative pricing as the Cushing storage and delivery hub saturates\u201d The turbulence has already forced the world\u2019s largest oil-backed exchange traded fund to start ditching all its short-term contracts for oil delivery next month. This move by United States Oil Fund (known as USO) is push the June oil price lower, creating more volatility. Kyle Rodda of IG explains: The US Oil Funds decision to dump its entire exposure to the front month WTI Futures contract prompted another sell-off in crude prices, and further concern about global energy demand and supply capacity. Oil\u2019s woes are also driven by anxiety over the global recession. There\u2019s less cheery optimism about a V-shaped recovery, with more economists accepting that growth is likely to resemble a U, a W, or even the dreaded L..... New US retail sales figures, US trade and consumer confidence, and Spanish jobless data due today will all help us see how the economy is faring. The agenda 8am BST: Spanish employment data for Q1 2020 11am BST: CBI distributive sales survey of UK retailers - expected to plunge to -40 from -3 1.30pm BST: US goods trade balance for March 3pm BST: US consumer confidence index for April - expected to plunge to 87.9 from 120",

      "bodyText": "David Warner has poured cold water on the prospect of Australia touring the UK this summer, giving the England and Wales Cricket Board a fresh headache as it prepares to postpone the Hundred by 12 months. The ECB has been clinging on to the hope that, while its new 100-ball tournament will likely be mothballed at a board meeting on Wednesday, England\u2019s men might still be able to play their intended 18 home internationals behind closed doors in a delayed and truncated season. But while their six white-ball fixtures against Australia in July were already facing a shift to the back end of the summer because of the coronavirus pandemic, Warner fancies his side will not be making the trip at all. \u201cAt the moment it\u2019s highly unlikely we\u2019re going to go over there given what\u2019s happened in England,\u201d the Australia opener told cricket.com.au, before referencing Boris Johnson\u2019s recent return to health after being admitted to hospital with Covid-19. \u201c[Johnson] is back up on his feet now and that\u2019s fantastic news, but there\u2019s a lot more to this than just sport being played.\u201d Tom Harrison, the ECB chief executive, admitted last week that it was \u201cvery early for us to be able to say the Aussies will be here\u201d given global travel restrictions. But at the forefront of his mind now is ensuring the Hundred actually sees the light of day. A 12-month postponement of the new tournament is expected to be approved at the board meeting on Wednesday and announced on Thursday morning \u2013 a decision that could cost the ECB an estimated \u00a310m in player compensation and lost marketing spend. But despite forecasts of a recession there remains an unflinching determination to get under way in 2021, even if teams may have to be redrafted from those picked last October and extra promotional work is required to make up for the loss of momentum. The ECB has also privately pushed back at the idea of selling equity stakes in the Hundred\u2019s eight teams to investors \u2013 or gifting them to the counties in lieu of central payments \u2013 following a suggestion by Oakwell Sports Advisory, a consultancy firm that advised CVC on its \u00a3200m deal with Premiership Rugby in 2018. As well as the Hundred\u2019s future, the ECB board will discuss Ian Watmore\u2019s appointment as chairman, having been forced to re-examine his departure from the Football League two years ago after his conduct during negotiations over a TV deal was questioned in a report seen by the Daily Mail.",

Nobody falls asleep at night dreaming of a chance to offload six weeks\u2019 worth of grass clippings. Yet after a month or more inside, some of us have learned to take our thrills where we can: a cup of tea in the sunshine, a phone call, a friendly word with the neighbours when putting out the bins.

      "bodyText": "If asked a month ago how the nation would celebrate the easing of the lockdown, I would never have imagined it would be with a trip to the council tip. Yet it\u2019s a measure of how dramatically our horizons have shrunk that the heady prospect of dumping some rubbish, plus the chance of a socially distanced trip to the garden centre, can now be held out by ministers as a reward for six weeks of self-sacrifice. Nobody falls asleep at night dreaming of a chance to offload six weeks\u2019 worth of grass clippings. Yet after a month or more inside, some of us have learned to take our thrills where we can: a cup of tea in the sunshine, a phone call, a friendly word with the neighbours when putting out the bins. The happiest people in lockdown are those most capable of finding solace in small things, and it\u2019s this dramatic lowering of expectations under pressure that might help explain the baffling paradox in politics right now. More than 21,000 people have died just in hospitals, millions are losing or likely to lose their jobs, coronavirus is ripping through care homes whose residents have frighteningly little chance of escaping it and frontline staff are shamefully having to risk their lives without in some cases the most basic protective equipment.

      "body": "<p>Germans have been advised to stay at home as much as possible and continue to apply physical distancing as official data appeared to indicate the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic was once again accelerating.</p> <p>The basic reproduction number (R), indicating how many new cases one infected person generates on average, has come to be seen as the key indicator over whether restrictions on public life can be loosened after Angela Merkel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/angela-merkel-draws-on-science-background-in-covid-19-explainer-lockdown-exit\">stressed the importance</a> of keeping the number below one.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the German government\u2019s disease control agency, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), announced the reproduction number for Monday 27 April had risen to 1, after having put it as low as 0.7 in mid-April.</p> <p>Lothar Wieler, the RKI\u2019s president, later specified that the reproduction rate for Monday was 0.96, and therefore technically still below one.</p> <p>Scientists believe the basic reproduction rate of Covid-19, R0, to lie somewhere between 2.4 and 3.3. Without measures taken to curb the spread of the virus, the rate of new infections would grow exponentially until about 70% of the population has been infected.</p> <p>Wieler appealed to the German public to \u201cpreserve our success\u201d of having prevented health services from being overwhelmed by continuing to apply physical distancing even though federal authorities have already begun to relax restrictions on social movement.</p> <p>\u201cLet us continue to stay at home as much as possible, keep observing the restrictions and keep a distance of 1.5 metres from one another,\u201d Wieler said.</p> <p>The medical expert also warned of pinning too many expectations on a single indicator, saying that \u201cR is only one index among many\u201d.</p> <p>As German politicians are increasingly divided over the speed at which social distancing measures should be relaxed, the negative news of the rising reproduction number had sown some confusion, especially with latest official data also showing new cases of confirmed infections with Covid-19 dropping below 1,000 cases for the first time in almost seven weeks.</p> <p>Other scientific institutions studying the spread of the pandemic in Germany question whether the downward trend of recent weeks has in fact been reversed, as the RKI\u2019s numbers suggest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=Germany\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=Germany\">Graphic</a> <figcaption>German coronavirus graphic</figcaption> </figure>  <p>In theory, the reproduction number is calculated by dividing the number of new infections by a weighted number of infectious people. In practice, perfectly accurate numbers on both of these counts are impossible to ascertain and even available data on new infections is compiled with a lag of a few days. The reproduction number is thus always an estimate.</p> <p>For its own estimate of the reproduction number, the RKI attempts to take into account the time lag by ignoring data from the last three days and back-dating known cases to their likely day of infection around a week earlier.</p> <p>The reproduction number announced on Tuesday can therefore only give an indication of the pandemic\u2019s development at a point about a week and a half ago, when a relaxation of social distancing measures had been announced by Angela Merkel but not yet come into effect.</p> <p>Alternative models for estimating the reproduction number have been developed by the <a href=\"https://stochastik-tu-ilmenau.github.io/COVID-19/germany\">Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau</a>, in the eastern state of Thuringia, and the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/simm/covid19/secir/-/wikis/Report\">Helmholtz Centre for Infections Research</a> in Braunschweig.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Statistician Thomas Hotz, of Ilmenau University, said the model used by the RKI had a tendency to \u201csmoothen out\u201d the number of new infections by the method in which it tried to correct for the reporting delay. Hotz said his own model did not indicate a sudden rise of new infections, and that he believed the reproduction number was likely to stay below one in the next few days.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Germans have been advised to stay at home as much as possible and continue to apply physical distancing as official data appeared to indicate the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic was once again accelerating. The basic reproduction number (R), indicating how many new cases one infected person generates on average, has come to be seen as the key indicator over whether restrictions on public life can be loosened after Angela Merkel stressed the importance of keeping the number below one. On Tuesday, the German government\u2019s disease control agency, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), announced the reproduction number for Monday 27 April had risen to 1, after having put it as low as 0.7 in mid-April. Lothar Wieler, the RKI\u2019s president, later specified that the reproduction rate for Monday was 0.96, and therefore technically still below one. Scientists believe the basic reproduction rate of Covid-19, R0, to lie somewhere between 2.4 and 3.3. Without measures taken to curb the spread of the virus, the rate of new infections would grow exponentially until about 70% of the population has been infected. Wieler appealed to the German public to \u201cpreserve our success\u201d of having prevented health services from being overwhelmed by continuing to apply physical distancing even though federal authorities have already begun to relax restrictions on social movement. \u201cLet us continue to stay at home as much as possible, keep observing the restrictions and keep a distance of 1.5 metres from one another,\u201d Wieler said. The medical expert also warned of pinning too many expectations on a single indicator, saying that \u201cR is only one index among many\u201d. As German politicians are increasingly divided over the speed at which social distancing measures should be relaxed, the negative news of the rising reproduction number had sown some confusion, especially with latest official data also showing new cases of confirmed infections with Covid-19 dropping below 1,000 cases for the first time in almost seven weeks. Other scientific institutions studying the spread of the pandemic in Germany question whether the downward trend of recent weeks has in fact been reversed, as the RKI\u2019s numbers suggest. In theory, the reproduction number is calculated by dividing the number of new infections by a weighted number of infectious people. In practice, perfectly accurate numbers on both of these counts are impossible to ascertain and even available data on new infections is compiled with a lag of a few days. The reproduction number is thus always an estimate. For its own estimate of the reproduction number, the RKI attempts to take into account the time lag by ignoring data from the last three days and back-dating known cases to their likely day of infection around a week earlier. The reproduction number announced on Tuesday can therefore only give an indication of the pandemic\u2019s development at a point about a week and a half ago, when a relaxation of social distancing measures had been announced by Angela Merkel but not yet come into effect. Alternative models for estimating the reproduction number have been developed by the Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau, in the eastern state of Thuringia, and the Helmholtz Centre for Infections Research in Braunschweig. Statistician Thomas Hotz, of Ilmenau University, said the model used by the RKI had a tendency to \u201csmoothen out\u201d the number of new infections by the method in which it tried to correct for the reporting delay. Hotz said his own model did not indicate a sudden rise of new infections, and that he believed the reproduction number was likely to stay below one in the next few days.",

This virus could be anywhere.\u201d In London, retired graphic designer Sue Lamble, 74 \u2013 who has been told to shield herself because of an auto-immune condition that makes her lungs more vulnerable to infection \u2013 said she will also distance for the foreseeable future. \u201cI am afraid of getting the virus because I have this lung condition,\u201d she said. \u201cI would be quite endangered by it; my GP said it would not be automatic death but present greater dangers than for most so I am very careful.\u201d But she objected to some of the government\u2019s language throughout the crisis and said she felt like \u201cvulnerable over 70s\u201d had been characterised as disposable. \u201cWe\u2019re not,\u201d she said. \u201cMe and my friends make a massive contribution, when we can.\u201d * Some names have been changed",

      "bodyText": "Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: Germans told to stay home as infection rate rises The head of Germany\u2019s Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases calls on people to stay at home as much as possible as new figures show the country\u2019s infection rate has increased. Lothar Wieler says the virus reproduction rate, dubbed \u201cR\u201d, is now at 1.0 in Germany, which means one person with the virus infects one other on average. Earlier this month, the rate was at 0.7. Russia extends lockdown Vladimir Putin extends a non-working period in Russia until 11 May, as he warns the rate of infection in the country has not yet peaked. The Russian president made the announcement during a televised meeting with senior government officials and regional heads. France sets out plan to end lockdown The French prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, begins outlining the schedule for the end of the lockdown. Addressing the national assembly, Philippe says the situation is unique. \u201cWho could have envisaged a France where schools, universities, cafes, restaurants, the majority of businesses, libraries \u2026 beaches, stadiums \u2026 would be closed?\u201d France to scale up testing to 700,000 a week Philippe announces an ambition to increase testing to 700,000 a week, including everyone who has been in contact with someone with the virus, whether they are symptomatic or not. \u201cIsolation is not a punishment or sanction, it is a measure of collective protection,\u201d he says, appealing to the \u201ccivic behaviour\u201d of everyone to isolate for 14 days if they test positive for the virus. More than 20,000 infected in Saudi Arabia The number of confirmed cases in the kingdom passes the 20,000 mark as its health authorities report 1,266 new infections. Saudi Arabia also reports eight deaths, bringing its total death toll to 152. UK to begin publishing care home death figures The health secretary, Matt Hancock, says the UK government will begin including deaths in care homes in its daily reports as official figures show they account for almost a quarter of the total death toll in England and Wales, with yet more occurring in private homes, hospices or elsewhere. Hancock wrongly claimed at a briefing that care home deaths represent just a sixth of the total. Deaths that occur in the community will also be included from now on. Britain expands list of those eligible for tests Hancock says asymptomatic NHS and care staff, over-65s and those who travel to work will now qualify for testing. He says the government can potentially carry out 73,400 coronavirus tests per day. He has previously promised the UK would be undertaking 100,000 tests per day by the end of April. At least 3m infected globally According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, 3,063,814 people are known to have been infected, while 212,345 are confirmed to have died.

But nothing more has been forthcoming on the impact of the lockdown. The Guardian\u2019s publication last week of a list of many attendees, including the prime minister\u2019s senior adviser Dominic Cummings, fuelled calls for transparency. Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, has now promised that a membership list of participants would be published with their permission and the government also says it is planning to release more scientific papers in the coming days.</p> <h2>Lockdown exit strategy</h2> <p>Politicians from Tory grandees to opposition leaders are growing impatient with the government\u2019s refusal to set out an exit strategy.

This is set to change, after Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said daily deaths in care homes and the community would be published each day from Wednesday.</p> <p>There is also an incomplete picture of infection numbers because of the patchy situation with testing, with no widespread community monitoring.

But they have failed to breakdown the types of people tested, including how many patients, care residents, hospital workers, care workers and other key workers are being tested and where in the country. Critics have asked for more information on why the number of tests being carried out do not match the capacity for testing, with many people unable or unwilling to travel for miles when unwell to drive-through testing centres.</p> <p>There is also ambiguity around the millions of antibody tests bought by the government, with a lack of clarity about how many different types are being tested, how much they cost, where they come from and how accurate they have proved so far. Ministers have been considering ordering a large batch from British developers of a test but there have been conflicting reports about whether they are reliable enough for home use.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Hancock announced a huge expansion of the eligibility criteria for coronavirus testing, with over-65s and those who work outside the home now able to get tested for coronavirus as long as they have symptoms. Moreover, tests will be available even without symptoms for all NHS staff, hospital patients, care home workers and their elderly residents. </p> <h2>Cygnus</h2> <p>The now-notorious Exercise Cygnus was a pandemic preparation project carried out four years ago, which showed the the UK was woefully underprepared for a global outbreak of a new virus.

The app is designed to warn people who have come into close contact with anyone who has Covid-19 to go into self-isolation.</p> \n<p>The government hoped that a high proportion of the population \u2013 up to 80% \u2013 would download the app on a smartphone. But in meetings, they have been advised that is unrealistic. In Singapore, with high smartphone use, the take-up was only 20%.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Public health experts say that apps are no substitute for a sympathetic and supportive conversation, even for those who are familiar and comfortable with using smartphones, which many older and more vulnerable people are not.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is absolutely ridiculous. You need the shoe-leather epidemiology, you need people on phones. Apps are simply supports for contact tracing,\u201d said Allyson Pollock, a professor of public health at Newcastle University. \u201cYou need people on old-fashioned things like telephones or going door to door and they need to be local teams because they need to understand the local communities.\u201d</p> \n<p>The whole system should be run by directors of public health and environmental health officers based in local authorities, with the resources they need, because they understand their community, she said. That was how it used to be, before the multiple restructuring culminating in the Health and Social Care Act 2012, which led to the decimation of public health disease control and its centralisation and fragmentation, she added.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e8a5d369-ef41-4b4a-adf8-f34313e47e32\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you've started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should&nbsp;<b>stay at home for at least 7 days</b>.<br></p>\n    <p>If you live with other people,&nbsp;<b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p>After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine.

This is partly because they\u2019ve ripped out so much capacity and they\u2019ve also ripped out the real-time data locally.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are never going to get on top of this if we don\u2019t put back the local capacity in order to lift local restrictions.\u201d</p> \n<p>Contact tracing began immediately after the first case was confirmed in England at the end of January but stopped abruptly across the whole of UK \u2013 even in regions with barely any cases \u2013 on 12 March, along with community testing.</p> \n<p>The government said it was moving from the \u201ccontain\u201d to the \u201cdelay\u201d phase because it was no longer possible to track down and isolate everyone infected. Countries that continued to follow that plan, as urged by the World Health Organization (WHO), have had fewer deaths. They include Germany, Singapore and South Korea.</p> \n<p>The UK \u201cgave up very early\u201d, said Anthony Costello, a professor of global health and sustainable development at University College London and a former WHO director. By 12 March, there had been 10 deaths and 590 confirmed cases, and about 3,500 contacts had been traced. But most of the cases were in London and the West Midlands. Continued testing, tracking and tracing could have kept the virus out of other regions and reduced deaths, he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf we hadn\u2019t stopped it on 12 March, our epidemic would have been much less. They effectively allowed it to spread,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Public health, local government and environmental health officers all say they are capable of running the sort of extensive contact tracing network that will be needed in all areas of the country.</p> \n<p>\u201cDirectors of public health \u2013 and their teams \u2013 have extensive experience and knowledge of contact tracing, their local communities and the wider health and social care system,\u201d said Dr Jeanelle de Gruchy, the president of the Association of Directors of Public Health.</p> \n<p>\u201cEngaging directors of public health in the design and implementation of any new plan will help ensure whatever is developed will work on the ground and be integrated with other aspects of the response to Covid-19, including testing and protecting vulnerable people across the UK.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe reality is that no single organisation or agency, whether national or local, can deliver and oversee this operation alone. A collaborative approach is fundamental.

      "bodyText": "Ministers must relinquish their top-down control of the coronavirus epidemic after the lockdown to allow millions of people potentially infected with Covid-19 to be traced and supported by local teams in their own communities, say experts. Urgent discussions have begun between central government, local authorities and public health officials about the 18,000-strong army promised on Friday by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to help trace the contacts of people who test positive or have symptoms of the coronavirus. Hancock said they would be in place within three weeks but the Guardian understands that nobody has yet been recruited. A letter to local authorities and other agencies on Friday, seen by the Guardian, said just 3,000 of these people would have public health expertise, while the other 15,000 would be call handlers. It is understood that ministers such as Hancock, who is enthusiastic about digital technology, hoped the NHS app would take much of the strain. The app is designed to warn people who have come into close contact with anyone who has Covid-19 to go into self-isolation. The government hoped that a high proportion of the population \u2013 up to 80% \u2013 would download the app on a smartphone. But in meetings, they have been advised that is unrealistic. In Singapore, with high smartphone use, the take-up was only 20%. Public health experts say that apps are no substitute for a sympathetic and supportive conversation, even for those who are familiar and comfortable with using smartphones, which many older and more vulnerable people are not. \u201cIt is absolutely ridiculous. You need the shoe-leather epidemiology, you need people on phones. Apps are simply supports for contact tracing,\u201d said Allyson Pollock, a professor of public health at Newcastle University. \u201cYou need people on old-fashioned things like telephones or going door to door and they need to be local teams because they need to understand the local communities.\u201d The whole system should be run by directors of public health and environmental health officers based in local authorities, with the resources they need, because they understand their community, she said. That was how it used to be, before the multiple restructuring culminating in the Health and Social Care Act 2012, which led to the decimation of public health disease control and its centralisation and fragmentation, she added. \u201cWe don\u2019t know where the block is, but there is a huge block and huge resistance to doing this locally. This is partly because they\u2019ve ripped out so much capacity and they\u2019ve also ripped out the real-time data locally. \u201cWe are never going to get on top of this if we don\u2019t put back the local capacity in order to lift local restrictions.\u201d Contact tracing began immediately after the first case was confirmed in England at the end of January but stopped abruptly across the whole of UK \u2013 even in regions with barely any cases \u2013 on 12 March, along with community testing. The government said it was moving from the \u201ccontain\u201d to the \u201cdelay\u201d phase because it was no longer possible to track down and isolate everyone infected. Countries that continued to follow that plan, as urged by the World Health Organization (WHO), have had fewer deaths. They include Germany, Singapore and South Korea. The UK \u201cgave up very early\u201d, said Anthony Costello, a professor of global health and sustainable development at University College London and a former WHO director. By 12 March, there had been 10 deaths and 590 confirmed cases, and about 3,500 contacts had been traced. But most of the cases were in London and the West Midlands. Continued testing, tracking and tracing could have kept the virus out of other regions and reduced deaths, he said. \u201cIf we hadn\u2019t stopped it on 12 March, our epidemic would have been much less. They effectively allowed it to spread,\u201d he said. Public health, local government and environmental health officers all say they are capable of running the sort of extensive contact tracing network that will be needed in all areas of the country. \u201cDirectors of public health \u2013 and their teams \u2013 have extensive experience and knowledge of contact tracing, their local communities and the wider health and social care system,\u201d said Dr Jeanelle de Gruchy, the president of the Association of Directors of Public Health. \u201cEngaging directors of public health in the design and implementation of any new plan will help ensure whatever is developed will work on the ground and be integrated with other aspects of the response to Covid-19, including testing and protecting vulnerable people across the UK. \u201cThe reality is that no single organisation or agency, whether national or local, can deliver and oversee this operation alone. A collaborative approach is fundamental. The government needs to fully involve us in this.\u201d The Chartered Institute of Environmental Health said its members and also many other people with expertise, such as retired doctors, had been in touch wanting to help. \u201cWe have quite early on opened up a national voluntary register,\u201d said Gary McFarlane, its Northern Ireland director. \u201cMy own view is that we need a national media call for those who have the skills \u2013 all those retired doctors and sexual health workers and environmental health officers who can hit the ground running.\u201d As businesses start to open, whether garden centres or offices or factories, local authorities would be busy engaging with them to ensure they did it safely \u2013 so the retired volunteers could help reduce their workload by taking on the contact tracing effort. A government spokesperson said: \u201cTracing and testing those with symptoms of Covid-19 is essential if we are to limit the spread of this virus and save lives. \u201cThe NHS is developing a contact tracing app, which alongside effective tracing and testing, is designed to give our country the confidence it needs to return to normality. \u201cWe are working with clinicians, scientists and other specialists to plan a safe, staged path to national rollout.\u201d \u2022 Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?",

Without the contribution of the big emitters, all our efforts will be doomed.\u201d</p> <p>Helen Clarkson, the chief executive of The Climate Group, a set of businesses accelerating action on the climate, said companies were still committed to climate action. \u201cWith the right green stimulus policies that ramp up investment in long-term sustainable solutions from electric transport to clean efficient energy, we can deliver on the goals of the Paris agreement without compromising on economic growth,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The UK will host global climate talks next year, after the UN\u2019s Cop26 summit had to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/02/we-must-use-this-time-well-climate-experts-hopeful-after-cop26-delay-coronavirus\">postponed from its original date of this November</a>.

Richard Black, the director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said it was time for such measures. \u201cBacking for a clean recovery is now widespread, led by governments and major businesses,\u201d he said. \u201cFor actions to match rhetoric, concrete policies are going to be needed very soon \u2013 for example, the UK government delivering new policies that get the nation on track to its legally binding net-zero target, and making sure the world doesn\u2019t bounce back into high-polluting ways as soon as the lockdown eases.\u201d Guterres called for tougher action on cutting emissions, as well as more investment. \u201cPublic funds should invest in the future by flowing to sustainable sectors and projects that help the environment and climate. Fossil fuel subsidies must end, and carbon must have a price so polluters will pay for their pollution,\u201d he said. Guterres also called for developing countries to receive $100bn (\u00a382bn) a year, a longstanding goal under the global climate negotiations, to help them curb emissions and cope with the impacts of climate breakdown, and he hinted at moves to reduce the debt on many developing countries, which has been mooted as a way to help them during the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cWe cannot allow the heavy and rising debt burden of developing countries to serve as a barrier to their ambition [on the climate],\u201d he said. Rich countries must all commit to zero-carbon emissions by 2050, added Guterres, with a particular nod to the US and China. \u201cThe Paris agreement was largely made possible by the engagement of the US and China. Without the contribution of the big emitters, all our efforts will be doomed.\u201d Helen Clarkson, the chief executive of The Climate Group, a set of businesses accelerating action on the climate, said companies were still committed to climate action. \u201cWith the right green stimulus policies that ramp up investment in long-term sustainable solutions from electric transport to clean efficient energy, we can deliver on the goals of the Paris agreement without compromising on economic growth,\u201d she said. The UK will host global climate talks next year, after the UN\u2019s Cop26 summit had to be postponed from its original date of this November. No date has yet to be set for the rearranged meeting, but work is continuing on diplomatic engagement aimed at encouraging countries to come forward with more ambitious climate plans, according to the UK government.",

      "bodyText": "Australia should launch an ambitious program to build public housing for 30,000 families and individuals to boost the post-crisis economic recovery and reduce homelessness, the Australian Council of Social Service has said. While business has renewed its calls for more flexible workplace relations laws and corporate tax cuts on the other side of the Covid-19 crisis, Acoss is warning against any sudden \u201csnap back\u201d to old economic and social policies, saying it could harm the recovery. In a new plan to \u201cbuild back better\u201d, the advocacy group has called for ongoing support to be provided to low- and modest-income households, noting they are most likely to spend it, while avoiding any return to the \u201cbrutality\u201d of $40 a day in unemployment payments. One of the key planks of the plan is a $7bn scheme to build 30,000 social housing dwellings. In its report, released on Wednesday, Acoss said the Covid-19 lockdowns had \u201cexposed the scale of homelessness and rough sleeping in Australia, both as a social problem and as a health risk\u201d. Even with winter approaching, services had been struggling to find suitable accommodation for people while maintaining physical distancing measures. The chief executive of Acoss, Dr Cassandra Goldie, said there was a lot of talk about fast-tracking infrastructure projects to spur the economic recovery. \u201cWe say we should pick the kind of builds that will deliver jobs and deliver them relatively quickly,\u201d she said. Goldie said housing construction should be rolled out \u201cas rapidly as possible\u201d in partnership with states and territories and targeted to areas of need all around the country. The last census found more than 116,000 people were sleeping rough or in overcrowded or insecure accommodation \u2013 about 50 out of every 10,000 people. As part of the response to the global financial crisis, the Rudd and Gillard governments spent $5.6bn over three and a half years on a social housing initiative. A report by KPMG found that for every $1 invested in construction activity, about $1.30 in economic turnover was generated. But after the GFC, Goldie said, successive governments \u201cjust cut away with this obsession of trying to return a budget to surplus at the expense of people who really got left behind back then, and we don\u2019t want that to happen this time around\u201d. In addition to social housing, Acoss called for a national program to improve energy efficiency and install solar panels on the homes of people on low incomes. Other elements of the five-point plan are: increasing income support to people most in need; closing the gaps in home care services to focus on those most at risk and create jobs; and pursuing reforms to avert a rise in long-term and structural unemployment. There is growing political support for a longer-term increase in unemployment benefits as the coronavirus supplement that effectively doubles the jobseeker payment is due to expire in six months. The former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce told Guardian Australia on Tuesday: \u201cThere will always be some who exploit any system but that can not be the reason we hurt the bona fide unemployed.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Australia would harm its interests for little more than a political stunt if it followed the United States in withdrawing from United Nations bodies, a former ambassador turned Liberal politician has warned. As the government finalises its review into how it engages with global bodies \u2013 prompted by Scott Morrison\u2019s concerns about \u201cnegative globalism\u201d \u2013 the Wentworth MP, Dave Sharma, said Australia should avoid being left without a seat at the table. Instead, Sharma called for Australia to use its influence to try to get more of its own candidates into senior positions on UN agencies, amid concerns that other countries including China were increasingly good at such efforts. Over the last few years Donald Trump has pulled the US out of a number of UN bodies, including the culture agency Unesco and the Human Rights Council, on the grounds of anti-Israel bias. The US president also abandoned the Paris climate accord and recently vowed to halt funding to the World Health Organization due to concerns about how it handled the coronavirus pandemic and its interactions with China. But if Australia were to withdraw from multilateral bodies, Sharma said, it would tend to harm our interests \u201cand it just means we don\u2019t have a seat at the table or a voice in the room\u201d. The former diplomat said he saw withdrawal as \u201ca political stunt more than anything else\u201d. \u201cThe threat of withdrawal by a country like the United States has an impact because they\u2019re a major country, they\u2019re usually the major donor to an organisation and they have a loud voice,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cAustralia is not that country.\u201d Earlier this month, Morrison revealed that a report on how Australia engages with international bodies would be coming back from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade \u201cvery soon\u201d. The audit is much broader than the WHO, which has been the focus of recent debate, and stems from Morrison\u2019s declaration in a speech to the Lowy Institute last year that Australia needed to avoid \u201cany reflex towards a negative globalism\u201d or \u201can unaccountable internationalist bureaucracy\u201d. Sharma, who served as the Australian ambassador to Israel before entering politics, said while he was unaware of the contents of the forthcoming report: \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be a review which says we should get out of bodies X, Y and Z.\u201d The backbencher said: \u201cIt should really be about: look, we want to support the rules-based global order, we\u2019ve identified that\u2019s in Australia\u2019s national interest, which bodies in the UN system are most important to upholding that order, and are we investing the right amount in those bodies \u2013 financially, diplomatically, political capital, candidacies?\u201d It may be necessary, he said, to have \u201ca rebalance or a prioritisation of our effort\u201d. Generally speaking, Australia was \u201cnot particularly forward thinking or strategic about\u201d running campaigns for leadership roles in international bodies. \u201cI think that\u2019s where we should be devoting more time and more resources and being a little more strategic in making sure that we\u2019ve got people on there that share our world view and have the right level of expertise,\u201d Sharma said.

Others had parents who understood the importance of expressing one\u2019s emotions for good mental health, for bonding, for learning and for building resilience \u2013 <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1066480710387486\">these are emotional coaches</a>. Regardless of what you inherited, your emotional style is <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45827156_Tuning_in_to_Kids_Improving_emotion_socialization_practices_in_parents_of_preschool_children-findings_from_a_community_trial\">something that can be changed</a>.</p> \n<p>Psychologists and neuroscientists have found that children who grow up with parents who use emotional coaching have a <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5363438_Physiology_and_functioning_Parents%27_vagal_tone_emotion_socialization_and_children%27s_emotion_knowledge\">calmer central nervous system, a lower resting heart rate, a healthier emotional brain circuitry</a> and <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9507.2005.00319.x\">better coping skills</a>. These are the kids who stay cool under pressure. Exactly the kind of coping skills our kids need right now.</p> \n<p>So, what can we do during Covid-19 to become an emotional coach for our kids? Here are four simple strategies you can incorporate into your daily family routine during lockdown that can also be turned into fun school assignments during this time of remote learning.</p> \n<h2>Create coronavirus conversations</h2> \n<p>Turn the news off so your child is not bombarded by Covid-19 updates, but don\u2019t shy away from those conversations. Be open to speaking with your kids about what\u2019s going on \u2013 respond to their questions and fears. Don\u2019t feel it is best to shelter them completely but do be wise about what and how you share with them. Take their lead and speak about it when they raise the conversation. Talk to them when you\u2019re feeling calm. If your emotional kaleidoscope is shaken up in the moment they initiate the conversations, reassure them: \u201cI think it\u2019s a good idea for us to talk, I have to do something first but let\u2019s sit down together and talk in 10 minutes.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>When our kids know that 'emotions have motion' and fear moves on, it is easier for them to experience the fear, sit with it and watch it give way to laughter</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Balance your conversation between \u201cfacts and feelings\u201d \u2013 talk about the facts of what you know and ask them about their feelings. Finish the conversation by reminding them about the things they have control over \u2013 washing their hands, social-distancing, trying their best during home-learning \u2013 as this will reduce their feelings of uncertainty and anxiety. Reassure them <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0735-7028.36.3.238\">all emotions are normal</a> and they can always talk to you about their feelings.</p> \n<p>For home-learning, you can set a language assignment that involves your kids creating an \u201cEmotions Dictionary\u201d. Have them look up the full range of different emotions, define each emotion, put it into a sentence and write about how that emotion might show itself during family lockdown. You can add an art lesson to this by having your child draw or paint each emotion.</p> \n<h2>Feel the feels</h2> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/22/self-isolation-is-bringing-out-the-worst-in-some-how-do-we-avoid-conflict\">'Self-isolation is bringing out the worst in some. How do we avoid conflict?'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Here\u2019s the thing about emotions: they are fleeting. Biologically speaking, emotions are actually a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4329228/\">little burst of brain chemistry</a> that alter our mood. The healthy brain has evolved so that it <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5289590/\">does not get stuck in one chemical state for a long period of time</a> and this is what makes us human. The emotional tapestry we experience allows us to experience highs and lows \u2013 to be angry one minute and in awe the next.

      "bodyText": "Most families are going through the full gamut of emotions right now. Gratitude, worry, fear, love, compassion, frustration, restlessness and so on \u2013 a fragile kaleidoscope of emotions. A fluctuating pattern of colours that changes radically with the slightest nudge. How do we help children deal with the emotions of something that we can\u2019t wrap our heads around ourselves? Research shows the resilience children have is influenced not only by the adversity itself but also by the emotional responses of the parents. Studies have found that parents generally fall into one of two categories when it comes to the way they deal with their children\u2019s emotions: emotional coaches or emotional dismissers. Often, your style was passed on to you by your own parents and has a lot to do with their beliefs about whether emotions are best avoided or embraced. Some among us were raised by parents who saw talking about emotions as a waste of time, self-indulgent, a sign of weakness, or shameful \u2013 this is the emotionally dismissive response. Others had parents who understood the importance of expressing one\u2019s emotions for good mental health, for bonding, for learning and for building resilience \u2013 these are emotional coaches. Regardless of what you inherited, your emotional style is something that can be changed. Psychologists and neuroscientists have found that children who grow up with parents who use emotional coaching have a calmer central nervous system, a lower resting heart rate, a healthier emotional brain circuitry and better coping skills. These are the kids who stay cool under pressure. Exactly the kind of coping skills our kids need right now. So, what can we do during Covid-19 to become an emotional coach for our kids? Here are four simple strategies you can incorporate into your daily family routine during lockdown that can also be turned into fun school assignments during this time of remote learning. Create coronavirus conversations Turn the news off so your child is not bombarded by Covid-19 updates, but don\u2019t shy away from those conversations. Be open to speaking with your kids about what\u2019s going on \u2013 respond to their questions and fears. Don\u2019t feel it is best to shelter them completely but do be wise about what and how you share with them. Take their lead and speak about it when they raise the conversation. Talk to them when you\u2019re feeling calm. If your emotional kaleidoscope is shaken up in the moment they initiate the conversations, reassure them: \u201cI think it\u2019s a good idea for us to talk, I have to do something first but let\u2019s sit down together and talk in 10 minutes.\u201d Balance your conversation between \u201cfacts and feelings\u201d \u2013 talk about the facts of what you know and ask them about their feelings. Finish the conversation by reminding them about the things they have control over \u2013 washing their hands, social-distancing, trying their best during home-learning \u2013 as this will reduce their feelings of uncertainty and anxiety. Reassure them all emotions are normal and they can always talk to you about their feelings. For home-learning, you can set a language assignment that involves your kids creating an \u201cEmotions Dictionary\u201d. Have them look up the full range of different emotions, define each emotion, put it into a sentence and write about how that emotion might show itself during family lockdown. You can add an art lesson to this by having your child draw or paint each emotion. Feel the feels Here\u2019s the thing about emotions: they are fleeting. Biologically speaking, emotions are actually a little burst of brain chemistry that alter our mood. The healthy brain has evolved so that it does not get stuck in one chemical state for a long period of time and this is what makes us human. The emotional tapestry we experience allows us to experience highs and lows \u2013 to be angry one minute and in awe the next. When our kids know that \u201cemotions have motion\u201d and fear moves on, it is easier for them to experience the fear, sit with it and then watch it give way to laughter as their dog comes up to lick their face. As parents, we can also take comfort in knowing that \u201cthis too shall pass\u201d. The anxiety or frustration you had this morning during family lockdown will give way to a sense of relief that your family is safe, gratitude for the kindness of a friend, pride that your family is adapting and having little wins along the way during this time of crisis. So, feel the feels and allow emotions to rise knowing that they won\u2019t stay. For home learning, set a science assignment and ask your child to research the neurochemistry of emotions. Ask them to prepare a presentation on the three neuropeptides that boost positive emotions: serotonin, dopamine and oxytocin. These might sound like big words, but your kids might surprise you with the learning on this topic. Make emotions concrete There\u2019s a truism in psychology, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to name it to tame it\u201d. A key part of building emotional intelligence is being able to name one\u2019s emotions. You can encourage your child to explore their emotions using the metaphors of weather. Have them name if they are cloudy, stormy, rainy, clear or sunny. Let them know that it is OK to have many seasons in the one day. They won\u2019t get stuck in a storm forever, the sun will shine again. A creative art learning activity to do during lockdown would be to create an art project of the family\u2019s emotional weather. If you want your child to do some maths at home, ask them to track the weather they observe in themselves and family members during the day, chart the moods of each family member, add up the percentage of time each family member experiences certain emotions and track how emotions change over the course of the day. Use the power of music Music is a great way to help connect children with their emotions. Music taps into our emotions in a way that words alone cannot. Neuroscientist Daniel Levitin\u2019s research shows that when we listen to music almost every region and neural subsystem in our brain is activated. Music helps with emotion and with brain development too which is a bonus while we are all home-schooling. A fun music lesson to have your kids do during family lockdown is create a positive playlist of songs that boost your mood. Include songs about resilience, triumph and overcoming negative events. Build on this assignment by having your children write an essay about singers who have shown resilience and grit in their career. You can then use the playlist to create a new positive family ritual by pumping the music and dancing like crazy each night after dinner. This can be turned into a physical education lesson that will release the pent-up energy of your kids and boost their endorphins and dopamine \u2013 all while you are showing them a technique they can use for the rest of their lives to manage their emotions. The added bonus is you are creating a positive memory for the kids and when they look back on this challenging time, they\u2019ll remember the \u201cfamily dance-off\u2019s\u201d that occurred each night. There\u2019s a lot we can\u2019t control right now but one thing we can turn our attention to is the emotions of our family and how to help our kids cope and grow stronger through this experience. Helping your kids express, understand and grow from their emotions during Covid-19 is a skill that will last into their adult lives.

Robbie King Alsager, Cheshire \u2022 I keep a child\u2019s toy fishing net in my house to catch birds that fly in, usually housemartin fledglings (Letters, 23 April). This enables me to catch them easily without all the frenzied, frightened crashing into the windows. Penny Snook Stubton, Lincolnshire \u2022 Zoe Williams observes that weevils can be sifted out of flour (Is old yeast OK? The 17 rules of expiry dates, 23 April). My mother-in-law bought flour out of the sack at a corner shop during the war. The weevils, she said, died when cooked.

      "bodyText": "One crucial moment in Boris Johnson\u2019s speech (PM\u2019s post-coronavirus speech: what he said, and what it means, 27 April) was when he framed the crisis using the following analogy: \u201cIf this virus were \u2026 an unexpected and invisible mugger, which I can tell you from personal experience it is\u2026\u201d Already, then, it seems the narrative is being seeded that all of this was somehow unavoidable \u2013 that the UK, under his leadership, is somehow an innocent victim of an epidemiological crime that we couldn\u2019t have seen coming. This is from a man who actively boasted of shaking hands with coronavirus patients. This is from a man at the helm when we missed a crucial opportunity to get ahead of the curve by going hard and early. This is from a man whose party was warned in 2016 and 2019 about the potential dangers of \u2013 and required preparation for \u2013 a pandemic and failed to act accordingly. If the virus truly were a mugger then the UK, under his leadership, would be the sucker who walked down a dark alley at midnight waving a wallet in the air.

Abrahams also warned of worsening mental health among the over-70s if they have to spend months away from friends and family, describing it as \u201cunimaginably\u201d bleak.</p> \n<p>The former Conservative chancellor, Ken Clarke, said treating the over-70s too cautiously could leave people feeling as though they are under house arrest, especially when many in this age group still work and look after grandchildren.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/coronavirus-uk-how-many-confirmed-cases-are-there-in-my-area\">Coronavirus UK: how many confirmed cases are there in my area?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The Alzheimer\u2019s Society has concerns about what a prolonged lockdown may mean for people with dementia.

      "bodyText": "Charities supporting older people have warned the government that prolonged shielding and social distancing for the over-70s while lockdown measures are potentially eased for others could create a sense of \u201cvictimisation\u201d. Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said age alone should not determine people\u2019s ability to go about their daily lives if the government decides to begin easing some of the restrictions. The prime minister is developing plans for the next stage of the government\u2019s coronavirus response when the current lockdown period ends on 7 May. People over 70 were told in March to abide by distancing rules and those classed as extremely vulnerable because of an underlying health condition have been asked to stay at home until the end of June. Prior to any easing of lockdown restrictions by the government, which is understood to be extremely cautious about this age cohort and reluctant to change its current advice, Abrahams said: \u201cAn enforced lockdown of people beyond a certain age would undoubtedly create a sense of victimisation, unless there is really clear clinical evidence showing that advancing age in and of itself makes it more likely that a person will become seriously ill, regardless of their state of health and their resilience.\u201d The charity has asked for the government\u2019s advice for the next stage of the coronavirus strategy to be advisory and not compulsory. Abrahams also warned of worsening mental health among the over-70s if they have to spend months away from friends and family, describing it as \u201cunimaginably\u201d bleak. The former Conservative chancellor, Ken Clarke, said treating the over-70s too cautiously could leave people feeling as though they are under house arrest, especially when many in this age group still work and look after grandchildren. The Alzheimer\u2019s Society has concerns about what a prolonged lockdown may mean for people with dementia. Isolation and a weakening of social skills maintained through day-to-day interaction could be a consequence. It has also suggested that any extension of the rules affecting the over-70s must ensure the continuation of reserved shopping hours for vulnerable people. Chair of the all-party parliamentary group on ageing and older people, Rachael Maskell MP, said the government could consider introducing a chief adviser on the elderly if they are going to be treated differently to the rest of the population in the long term. Downing Street has not released plans for this age group or how they fit into a lockdown exit strategy. Much of the response for supporting the elderly has been led by Robert Jenrick, secretary of state for housing, communities and local government, who is expected to continue feeding into the government\u2019s preparations. However, the government may consider replacing the shielding advice for vulnerable people with gentler physical distancing guidelines if the scientific evidence suggests it is feasible. Dame Esther Rantzen, 79, founder of The Silver Line, which supports older people with telephone friendship and an advice helpline, said lockdown measures for the over-70s should continue if the government thinks it is the best advice. She told the Guardian: \u201cThis is not something you can just breeze through when you are 70-plus. I think it\u2019s a measure of the value they place on us. I won\u2019t object. I would object far more if there was an official view that people over 70 didn\u2019t matter and therefore they can come out and catch the virus and go down like nine-pins. The idea we should be shielded is evidence we should be valued.\u201d However she warned that the social cost of a potential extension would be high and asked people to keep up support for elderly neighbours if they are allowed to return to work. Tory MP, Bob Blackman, said he did not expect government advice for the over-70s to change after 7 May. \u201cI just don\u2019t believe it\u2019s going to change.

      "bodyText": "The death toll from coronavirus in care homes will be announced daily from Wednesday after figures revealed a sharp rise of more than 4,300 deaths in a fortnight in England and Wales and care operators said they were at the centre of the crisis. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said care deaths would now be tracked in the same way as hospital fatalities \u201cto keep the focus on what is happening in care homes\u201d and allow policy to be changed swiftly if needed. Until now, data has been published weekly and a week out of date. But Hancock declined to apologise to bereaved families for failing to protect their loved ones, amid widely reported shortages of personal protective equipment and testing in care homes. Hancock said testing would be expanded to include people with coronavirus symptoms aged over 65 and members of their households, as well as workers who have had to leave home in order to do their jobs, and their households. \u201cBuilding on successful pilots, we will be rolling out testing of asymptomatic residents and staff in care homes in England, and to patients and staff in the NHS. This will mean that anyone who is working or living in a care home will be able to get access to a test whether they have symptoms or not,\u201d Hancock said. \u201cThe spread of the virus though care homes is absolutely a top priority.\u201d Data gathered by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), the care homes regulator, published for the first time on Tuesday by the Office for National Statistics showed that from 10-24 April care homes reported 4,343 deaths from coronavirus. Half of them came in the last five days, indicating an accelerating death toll. It marks a sharp rise in the official death toll in care homes, which stood at 1,043 up to 10 April. There has been growing frustration among care home operators, staff and relatives that the government has underestimated the gravity of the impact of the virus in care. In the week to 17 April almost a quarter of recorded deaths from the virus happened in care homes, and local authority social care directors have said the death toll in care and community settings is likely to rise higher than that in NHS hospitals. The latter toll reached 21,678 on Tuesday. Labour said the latest care home figures showed \u201cthe appalling impact Covid-19 is having on people who use social care\u201d. Liz Kendall, the shadow minister for care and older people, urged Hancock to deliver \u201cwhatever resources it takes\u201d for care homes to tackle the pandemic, guaranteeing personal protective equipment (PPE) for care workers and priority testing close to their homes. She called on Hancock to use spare NHS capacity including the Nightingale hospitals to receive people discharged from hospital with a positive Covid-19 diagnosis rather than sending them into care homes, and also to accept coronavirus patients from care homes that are struggling to cope. Care home operators said the ONS data appeared to be finally starting to catch up with death rates they had been seeing for several weeks. Sam Monaghan, the chief executive of MHA, the largest charitable operator of care homes, at which 294 residents have died from confirmed or suspected coronavirus, said the figures were starting to show \u201cwhat we have known for some weeks now, that care homes are sadly the most affected area of society in terms of deaths from Covid-19\u201d. The ONS cautioned that the figures, gathered from notifications from providers, may yet be an underestimate because of reporting delays. Figures gathered by the Guardian from the largest care home chains have shown rises in the number of fatalities from Covid-19 in residential and nursing homes of between 50% and 79% in the last one to two weeks. Vic Rayner, the chief executive of the National Care Forum, said the figures showed \u201cthe very urgent need for a daily tracking of all Covid-19 deaths as a key priority for the government\u201d and called for a \u201cring of steel\u201d around care homes. \u201cThey need the right PPE equipment, medical monitoring devices, rapid and comprehensive testing, proper funding and intensive research to safeguard the people they care for,\u201d she said. Up to 17 April there were 22,300 deaths registered in England and Wales where Covid-19 was mentioned on death certificates. The virus accounted for 39% of all deaths, over half of the death toll in London and more than 40% in the north-west and the north-east. Separately, figures for Scotland show that by 19 April, of the 1,616 deaths from the virus, a third happened in care homes. The number of deaths in care homes where Covid-19 has been included on the death certificate has risen sharply from two in the week ending 20 March, to 22, 217, 1,043 and 3,093 in the following four weeks to 17 April, according to the ONS. The CQC figures, which account for a further week but are broadly tracking the ONS figures, suggest the ONS data next week is likely to show well over 5,000 care home deaths in total. ONS data has to be certified by a doctor, registered and processed, and so is usually published approximately 11 days in arrears.",

Earlier this month, she warned that domestic abuse killings were up to twice as high as normal since lockdown measures confined millions of people to their homes, although the sample size was small.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere was always going to be an epidemic [of domestic violence] inside this pandemic,\u201d Baird said. \u201cIt should have been flagged up a lot earlier. There have been stories from social services of people not being able to obtain admission to [family] homes [to investigate] because they have been told, inappropriately, they haven\u2019t got personal protective equipment (PPE).</p> \n<p>\u201cMinisters are working very hard but they are all working in their own silos. It\u2019s imperative that there be more accommodation made available for victims of domestic violence. Refuges are full, others are in lockdown because of coronavirus [so can\u2019t take in new victims].\u201d</p> \n<p>There were 72 refuge vacancies in England on 3 April, compared to 170 on the same day last year. The Women\u2019s Aid Annual Survey 2017, carried out on a single day, found there were 3,557 women with 3,919 children and young people staying in refuges across all services in England.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s very little accommodation,\u201d Baird said. \u201cUniversities and hotels have been offering help\u201d but they cannot provide the specialist services required, she added.</p> \n<p>An intergovernmental group involving both the Ministry of Justice and Home Office should be established to deal with the problem, Baird urged, with the victims\u2019 commissioner and domestic abuse commissioner also involved.</p> \n<p>A survey published by Women\u2019s Aid on Tuesday found that over two-thirds of survivors contacted this month said that domestic abuse was escalating under lockdown; 72% said their abuser has more control over their life since Covid-19.</p> \n<p>Over three-quarters (78%) of victims, the survey found, reported that Covid-19 has made it harder for them to leave their abuser. One survivor said: \u201cI wanted to leave the relationship. However, since Covid-19 and the lockdown coming into effect, it has made it harder to leave. I am a key worker who is around Covid positive patients, so I don\u2019t feel like I can go home and stay with my parents.\u201d</p> \n<p>Womens\u2019 Aid said there was a severe shortage of refuge places even before the pandemic. There were about 300 refuges in England and Wales in 2017 but funding has been cut.</p> \n<p>Lucy Hadley, campaigns and policy manager at Women\u2019s Aid, said: \u201cDemand for refuge services far outstripped supply before the Covid-19 crisis. Sixty-four per cent of refuge referrals were declined in 2018-19, and the number of refuge bed spaces in England is 30% below the number recommended by the Council of Europe.

      "bodyText": "Refuges providing sanctuary to victims of domestic violence are running out of space, with many full or effectively closed amid an \u201cepidemic inside this pandemic\u201d, the victims\u2019 commissioner has told MPs. A \u201cperfect storm\u201d of problems is in danger of overwhelming support services for those trying to escape violent and abusive partners, Dame Vera Baird QC warned members of the House of Commons justice select committee. She also said on Tuesday there was evidence of a newer trend, of older children \u2013 principally teenagers \u2013 attacking their parents amid frustration about being unable to go outside. The former solicitor general reinforced concerns about the rapid rise in domestic violence cases during lockdown. Earlier this month, she warned that domestic abuse killings were up to twice as high as normal since lockdown measures confined millions of people to their homes, although the sample size was small. \u201cThere was always going to be an epidemic [of domestic violence] inside this pandemic,\u201d Baird said. \u201cIt should have been flagged up a lot earlier. There have been stories from social services of people not being able to obtain admission to [family] homes [to investigate] because they have been told, inappropriately, they haven\u2019t got personal protective equipment (PPE). \u201cMinisters are working very hard but they are all working in their own silos. It\u2019s imperative that there be more accommodation made available for victims of domestic violence. Refuges are full, others are in lockdown because of coronavirus [so can\u2019t take in new victims].\u201d There were 72 refuge vacancies in England on 3 April, compared to 170 on the same day last year. The Women\u2019s Aid Annual Survey 2017, carried out on a single day, found there were 3,557 women with 3,919 children and young people staying in refuges across all services in England. \u201cThere\u2019s very little accommodation,\u201d Baird said. \u201cUniversities and hotels have been offering help\u201d but they cannot provide the specialist services required, she added. An intergovernmental group involving both the Ministry of Justice and Home Office should be established to deal with the problem, Baird urged, with the victims\u2019 commissioner and domestic abuse commissioner also involved. A survey published by Women\u2019s Aid on Tuesday found that over two-thirds of survivors contacted this month said that domestic abuse was escalating under lockdown; 72% said their abuser has more control over their life since Covid-19. Over three-quarters (78%) of victims, the survey found, reported that Covid-19 has made it harder for them to leave their abuser. One survivor said: \u201cI wanted to leave the relationship. However, since Covid-19 and the lockdown coming into effect, it has made it harder to leave. I am a key worker who is around Covid positive patients, so I don\u2019t feel like I can go home and stay with my parents.\u201d Womens\u2019 Aid said there was a severe shortage of refuge places even before the pandemic. There were about 300 refuges in England and Wales in 2017 but funding has been cut. Lucy Hadley, campaigns and policy manager at Women\u2019s Aid, said: \u201cDemand for refuge services far outstripped supply before the Covid-19 crisis. Sixty-four per cent of refuge referrals were declined in 2018-19, and the number of refuge bed spaces in England is 30% below the number recommended by the Council of Europe. These life-saving services are now on the frontline of the response to the pandemic. \u201cThey are now facing staff shortages, lost income, challenges in managing social distancing within communal accommodation, and restrictions on resettling women and children into long-term housing. This simply means the spaces we have are even less accessible to survivors.\u201d Baird also told the justice committee that there is \u201csome suggestion of abuse by older children on parents\u201d during the coronavirus lockdown. \u201cThis is a newer kind of domestic abuse which is probably suggestive of kids wanting to go out and not being allowed to. We are talking teenagers.\u201d Calls to domestic violence helplines have rocketed, she said, although complaints to the police have not gone up commensurately. \u201cThere are real worries about access to any help if you are locked down with the perpetrator in the next room.\u201d Labour\u2019s shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds MP, has criticised the government\u2019s announcement that it is providing just over \u00a33m in emergency aid. \u201cThat is why Labour has set out an urgent \u00a375m plan to fund charities working to protect people suffering from domestic abuse,\u201d he said. In the Commons, the new attorney general, Suella Braverman, said the extra funds being made available would help frontline services. She reminded those in danger that \u201cthey will not be breaking the law if they flee their home [during the lockdown] and seek help outside\u201d.",

David Nieper\u2019s gown has been designed with ties at the front of the shoulder which can easily be unfastened without assistance. The gown can also be removed inside out so that germs are trapped inside before being washed.",

This marks a sharp rise from the official death toll up to 10 April, which was 1,043. From Wednesday, the government will publish daily figures for the number of coronavirus deaths in care homes and the community. This follows complaints for many weeks that by only publishing hospital deaths, figures could be underestimating the true number of deaths by as much as half, according to some estimates.<br></li> \n   <li>The Scottish government published new guidance recommending <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/28/sturgeon-urges-scots-to-wear-coronavirus-face-masks-for-shopping-and-travel\">the public should wear face coverings</a> in \u201climited circumstances\u201d where it was not always possible to remain two metres apart, for instance in supermarkets and on public transport. The UK government said it was still considering advice submitted on this issue submitted by Sage last week, which maintained there is \u201cweak\u201d evidence of face masks having a \u201csmall\u201d protective effect. The most important thing to maintain is physical distancing, it added.</li> \n   <li>British Airways is set to make up to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/british-airways-plans-to-make-up-to-12000-staff-redundant\">12,000 workers redundant</a> as the airline\u2019s parent company revealed its revenue had plunged 13% in the first quarter of 2020. Announcing the cuts, IAG said it expected recovery to 2019 passenger levels to take several years.</li> \n   <li>Eligibility for free coronavirus tests has been extended to NHS patients and staff who do not have symptoms, and care home residents and staff who do not have symptoms (those who do have symptoms qualify for tests already). Anyone over 65 with symptoms and anybody who needs to leave home to go to work who has symptoms, as well as members of their family, will also be eligible. </li> \n   <li>And the former prime minister Theresa May urged ministers to consider the impact of lockdown for domestic abuse and mental health, as well as the economy, when deciding how quickly to lift restrictions. Speaking in a debate on the domestic abuse bill, she said there was \u201cclear\u201d evidence that domestic abuse was increasing during lockdown because perpetrators have greater freedom to act and victims find it harder to leave. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s it from us today on the UK side, thanks to all of you for following along and to everybody who got in touch with tips and suggestions.

Until now it has only published daily figures for hospital deaths. This has led to complaints that the headline figures are giving a misleading impression, because there are claims that they understate the true level of coronavirus deaths by as much as half. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/28/uk-coronavirus-live-news-minutes-silence-to-commemorate-key-workers-who-have-died?page=with:block-5ea83d178f08103bdf8097fa#block-5ea83d178f08103bdf8097fa\">3.34pm.)</a> Hancock said the new figures would \u201chelp inform the judgments that we make as we work to keep people safe\u201d. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He announced a significant increase in the number of people eligible for free coronavirus tests.</strong> Residents and staff in care homes, and patients and staff in NHS hospitals, who don\u2019t have symptoms would be eligible, he said. (If they do have symptoms, they are already eligible.) And he said that people over 65 with symptoms, or people who need to travel for work and have symptoms, would be eligible too. He said that the government was able to do this because it now had the capacity to carry out more than 70,000 tests a day. The full details of the new eligibility rules are<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-getting-tested\"> here.</a></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He complained that a reporter who asked him to apologise for not doing enough to protect people in care homes was being unreasonable. </strong>When it was put to him that he might take the opportunity to apologise, Hancock replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The thing is, I think that\u2019s unreasonable as a question, actually. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Hancock insisted that he had been focused on problems in care homes from the start.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He defended his decision not to ban visitors to care homes earlier.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The critical thing is that in a care home having visitors also has a positive impact both against the loneliness of the residents but also on their longevity and their mental health. So these are difficult judgments and there are no easy recommendations to make.</p> \n   <p>We were guided by that clinical advice and when it was necessary to make that change, which is quite a firm change, then we did so.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He criticised <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-52440641\">a BBC Panorama investigation about PPE shortages.</a> </strong>In response to a question about the report, and about a survey of doctors that showed their concerns about PPE, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I saw two of the things you referred to. I\u2019m not sure they were a fair and objective journalistic assessment of the situation but what we do have is constant focus on the realities of getting PPE to the frontline.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Prof Dame Angela McLean, the government\u2019s deputy chief scientific advisor, said ministers have been told there is \u201cweak\u201d evidence of a \u201csmall\u201d beneficial effect from face masks.</strong> She said this advice had been passed on to ministers, who are still deciding whether to change the official advice to the public.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The government published a chart that appears to show the UK performing worse than other European countries on coronavirus deaths. </strong>That is because it includes all coronavirus deaths for the UK. But the chart itself stresses that the data does not always include like-for-like comparisons because different countries count in different ways.

The number of prison staff infected rose by 7% to 317 workers in the same period.</p> \n  <p>Analysis by <strong>Public Health England</strong> published late on Monday revealed that there were nearly 1,800 possible cases of the virus among the prisoner population. 15 inmates have died directly or indirectly from Covid-19.</p> \n  <p>There are 81,500 prisoners across 117 jails in England and Wales, and around 33,000 staff working in 104 public sector prisons.</p> \n  <p>The new modelling from PHE shows that reducing the prison population by 5,000 could be effective in limiting the spread of the virus, the MoJ said, with the number of inmates already reduced by 3,000 over a seven-week period.</p> \n  <p>Testing for prisoners has been \u201climited but variable\u201d but staff testing has been made available with more than 1,000 referred in the past fortnight.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea85f6b8f0853abef659251\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-28T16:56:27.199Z\">5.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Q: When will you recruit the 18,000 contact tracers you need?

(The question came from the Northern Echo.) He says he knows how \u201cgregarious\u201d they are.</p> \n  <p>McLean says London passed its peak before other areas. But if there is an effect, it is quite small, she says.</p> \n  <p>She says the question of whether or not there should be regional approaches to relaxing the lockdown is interesting. There is always a trade-off between tailoring policy to different regions, and keeping it simple and ensuring people are all in it together. She says she does not have an answer on that.</p> \n  <p>Hancock says the government is looking at the case for taking different approaches in different regions. But he says there is a case for ensuring all regions move together. And if the reproduction number went above 1 in any area, that would spread.</p> \n  <p>These arguments make the case for acting together, he says.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-28T16:59:13.057Z\">at 5.59pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea85d408f0853abef659212\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-28T16:46:26.272Z\">5.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Q: There is confusion about what the social distancing measures are.

Here\u2019s an extract.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>After the Plague and the Great Fire, London was rebuilt by [the architect Christopher] Wren. In the decades after the second world war, London\u2019s manufacturing base dwindled to a fraction of its former self, and the Docks, the hub of the world\u2019s goods-trading economy were shuttered. But London was reborn as a city of services \u2013 financial, business, educational, creative, cultural, scientific, technological and more.</p> \n   <p>It seems unlikely that London, and cities like it, are about to disappear. But London may become a very different place from what it is now. A city where creative class or knowledge workers work from home as much as they commute to the office. Where the jostling for the best table in the restaurant takes place when booking online and not in the queue on the street. Where stadiums, art galleries and concert halls are redesigned to ensure public health along with entertainment and high culture. Where delivery vehicles are necessarily electric, and deliveries are grouped by algorithms and priced accordingly. Where pavements and public areas are widened to allow easy transition to social distancing, and where road space is recognised as a precious asset and charged for as such. Where the slow process of reimagining the high street gets speeded up. In this new London, centrality will retain both its allure and its economic benefits \u2013 but they will become relatively more expensive.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In Scotland pavement widening is already on the agenda.

None of us are expecting perfection. We are expecting progression. We just want you to openly acknowledge there have been mistakes in handling the virus, especially for me and so many families that have really lost loved ones as a result of the virus and probably as a result of the government not handling it seriously.

      "bodyText": "Almost a quarter of coronavirus deaths in England and Wales were in care homes, the latest weekly figures from the ONS revealed, with more than 4,300 deaths recorded in a fortnight. This marks a sharp rise from the official death toll up to 10 April, which was 1,043. From Wednesday, the government will publish daily figures for the number of coronavirus deaths in care homes and the community. This follows complaints for many weeks that by only publishing hospital deaths, figures could be underestimating the true number of deaths by as much as half, according to some estimates. The Scottish government published new guidance recommending the public should wear face coverings in \u201climited circumstances\u201d where it was not always possible to remain two metres apart, for instance in supermarkets and on public transport. The UK government said it was still considering advice submitted on this issue submitted by Sage last week, which maintained there is \u201cweak\u201d evidence of face masks having a \u201csmall\u201d protective effect. The most important thing to maintain is physical distancing, it added. British Airways is set to make up to 12,000 workers redundant as the airline\u2019s parent company revealed its revenue had plunged 13% in the first quarter of 2020. Announcing the cuts, IAG said it expected recovery to 2019 passenger levels to take several years. Eligibility for free coronavirus tests has been extended to NHS patients and staff who do not have symptoms, and care home residents and staff who do not have symptoms (those who do have symptoms qualify for tests already). Anyone over 65 with symptoms and anybody who needs to leave home to go to work who has symptoms, as well as members of their family, will also be eligible. And the former prime minister Theresa May urged ministers to consider the impact of lockdown for domestic abuse and mental health, as well as the economy, when deciding how quickly to lift restrictions. Speaking in a debate on the domestic abuse bill, she said there was \u201cclear\u201d evidence that domestic abuse was increasing during lockdown because perpetrators have greater freedom to act and victims find it harder to leave. That\u2019s it from us today on the UK side, thanks to all of you for following along and to everybody who got in touch with tips and suggestions. If you would like to continue following the Guardian\u2019s coverage of the pandemic, head over to our global live blog for the worldwide picture. Here are the main points from Matt Hancock\u2019s press conference. Hancock, the health secretary, said that from tomorrow the government will start publishing daily figures for the number of coronavirus deaths in care homes and other non-hospital settings. Until now it has only published daily figures for hospital deaths. This has led to complaints that the headline figures are giving a misleading impression, because there are claims that they understate the true level of coronavirus deaths by as much as half. (See 3.34pm.) Hancock said the new figures would \u201chelp inform the judgments that we make as we work to keep people safe\u201d. He announced a significant increase in the number of people eligible for free coronavirus tests. Residents and staff in care homes, and patients and staff in NHS hospitals, who don\u2019t have symptoms would be eligible, he said. (If they do have symptoms, they are already eligible.) And he said that people over 65 with symptoms, or people who need to travel for work and have symptoms, would be eligible too. He said that the government was able to do this because it now had the capacity to carry out more than 70,000 tests a day. The full details of the new eligibility rules are here. He complained that a reporter who asked him to apologise for not doing enough to protect people in care homes was being unreasonable. When it was put to him that he might take the opportunity to apologise, Hancock replied: The thing is, I think that\u2019s unreasonable as a question, actually. Hancock insisted that he had been focused on problems in care homes from the start. He defended his decision not to ban visitors to care homes earlier. He said: The critical thing is that in a care home having visitors also has a positive impact both against the loneliness of the residents but also on their longevity and their mental health. So these are difficult judgments and there are no easy recommendations to make. We were guided by that clinical advice and when it was necessary to make that change, which is quite a firm change, then we did so. He criticised a BBC Panorama investigation about PPE shortages. In response to a question about the report, and about a survey of doctors that showed their concerns about PPE, he said: I saw two of the things you referred to. I\u2019m not sure they were a fair and objective journalistic assessment of the situation but what we do have is constant focus on the realities of getting PPE to the frontline. Prof Dame Angela McLean, the government\u2019s deputy chief scientific advisor, said ministers have been told there is \u201cweak\u201d evidence of a \u201csmall\u201d beneficial effect from face masks. She said this advice had been passed on to ministers, who are still deciding whether to change the official advice to the public. The government published a chart that appears to show the UK performing worse than other European countries on coronavirus deaths. That is because it includes all coronavirus deaths for the UK. But the chart itself stresses that the data does not always include like-for-like comparisons because different countries count in different ways. Here is the chart. The number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 within prisons continues to rise, a daily update by the Ministry of Justice shows. As at 5pm on Monday, there were 332 prisoners who had tested positive for the virus across 69 prisons, an increase of 2% in 24 hours. The number of prison staff infected rose by 7% to 317 workers in the same period. Analysis by Public Health England published late on Monday revealed that there were nearly 1,800 possible cases of the virus among the prisoner population. 15 inmates have died directly or indirectly from Covid-19. There are 81,500 prisoners across 117 jails in England and Wales, and around 33,000 staff working in 104 public sector prisons. The new modelling from PHE shows that reducing the prison population by 5,000 could be effective in limiting the spread of the virus, the MoJ said, with the number of inmates already reduced by 3,000 over a seven-week period. Testing for prisoners has been \u201climited but variable\u201d but staff testing has been made available with more than 1,000 referred in the past fortnight. Q: When will you recruit the 18,000 contact tracers you need? And how many people do you expect to download your contact-tracing app? As soon as possible, and as many as possible, says Hancock. He says he is sorry he cannot give a more detailed answer. He says the contact tracing network, and the app, need to work together. He wants them in place by the middle of May, he says. Q: If the app is coming in three weeks, does that mean you hope to hire the 18,000 contact tracers by then? Hancock says he wants them available before, or at the same time. And that\u2019s it. The press conference is over. Q: What is the time lag for the epidemic? If some regions went into lockdown when the epidemic was at an earlier stage, does that mean they are more vulnerable to a second peak? And could the lockdown measures be lifted at a different point? Hancock starts by paying tribute to the people of the north-east for staying at home. (The question came from the Northern Echo.) He says he knows how \u201cgregarious\u201d they are. McLean says London passed its peak before other areas. But if there is an effect, it is quite small, she says. She says the question of whether or not there should be regional approaches to relaxing the lockdown is interesting. There is always a trade-off between tailoring policy to different regions, and keeping it simple and ensuring people are all in it together. She says she does not have an answer on that. Hancock says the government is looking at the case for taking different approaches in different regions. But he says there is a case for ensuring all regions move together. And if the reproduction number went above 1 in any area, that would spread. These arguments make the case for acting together, he says. Q: There is confusion about what the social distancing measures are. Can you clarify them? Hancock says it is clear; people have to follow the social distancing rules. Q: Is British ventilators production being scaled back? Hancock says people were worried about the NHS being overwhelmed. But it has not been overwhelmed. The UK is still producing ventilators, he says. There are other countries around the world that need them. He pays tribute to those who contributed to the ventilator challenge. Hancock says deciding whether or not to ban visitors from care homes was difficult, because having visitors can have a beneficial effect on residents\u2019 health. Q: When are ministers going to update the advice on face masks? And why is it taking so long? Hancock says the government is guided by the science. The UK government position has not changed, he says. He says the most important thing is to maintain social distancing. Q: Are you advising people to disinfect items coming into their home? McLean says the recommendation from Sage is clear; there is \u201cweak evidence\u201d of face masks having a \u201csmall\u201d protective effect. She says they have passed that advice on to government for ministers to make a decision. Ministers have been told there is \u201cweak\u201d evidence for face masks having \u201csmall\u201d protective effect, McLean says. British Airways owner International Airlines Group (IAG) has announced up to 12,000 planned job cuts as it revealed that revenues plunged 13% in the first quarter of 2020. In a statement, IAG said: In light of the impact of Covid-19 on current operations and the expectation that the recovery of passenger demand to 2019 levels will take several years, British Airways is formally notifying its trade unions about a proposed restructuring and redundancy programme. The proposals remain subject to consultation but it is likely that they will affect most of British Airways\u2019 employees and may result in the redundancy of up to 12,000 of them. As previously announced, British Airways has availed itself of the UK\u2019s Covid-19 job retention scheme and furloughed 22,626 employees in April. Q: You said care home deaths were a sixth of the total. But in the most recent week for which figures were available they were 23%. (See 5.11pm.) Hancock says he was talking about the total for all deaths. But he accepts that that proportion is changing. Q: Testing in care homes was inadequate. PPE was inadequate. This seems to have taken you by surprise. Will you apologise for leaving people unprotected? Hancock says he does not think that is reasonable as a question. He says his department was aware of the problems in care homes right from the start. He recalls a conversation in January about care homes. They knew the virus was particularly dangerous for care homes. It is something we have focused on right from the start. Hancock suggests that the BBC Panorama investigation looking at the government\u2019s record on stockpiling PPE was not fair and objective. The second question from a member of the public, recorded on video, comes from a mother with a child with cystic fibrosis and autism who asks if children like hers will be able to get back to a normal education. Yes, says Hancock. He says the education plan makes allowance for children with special health needs. But he also says that shielding them must take priority, because their health comes first. Hancock says the first two questions will be ones submitted by members of the public. He reads out the first, from Amanda in Hull. She says, given that grandparents cannot look after grandchildren, what can full-time working parents with young children do when they need to go back to work? Amanda does not get much of an answer. Hancock says he cannot say. He says the government is not in a position to lift lockdown measures yet. McLean is now presenting the daily slides. Here are the latest figures for hospital deaths. And this figure compares weekly figures for all coronavirus deaths with figures for hospital deaths. And here is the global deaths comparison. Hancock says the government now has the capacity to carry out 73,400 coronavirus tests per day. As a result, he can expand the list of people eligible, he says. He says NHS patients and staff who do not have symptoms, and care home residents and staff who do not have symptoms, will be able to get tests. (Those who do have symptoms qualify for tests already.) He also says anyone over 65 with symptoms, and anyone who needs to leave home to go to work with symptoms, will be able to get a test, as well as members of their family. UPDATE: I\u2019ve corrected this post to make it clear that it is people over 65 and people who need to travel to work with symptoms who will be eligible. There are more details here. Hancock says the government plan is working. He says the government has 3,260 spare critical care beds. He says the government has carried out 700,387 tests, including 43,453 yesterday. He says 21,678 people have now died in hospital with coronavirus - an increase of 586 since yesterday. The proportion of coronavirus deaths in care homes is around a sixth of the total, he says. (That is not true if you just look at the most recent figures. See 12.18pm.) Hancock says from tomorrow the government will publish daily figures for the number of coronavirus deaths in care homes and in the community. Hancock is starting now. He says the minute\u2019s silence this morning was a \u201csolemn moment of reflection\u201d. People were remembering \u201cthe nation\u2019s heroes\u201d. Matt Hancock, the health and social care secretary, is due to hold the daily government press conference any minute now. He will be with Prof Dame Angela McLean, the government\u2019s deputy chief scientific adviser, and Prof John Newton from Public Health England, coordinator of the national testing effort. At first minister\u2019s questions this afternoon, Nicola Sturgeon underlined the importance of public understanding of the test, trace, isolate strategy that will be at the heart of any easing of lockdown restrictions. She said that the Scottish government would be publishing a document next week setting out more detail about test, trace, isolate, \u201cso the public can start to develop an understanding of what their role will be\u201d and also to help them prepare for what might be multiple periods of isolation that the plan could require. On the earlier guidance on face covering, Sturgeon emphasised that this was advice and a recommendation, rather than mandatory, and that the circumstances where it might be necessary should be very limited. She said she had taken advice from the UK government\u2019s scientific advisory group (Sage), and the Scottish government\u2019s chief medical officer, saying the evidence was that there could be some benefit in a situation where somebody is asymptomatic but doesn\u2019t know they have the virus, and a mask could give additional protection. She restated that the rationale for setting out the guidance now is to set out what limited benefit there may be to face covering but also to say it is not a substitute for the other things people should be doing, such as maintaining physical distancing and staying at home and within household groups. In the Commons, MPs have been debating the second reading of the domestic abuse bill. The bill, which has cross-party support, creates a new definition of domestic abuse, creates new civil protection orders and creates a domestic abuse commissioner post. There are full details in this Commons library briefing note (pdf). Theresa May, who pushed for tougher laws on domestic violence as home secretary and then as prime minister, spoke in the debate and said ministers should consider the impact of the lockdown on this issue, and wellbeing generally. Addressing the Commons via Zoom from her home she said: I would also urge government to think of the impact on domestic abuse that lockdown has made as they consider the exit strategy from lockdown. I want government to look not just at the impact of relaxing restrictions on capacity in the National Health Service, although we must all have a concern for our wonderful NHS staff and care workers, and for those who have contracted the disease. But government must also think about the impact of lockdown on our overall health and wellbeing as a nation. That, of course, includes the economy, but it must also include the impact on domestic abuse and mental health. We cannot have a situation where the cure for the disease does more damage than the disease itself. May\u2019s warning about the \u201ccure\u201d for coronavirus being potentially more damaging than the illness itself is almost word for word what President Donald Trump said last month. \u201cWe can\u2019t have the cure be worse than the problem,\u201d he said. According to a HuffPost story, three government departments have asked the Treasury for a total of \u00a370m to help them support domestic abuse victims during the crisis. New data has shown that an increasing number of vulnerable children are turning up at schools to take up places set aside for them by the government, but it\u2019s still far fewer than ministers had hoped. Since the lockdown began last month, there has been growing concern about the impact on vulnerable children who have largely disappeared from view. According to figures published by the Department for Education (DfE) on Tuesday, the number attending school last week was double the previous week, but it still only represents around 10% of all vulnerable children entitled to a school place. While schools in England remain closed to most children, a skeleton service is running for children of key workers as well as children classed as \u201cvulnerable\u201d by the government, which includes those who have assigned social workers or education, health and care plans. Last Friday, 49,000 vulnerable children were in schools, up from 24,000 on 17 April, which was the end of the Easter holidays, though schools remained open. The DfE said: We estimate this represents around 10% of all children and young people classified as \u2018children in need\u2019 or who have an education, health and care plan, up from 5% on 17 April. The number of key workers\u2019 children in school has also gone up, from 62,000 to 112,000 over the same period, which represents around 4% of children of essential workers entitled to be in school. Overall, the attendance rate in school and early years settings doubled, going up from 1% of pupils to 2% \u2013 far lower than the government originally anticipated \u2013 suggesting that parents remain cautious about sending their children to school. These are from Sky\u2019s economics editor Ed Conway. Conway has based his figures on data from EuroMOMO, the European monitoring of excess mortality for public health action project. It works with public health bodies around Europe. Mark Kleinman, professor of public policy at Kings College London (not the Sky News City editor), has written an interesting article on what cities like London might look like after the coronavirus pandemic is over. Here\u2019s an extract. After the Plague and the Great Fire, London was rebuilt by [the architect Christopher] Wren. In the decades after the second world war, London\u2019s manufacturing base dwindled to a fraction of its former self, and the Docks, the hub of the world\u2019s goods-trading economy were shuttered. But London was reborn as a city of services \u2013 financial, business, educational, creative, cultural, scientific, technological and more. It seems unlikely that London, and cities like it, are about to disappear. But London may become a very different place from what it is now. A city where creative class or knowledge workers work from home as much as they commute to the office. Where the jostling for the best table in the restaurant takes place when booking online and not in the queue on the street. Where stadiums, art galleries and concert halls are redesigned to ensure public health along with entertainment and high culture. Where delivery vehicles are necessarily electric, and deliveries are grouped by algorithms and priced accordingly. Where pavements and public areas are widened to allow easy transition to social distancing, and where road space is recognised as a precious asset and charged for as such. Where the slow process of reimagining the high street gets speeded up. In this new London, centrality will retain both its allure and its economic benefits \u2013 but they will become relatively more expensive. In Scotland pavement widening is already on the agenda. See 3.54pm. Another 20 people have died in Northern Ireland after testing positive for Covid-19, taking the total there to 329. And a further 34 people tested positive, bringing the number of confirmed cases to 3,408. Some of Scotland\u2019s best-loved independent museums are facing mass redundancies and permanent closure as the ongoing lockdown drains resources. Scotland is considered a world leader with its wide range of community-run heritage, particularly across the Highlands, and the vast majority of these local museums are charities that receive no local or central government funding. But rural sites like the Highland Museum of Childhood, the Groam House Pictish Centre and New Lanark, which operate on limited reserves and generate most of their income from visitors and education programmes between April and September, are at risk. Industrial Museums Scotland, which holds almost a quarter of Scotland\u2019s nationally significant collection, the Scottish Community Heritage Alliance and Museums Heritage Highland today issued a call for urgent intervention by funders, arguing that whilst some emergency grants are available, this support is only designed for the short term. The Department for Education has published a report (pdf) showing that at the end of last week only 1.6% of children were in school in England. When the government announced that schools would be closed except for the children of key workers and vulnerable children, it was expected that a far higher proportion would continue to attend. But these figures show that only around 10% of children classified as vulnerable, and only around 4% of children of essential workers, are attending. The Scottish government is offering \u00a310m to allow councils to introduce new \u201cpop up\u201d wider pavements and cycle paths to improve physical distancing and protect pedestrians, joggers and cyclists from motorists. Michael Matheson, the Scottish transport secretary, told MSPs on Tuesday the funding would allow councils to quickly install new and widened features without needing to find additional spending from their own budgets. Cycling is believed to have increased by 35% during the lockdown. The cash for the new \u201cspaces for people\u201d initiative has been diverted from the devolved government\u2019s Places for Everyone active travel budget, Matheson said. Addressing the Scottish parliament during its once-a-week session, he said: Our communities need this support quickly, especially with the welcome increases in cycling we are seeing across the country. At the same time, almost every journey starts and ends on our pavements in some way, and so it is vitally important that people can physically distance for those essential trips or for exercise. [For] our air quality, climate, health and particularly for our mental wellbeing at this time, walking and cycling remain our most beneficial form of transport. We should all be encouraged by the increases we are seeing in cycling and this government will do what it can to continue to support this through our recovery and beyond. The Scottish Greens and Liberal Democrats, as well as cycling campaigners, have been pressing for extra help to protect and support pedestrians and cyclists during the lockdown; walking, cycling and jogging has increased dramatically while most of the population has been working from home or furloughed. There are fears, however, that as people return to work and car use increases, there are greater risks of accidents as pedestrians and joggers continue physical distancing on pavements, and step out on to roads. Cycling campaigners welcomed the initiative, asking councils to quickly install new infrastructure. Matt Hancock was wrong to state earlier that some children have died from the new set of serious symptoms that resemble toxic shock syndrome and is closely linked to Covid-19, it has emerged. When asked about the condition on LBC radio this morning the health secretary said: \u201cWe have lost some children.\u201d However, he was referring to children dying from Covid-19 and not from this new inflammatory syndrome, which is confounding and worrying doctors. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has now clarified that Hancock did not mean to suggest that any children had lost their lives as a result of the new set of symptoms, which include intense stomach pain, gastrointestinal problems and an inflamed heart. A source at the DHSC said: The health secretary was referencing deaths we\u2019re aware of that sadly related to Covid-19 not the inflammatory syndrome. We are not currently aware of any confirmed deaths related to the inflammatory syndrome. His comments were widely reported in the media, including in this liveblog. The existence of the syndrome first emerged on Monday. NHS England issued an urgent alert to doctors at the weekend asking them to immediately refer to hospital any under-18s displaying the key symptoms, which the Health Service Journal obtained. The Guardian understands that 19 cases have been found in London and other parts of the UK and that many of those affected are being treated at Great Ormond Street hospital for sick children in the capital. On LBC Hancock said he was \u201cvery worried\u201d about reports of the new illness in children, most \u2013 and possibly \u2013 of whom have had Covid-19. Medical experts are \u201clooking into it with great urgency\u201d, he added. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a lot of research now but it is something we\u2019re worried about. What I would also stress is that it is rare. \u201cAlthough it is very significant for those children who do get it the number of cases is small,\u201d Hancock added. The former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown has challenged Donald Trump and Xi Jinping to recognise the \u201cdeadly urgency\u201d of joining a global push to help poor countries combat Covid-19 and warned the world\u2019s two biggest economies that go-it-alone strategies will end in failure, our colleague Larry Elliott reports. Turning back to today\u2019s ONS weekly death figures, Chris Giles and Gill Plimmer in the Financial Times (paywall) say the new figures support their own modelling suggesting that by last week more than 41,000 people in the UK had died either directly or indirectly from coronavirus. The total is now likely to be in excess of 45,000, they say. That is more than double the daily headline figure announced by the UK government, which only covers deaths in hospital of people who have tested positive for coronavirus. Yesterday it was 21,092. Here is an extract from the Giles/Plimmer analysis. Since the beginning of March, there have been 27,015 more deaths registered up to April 17 than the five-year average for the time of year. With an average delay of four days between someone dying and their death being registered, the figures relate to the period to April 13, during which the government said there had been 11,408 deaths of people testing positive for coronavirus in English and Welsh hospitals ... The official figures verified Financial Times modelling that suggested 41,000 people had died by last Tuesday either directly or indirectly as a result of coronavirus, with the death registrations higher than expected by the FT\u2019s model. With almost 30,000 excess deaths by mid-April across the UK, approximately two weeks ago, the number of total deaths now is likely to be in excess of 45,000, according to the FT model. Earlier Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, told MPs that Nervtag, the new and emerging respiratory virus threats advisory group, was responsible for advising the government on what should be held in its stockpile of PPE (personal protective equipment) needed for a pandemic. (See 1.44pm.) But, according to a BBC investigation for Panorama, Nervtag advised the purchase of gowns last June, and yet this recommendation was ignored. (I\u2019m grateful to njf1953 in the comments for flagging this up.) On BBC Radio 4\u2019s the World at One, Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, a statistician at the University of Cambridge, has said he believes more coronavirus deaths are now occurring in care homes and at home than in hospitals. He told the programme: I think we can be very confident that our deaths in English hospitals peaked around April 8 \u2013 we had about 850 deaths and now they are down to around 400 deaths a day occurring in English hospitals \u2013 a steady but slow decline. However, we\u2019ve now just got new data that the Care Quality Commission have been reporting on notifications from care homes about deaths from Covid. They receive those really quite up to date, only a couple of days\u2019 delay, but that goes right up until April 24 \u2013 just a few days ago \u2013 when they were getting 400 notifications a day of deaths in care homes from Covid. When we add on deaths at home from Covid, makes me \u2013 slightly sticking my neck out \u2013 believing that recently that more deaths occurring from Covid out of hospital than in hospital. NHS England has announced 546 more deaths of patients who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 19,295. The full details are here (pdf). Of the 546 new deaths announced today: 93 occurred on 27 April 213 occurred on 26 April 79 occurred on 25 April The figures also show 141 of the new deaths took place between 1-24 April while the remaining 20 deaths occurred in March, with the earliest new death taking place on 19 March. NHS England releases updated figures each day showing the dates of every coronavirus-related death in hospitals in England, often including previously uncounted deaths that took place several days or even weeks ago. This is because of the time it takes for deaths to be confirmed as testing positive for Covid-19, for postmortems to be processed and for data from the tests to be validated. The figures published by NHS England show 8 April continues to have the highest number for the most hospital deaths occurring on a single day, with a current total of 857. From Scotland\u2019s first minister: Following the Scottish government\u2019s recommendation that people should wear face coverings in \u201climited circumstances\u201d where physical distancing isn\u2019t always possible (see 12.58), the Welsh health minister, Vaughan Gething, said formal guidance was not yet being issued in Wales. He said there was \u201cno evidence\u201d that it was harmful for members of the public to wear a form of face covering or scarf, adding: If we do give formal guidance that people should wear a covering over their face, we need to understand what that means about the way the public will then behave. We also need to be particularly cognisant of the potential for people trying to acquire masks that would otherwise be used by health and care professionals. Gething said he wanted to see details of the Scottish government\u2019s recommendation and speak to Wales\u2019s chief medical officer before \u201cmaking a definitive comment about the position in Wales\u201d. Britons do not believe the economy and businesses should open if coronavirus is not fully contained, according to a new study. In an Ipsos Mori poll of more than 28,000 people in 14 countries, Britons were the least likely to believe restarting the economy was the right approach as ministers face continued questions over the UK\u2019s plan for lifting its coronavirus lockdown. Britons had the strongest views against opening up the economy if the virus is not fully under control, with 70% of those surveyed saying they felt this way. It comes as a number of British businesses have said they are set to start opening despite the lockdown. High street bakery chain Greggs has told staff it plans to open 20 stores in the Newcastle area from 4 May as part of a \u201ccontrolled trial\u201d. And firms such as B&amp;Q have reopened their doors to shoppers, while John Lewis has said it hopes to reopen all its shops next month. Burger King, KFC and Pret have also announced they are to reopen some stores for takeaway and delivery. The researchers also found that Britons were \u201cthe most cautious\u201d about reopening the economy, with 71% saying they will be nervous about leaving the house after the lockdown eases. Gideon Skinner, head of political research at Ipsos Mori, said these factors \u201csuggest that the turnaround in the economy might not be quite so fast as hoped for\u201d. The prime minister Boris Johnson said lockdown will only be eased if the country can meet five tests: falling death figures, a protected NHS, a reduced rate of infection, sufficient testing and PPE, and avoiding a second peak. The next three-week review of the lockdown restrictions is due on 7 May. Another 17 people have died after testing positive for Covid-19 in Wales, Public Health Wales said, taking the death toll there to 813. And there were 232 new cases reported, bringing the total number of cases to 9,512. The Welsh health minister Vaughan Gething told a press conference there had been \u201cchallenges in communication\u201d between Betsi Cadwaladr health board and Public Health Wales, and there had also been a \u201cmaterial under-reporting issue\u201d in the Hywel Dda health board area, where 31 deaths were not reported and did not appear in Public Health Wales figures. Gething said \u201cindividual family communication\u201d had not been affected, with those who had lost loved ones informed of the deaths at the time, and that figures would now be \u201cfully up to date\u201d. The coronavirus outbreak has changed all of our lives in ways that are profound and often overwhelming. Amid the endless headlines, rolling news coverage and constant stream of information about the virus, how much have you taken in? Here is a quiz from the Guardian\u2019s Martin Belam, designed to test your knowledge of Covid-19 and refresh your memory on the facts. In the House of Commons, in response to a question from the SNP\u2019s Pete Wishart, the Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove suggested that the government\u2019s scientific advisers bore some responsibility for the shortage of PPE (personal protective equipment). Asked by Wishart to acknowledge that the government had not stockpiled enough in advance, Gove said: The stockpile that we had before this pandemic was explicitly designed in accordance with the advice from the scientific advisers the government has - Nervtag (the new and emerging respiratory virus threats advisory group) - and of course it was specifically for a flu pandemic. The nature of coronavirus is different from a flu pandemic as we all know and we, like every government across the world, have had to respond to this new virus by assuring not just with personal protective equipment, but in every respect, that we are in a position to retool, refit and to upgrade our response. This exchange can be viewed as an early dry run for the debate that is going to be central to what is now seen as the inevitable public inquiry that will take place into how the government handled the pandemic. York, one of the UK\u2019s most popular tourist destinations, could implement a one-way system to guide visitors around the Viking city on foot, the BBC reports. Phil Pinder, who chairs the York Retail Forum, said plans were being considered to introduce a form of voluntary code or charter to help pedestrians safely navigate York\u2019s higgledy-piggledy streets. Pinder told the BBC: Narrow streets and alleyways would be strictly one way with perhaps a barrier at one end telling people to please go the other way round. On wider streets people would be allowed to go in both directions but to stick to the left, like a car would, with a line down the middle and temporary stickers to guide people. We have to make sure it works for everyone and have rules we can all follow. According to this Reuters analysis, the latest ONS coronavirus death figures suggest that the UK is now on track to record more coronavirus deaths than France or Spain, but not Italy. In the Commons Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, has just said that the government will publish the figures showing whether or not it met its target of achieving 100,000 daily coronavirus tests by the end of April (Thursday) on Saturday. No 10 said yesterday it would not be able to disclose figures on the day because it took a while to get the figures for the number of home-delivered tests administered. Announcing Scottish government guidance on facial coverings as calls grow for the rest of the UK to follow suit, Nicola Sturgeon has said that her government will review whether to make them mandatory as restrictions are lifted. She said: As we go into a phase of lifting some of the restrictions and people are maybe coming into contact with more people than they are now we will review that and it may be at later stages we will take a tougher stance. Over the weekend, pressure was growing on the UK government with the British Medical Association calling on ministers to make wearing masks in public compulsory. Sturgeon said that \u201call governments across the UK are considering this and it\u2019s not for me to speak to them\u201d. She added: My judgment is that this guidance is appropriate in Scotland ... there will be some instances where we decide to do things ahead of the rest of the UK, or vice versa \u2013 that does not indicate a different of opinion or a divide or split. My responsibilityis to make judgment based on the evidence I can get on what is right to protect the people of Scotland. Sturgeon also said that one of the reasons she had issued the guidance was because she didn\u2019t want the use of facial coverings to make people feel \u201cinvincible\u2019 or distract from adherence to existing physical distancing and stay-at-home guidance. At the Downing Street lobby briefing, when asked if the UK government would follow the Scottish government in offering new advice to the public on wearing face coverings (see 12.58pm), the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said ministers were still considering advice on this topic submitted by the scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) last week. Sky\u2019s Sam Coates has a Twitter thread with more from today\u2019s No 10 lobby briefing. It starts here. No 10 also announced that Matt Hancock, the health and social care secretary, will take this afternoon\u2019s press conference. There were reports in some papers this morning suggesting that Boris Johnson was going to announce his plans for starting to relax the lockdown at the end of the week. A story in the Daily Telegraph (paywall) said Downing Street sources had confirmed that the \u201cprime minister was expected to share his plans with the nation by the end of the week\u201d and the Times (paywall) quoted a No 10 adviser saying Johnson would \u201cput flesh on the bones\u201d of the plan by the end of this week Now it seems that either someone in Downing Street jumped the gun, or else there has been a change of heart, because at the Downing Street lobby briefing the prime minister\u2019s spokesman strongly signalled that Johnson would not be announcing any plans this week. The spokesman said: We have set out that we will review social distancing measures by 7 May and the government is focused upon that date. It was also stressed that the government will not be announcing plans to relax the lockdown until the five tests set for this to happen have been met. At her daily briefing, the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, confirmed a further 200 confirmed cases of coronavirus, taking the total to 10,721. There was also a decrease of eight people in hospital, giving a new total of 1,754 patients, and a decrease of eight patients in intensive care, reducing that total to 126. There were 70 more deaths recorded since yesterday, taking the death toll to 1,332. The Scottish government has published updated guidance on the use of face coverings during the pandemic. It doesn\u2019t go as far as enforcing their use, but recommends that in \u201climited circumstances\u201d there may be some benefit in wearing one when leaving the home and entering enclosed spaces with others where physical distancing is more difficult. Examples of this include on public transport or entering a supermarket where it\u2019s not always possible to maintain a two-metre distance from others. The guidance reads: We are recommending that you consider using face coverings in the limited circumstances described above as a precautionary measure. Given that the evidence of impact on transmission is relatively weak, the public use of facial coverings is not being made mandatory and will not be enforced at this stage. However, we will keep this guidance under ongoing review as we consider any easing of lockdown restrictions in the weeks ahead. The guidance stresses that the wearing of face coverings must not be used as an alternative to physical distancing, hand washing and respiratory hygiene, which remain the most important and effective measures for preventing the spread of coronavirus. The Scottish government advice highlights that there is currently no evidence to suggest that the general wearing of a facial covering outdoors has any benefit, unless in an unavoidable crowded situation. It adds that face masks are not suitable for children under the age of two. It also specifies that face coverings should not be the same as those used by medical professionals: By face coverings we do not mean the wearing of a surgical or other medical grade mask but a facial covering of the mouth and nose, that is made of cloth or other textiles and through which you can breathe, for example a scarf. The UK government is not currently advising the public to wear face masks but has said it will consider the scientific evidence presented by Sage. The change in policy from the Scottish government will add to growing pressure on the UK government to follow suit, after the likes of the London mayor Sadiq Khan and the Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer already publicly backed the idea that non-medical face coverings should be recommended. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, is making a Commons statement about coronavirus and the public services. He started by paying tribute to public sector workers. He said the ministerial group he chaired looking at the impact of the pandemic on public services had now met 30 times. They have been working to address the shortfall in the agricultural workforce, to protect the food supply, he said. Working with Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, the group had set up the free school meal voucher scheme, he said. He said 15,500 schools had placed orders for vouchers, and vouchers worth \u00a329m had been redeemed. Since the end of March 90% of rough sleepers known to councils have been offered accommodation, he said. He said the armed forces had organised a 19,600-strong coronavirus support force. He said more than 150,000 key workers and their family members had been tested for coronavirus. More than 400 civil servants had been moved to the Department of Health and Social Care to help it operate, he said. More than 750,000 people have signed up to the NHS volunteers programme, he said. And he said more than 600,000 had had their ID verified so they could start volunteering. And he said a total of 3,203 fines had been handed out to people who flouted social distancing rules between 27 March and 13 April. Frontline \u201cheroes\u201d risk losing their jobs if the government fails to meet its promise to fully fund councils in their coronavirus crisis response, Labour has warned. The shadow communities secretary, Steve Reed, told the Commons that if councils face falling into debt because of the extra work created by the crisis they \u201cwill be forced to make cuts potentially totalling billions of pounds and that\u2019ll mean job losses\u201d. He said: Councils say the additional funding that\u2019s been announced so far barely covers a quarter of what\u2019s needed \u2013 it\u2019s not enough. So will the secretary of state reconfirm the government\u2019s original promise to fund whatever is necessary in full, because if he doesn\u2019t the frontline heroes we\u2019re cheering today will lose their jobs tomorrow. The communities and local government secretary, Robert Jenrick, said he had been working closely with councils and that \u00a33.2bn of additional money had already been committed, plus other support. He added: We will keep under review whether further funding is required, and if it is we will bring it forward because we want to back this brilliant sector in all that they\u2019re doing. As a consequence of social and economic lockdown measures introduced by governments, the global economy is heading for what the International Monetary Fund believes is the worst recession since at least the Great Depression. The Guardian\u2019s economics correspondent Richard Partington explains the unprecedented measures being taken to help protect individuals, households and businesses; how they are helping, and the costs they may involve. Alongside its report on the latest weekly death figures (see 9.42am), the Office for National Statistics has also published its latest dataset, a file that contains the figures in detail. This shows that in the week ending Friday 17 April, the latest week for which figures are available, almost a quarter of coronavirus deaths in England and Wales were in care homes. And around 70% were in hospitals. The rest were in private homes, hospices, or elsewhere. The exact figures are: 6,107 coronavirus deaths in hospitals, 2,050 in care homes, 416 in private homes, 103 in hospices, 41 in other communal establishments and 41 elsewhere. Following the publication of the figures Liz Kendall, the shadow social care minister, has written an open letter to Matt Hancock, the health and social care secretary, calling for action in six areas on social care. She said: These new [ONS] figures show the devastating impact Covid-19 is having on care homes, and will be desperately worrying for residents, their families, and staff. Urgent action is needed to get a grip of this problem. That is why I have today written to the health secretary outlining six areas where further steps should be taken to help protect care users and staff, and help bring these appalling death rates down. Here are Kendall\u2019s six proposals. 1. A new intermediate care strategy for people being discharged from hospital who test positive for Covid-19, and to support struggling care homes. 2. Improved access to, and priority testing for, social care workers. 3. Guaranteeing all care workers get the PPE they need: for domiciliary care workers and personal assistants employed via direct payments, as well as staff in residential care. 4. Ensuring social care has \u201cwhatever resources it takes\u201d to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic. 5. New leadership for social care sector, with a new chief care officer. 6. Daily reporting of Covid-19 deaths outside hospitals, including in care homes. The Chartered Society of Physiotherapists is calling on the government to extend its automatic visa extension scheme to physiotherapists to protect staffing levels across health and social care at the height of the pandemic. At the moment the one-year visa extension scheme applies to doctors, nurses and paramedics who are employed by the NHS on a Tier 2 visa that was previously due to expire before October 2020. But it does not cover NHS physiotherapists or other allied health professionals (AhPs) and their families. Physiotherapists and physiotherapy support workers are essential throughout the care of patients worst affected by Covid-19, from intensive care to community rehabilitation after discharge. Their work includes helping patients recovering from coronavirus to rehabilitate and return home, and freeing up capacity by helping patients with non-Covid-19 conditions rehabilitate and leave hospital. Rob Yeldham, the CSP director of strategy, said: Physiotherapy staff are playing a crucial part in the UK\u2019s response to Covid-19, helping patients leave hospital and ensuring those with other conditions, such as stroke, can continue their recovery at home. Their services are set to face unprecedented increases in demand caused by the crisis in the coming months and years and their success in meeting that need will be crucial for the whole system. In order to do that, we need to retain every overseas physio and physio support worker currently working in the UK. The CSP is therefore urgently calling on the UK government to extend the scheme to include all overseas physiotherapists and rehab support workers regardless of their employer, and help us ensure patients receive the rehab they need. There are an estimated 3,000 physiotherapists working in the UK who qualified overseas, though not all will be affected by the visa issue. At a hearing with the Commons science committee this morning, Matthew Gould, the chief executive of NHSX, the health service\u2019s digital innovation arm, said the contact-tracing app being developed by the government, which should tell people if they have been in contact with others who subsequently test positive for coronavirus, would be trialled in a \u201csmall area\u201d before potentially being rolled out nationally next month, subject to its performance in those trials. He went on: I would expect it technically to be ready for wider deployment in two to three weeks. Whether it is then deployed depends on the wider strategy. He said people using the app could be \u201cconfident\u201d their personal data would not be compromised. He explained: What we have is identifiers rather than identities, which sit on people\u2019s phones until they choose to share it with us. So there are a series of protections that allow people to be confident in using it that their privacy is being protected. But he also said it would be \u201ctough\u201d to get 80% of smartphone users to install the app. The message needs to be: if you want to keep your family and yourselves safe, if you want to protect the NHS and stop it being overwhelmed and at the same time we want get the country back and get the economy moving, the app is going to be an essential part of the strategy for doing that. Prof Christopher Fraser, senior group leader in pathogen dynamics at the University of Oxford Big Data Institute, told the committee that if roughly 60% of the population used the app, that would be enough to keep the reproduction number (the infectivity rate of the virus) below one, meaning the pandemic could be contained. But he said that number would rely on people paying heed to other warnings about sharing data with the app rather than simply downloading it, and self-isolating when symptoms developed. The work of postal staff will be marked on Wednesday as they continue to play a huge role during the lockdown. National Postal Workers\u2019 Day is an annual event organised by the Communication Workers Union (CWU) to promote the work its members do year-round, but is particularly pertinent this year. A union spokesman said: We are living in unprecedented times but one thing always remains constant \u2013 the significant role our members play in every community in the UK. This year we are calling on the public, media and politicians to give a greater level of recognition to postal workers than ever before. Despite hugely challenging times, CWU members are keeping the country connected. From delivering essential items to checking on the elderly and taking shopping to the most vulnerable in society, we have seen thousands of examples of local postal workers stepping up. The Labour MP Tony Lloyd is stepping down as shadow Northern Ireland secretary to focus on his recovery from coronavirus, the party has announced. He will be replaced by the shadow policing minister Louise Haigh, who had been covering for him in his absence. Lloyd, 70, was discharged from intensive care at Manchester Royal Infirmary last week. Guardian Money is reminding readers who are no longer able to use their rail season tickets that they can now cash it in for a full refund online, which in many cases could be worth thousands of pounds. In stark contrast to the airlines, the rail industry is refunding passengers \u2013 even those who bought non-refundable single tickets. Refunds are being backdated to 17 March, or the last day travelled. In London, passengers have eight weeks from their last trip to cash in the Oyster card. Those who booked one-off rail trips for March and April are also being refunded. Here is our full story on how to do it, and what you\u2019re likely to receive back. People around Britain have been observing a minute\u2019s silence in honour of NHS workers, care home staff and other key workers who have lost their lives to coronavirus. Boris Johnson stood in silence in the cabinet room, alongside the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary. Nick Stripe, head of the health analysis and life events division at the ONS, has been speaking to the BBC about today\u2019s coronavirus death figures released this morning. He said there have now been around 27,000 excess deaths - that is more deaths than you would expect on average for this time of year - in the four most recent weeks for which figures are available. Of the 12,000 excess deaths in the most recent week (see 9.42am), he said that around 25% of those did not involve coronavirus being mentioned on the death certificate. He also said that there total number of coronavirus deaths in care homes in England was probably now at least 5,500 - which is higher than the official most recent ONS figure. (See 9.55am.) He explained: In care homes we are now seeing over three times more deaths in total in care homes, in that last week, than we saw four weeks previously. And 28% of those deaths are from Covid. Now, we\u2019ve also taken data from the Care Quality Commission over the last few days. The Care Quality Commission collects death notifications of all deaths of care home residents. And we have been able to compare that data against our death registrations data, and it\u2019s a good match. So from the 10 to 17 April, for example, we can see a very close match. If you take that data, we can see the Care Quality Commission has figures for England of 4,343 deaths in care homes between 10 and 24 April, so much more current, that\u2019s last Friday. And we know that we had 1,000 deaths registered in care homes prior to 10 April. So in total we are looking at around at least 5,500 deaths in care homes in England related to Covid by 24 April. More than 4,300 people in care homes in England and Wales died from Covid-19 in a fortnight, according to official figures which show a sharp increase in mortality outside hospitals. Data gathered by the care homes regulator, published for the first time on Tuesday by the Office for National Statistics, showed that from 10-24 April, care homes reported 4,343 deaths from coronavirus. It marks a sharp rise in the official death toll in care homes, which stood at 1,043 up to 10 April. Read the full story here: Workers who have been furloughed as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic are being offered the opportunity to improve their numeracy and digital skills with a free online learning platform set up by the government. The Skills Toolkit, launched on Tuesday by the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, will offer adults stuck at home during lockdown the chance to refresh their maths skills, learn how to do digital marketing, how to code and use programmes like Excel and PowerPoint, as well as how to use social media and present themselves professionally online. The government\u2019s aim is to improve employability, boost confidence and support mental health. Launching the platform, Williamson said: \u201cI know how difficult the recent months have been and the huge changes the coronavirus has brought on the daily lives of us all. \u201cThe high-quality and free-to-access courses on offer on our new online learning platform, the Skills Toolkit, will help those whose jobs have been affected by the outbreak, and people looking to boost their skills while they are staying at home, protecting the NHS and saving lives.\u201d There are currently 13 courses on offer and providers include the Open University, Google and Lloyds bank. Matthew Fell, the chief UK policy director of the CBI, said: \u201cOnline learning is a great way for people to upgrade their skills at any time, but never more so than during a lockdown.\u201d Here are three of the most useful chart from the ONS report on weekly death figures. This one shows the sharp rise in coronavirus deaths, and all excess deaths (ie, above what you would expect at this time of year). This one shows coronavirus deaths by age and gender. It shows that men are more likely to die from the illness than women. And this one shows coronavirus deaths by date and place of death. It shows that hospital deaths have been decreasing, but not care home deaths. The health secretary said it appears that some children with no underlying health conditions have died from a rare inflammatory syndrome which researchers believe to be linked to Covid-19. Italian and British medical experts are looking into a potential link between coronavirus and clusters of severe inflammatory disease being found among infants arriving in hospital with high fevers and swollen arteries. Doctors in northern Italy have reported large numbers of children under the age of nine with severe cases of what appears to be Kawasaki disease, which is more common in parts of Asia. We have this report out of our Australia bureau: Hancock told LBC he was \u201cvery worried\u201d about reports of the new illness in children and experts were \u201clooking into it with great urgency\u201d. He said: We put out at the weekend a call across the NHS because some cases of this had been identified and then this call essentially says to doctors in other parts of the country: \u2018Have you seen this condition?\u2019 and then they collate the information and find out what\u2019s going on. He said: We have lost some children [...] There are some children who have died who didn\u2019t have underlying health conditions. It\u2019s a new disease that we think may be caused by coronavirus and the Covid-19 [disease], we\u2019re not 100% sure because some of the people who got it hadn\u2019t tested positive, so we\u2019re doing a lot of research now, but it is something that we\u2019re worried about. It is rare, although it is very significant for those children who do get it, the number of cases is small. The Office for National Statistics says there were 4,316 deaths involving Covid-19 outside hospitals in England and Wales up to 17 April. Of these, 3,096 took place in care homes (up from 1,043 the week before), 883 in private homes, 190 in hospices, 61 in other communal establishments, and 86 elsewhere. The equivalent figure for hospital deaths over this period is 14,796. The ONS numbers are based on where Covid-19 is mentioned anywhere on the death certificate, including in combination with other health conditions. The ONS also says 4,343 deaths in care homes involving coronavirus were reported by care home providers in England to the Care Quality Commission in the fortnight up to 24 April. The Office for National Statistics weekly death figures are out. The report is here. These figures cover the week ending Friday 17 April. (That\u2019s week 16 in ONS-speak.) Here are the main points from the ONS report. The provisional number of deaths registered in England and Wales in the week ending 17 April 2020 (week 16) was 22,351; this represents an increase of 3,835 deaths registered compared with the previous week (week 15) and 11,854 more than the five-year average; this is the highest weekly total recorded since comparable figures begin in 1993. Of the deaths registered in week 16, 8,758 mentioned \u201cnovel coronavirus (Covid-19)\u201d, which is 39.2% of all deaths; this compares with 6,213 (33.6% of all deaths) in week 15. In London, over half (55.5%) of deaths registered in week 16 involved Covid-19; the North West and North East also had a high proportion of Covid-19 deaths, accounting for 42.3% and 41.1% respectively of deaths registered in these regions. Of deaths involving Covid-19 registered up to week 16, 77.4% (14,796 deaths) occurred in hospital, with the remainder occurring in care homes, private homes and hospices. The number of overall deaths in care homes for week 16 was 7,316; this is 2,389 higher than week 15, almost double the number in week 14 and almost triple the number in week 13. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, joining the blog. We are about to get the latest weekly death figures from the Office for National Statistics. Unlike the daily figures produced by the Department for Health and Social Care, these figures include care home deaths. Nick Stripe, head of the health analysis and life events division at the ONS, posted this on Twitter about the release yesterday. Scientists hope to begin clinical tests of a new anti-viral drug which has had positive results in laboratory tests against Covid-19. Pneumagen, a University of St Andrews spin-out company, conducted three separate in-vitro studies into preventing coronavirus infections, reports PA Media. The successful studies involved both treating infection and blocking new infections. The chief executive, Douglas Thomson, said: Today\u2019s positive results from in-vitro studies of our mCBMs against coronaviruses show that glycan binding has the potential to prevent and treat infection. This further supports the value of our universal therapeutic modality to block access to lung cells of Sars-CoV-2 [coronavirus], as well as other viruses, that cause respiratory tract infections, providing the potential for a pan-viral respiratory product. Our goal is now to rapidly begin clinical testing for the prevention and treatment of Covid-19. We\u2019ve reported this morning that at least 15m more cases of domestic violence are predicted around the world this year as a result of pandemic restrictions, according to new data. The UN Population Fund (UNFPA) has also calculated that tens of millions of women will not be able to access modern contraceptives this year, and millions more girls will undergo female genital mutilation or be married off by 2030. Discussing the domestic abuse bill, which is to have its second reading in the Commons on Tuesday, Victoria Atkins told BBC Breakfast said it would introduce new powers, protective orders, and change various measures in courts to help protect victims. What we\u2019ve done in terms of our response to the Covid-19 crisis is that we have been listening to charities delivering these services on the frontline. In response to the huge increase in calls to helplines and engagement with web services, the government has announced a further \u00a32m to bolster services. She added: In addition, today we are very conscious of the impact this may be having on children living in abusive households, so we have announced a \u00a33m fund today to help those charities ... to ensure that the children receive the immediate care they need. If you, or someone you know, need help escaping domestic violence, the NHS lists the following help lines: Women can call the freephone National Domestic Abuse Helpline, run by Refuge on 0808 2000 247 at any time, day or night. The staff will offer confidential, non-judgmental information and support. Men can call Men\u2019s Advice Line on 0808 8010 327 (Monday and Wednesday, 9am to 8pm, and Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, 9am to 5pm) for non-judgemntal information and support. Men can also call ManKind on 0182 3334 244 (Monday to Friday, 10am to 4pm) Men and women who are harming their partners and families can contact Respect Phoneline: 0808 8024040, the service is anonymous and confidential. If you identify as LGBTQ+ you can call Galop on 0800 999 5428 for emotional and practical support. Anyone can call Karma Nirvana on 0800 5999 247 (Monday to Friday 9am to 5pm) about forced marriage and \u201chonour\u201d crimes. You can also call 020 7008 0151 to speak to the government\u2019s Forced Marriage Unit. Hancock was asked by LBC host Nick Ferrari whether he accepted that mistakes were made in the provision of PPE. He replied: Well, there are things that we\u2019ve changed as we\u2019ve gone through, both because we\u2019ve learnt more things about the virus, also because things didn\u2019t work out as we expected. Pushed, he added: A huge amount of people are doing everything they can and have done since the start of this crisis, and of course this is a very, very complicated logistical effort but I don\u2019t want to play down the enormous efforts of many thousands of people. Asked whether it had been right to allow the Cheltenham Festival to go ahead, Hancock said there would be a review. Hancock defended the decision to let the horse racing event go ahead in March, and said: We followed the scientific advice, we were guided by that science. I think broadly we took the right measures at the right time. We were ahead of many other countries in Europe in terms of when we took the measures. Hancock said that people in care homes who go to hospital for non-Covid-19 reasons will not be discharged until they are known not to have the virus, after one caller - Victor, from Loughton, Essex, who runs a care home - said 12 of his residents died when someone with Covid-19 was moved in. Hancock said: I\u2019m not going to say, you know, it\u2019s a matter for the care home; it\u2019s actually a matter for all of us, and exactly as Victor says, because you know, when this horrible disease gets into a care home, some of the people who are most vulnerable to it live in care homes. One thing that we\u2019ve done is introduced testing for everybody leaving hospital going to care homes to avoid the situation that Victor talks about. He also addressed Victor\u2019s concerns about PPE in private care homes and said: The responsibility sits on my shoulders. Because of the need to increase the amount of PPE, we\u2019ve stepped up and put in place extra processes and allowed the access to the NHS PPE distribution and expanded that to care homes. Matt Hancock is having a difficult morning. When he began to take questions from members of the public on the Nick Ferrari show on LBC, he was confronted by Intisar Chowdhury, the son of Dr Abdul Mabud Chowdhury who we heard earlier on Today. (See 7.49am.) Challenging Hancock, Chowdhury asked why his father\u2019s letter to the prime minister which appealed for more PPE was ignored. He said: When he was unwell he wrote an open letter to the prime minister appealing for more PPE for NHS frontline workers. It was a request that was ignored. Two weeks later he passed away and since then over 100 NHS and social care workers have passed away from contracting the virus. Do you regret not taking my dad\u2019s concerns, my 11-year-old sister\u2019s dad\u2019s concerns, and my mother\u2019s husband\u2019s concerns seriously enough for my dad that we\u2019ve all lost? The health secretary replied: Intisar, I\u2019m really sorry about your dad\u2019s death and I have seen the comments you\u2019ve made and what you\u2019ve said in public, and I think it\u2019s very brave of you to be speaking out in public. We took very, very seriously what your father said and we\u2019ve been working around the clock to ensure that there\u2019s enough protective equipment. In the case of anybody who works in the NHS or in social care [who] has died from coronavirus, we look into it in each case to find out the reasons why they might have caught it and what lessons we can learn. Asked to response to what Hancock said, Chowdhury replied: Mr Hancock, the public is not expecting the government to handle this perfectly. None of us are expecting perfection. We are expecting progression. We just want you to openly acknowledge there have been mistakes in handling the virus, especially for me and so many families that have really lost loved ones as a result of the virus and probably as a result of the government not handling it seriously. Openly acknowledging a mistake is not an admission of guilt. It is genuinely just making you seem more human. So could you please do that for me later today, at the press conference today, maybe a public apology. In response, Hancock said: It is very important that we are constantly learning about how to do these things better, and listening to the voices on the frontline is a very, very important part of how we improve. Matt Hancock\u2019s defence of the government\u2019s handling of PPE this morning comes after it emerged that key items of personal protective equipment (PPE) were not included in the government\u2019s pandemic stockpile when coronavirus reached the UK, an investigation has found. BBC Panorama reported that gowns, visors, swabs and body bags were left out of the stockpile when it was set up in 2009. Some of the items are now in short supply. The full story is here: A chartered flight carrying 200,000 fluid-resistant gowns is expected to arrive in Wales from Cambodia and China today, reports the South Wales Guardian. Today\u2019s flight has been arranged through Welsh contacts and is the first of two due to arrive this week, which will replenish vital supplies of gowns for the NHS and social care staff in Wales. In total, 660,000 gowns will be flown in to Cardiff airport on the flights, from Phnom Penh, in Cambodia and Hangzhou, in China. The first minister, Mark Drakeford, said: Since the start of the pandemic, we have been working very hard to make sure we continue to get the right supply of PPE for Wales. Coronavirus has put supplies under pressure around the world. Today\u2019s flight is the result of a lot of hard work behind the scenes to secure new supplies of gowns for our frontline workers. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said the government has distributed more than a billion items of PPE. Speaking to Nick Ferrari on LBC, he said: People need to have the PPE according to the guidelines, the guidelines do say that in some cases PPE can safely be reused and that\u2019s a good thing because PPE is in global short supply. When asked if he would wear re-used PPE that was originally designed as single-use on future visits to hospitals, Hancock said: If that is what is clinically advised, then yes of course. What we\u2019ve managed to do during this crisis is improve ways that kit like that can be sterilised and then safely re-used and that\u2019s work that has been ongoing. Online grocery sales are expected to grow by around a third during 2020, due to the \u201cseismic impact\u201d that Covid-19 is having on people\u2019s shopping habits, PA Media reports. The online grocery market is forecast to grow by 33% in 2020 to reach an estimated value of \u00a316.8bn, up from \u00a312.7bn in 2019, market research agency Mintel said. The big jump follows four years in a row of slowing growth. In 2019, growth fell to a historic low of just 2.9%. Mintel estimates the market will be worth \u00a317.9bn by 2024, growing by 41% over the five-year period. Nick Carroll, associate director of retail research at Mintel, said: Covid-19 has had a seismic impact on Britain\u2019s grocery sector. [T]he impact will last beyond the crisis. Shopper numbers in the online grocery market have plateaued in recent years as retailers struggled to get new customers to try these services. The outbreak is bringing a new audience to online grocery, and this should boost the market long term with strong growth forecast through to 2024. The son of a doctor who died of coronavirus after warning Boris Johnson about a lack of protective equipment has spoken powerfully on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme this morning. Intisar Chowdhury, the 18-year-old son of Abdul Mabud Chowdhury, a consultant urologist at Homerton hospital in east London who died after contracting Covid-19, called on the government to apologise to all the families of healthcare workers who had died during the pandemic. He said: I definitely do want a public apology because I feel like the government response in not only handling the PPE crisis but the whole crisis wasn\u2019t the best. I think that we could forgive that as a country, as it\u2019s such an unprecedented thing it\u2019s hard to know what the right thing is to do, but they need to be able to hold themselves accountable for that, make an apology for that, learn from that and then move on so we can trust them more. The 18-year-old\u2019s father urged the prime minister to ensure every NHS worker was protected in a direct plea on Facebook last month shortly after being taken ill with Covid-19. Following the 53-year-old\u2019s death on 8 April, his son said he was glad that the issue was now getting the attention it needed. But asked about the government announcement of \u00a360,000 for every family of a healthcare worker who has died as a result of the disease, he said: It\u2019s a step in the right direction, but if I\u2019m being honest rather than the \u00a360k for my family I would rather the efforts go into giving more PPE to NHS, because I have family friends and cousins that work in hospitals and they are still having to reuse their equipment and clearly they do not have the adequate equipment right now. He added: The money itself doesn\u2019t really cover up the fact that the government hasn\u2019t really made a public apology yet. They have a press conference every single day where they have an opportunity to own up to their mistakes and you know what as citizens none of us are expecting perfection from the government we are just expecting progression. Good morning if you are joining us in the UK, I\u2019m Alexandra Topping and I\u2019ll be starting the UK coronavirus liveblog this morning. Here are a roundup of today\u2019s key stories The UK\u2019s coronavirus frontline has switched from hospitals to care homes, according to sector leaders who have dismissed Boris Johnson\u2019s claim that the virus has been \u201cwrestled to the floor\u201d as premature. A minute\u2019s silence will be held across the UK later to commemorate the key workers who have died with coronavirus. Prime minister Boris Johnson, who returned to work on Monday, will join the tribute, which starts at 11am. Grieving families of NHS and social care workers who died after contracting coronavirus in the course of their duties will be entitled to a \u00a360,000 payment, ministers announced on Monday as the reported death toll for frontline workers rose to 134. Ministers have held a series of high-level meetings with trades unions and business leaders amid fears that millions of people will be too fearful to return to work as pressure intensifies on the government to publish a path out of the national lockdown. The first minister of Wales has said he is ready to move the country out of lockdown earlier than the rest of the UK as he demands more contact from ministers at Westminster.",

As the government seeks to hit its target of 100,000 tests a day, Matt Hancock said all NHS staff, hospital patients, care home workers and their elderly residents would be able to book tests even if they did not have symptoms. Speaking at the Downing Street daily press conference, Hancock also promised that figures on deaths in care homes and the community would be published daily from Wednesday. This follows criticism that they have been separate from the main daily numbers on hospital deaths. The expansion of eligibility for testing will be important for the government\u2019s ability to ease lockdown measures. Hancock said there was no way the lockdown could be lifted yet, but slides presented at the No 10 daily press conference suggested the government had slightly loosened the criteria for when it may be possible. One of the five key tests for restrictions to be eased is that there will be no risk of a second peak of infections, but this was changed on one of the slides to say no risk of a second peak that overwhelms the NHS.

      "bodyText": "The teenage son of a doctor who died of Covid-19 after warning Boris Johnson about a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) is still holding out for an apology from the government after personally confronting Matt Hancock, he said. In one of the most symbolic moments yet of the crisis, Intisar Chowdhury, 18, picked up the baton from his father and, on the radio, asked the health secretary if he regretted not taking more seriously the concerns the doctor had raised in a letter to Downing Street two weeks before his death. His intervention led to figures from politics and beyond heaping pressure on the government to admit that it had made serious errors in relation to PPE for key workers who have died. They were commemorated on Tuesday in a one-minute silence. \u201cI have faith there will be an apology because I do feel that it has come to a point where we need one. The government are not robots. They are humans and they will understand that,\u201d Chowdhury told the Guardian after challenging Hancock on LBC radio. The health secretary would only go so far as to say he was really sorry about his father\u2019s death. \u201cI feel that was a blanket statement, that other senior government figures have forbid an apology and that was why Matt Hancock, Priti Patel and others have not given a real apology, Chowdhury said. \u201cWhoever instructed that blanket statement \u2013 and I\u2019m not sure who it was \u2013 was in the wrong for doing that because apologies are not an admission of guilt. Apologies are not going to make you liable for litigation and things like that. The purpose of them is to display honesty, integrity and build trust from the public. That is the most important aspect.\u201d Dr Chowdhury, a consultant urologist at Homerton hospital in east London, urged the prime minister to ensure every NHS worker was protected in an open letter last month shortly after being taken ill with Covid-19. In a Facebook post on 18 March, Abdul Mabud Chowdhury said: \u201cPeople appreciate us and salute us for our rewarding job which are very inspirational but I would like to say we have to protect ourselves and our families/kids in this global disaster/crisis by using appropriate PPE and remedies.\u201d The 53-year-old died on 8 April. On Tuesday, a grassroots lobbying and campaigning group advocating for the medical profession and wider NHS supported the call by Dr Chowdhury\u2019s son for an official apology to the families of healthcare workers who have died. \u201cI think an apology would be a first step in acknowledging what the government have provided NHS workers and social care workers in terms of PPE,\u201d said Dr Rinesh Parmar, chair of the Doctors\u2019 Association UK. \u201cIt has been inadequate and admitting that would be the the first part in recognising that the pandemic planning had not been robust enough.\u201d The acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey, said it was \u201cbeyond belief\u201d that there were still workers on the frontline without the protection they needed weeks after Dr Chowdhury\u2019s death. \u201cThe government must apologise and they must ensure that all NHS and care workers receive the protection they need, it is fundamental to the credibility of the government.\u201d The co-leader of the Green party, Jonathan Bartley, said: \u201cIt\u2019s an obvious step to apologise and that should be one, but a real apology also means changing direction for everyone. An apology that is not backed up by action \u2013 whether that\u2019s addressing the real needs of people in care homes and a whole range of neglected areas \u2013 would be pretty poor.\u201d Meg Hillier, the east London Labour MP whose constituency includes Homerton hospital, called on the government \u201cto stop being defensive and act\u201d while her fellow Labour MP, Diane Abbott, added: \u201cIt is increasingly becoming clear that this a government with blood on its hands.\u201d Further details also emerged of the kind of man Dr Chowdhury was, and of the heart-wrenching circumstances in which his family said goodbye as he lay unconscious in hospital.

When night falls, passengers are even scarcer and the work can be \u201ceerie and isolating\u201d.</p> \n<p>Though Farrell misses having longer chats with customers and waving to other bus drivers when the roads are busier, loneliness is the least of her worries when it comes to work.</p> \n<p>Trying to protect herself from contracting coronavirus armed only with sanitiser is at the forefront of her mind. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/coronavirus-london-mayor-devastated-deaths-bus-workers\">deaths of London bus drivers</a> have also exacerbated her anxiety. \u201cWhen something happens to a bus driver, no matter where it happens, you still feel quite attached to them,\u201d said Farrell. \u201cIt does filter through to us all and it is a very worrying time.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>As a result of not being able to do overtime due to lower passenger numbers, Farrell\u2019s working hours have dropped from 45 a week to 38.</p> \n<p>But shows of support from the public have helped to boost her morale. \u201cLast week, I got an applause as I drove past Salford Cathedral and people are always waving from the street,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Adding to her sense of pride is the fact that her 23-year-old daughter is a newly qualified junior doctor about to head out to work in a hospital. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of her, and I\u2019m proud that I\u2019m helping too because it\u2019s people like her that I\u2019m taking to work every day.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Josef Szabo, 42</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8413599682f23c5acb890f5d958cf909a2ab9ff\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8413599682f23c5acb890f5d958cf909a2ab9ff/0_224_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Josef Szabo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Josef Szabo is regularly dosing his cabin in santiser.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Szabo, who has worked on the same route as Farrell since January, said he was also finding it difficult to adapt to quieter roads and lower passenger numbers. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very quiet. I\u2019d say it\u2019s quite boring to be honest,\u201d said Szabo.</p> \n<p>But although he longs for the days when he can exchange more than a few brief words with regulars, right now he is focused on trying to lessen his risk of catching the coronavirus.</p> \n<p>He regularly douses his cabin in sanitiser, while the holes in its assault shield \u2013 which would usually allow him to be heard more clearly by passengers \u2013 are blocked up.</p> \n<p>But there is only so much he can do to influence the behaviour of others. \u201cMost of our customers are sticking to the rules and staying well away from each other, but there are some who are too impatient to even let other passengers off the bus before they get on,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus-key-workers\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus-key-workers&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus-key-workers</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Although he hasn\u2019t received grand gestures of thanks \u2013 such as Farrell\u2019s applause \u2013 he is grateful for small acts of kindness. \u201cElderly passengers will often say thank you, it\u2019s very nice,\u201d he added.</p> \n<p>Before the crisis began, Szabo, who lives alone in Middleton, planned to return to his home country of Hungary to visit his brother and sister, after putting off a trip last year.

      "bodyText": "Although providing a vital service offers them a sense of normality and purpose in challenging times, bus drivers in Manchester have said the death toll among their workforce is an increasing source of anxiety. Tracy Farrell, 48 Tracy Farrell has been a bus driver along First Group\u2019s Vantage route \u2013 which takes mostly commuters from Leigh, in the borough of Wigan, to Manchester city centre \u2013 for six years, but she has never seen days like those she has experienced in lockdown. \u201cWe\u2019re still taking people to work but our passenger numbers have dropped by around 90%,\u201d said Farrell. When night falls, passengers are even scarcer and the work can be \u201ceerie and isolating\u201d. Though Farrell misses having longer chats with customers and waving to other bus drivers when the roads are busier, loneliness is the least of her worries when it comes to work. Trying to protect herself from contracting coronavirus armed only with sanitiser is at the forefront of her mind. The deaths of London bus drivers have also exacerbated her anxiety. \u201cWhen something happens to a bus driver, no matter where it happens, you still feel quite attached to them,\u201d said Farrell. \u201cIt does filter through to us all and it is a very worrying time.\u201d As a result of not being able to do overtime due to lower passenger numbers, Farrell\u2019s working hours have dropped from 45 a week to 38. But shows of support from the public have helped to boost her morale. \u201cLast week, I got an applause as I drove past Salford Cathedral and people are always waving from the street,\u201d she said. Adding to her sense of pride is the fact that her 23-year-old daughter is a newly qualified junior doctor about to head out to work in a hospital. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of her, and I\u2019m proud that I\u2019m helping too because it\u2019s people like her that I\u2019m taking to work every day.\u201d Josef Szabo, 42 Szabo, who has worked on the same route as Farrell since January, said he was also finding it difficult to adapt to quieter roads and lower passenger numbers. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very quiet. I\u2019d say it\u2019s quite boring to be honest,\u201d said Szabo. But although he longs for the days when he can exchange more than a few brief words with regulars, right now he is focused on trying to lessen his risk of catching the coronavirus. He regularly douses his cabin in sanitiser, while the holes in its assault shield \u2013 which would usually allow him to be heard more clearly by passengers \u2013 are blocked up. But there is only so much he can do to influence the behaviour of others. \u201cMost of our customers are sticking to the rules and staying well away from each other, but there are some who are too impatient to even let other passengers off the bus before they get on,\u201d he said. Although he hasn\u2019t received grand gestures of thanks \u2013 such as Farrell\u2019s applause \u2013 he is grateful for small acts of kindness. \u201cElderly passengers will often say thank you, it\u2019s very nice,\u201d he added. Before the crisis began, Szabo, who lives alone in Middleton, planned to return to his home country of Hungary to visit his brother and sister, after putting off a trip last year. Now, although daily calls from them help abate loneliness, most of their conversations are about his line of work. \u201cThey\u2019re concerned for me because they understand that I\u2019m on the frontline so the risks are high for me to catch the virus,\u201d he said. \u2022 This article was amended on 30 April 2020 to clarify that Leigh is in the borough of Wigan, not \u201cin Wigan\u201d.",

It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers \u2013 not the public.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>\u201cWearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,\u201d the WHO has stated.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>There is no robust scientific evidence \u2013 in the form of trials \u2013 that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.</p>\n    <p>Also underlying the WHO\u2019s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play, especially on crowded public transport as people return to work..</p>\n    <p><b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\">Sarah Boseley</a></b>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>On Tuesday Nicola Sturgeon announced new non-mandatory guidance recommending that the Scottish public should wear face masks in enclosed spaces where social distancing is difficult to achieve, for example while shopping or using public transport.</p> \n<p>The Scottish first minister said she had taken advice from Sage, as well as her own chief medical officer, before making the decision to advise the use of masks \u201cin limited circumstances\u201d.</p> \n<p>Sturgeon said one of the reasons she had issued the guidance now was because people were increasingly wearing masks when they left the house and she did not want this to make individuals feel \u201cinvincible\u2019 or distract from adherence to existing physical distancing and stay-at-home guidance.</p> \n<p>She told reporters at her daily media briefing \u201call governments across the UK are considering this and it\u2019s not for me to speak to them\u201d, insisting there was no \u201cdivide or split\u201d between them on the matter.</p> \n<p>Asked about the issue later at the No 10 press briefing, Hancock said: \u201cUK government advice hasn\u2019t changed, not least because the most important thing people can do is the social distancing, as opposed to the weak science on face masks.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere is very clear science on social distancing and the importance of it.

      "bodyText": "Ministers are split over whether to change government advice on wearing face masks, with Matt Hancock, the health secretary, stressing that the evidence for them was weak despite Scotland\u2019s decision to recommend cloth coverings in some public places. Hancock expressed his scepticism about changing the UK-wide advice in the daily No 10 press conference on Tuesday, emphasising that physical distancing was a much greater priority. However, Whitehall sources said the discussion on the issue was still live among ministers, even though the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) presented its verdict on the issue to the cabinet almost a week ago, which is understood to have advised there was little evidence masks reduce the spread of infection in the community. One government source said there was still clear concern among some ministers about changing the UK advice at this stage, when people with symptoms are being advised to stay at home anyway. \u201cThere is a worry in government is that we don\u2019t want to do anything to lessen the impact of masks for healthcare workers. The risk is that you end up with people in the NHS without masks. We are being very cautious about it. There are people in government who obviously are more and less enthusiastic about the idea,\u201d the source said. However, some ministers are persuaded of the idea that people might feel more confident about going back to work if they are told to wear cloth coverings on public transport and in enclosed work spaces, which could help reopen the economy. The British Medical Association has also called on ministers to make wearing masks in public compulsory. On Tuesday Nicola Sturgeon announced new non-mandatory guidance recommending that the Scottish public should wear face masks in enclosed spaces where social distancing is difficult to achieve, for example while shopping or using public transport. The Scottish first minister said she had taken advice from Sage, as well as her own chief medical officer, before making the decision to advise the use of masks \u201cin limited circumstances\u201d. Sturgeon said one of the reasons she had issued the guidance now was because people were increasingly wearing masks when they left the house and she did not want this to make individuals feel \u201cinvincible\u2019 or distract from adherence to existing physical distancing and stay-at-home guidance. She told reporters at her daily media briefing \u201call governments across the UK are considering this and it\u2019s not for me to speak to them\u201d, insisting there was no \u201cdivide or split\u201d between them on the matter. Asked about the issue later at the No 10 press briefing, Hancock said: \u201cUK government advice hasn\u2019t changed, not least because the most important thing people can do is the social distancing, as opposed to the weak science on face masks. \u201cThere is very clear science on social distancing and the importance of it. That is the absolute priority in terms of the message to the public. The social distancing and staying at home is the thing that\u2019s helping to save lives. That is the number one thing.\u201d Professor Dame Angela McLean, the UK deputy chief scientific adviser, confirmed that Sage recommended that there was \u201cweak evidence of a small effect in which a face mask can prevent a source of infection going from somebody who is infected to the people around them\u201d. McLean said: \u201cUnder our current circumstances, anybody who has symptoms really must stay at home ... but we are also concerned that some people are infected who don\u2019t have symptoms, or maybe don\u2019t have symptoms yet, and that is the reason that Sage has put so much effort into looking at this question,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the answer is clear that the evidence is weak and the effect is small, and we have passed that on to our colleagues in government with which to make a decision.\u201d",

A spokesperson said POA understood that the government would be considering other frontline workers for the scheme and it hoped prison workers would be among them. The Department of Health and Social Care said the government recognised the important contribution of all key workers in the fight against coronavirus. A spokesperson said the scheme was targeted at frontline NHS and care workers because of the \u201cheightened risks they are facing when working in environments where they are providing care to coronavirus patients and patients with suspected coronavirus\u201d. The government defended the \u00a360,000 payment as \u201cof comparable size to the death-in-service lump sum that would be payable through the NHS pension scheme to the next of kin of an average NHS staff member\u201d.

Top stories The federal government has offered independent schools early funding if they meet benchmarks to return to face-to-face teaching by June. The education minister, Dan Tehan, has said independent and Catholic schools will receive up to 25% of their total annual recurrent funding early if they reopen. The coronavirus death toll at the Newmarch House care home in Sydney has now reached 11. The Anglicare Sydney facility has recorded 54 Covid-19 infections to date. Australian doctors are on the lookout for a rare disease in children linked to Covid-19, following an alert from the UK yesterday. Kawasaki disease causes blood vessels to become inflamed and in some cases leads to heart disease, and is presenting in a small number of children who have tested positive for the Covid-19 virus. And lockdown restrictions in NSW have eased, with households now allowed to have two adult visitors. Australia\u2019s property market has been hit hard by coronavirus, with sales plummeting and tenants breaking leases because they can no longer afford to pay rent. Sales values dropped 85% in Melbourne in the past eight weeks, according to figures released on Tuesday, equating to a year-on-year loss of $584m. Meanwhile, Australia\u2019s major retailers are refining their click-and-collect services, even as lockdown restrictions are eased. Paul Zahra, Australian Retailers Association CEO, believes the shift towards delivery and kerbside pickup will leave a \u201clegacy\u201d in Australians\u2019 shopping habits. Donald Trump has suggested the US will seek damages from China, saying the country could have done more to stop the virus. At the president\u2019s latest briefing Trump launched a forthright attack on China, saying there were \u201ca lot of ways you can hold them accountable\u201d for the pandemic. In New York, an ER doctor described as \u201ctruly in the trenches of the frontline\u201d has killed herself. Her father told the New York Times that she had been talking about how hard it was not to be able to save Covid-19 patients. In Spain, three women have been killed by their partners following a worrying uptick in domestic violence cases. Germany has urged its citizens to stay home as official data appeared to indicate the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic was once again accelerating. But there is better news in France, where a huge national testing scheme accompanies a \u201cprogressive and controlled\u201d lockdown exit plan. Australia Australia should embark on an ambitious public housing program to build its way out of the Covid-19 economic crisis, the Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss) has said. Acoss warns a return to old economic policies could harm the recovery. As well as a $7bn scheme to build 30,000 social housing dwellings, Acoss recommends welfare payments avoid any return to the \u201cbrutality\u201d of $40 a day. Almost all of Australia\u2019s power needs could be met by renewables with no extra cost to the consumer, according to an analysis by the energy and carbon consultancy RepuTex. The report finds that Australia could reach 70% renewable energy generation by 2030 and 90% in 2040 if it follows an ambitious plan to invest in renewables. A report showing that Facebook and Google were refusing to pay Australian media companies for content sparked the decision to force the tech giants to share their ad revenue last week. The competition watchdog is now drafting a code and setting up \u201cintensive bilateral discussions\u201d with all parties before issuing a draft at the end of July. The energy minister, Angus Taylor, is making a distinction between \u201cdownloading\u201d and \u201caccessing\u201d documents as his attack on Sydney City Council continues to trouble him. Through a spokesman Taylor rejected news reports he refused to be interviewed by police investigating the matter. The world The Pentagon has formally released three UFO videos taken by US Navy pilots, after they were leaked online. The videos were declassified to \u201cclear up any misconceptions\u201d on whether they were real. The Michael Moore documentary Planet of the Humans has prompted a furious reaction from scientists and campaigners who say it is full of misinformation. Scientists say the documentary \u201ctrades in debunked fossil fuel industry talking points\u201d that question the affordability and reliability of solar and wind energy.

Worries also surround supporters moving into public spaces to celebrate major victories, and one club questioned whether it would be possible to stop people playing football in parks if the professional game is back on television screens. Clubs do not want to become scapegoats.</p> <p>Ultimately the league\u2019s approach will be informed by the government and medical experts.

      "bodyText": "Premier League clubs are concerned about supporters gathering outside stadiums if the season resumes and fear football will be blamed if breaches of physical distancing guidelines result in a rise in coronavirus cases. Although the government this week declared its desire to see football back \u201cas soon as possible\u201d, it is understood a range of potential complications will be raised when top-flight clubs hold a pivotal meeting on Friday to discuss how to complete the season. Several clubs are worried about the public gathering outside stadiums where games are taking place behind closed doors, and there are reservations about how to solve contract issues involving players, the capacity for testing, and whether playing in neutral venues would be an artificial construct. Many issues have not yet been properly discussed, with one official saying clubs remain in the dark over a restart plan, and that Friday\u2019s meeting will be key to finding a path towards a potential resumption in mid-June. Yet with some clubs questioning whether the government is trying to use football as a distraction amid criticism of its Covid-19 strategy and tensions over the lockdown, there is a growing feeling that the Premier League\u2019s return could have unwanted consequences. Several clubs fear the prospect of mass gatherings outside stadiums, or supporters meeting in homes to watch games, and there are concerns that even playing at neutral venues may not dissuade fans from travelling. Worries also surround supporters moving into public spaces to celebrate major victories, and one club questioned whether it would be possible to stop people playing football in parks if the professional game is back on television screens. Clubs do not want to become scapegoats. Ultimately the league\u2019s approach will be informed by the government and medical experts. There is no desire to return before it is safe and although Premier League sides are watching with interest as the Bundesliga prepares to resume on 9 May, they know there is more capacity for testing in Germany than in the United Kingdom.

The professor, who has a history of respiratory problems, was exonerated in a US sanctions trial last year, but Ice has refused to release him or allow him to return to Iran. Iran\u2019s foreign minister recently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JZarif/status/1243504082050068481\">called</a> for his release, as have some <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoaquinCastrotx/status/1246909194781052928\">US lawmakers</a> and human rights groups.</p> <p>Asgari is confined to a small room at the Winn correctional center in a Louisiana, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/12/coronavirus-us-deep-south-poverty-race-perfect-storm\">state hard hit by coronavirus</a>.</p> <p>Ice informed the attorneys that Asgari\u2019s test was positive on Tuesday, but Asgari said Ice had not yet told him the results and that he had learned of them on a call with his family and lawyers. \u201cThe nurse \u2026 always says the test results are not in,\u201d Asgari said, noting that the medical staff checked on him twice or three times a day.</p> <p>Ice told Asgari\u2019s lawyers he would only be released to a hospital if he was struggling to breathe, the attorneys said.</p> <p>Bryan Cox, an Ice spokesman, said there were two confirmed Covid-19 cases at Winn but declined to answer specific questions about Asgari.</p> <p>The professor has repeatedly raised concerns about Ice continuing to bring in new detainees into the close quarters of the facility, mixing them with those already jailed. Asgari said he got a bad fever after Ice recently brought a new group to his pod.</p> <p>The specifics of Asgari\u2019s case have been particularly shocking to immigration attorneys. Asgari, a father of three, has deep ties to the US, including two children living in America. In 2017, he was charged with fraud and trade secret theft relating to his work with a university in Ohio. But after a long trial, he was acquitted in November 2019.</p> <p>But because the US had revoked his original visa, he was taken into Ice custody and has remained detained. Since the pandemic hit, he has tried to \u201cself-deport\u201d to Iran or get approval to stay with his family in the US but has been denied. Now, even if released, he would probably be unable to get on an immediate flight due to his diagnosis.</p> <p>\u201cThis mass [detention] under this outbreak of a nasty virus is absolutely wrong,\u201d Asgari said on Tuesday after learning of his test results. \u201cWhat more proof do they need?\u201d </p> <p>Asgari said he was unable to shower while in isolation and was given a bowl of water he could use to wash his head. He said he had also pleaded for fresh fruit, which he has not had for a month.</p> <p>At Winn, he and other detainees <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/us-jail-immigrants-coronavirus-deportation\">told the Guardian</a> last month that many of them were trying to get deported because they were so fearful of Covid-19 exposure inside. Several men said the detainees were responsible for all cleaning, and there was a single shower and only two toilets for all 44 of them to share. They are also sleeping on beds spaced roughly 2ft apart.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this is happening. It\u2019s devastating,\u201d said Mehrnoush Yazdanyar, an attorney working with Asgari\u2019s family. \u201cEvery fear he had has been realized, one by one, with him ending up with Covid-19. This is an innocent man who hasn\u2019t committed any crimes. He shouldn\u2019t be behind bars. Why does the US government continue to keep him in detention?\u201d</p> <p>The number of positive Covid-19 cases inside Ice jails has been steadily climbing, with Ice officials reporting that <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article242203726.html\">hundreds of detainees</a> have the virus. But only a fraction of people inside immigration jails have received tests so far, and rights groups fear the rate could be much higher. Some judges have ordered Ice to release detainees due to Covid-19 risks, and advocates have urged the US to conduct immediate mass releases to avoid a huge death toll inside.</p> <p>As of 18 April, Ice had 30,737 people in custody, and the population in jails has declined by roughly 8,000 since 29 February, according to the Ice spokesman.</p> <p>Cox said Ice had adequate cleaning supplies, adding in an email that the agency had \u201ca long history of handling communicable diseases in the course of everyday operations\u201d and had \u201ctaken extensive precautions to limit the potential spread of COVID-19\u201d.</p>",

The professor has repeatedly raised concerns about Ice continuing to bring in new detainees into the close quarters of the facility, mixing them with those already jailed. Asgari said he got a bad fever after Ice recently brought a new group to his pod. The specifics of Asgari\u2019s case have been particularly shocking to immigration attorneys. Asgari, a father of three, has deep ties to the US, including two children living in America. In 2017, he was charged with fraud and trade secret theft relating to his work with a university in Ohio. But after a long trial, he was acquitted in November 2019. But because the US had revoked his original visa, he was taken into Ice custody and has remained detained. Since the pandemic hit, he has tried to \u201cself-deport\u201d to Iran or get approval to stay with his family in the US but has been denied. Now, even if released, he would probably be unable to get on an immediate flight due to his diagnosis. \u201cThis mass [detention] under this outbreak of a nasty virus is absolutely wrong,\u201d Asgari said on Tuesday after learning of his test results. \u201cWhat more proof do they need?\u201d Asgari said he was unable to shower while in isolation and was given a bowl of water he could use to wash his head. He said he had also pleaded for fresh fruit, which he has not had for a month. At Winn, he and other detainees told the Guardian last month that many of them were trying to get deported because they were so fearful of Covid-19 exposure inside. Several men said the detainees were responsible for all cleaning, and there was a single shower and only two toilets for all 44 of them to share. They are also sleeping on beds spaced roughly 2ft apart. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this is happening. It\u2019s devastating,\u201d said Mehrnoush Yazdanyar, an attorney working with Asgari\u2019s family. \u201cEvery fear he had has been realized, one by one, with him ending up with Covid-19. This is an innocent man who hasn\u2019t committed any crimes. He shouldn\u2019t be behind bars. Why does the US government continue to keep him in detention?\u201d The number of positive Covid-19 cases inside Ice jails has been steadily climbing, with Ice officials reporting that hundreds of detainees have the virus. But only a fraction of people inside immigration jails have received tests so far, and rights groups fear the rate could be much higher. Some judges have ordered Ice to release detainees due to Covid-19 risks, and advocates have urged the US to conduct immediate mass releases to avoid a huge death toll inside. As of 18 April, Ice had 30,737 people in custody, and the population in jails has declined by roughly 8,000 since 29 February, according to the Ice spokesman. Cox said Ice had adequate cleaning supplies, adding in an email that the agency had \u201ca long history of handling communicable diseases in the course of everyday operations\u201d and had \u201ctaken extensive precautions to limit the potential spread of COVID-19\u201d.",

Papua New Guinea: With eight confirmed cases in four separate locations, and with few clear sources of transmission, the nation remains very much in the Covid-19 spotlight. Soldiers were despatched to conduct contact tracing in Western Province, and 152 samples were collected, including those of 10 police officers who were sent to the area without PPE. The country is already running low on critical supplies required for testing. The government of Australia is assisting PNG to source what is needed. Guam: The territory has now reported a total of 144 infections. They have had five deaths, 128 people have recovered and four active cases remain, said the Guam Daily Post. Nearly all of the crew of the aircraft carrier, the USS Theodore Roosevelt, which docked in Guam after coronavirus was detected on the ship have been tested, with 777 testing positive. More than 60 have recovered already. New Caledonia: The number of confirmed cases remains unchanged at 18. The government claims there is no evidence of any local transmission. Fiji: There are seven active cases of Covid-19 in the country and a total of 18 infections have been recorded. Fiji has not had a new confirmed case since 18 April. Vanuatu: The country remains virus-free. But the massive economic impact of Covid-19 is becoming starkly clear. A recent survey of more than 250 tourism businesses showed full-time employment in the sector had decreased by 70%. Tonga: The country remains virus-free although readiness work is still ongoing in case any infections are detected. Authorities have stated that the available resources would make it very hard for them to deal with even a small number of cases Marshall Islands: No cases have been confirmed, but the Marshall Islands Journal reports that five people remain under observation in quarantine. What are Pacific governments doing? Papua New Guinea: Some restrictions imposed during the government\u2019s State of Emergency have been lifted, including resumption of public transport services subject to sanitation and physical distancing requirements. Restaurants and places of worship have re-opened, again with protective measures in place. Fiji: Some restrictions on movement and gatherings within the country have been relaxed, including allowing gatherings of up to 20 people. A curfew remains in place, as does a ban on sporting events. A senior military officer this week defended the government\u2019s right to suppress free speech in the crisis. His statement was roundly rejected by human rights advocates. Solomon Islands: The nation has no current cases. Government has ended in-person visits in the country\u2019s correctional facilities, replacing them with scheduled phone calls using phones donated by the International Committee of the Red Cross. Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare announced Friday that the nation now has domestic testing capability, thanks to equipment donated by China. Vanuatu: The country\u2019s third largest island is in temporary lockdown. Travel to Malekula and its surrounding islands is forbidden following the news that two men had ignored quarantine rules and gone aboard a Philippines-based cargo ship. Officials say there is only a very low likelihood that anyone on board is infected, but they\u2019re taking no chances. New Caledonia: The resumption of domestic flights has been deferred until 4 May and international flights remain barred, except for repatriation. Pro-independence members of the government have asked that a flight carrying 180 military personnel be cancelled. This flight is part of the regular rotation of French soldiers stationed overseas. Samoa: The IMF last week approved a US$22m concessional loan to the government Samoa to address \u201curgent balance of payment needs created by Covid-19.\u201d Samoa has long been saddled with high levels of debt, including loans from China EXIM Bank. Marshall Islands: The foreign minister has joined the governor of Guam in expressing concern about the travel of US citizens to Guam and the Marshalls while the Covid-19 crisis persists. Federated States of Micronesia: The United States government last week announced a multi-million dollar assistance package for Pacific island countries, including about US$7.7m for the FSM. French Polynesia: Health minister Jacques Reynal claimed this week that the transmission of Covid-19 in the territory has \u201cstopped\u201d. This comes four days after two new cases were reported. A territory-wide curfew is scheduled to end today. French Polynesia: The territory reported another case on Tuesday, bringing the total to 58. This came just days after health minister Jacques Reynal claimed the transmission of Covid-19 in the territory had \u201cstopped\u201d. A territory-wide curfew is scheduled to end today. Palau: The government has taken delivery of four tonnes of medical aid donated by a Cambodia-based company Horizons Holdings. The cargo arrived by chartered aircraft from China. Guam: Citing the possibility of undetected cases among neighbouring populations, Governor Lou Leon Guerrero has written to US Vice President Mike Pence to request a suspension of incoming international flights from Palau, the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia. None of these nations have any confirmed cases. Australia and New Zealand Australia has just over 6,600 cases and 84 deaths from Covid-19. The rate of infection has continued to slow, with the country recording between nine and 21 new cases a day for the past seven days. Many states have announced slight loosening of lockdown laws, and more than two million people across the country have downloaded an app that aims to assist the government with contract tracing of cases. New Zealand\u2019s strict level-four lockdown ended on Monday night, meaning that New Zealanders are now allowed to go out for takeaway and some are able to return to work. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the country had successfully stopped the \u201cwidespread, undetected community transmission\u201d of Covid-19. The country has had just over 1,470 cases and 19 deaths. Fake news A Korean cult based in Fiji has published an advertisement in the Fiji Sun containing the claim that \u201cthe reason for the Covid-19 outbreak is the unjust persecution, imprisonment and slandering of its leader Reverend Okjoo Shin as a cult.\u201d Shin, founder of the Grace Road Church, convinced her followers to move to Fiji in 2014, which she said was the \u201cpromised land\u201d where they would survive coming apocalyptic events. She was jailed in South Korea last year for holding 400 people captive in Fiji and subjecting them to violent beatings. Fiji\u2019s media regulator, the Media Industry Development Authority, and the Fiji Sun declined to comment to local media about how these claims linking Shin\u2019s arrest to the coronavirus outbreak made it into print. What did they say? During a crisis the media and government form a partnership where the public safety is paramount. The exchanges should not degenerate into the kind of acrimony we see between the US media and President Trump, where one-upmanship and point-scoring have become the order of the day. - Dr Shailendra Singh, commenting on the government of Fiji\u2019s willingness to use the Covid-19 crisis as an excuse to suppress freedom of speech. Good news Vanuatu brought joy to a sports-starved world by using Facebook to broadcast a rare live event. The women\u2019s club cricket T20 championship, followed by a 10-over exhibition match played by the Vanuatu men\u2019s team was watched by around 350,000 people around the world - which is more than the population of Vanuatu. Infection and fatality figures in this article are valid as of 28 April. They are based on WHO daily situation reports, and supplemented in some cases by national government updates.",

      "body": "<p>British Airways has set out plans to make up to 12,000 of its staff redundant because of the global collapse in air travel in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>The airline\u2019s chief executive, Alex Cruz, told BA\u2019s 42,000 staff on Tuesday night that the company \u201cmust act decisively now to ensure that British Airways has a strong future\u201d and that means more than one in four jobs must be cut.</p> <p>Cruz said the UK\u2019s flag carrier airline, which has placed 22,600 people on the government\u2019s furlough scheme, \u201ccannot expect the taxpayer to offset salaries indefinitely\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cYesterday, British Airways flew just a handful of aircraft out of Heathrow. On a normal day we would fly more than 300. What we are facing as an airline, like so many other businesses up and down the country, is that there is no \u2018normal\u2019 any longer,\u201d <a href=\"https://mediacentre.britishairways.com/pressrelease/details/86/News-1/12272\">Cruz said in a letter to staff </a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe are a strong, well-managed business that has faced into, and overcome, many crises in our hundred-year history. We must overcome this crisis ourselves, too.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/British_Airways/status/1255177465263198209\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The Covid-19 pandemic is an unprecedented crisis for the world.

We must act decisively now to ensure that British Airways has a strong future and continues connecting Britain with the world.\u201d</p> <p>IAG said it had plunged to a loss of \u20ac535m (\u00a3465m) in the first three months of this year \u2013 with all the damage being done in March. In the same period last year the airline group made a profit of \u20ac135m. IAG also revealed it had made a one-off loss of \u20ac1.3bn \u2013 the result of taking out contracts to hedge against the possibility of rising oil prices. In fact the oil price has crashed.</p> <p>IAG said BA had been hit hardest, with other airlines in the group \u2013 Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling \u2013 feeling less impact.</p> <p>Unions responded with anger. Brian Strutton, the general secretary of the pilots\u2019 union Balpa, said staff were devastated by the \u201cbolt out of the blue\u201d news and that the union would fight for every job.</p> <p>\u201cBA pilots and all staff are devastated by the announcement of up to 12,000 possible job losses in British Airways,\u201d he said.</p> <p>BA, he added, had \u201csaid it was wealthy enough to weather the Covid storm and declined any government support.\u201d</p> <p>The leader of the Unite union described BA\u2019s decision as heartless, and a \u201cstab in the back\u201d, saying it was \u201centirely at odds with the course of action followed by our European competitors as they seek a way through the coronavirus crisis\u201d.</p> <p>Len McCluskey said: \u201cTo reject government support but then expect their own staff to pay the cost of such a misjudgement, is irresponsible, dangerous and destructive and is utterly at odds with the mood of the country at a time of crisis.\u201d</p> <p>Nadine Houghton, national officer of GMB, the union for British Airways ground staff, said: \u201cIf the 12,000 figure is accurate this will be a huge blow for our loyal members.</p> <p>\u201cWe believed we had reached some relative, albeit temporary, respite for them following the agreement to furlough 80% of BA\u2019s staff \u2013 now this.</p> <p>\u201cI know our reps will work day and night to limit the impact on our members but 12,000 employees is a staggering number. All our efforts will be out into bringing that number down.\u201d</p> <p>The airline industry is facing its biggest ever challenge with the vast majority of flights grounded around the world. It is unclear when governments will allow airlines to resume a regular schedule.</p> <p>When planes do take to the skies again social distancing measures \u2013 which are likely to limit the density of passengers onboard \u2013 will make it hard for airlines to make the same profits as before.</p> <p>The global airlines trade association, Iata, has predicted that airlines could lose more than $300bn (\u00a3240bn) in the fallout from the pandemic and warned that 25m jobs are at risk.</p> <p>\u201cThis is an emergency. Airlines around the world are struggling to survive,\u201d Alexandre de Juniac, Iata\u2019s director general, said last week.</p> <p>\u201cGovernments will need financially viable airlines to lead the economic recovery. Many of them won\u2019t be around to do that if they have run out of cash. </p> <p>\u201cWe could see more than half of passenger revenues disappear. That would be a $314bn hit.

      "bodyText": "British Airways has set out plans to make up to 12,000 of its staff redundant because of the global collapse in air travel in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. The airline\u2019s chief executive, Alex Cruz, told BA\u2019s 42,000 staff on Tuesday night that the company \u201cmust act decisively now to ensure that British Airways has a strong future\u201d and that means more than one in four jobs must be cut. Cruz said the UK\u2019s flag carrier airline, which has placed 22,600 people on the government\u2019s furlough scheme, \u201ccannot expect the taxpayer to offset salaries indefinitely\u201d. \u201cYesterday, British Airways flew just a handful of aircraft out of Heathrow. On a normal day we would fly more than 300. What we are facing as an airline, like so many other businesses up and down the country, is that there is no \u2018normal\u2019 any longer,\u201d Cruz said in a letter to staff . \u201cWe are a strong, well-managed business that has faced into, and overcome, many crises in our hundred-year history. We must overcome this crisis ourselves, too.\u201d Cruz said the airline and its parent company International Airlines Group, had informed the government and its trade unions about its plans to cut jobs, and would begin a consultation period with staff and unions immediately. \u201cThis has been a difficult message to write and one I never thought I would need to send,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cI know how tight-knit the BA family is, and how concerned you will be, not just for yourself but for your colleagues, too. We must act decisively now to ensure that British Airways has a strong future and continues connecting Britain with the world.\u201d IAG said it had plunged to a loss of \u20ac535m (\u00a3465m) in the first three months of this year \u2013 with all the damage being done in March. In the same period last year the airline group made a profit of \u20ac135m. IAG also revealed it had made a one-off loss of \u20ac1.3bn \u2013 the result of taking out contracts to hedge against the possibility of rising oil prices. In fact the oil price has crashed. IAG said BA had been hit hardest, with other airlines in the group \u2013 Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling \u2013 feeling less impact. Unions responded with anger. Brian Strutton, the general secretary of the pilots\u2019 union Balpa, said staff were devastated by the \u201cbolt out of the blue\u201d news and that the union would fight for every job. \u201cBA pilots and all staff are devastated by the announcement of up to 12,000 possible job losses in British Airways,\u201d he said. BA, he added, had \u201csaid it was wealthy enough to weather the Covid storm and declined any government support.\u201d The leader of the Unite union described BA\u2019s decision as heartless, and a \u201cstab in the back\u201d, saying it was \u201centirely at odds with the course of action followed by our European competitors as they seek a way through the coronavirus crisis\u201d. Len McCluskey said: \u201cTo reject government support but then expect their own staff to pay the cost of such a misjudgement, is irresponsible, dangerous and destructive and is utterly at odds with the mood of the country at a time of crisis.\u201d Nadine Houghton, national officer of GMB, the union for British Airways ground staff, said: \u201cIf the 12,000 figure is accurate this will be a huge blow for our loyal members. \u201cWe believed we had reached some relative, albeit temporary, respite for them following the agreement to furlough 80% of BA\u2019s staff \u2013 now this. \u201cI know our reps will work day and night to limit the impact on our members but 12,000 employees is a staggering number. All our efforts will be out into bringing that number down.\u201d The airline industry is facing its biggest ever challenge with the vast majority of flights grounded around the world. It is unclear when governments will allow airlines to resume a regular schedule. When planes do take to the skies again social distancing measures \u2013 which are likely to limit the density of passengers onboard \u2013 will make it hard for airlines to make the same profits as before. The global airlines trade association, Iata, has predicted that airlines could lose more than $300bn (\u00a3240bn) in the fallout from the pandemic and warned that 25m jobs are at risk. \u201cThis is an emergency. Airlines around the world are struggling to survive,\u201d Alexandre de Juniac, Iata\u2019s director general, said last week. \u201cGovernments will need financially viable airlines to lead the economic recovery. Many of them won\u2019t be around to do that if they have run out of cash. \u201cWe could see more than half of passenger revenues disappear. That would be a $314bn hit. And without urgent relief, many airlines will not survive to lead the economic recovery.\u201d Several airlines around the world are on the brink of collapse and many are urgently trying to secure government bailouts or emergency bank loans. Germany\u2019s Lufthansa is reportedly considering filing for creditor protection, as negotiations over state bailouts collapsed on Tuesday night. The airline is said to be burning through \u20ac1m of cash every hour, and has warned it will have 10,000 too many staff when it emerges from the crisis as a much smaller operator. The budget airline Norwegian has warned that virtually all of its fleet of aircraft will remain grounded until 2021 and is seeking to persuade shareholders to accept a government-backed rescue plan that will wipe out most of their investments. Virgin Atlantic is trying to find an investor to pump in millions to keep it afloat as it negotiates with the government for a \u00a3500m emergency loan. Virgin Australia collapsed into administration last week. Easyjet has borrowed \u00a3600m from the government under its Covid Corporate Financing Facility, allowing it to survive another nine months at the present rate of cash burn. In a statement to the stock market, IAG said: \u201cIn light of the impact of Covid-19 on current operations and the expectation that the recovery of passenger demand to 2019 levels will take several years, British Airways is formally notifying its trade unions about a proposed restructuring and redundancy programme. \u201cThe proposals remain subject to consultation but it is likely that they will affect most of British Airways\u2019 employees and may result in the redundancy of up to 12,000 of them.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: US passes 1 million confirmed cases The country, by far the world\u2019s worst affected, reaches the milestone of 1 million confirmed cases, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The US death toll is now at more than 57,000 people. Confirmed deaths in Brazil exceed known Chinese toll Brazil\u2019s total number of confirmed deaths overtakes the WHO\u2019s figure for China as cases accelerate in Latin America\u2019s biggest country. The Brazilian health ministry reports 474 more deaths in a 24-hour period, taking the total to 5,017 \u2013 more than the known figure in China, where the virus was first reported and where there have been at least 4,643 deaths so far, according to the WHO. UK reports 586 more deaths The heath secretary, Matt Hancock, says the country has suffered 586 more deaths, bringing the total death toll in British hospitals to 21,678. In the UK government\u2019s daily briefing, Hancock says that the government will publish daily figures for the number of deaths in care homes and in the community from Wednesday onwards. Known global death toll exceeds 215,000 According to the Johns Hopkins researchers, at least 3,090,844 people have been infected worldwide and at least 215,063 have died since the outbreak began. The numbers are likely to be significant underestimates due to suspected underreporting and differing testing and recording systems around the world. Portugal to end state of emergency The country\u2019s president announces that its state of emergency will end at the weekend. Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa says the third such 15-day period will end at midnight on Saturday and \u201cwe hope it will not be necessary to use it again in the future\u201d. Spain outlines \u2018plan for transition to normality\u2019 The Spanish government sets out details of its lockdown strategy, as the country\u2019s daily death toll continues to decline and the rate of contagion falls. The plan proposes a transition in four phases, each lasting approximately two weeks, without setting a specific date when bars and restaurants can reopen or sporting and other events can resume. 12,000 BA staff face redundancy British Airways sets out plans to make as many as 12,000 of its staff redundant due to the global collapse in air travel caused by the pandemic. The airline\u2019s chief executive, \u00c1lex Cruz, has told its 42,000 staff the company \u201cmust act decisively now to ensure that British Airways has a strong future\u201d and that more than one in four jobs must be cut. Streamed films to be made eligible for Oscars Films released on streaming platforms only will be eligible for Academy Awards next year because of the pandemic\u2019s disruption to the industry, the organisers of the Oscars say. The change, announced by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, follows the closure of cinemas across the US. Previously, a movie had to have been screened in a cinema in Los Angeles for at least seven days to be eligible for Oscar consideration.",

      "bodyText": "Employment tribunals should be given powers to make awards of up to \u00a3100,000 for breach of contract and to deal with disputes where staff are still in work, the Law Commission has recommended. The strict time limit of three months to lodge claims after leaving employment should also be doubled to six months, the independent body which reviews legislation in England and Wales has proposed. In a 200-page report, the commission says employment tribunals should be able to hear complaints by employees that they are working excessive hours in breach of maximum working time limits. The recommendations, released in the middle of the coronavirus crisis, coincide with calls this week from a coalition of more than 20 justice organisations for the government to relax the three-month deadline to lodge employment tribunal claims during the pandemic. Since the tribunals were created in 1964 their jurisdiction has been steadily expanded. They now deal with a wide variety of claims brought by employees and workers for unfair dismissal and discrimination in the workplace. Their work involves less formal procedures than courts. Representatives do not need to be lawyers, and tribunals do not award costs to the winning party. The Law Commission says its recommendations, if implemented, would enhance the protections that employees and workers receive from the employment tribunals against discriminatory and unlawful practices. The proposals would increase the powers of employment tribunals while maintaining their exclusive jurisdiction over many types of claims. The law commissioner, Nicholas Paines QC, said: \u201cEmployment tribunals play an important role in resolving disputes and protecting the rights of workers. However, the system is not working as well as it should. \u201cThe reforms that we have recommended will bring real benefits for the courts and tribunals system and its users.

      "bodyText": "The coronavirus outbreak could lead to court case delays of up to six months and record prisoner numbers once the lockdown has been lifted, according to a leading Whitehall thinktank. Pressure on the criminal justice system from the pandemic combined with an anticipated rise in suspects facing charges could cause an \u201cunprecedented\u201d backlog of court proceedings in England and Wales, the Institute for Government (IfG) said. Working alongside the Chartered Institute for Public Finance and Accountancy (Cipfa), researchers said waiting times to hear cases could increase by more than 70% after a six-month lockdown, with many defendants and victims forced to wait more than half a year for crown court trials. This could result in the highest average waiting time ever recorded, the IfG said. To resolve the backlog, the thinktank calculates the government would need to spend an extra \u00a355m to \u00a3110m a year for two years so the extra trials could take place. Although there has been a recent dip in the prison population because courts have been suspended and prisoners released, researchers found that the government\u2019s plans to increase police numbers by 20,000 would rapidly increase the numbers arrested, charged and imprisoned. Researchers said the population in prisons could rise to 90,000 \u2013 its highest-ever level \u2013 and possibly more than 95,000 by 2023-24. Prisons in England and Wales are already close to capacity, with cases of violence and self-harm increasing sharply over the last decade. The government\u2019s pledge to provide 10,000 additional prison places is unlikely to be ready to meet the predicted rise in prisoner numbers. An extra \u00a3250m a year of spending would be required just to maintain current levels of performance in prisons, the report said. The IfG programme director, Nick Davies, who wrote the report, said: \u201cEven before the coronavirus outbreak, the government\u2019s pledge to increase police officer numbers could have resulted in courts and prisons being overwhelmed by an increase in cases. \u201cThe effect of the coronavirus outbreak now means that there will also be huge delays in cases reaching courts \u2013 and therefore justice delayed \u2013 without more spending.\u201d The report came as barristers warned that public access to justice is being hindered by the crisis. Three-quarters (75%) of more than 3,400 barristers surveyed by the Bar Council said they did not think the public can currently access justice at an acceptable level, while just 7% said access was acceptable. The body calculated that, of the self-employed barristers polled, 65% had seen a reduction in work. Rob Whiteman, the chief executive of Cipfa, said: \u201cA decade of austerity has meant that finance professionals in the criminal justice system have had to change nearly every aspect of how they manage their budgets. \u201cThe measures that have been taken in this area to fight Covid-19 will only exacerbate these pressures, particularly if we see an increase in demand. Throughout this crisis, government has stressed the need for policy decisions to be guided by evidence. \u201cWe would encourage stronger adoption of this approach when it comes to medium- to long-term financial planning, both for the criminal justice system, and public services at large.\u201d",

While some of the projected additional deaths will be among people with cancer who contract Covid-19, others will occur because diagnosis was late or treatment such as chemotherapy was delayed, the researchers conclude. \u201cOur findings demonstrate the serious potential for unintended consequences of the response to the Covid-19 pandemic, which may negatively impact on patients with cancer and other underlying health conditions,\u201d said Dr Alvina Lai, a lead author of the study and a lecturer in health data analytics at UCL\u2019s institute of health informatics. The NHS should recognise patients affected as being particularly vulnerable and manage their care to reduce the risk to their health, Lai added. Prof Peter Johnson, NHS England\u2019s top cancer doctor, said on Wednesday that people with possible signs of cancer who delay seeking care could face serious consequences. He said they should have symptoms such as a lump or new mole checked out as soon as possible. Patients can have cancer surgery at one of the NHS\u2019s \u201cCovid-free cancer hubs\u201d already operating in 19 areas of England, he added. Almost eight in 10 of the extra fatalities will be people recently diagnosed with cancer who also have at least one other long-term illness, such as heart problems, high blood pressure, obesity or diabetes, the NHS-funded study concluded. Prof Mark Lawler, of Queen\u2019s University Belfast and Data-Can\u2019s scientific lead, said: \u201cThe results are concerning. We believe countries need to rapidly understand how the emergency is affecting cancer outcomes, otherwise we risk adding cancer and other underlying health conditions to the escalating death toll of the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201d Prof Harry Hemingway, a senior author and the director of UCL\u2019s institute of health informatics, said: \u201cThe overall impact of the Covid-19 emergency on deaths in cancer patients could be substantial. There are many factors operating here including rapid changes to diagnosis and treatment protocols, social distancing measures, changes in people\u2019s behaviour in seeking medical attention and [the] economic impact of Covid-19, as well as deaths due to Covid-19 infection.\u201d One patient with bowel cancer told the Guardian that he had had a CT scan but his planned colonoscopy \u2013 a diagnostic procedure \u2013 at a hospital in south-west England had been postponed for an unspecified period because the hospital\u2019s endoscopy department had closed until the Covid-19 crisis eases. \u201cI am totally gutted to think I\u2019ve been chucked on the pile in favour of coronavirus victims. For all I know they are giving me a death sentence [by] not looking at my case,\u201d he said. Another person said their mother\u2019s surgery to remove a 3cm bladder tumour had been delayed for up to eight weeks because her hospital\u2019s urology department had been shut as part of its preparations for Covid-19 cases. \u201cThis is worse than any nightmare I might ever have imagined in my darkest hour,\u201d the relative said. Macmillan\u2019s chief executive, Lynda Thomas, said: \u201cThis research shows the possible extent of the direct and collateral damage caused by coronavirus on the health of our nation and to the lives of people living with conditions like cancer. It\u2019s extremely worrying that we are likely to see an increase in deaths of people newly diagnosed with cancer. \u201cWe are calling on all governments to stop cancer becoming the forgotten C and urgently ensure cancer services are getting everything they need to recover and catch up as quickly as possible from the disruption of the pandemic. This means having the right staff, protective equipment and testing to deliver safe care.\u201d Genevieve Edwards, the chief executive of Bowel Cancer UK, warned that unless NHS cancer services had the resources they needed to tackle the backlog of care, \u201cthe effects on the diagnosis and treatment of cancer will be felt for years to come\u201d.",

Headlined \u201c<a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30134-0/fulltext?dgcid=raven_jbs_etoc_email\">Decolonising Covid-19</a>\u201d, it argues that even before the health impact of the pandemic has been felt in the developing world, it\u2019s economic impact is proving hugely damaging. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>UNDP has estimated income losses of US$220 billion in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) and that nearly half of all jobs in Africa could be lost. This, combined with the potential health impact, could be catastrophic. A Comment published in The Lancet Global Health in April found that a rapid acceleration in the number of cases in west Africa, as has been seen in Europe, could quickly overwhelm vulnerable health systems that typically have fewer than five hospital beds per 10,000 population. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>There is a risk, the Lancet says, that attempts to tackle the pandemic by richer nations could leave the developing world \u201cin the dark\u201d, whilst, at the same time, expertise developed in Africa from dealing with, for example, the Ebola epidemics, is not being respected. </p> \n  <p>And, it adds, \u201ca sinister undercurrent has re-emerged\u201d as teams around the world race to develop treatments and vaccines for Covid-19.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>At the beginning of April, two French doctors sparked an intense backlash over comments made during a live television discussion about Covid-19 trials in Europe and Australia by saying that the studies should be done in Africa first \u201cwhere there are no masks, no treatments, no resuscitation\u201d, reasoning that certain studies on AIDS had been carried out in prostitutes \u201cbecause we know that they are highly exposed and that they do not protect themselves\u201d. </p> \n   <p>Africa is a continent where the legacy of colonialism is particularly heavy. It is shocking to hear these remarks from scientists in the 21st century, at a time when the work of epidemiologists, infectious disease modellers, public health specialists and, indeed, all health workers, is in the public spotlight like never before. At the WHO press briefing on April 6, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus responded plainly, \u201cTo be honest, I was so appalled, and it was at a time when I said we needed solidarity. These kinds of racist remarks will not help. It goes against solidarity. Africa cannot and will not be a testing ground for any vaccine \u2026 The hangover from a colonial mentality has to stop.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2214-109X%2820%2930134-0\">Read the rest of the article here</a>.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-28T14:44:46.071Z\">at 3.44pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea83bf48f082c9ba20aa187\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-28T14:23:22.004Z\">3.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This is <strong>Damien Gayle</strong> taking back control on the live blog now, with thanks to Simon Burnton for covering my break.

This will now be eased and new measures introduced. These include a nationwide night-time curfew, mandatory wearing of facemasks and a ban on \u201cnon-essential\u201d travel between different regions.</p> \n  <p>But a new and immediate two-week lockdown will be imposed in northern Nigeria\u2019s largest city Kano after officials said they were probing reports of \u201cmysterious deaths\u201d that doctors say often involve pneumonia.</p> \n  <p>In <strong>South Africa</strong>, where a strict nationwide lockdown has confined 56 million people to their homes for all but essential journeys since late March, restrictions are being loosened on Friday to allow some people to go back to work in designated industries and basic public transport to function. Schools however remain shut and sales of alcohol banned.</p> \n  <p>South Africa has been lauded for its aggressive effort to root out pockets of infection with screening and testing, as well as its big economic relief package. However there are signs that the lockdown - which has been largely respected - is beginning to fray. </p> \n  <p>In a national address last week, Cyril Ramaphosa described five stages of progressively looser lockdown. But no dates have been given for moving down (or up) the scale beyond May 1st and the shift to phase four, and different phases can be imposed in different parts of the country simultaneously. </p> \n  <p>Strategies have differed across Africa. <strong>Kenya </strong>has imposed a loose lockdown in the capital Nairobi and port city of Mombasa along with a nationwide curfew. <strong>Ghana </strong>recently lifted most of the restrictions placed on inhabitants of major cities but has maintained a ban on social events and public gatherings are still banned. </p> \n  <p>So too has the <strong>Democratic Republic of Congo</strong>, which imposed a loose lockdown on parts of the capital Kinshasa.

minister for North Korean affairs</strong> said on Tuesday. </p> \n  <p>The North Korean leader\u2019s absence from public ceremonies on the birth anniversary of his grandfather and founder of the country, Kim Il-sung, was unprecedented, and he has not been seen in public since. That has led to days of speculation over his health.</p> \n  <p>South Korean officials emphasise they have detected no unusual movements in North Korea and have cautioned against reports that Kim may be ill. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36c94b6e94ff2e2145acf57c94fa5dd787a8b9f7\"> \n   <img

confirmed cases of the coronavirus, but given the fact that the country has taken stringent steps to head off an outbreak, Kim\u2019s absence from the ceremonies is not particularly unusual, unification minister Kim Yeon-chul, who oversees North Korea engagement, told lawmakers. </p> \n  <p>He said at a parliamentary hearing </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is true that he had never missed the anniversary for Kim Il-sung\u2019s birthday since he took power, but many anniversary events including celebrations and a banquet had been cancelled because of coronavirus concerns.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p> He said there were at least two instances since mid-January where Kim Jong-un was out of sight for nearly 20 days. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s particularly unusual given the current (coronavirus) situation.\u201d </p> \n  <p>The US president, Donald Trump, said on Monday he has a good idea how Kim Jong-un is doing and hopes he is fine, but would not elaborate. </p> \n  <p>The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said he was aware of reports on Kim\u2019s health and he was was paying close attention to developments. </p> \n  <p>North Korea had cancelled some large events, and imposed a border lockdown and quarantine measures in an effort to prevent an outbreak of the coronavirus. </p> \n  <p>But if Kim Jong-un is hiding out due to fears surrounding Covid-19, it would \u201cpuncture a hole in the state media narrative of how this crisis has been perfectly managed\u201d, said Chad O\u2019Carroll, CEO of Korea Risk Group, which monitors North Korea. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-28T06:35:01.021Z\">at 7.35am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div

has rejected claims it was the origin of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n  <p>The head of the lab told Reuters the claims have no basis in fact, adding there were still no conclusive answers as to where the disease started. </p> \n  <p> Conspiracy theorists have claimed Covid-19, now responsible for more than 200,000 deaths worldwide, was synthesised by the <strong>Wuhan Institute of Virology</strong> (WIV), based in the city where the disease was first identified. </p> \n  <p>Though the scientific consensus is that the coronavirus evolved naturally, such claims have gained traction. </p> \n  <p>The US president, Donald Trump, said on 15 April that his government was investigating whether it had originated in the Wuhan lab. </p> \n  <p>Yuan Zhiming, professor at WIV and the director of its National Biosafety Laboratory, said \u201cmalicious\u201d claims about the lab had been \u201cpulled out of thin air\u201d and contradicted all available evidence. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThe WIV does not have the intention and the ability to design and construct a new coronavirus,\u201d he said in written responses to questions from Reuters. \u201cMoreover, there is no information within the SARS-CoV-2 genome indicating it was manmade.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Some conspiracy theories were fuelled by a widely read scientific paper from the Indian Institute of Technology, since withdrawn, claiming that proteins in the coronavirus shared an \u201cuncanny similarity\u201d with those of HIV. </p> \n  <p>However, most scientists now say Covid-19 originated in wildlife, with bats and pangolins identified as possible host species. </p> \n  <p>\u201cMore than 70% of emerging infectious diseases originated from animals, especially wild animals,\u201d Yuan said. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIn recent years, we have seen increasing risks posed by close contact between humans and wild animals, with global climate change and the continuous expansion of human activities,\u201d he said. </p> \n  <p>All seven known human coronaviruses have origins in bats, mice or domestic animals, scientists say. </p> \n  <p>Yuan also rejected theories that the lab had accidentally released a coronavirus it had harvested from bats for research purposes, saying the lab\u2019s biosecurity procedures were strictly enforced. </p> \n  <p>\u201cHigh-level biosafety labs have sophisticated protective facilities and strict measures to ensure the safety of laboratory staff and protect the environment from contamination,\u201d he said. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div

Head there for the latest global coronavirus news: Three US children infected with the coronavirus are being treated for a rare inflammatory syndrome that appears similar to one that has raised concerns by doctors in Britain, Italy and Spain, Reuters reports. All three children - who range in age from 6 months to 8 years - have undergone treatment at Columbia University Medical Centre in New York, and all had fever and inflammation of the heart and the gut. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re at the very beginning of trying to understand what that represents,\u201d Columbia\u2019s Dr Mark Gorelik told Reuters. Italian and British medical experts are investigating a possible link between the coronavirus pandemic and clusters of Kawasaki disease, a severe inflammatory disease among infants arriving in hospitals with high fevers and swollen arteries. The syndrome has been largely undetected in the United States, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Gorelik said he believes the cases are likely not Kawasaki disease, but a similar process that shares an underlying mechanism with Kawasaki, which is thought to be triggered by an infectious agent that sparks an immune response. Known global death toll exceeds 215,000. According to the Johns Hopkins researchers, at least 3,110,219 people have been infected worldwide and at least 216,808 have died since the outbreak began. The numbers are likely to be significant underestimates due to suspected underreporting and differing testing and recording systems around the world. US passes 1 million confirmed cases. The country, by far the world\u2019s worst affected, reaches the milestone of 1 million confirmed cases, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The US death toll is now at more than 57,000 people. Confirmed deaths in Brazil exceed known Chinese toll. Brazil\u2019s total number of confirmed deaths overtakes the WHO\u2019s figure for China as cases accelerate in Latin America\u2019s biggest country. UK reports 586 more deaths. The heath secretary, Matt Hancock, says the country has suffered 586 more deaths, bringing the total death toll in British hospitals to 21,678. Portugal to end state of emergency. The country\u2019s president announces that its state of emergency will end at the weekend. Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa says the third such 15-day period will end at midnight on Saturday and \u201cwe hope it will not be necessary to use it again in the future\u201d. Spain outlines \u2018plan for transition to normality\u2019. The Spanish government sets out details of its lockdown strategy, as the country\u2019s daily death toll continues to decline and the rate of contagion falls. 12,000 BA staff face redundancy. British Airways sets out plans to make as many as 12,000 of its staff redundant due to the global collapse in air travel caused by the pandemic. The airline\u2019s chief executive, \u00c1lex Cruz, has told its 42,000 staff the company \u201cmust act decisively now to ensure that British Airways has a strong future\u201d and that more than one in four jobs must be cut. Streamed films to be made eligible for Oscars. Films released on streaming platforms only will be eligible for Academy Awards next year because of the pandemic\u2019s disruption to the industry, the organisers of the Oscars say. Here is vice-president Mike Pence earlier today, failing to wear a mask at the Mayo Clinic\u2019s facilities in Minnesota. Pence triggered a storm of controversy on Tuesday by failing to wear a face mask on a visit to the facilities. Pence leads the US government\u2019s coronavirus taskforce, but his staff have claimed he does not need to wear the protective covering because he is regularly tested for the coronavirus: My colleague Sam Levin has this story: Iranian scientist in Ice detention tests positive for Covid-19 An Iranian scientist who has been pleading for weeks to be released from a US immigration jail due to his fragile health has contracted Covid-19, according to his family and attorneys. Dr Sirous Asgari, a materials science and engineering professor who spoke out in March about the unsanitary and \u201cinhumane\u201d conditions in detention, was placed in an isolation cell this week inside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) jail in Louisiana. His lawyers learned on Tuesday that his Covid-19 test was positive. He and his family are calling for his release to a medical facility where he can receive proper care. Hi, Helen Sullivan with you now. Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. Doctors on the frontline also widely believe that the real numbers are much higher \u2013 one factor being people dying at home. Speaking on condition of anonymity, one medic in Rio de Janeiro state said three patients who were intubated after testing positive using faster, less accurate serological tests died during his overnight shift last weekend at a public hospital in the town of Nova Igua\u00e7u. If one doctor saw this (in one night) I think it\u2019s unlikely the number for the whole of Brazil is 474. Brazil\u2019s total number of confirmed deaths has now overtaken the WHO\u2019s figure for China as cases accelerate in Latin America\u2019s biggest country. On Tuesday, the Brazilian health ministry reported 474 deaths over the previous 24 hours, taking the total to 5,017 \u2013 more than China, where the virus was first reported and which has seen 4,643 deaths so far, according to the WHO. Brazil now has 71,886 confirmed cases after adding 5,385 in the last 24 hours, though widespread underreporting and a generalised lack of tests means numbers are almost definitely much higher. The G1 news site reported on Tuesday that deaths in S\u00e3o Paulo are 168% more than the official number of 2,049. Films released on streaming platforms only will be eligible for Academy Awards next year because of the pandemic\u2019s disruption to the industry, the organisers of the Oscars have said. The change, announced by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, follows the closure of cinemas across the US. Previously, a movie had to have been screened in a cinema in Los Angeles for at least seven days to be eligible for Oscar consideration. The number of cases in Peru has passed 30,000, with 854 associated deaths, the country\u2019s health ministry has confirmed. Tuesday\u2019s 31,190 confirmed cases represents the second-highest caseload in Latin America. The number has more than doubled in nine days, according to a Reuters tally. Infections have prompted the collapse of some medical facilities, with bodies being kept in hallways, masks being repeatedly reused, and protests breaking out amongst medical workers concerned over their safety. In the UK, leading BAME campaigners have said the credibility of an inquiry into why black, Asian and minority ethnic people are being disproportionately affected by Covid-19 is being undermined among those it seeks to serve by the appointment of Trevor Phillips. The former chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission was selected despite being suspended from the Labour party last month for alleged Islamophobia, including a reference to UK Muslims as being \u201ca nation within a nation\u201d. The first four UK doctors with Covid-19 known to have died were all Muslim. And Labour\u2019s former shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, has said: We need a public inquiry. Very sadly, the public health executive have chosen to make Trevor Phillips one of their advisers on their inquiry, which I think means that their inquiry is dead on arrival. Morocco has insisted that allegations of police brutality in enforcing the lockdown there are unfounded after an official in the office of the UN high commissioner for human eights included it in a list of countries where crackdowns have raised concern. High Commissioner Michelle Bachelet has accused some governments of using emergency powers invoked over the coronavirus \u201cto quash dissent, control the population, and even perpetuate their time in power\u201d. Bachelet did not name any countries. But at a news conference in Geneva, Georgette Gagnon, the director of field operations for the UN high commissioner\u2019s office, included Morocco among 15 countries where police actions in enforcing lockdown measures were deemed most troubling. Morocco\u2019s diplomatic mission in Geneva said measures it has adopted are in line with \u201cthe rule of law in full respect of human rights\u201d. False information on alleged violations shared by some media are unfounded and were not mentioned in any official document of the High Commission for Human Rights. Moroccan police have registered nearly 77,000 violations of lockdown measures and nearly 41,000 people are awaiting trial, a Moroccan source told Reuters. Prosecutors said 5% of them are in detention. Morocco has confirmed 4,252 cases of the coronavirus, including 165 deaths. The US vice-president Mike Pence has been heavily criticised for failing to wear a face mask on a visit to the Mayo Clinic\u2019s facilities in Minnesota. Pence leads the US government\u2019s coronavirus taskforce, though he is typically overshadowed by Donald Trump or medical experts at the regular press briefings. Nearly 70 residents of a single home for military veterans in the US state of Massachusetts have died, local officials have said. While the death toll at the state-run Holyoke Soldiers\u2019 Home continues to climb, federal officials are investigating whether residents were denied proper medical care while the state\u2019s top prosecutor is deciding whether to bring legal action. \u201cIt\u2019s horrific. These guys never had a chance,\u201d said Edward Lapointe, whose father-in-law lives at the home and had a mild case of the virus. According to the Associated Press, officials said 66 residents who tested positive and the cause of another death is unknown. Another 83 residents and 81 staff have tested positive. A state of emergency in the Czech Republic is set to be extended until 17 May after a vote in the lower house of the country\u2019s parliament. The extension is a week shorter than the government sought. The prime minister, Andrej Babi\u0161, had asked for an extension until 25 May to be able to keep restrictions on business in place. The state of emergency was due to expire on 30 April. The government is reluctant to end the emergency early, even though it has already reopened some shops and services over the past week as the pace of new infections has declined. It has announced that it now expects to reopen the economy faster than previously forecast, although not in time for the deadline now set by parliament. Ireland has failed to reach its target to carry out 100,000 tests per week and will not meet it until the week of 18 May, three weeks later than planned, a senior health official has admitted. The ability to quickly test and isolate anyone who catches the virus is a key component in the debate over whether to ease stay-home restrictions now in place until 5 May. Ireland\u2019s chief medical officer, Tony Holohan, set the 100,000 testing capacity target on 17 April and said the health service planned to meet it within 10 days. But Cillian De Gascun, chair of Ireland\u2019s expert advisory group, has said testing capacity has been increased to only 60,000 tests per week. The teenage son of a doctor who died of Covid-19 after warning the UK prime minister Boris Johnson about a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) is still holding out for an apology from the government after personally confronting the health secretary, Matt Hancock. In one of the most symbolic moments yet of the crisis, 18-year-old Intisar Chowdhury picked up the baton from his father Dr Abdul Mabud Chowdhury and asked the health secretary on radio if he regretted not taking more seriously the concerns he had raised in a letter to Downing Street two weeks before his death. The teen\u2019s intervention led to figures from politics and beyond heaping pressure on the government to admit that it had made serious errors in relation to PPE for key workers who have died. They were commemorated on Tuesday in a one-minute silence. After challenging Hancock on LBC radio, Chowdhury told the Guardian: I have faith there will be an apology because I do feel that it has come to a point where we need one. The government are not robots. They are humans and they will understand that. The health secretary would only go so far as to say he was really sorry about his father\u2019s death. I feel that was a blanket statement, that other senior government figures have forbid an apology and that was why Matt Hancock, Priti Patel and others have not given a real apology. Whoever instructed that blanket statement \u2013 and I\u2019m not sure who it was \u2013 was in the wrong because apologies are not an admission of guilt. Apologies are not going to make you liable for litigation and things like that. The purpose of them is to display honesty, integrity and build trust from the public. That is the most important aspect. Dr Chowdhury, a consultant urologist at Homerton hospital in east London, urged the prime minister to ensure every NHS worker was protected in an open letter last month shortly after being taken ill with Covid-19. The United States accounts for about a third of all confirmed cases. The global total stands at 3,083,467, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The US has confirmed 1,002,498. That is far more than any other country. Spain has confirmed 232,128 cases, and Italy has confirmed 201,505 cases. No other country has confirmed more than 200,000 cases. The US has reached the milestone of one million confirmed cases, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The US death toll is now over 57,000 people. Mitsotakis said people will be free to circulate as of next week and will no longer have to give prior notice of their movements. But they will need to wear face masks when travelling in taxis or on public transport, and will not immediately be able to travel around the country. Schools and churches will open in May and hotels, restaurants and tavernas on 1 June. But they too will have to apply austere physical distancing rules when they do. Mitsotakis said: All these things should become second nature, because there is no return to pre-coronavirus reality. Already, we are living differently. The relaxation of measures will be reviewed every 24 hours by the experts who have been advising the government, raising the spectre of the policies being reintroduced if necessary. The Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has announced the relaxation of restrictions enforced almost six weeks ago. In a televised speech from his Megarou Maximou office, Mitsotakis said the containment measures will be reversed, gradually, beginning on Monday 4 May. \u201cOur new slogan will be we stay safe,\u201d he said, insisting that exit from lockdown would unfold according to a finely tuned plan over the course of the next two months. The centre-right government implemented draconian safeguards early on and Greece has had far fewer deaths and infections than most EU member states; suffering 138 and 2,566 respectively. Mitsotakis said: Today, we can say with certainty that the measures we took paid off. The facts cannot be disputed. He said new cases have been virtually eliminated and the number of patients requiring hospitalisation has dropped; as has the number in intensive care. But the Greek leader warned the battle is now on to keep it that way. This is not the end of the ordeal but a continuation. I will say it again: our exit from quarantine will be done step by step. No one can rule out a possible resurgence of the threat. The shadow transport secretary, Labour\u2019s Jim McMahon, has said the news is devastating for BA staff. The government should have stepped in sooner and done more to protect their jobs. The aviation industry is critical to the UK economy but workers should not be being laid off by those at the top who have reaped the rewards from their hard work. It was always clear aviation needed a sector specific deal to alleviate the immediate financial pressures that exist, yet the government failed to act. The government must do more to ensure that airlines and airports have the financial resources needed to operate in a safe environment for staff and customers when the time is right to transition out of the lockdown. British Airways has set out plans to make as many as 12,000 of its staff redundant due to the global collapse in air travel caused by the pandemic. The airline\u2019s chief executive, Alex Cruz, has told BA\u2019s 42,000 staff that the company \u201cmust act decisively now to ensure that British Airways has a strong future\u201d and that more than one in four jobs must be cut. Cruz said BA, which has placed 22,600 people on the UK government\u2019s furlough scheme, \u201ccannot expect the taxpayer to offset salaries indefinitely\u201d. Yesterday, British Airways flew just a handful of aircraft out of Heathrow. On a normal day, we would fly more than 300. What we are facing as an airline, like so many other businesses up and down the country, is that there is no \u2018normal\u2019 any longer. Here are the latest lines in the Guardian\u2019s global coverage of the coronavirus outbreak: The head of Germany\u2019s Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases called on people to stay at home as much as possible as new figures show the country\u2019s infection rate has increased. Vladimir Putin extended a non-working period in Russia until 11 May, as he warned the rate of infection in the country has not yet peaked. The Russian president made the announcement during a meeting with senior officials and regional heads. France began outlining the schedule for the end of the lockdown. The prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe said: \u201cWho could have envisaged a France where schools, universities, cafes, restaurants, the majority of businesses, libraries \u2026 beaches, stadiums \u2026 would be closed?\u201d Philippe also announced an ambition to increase testing to 700,000 a week, including everyone who has been in contact with someone with the virus, whether they are symptomatic or not. The number of confirmed cases in Saudia Arabia passed 20,000 as its health authorities reported 1,266 new infections. The kingdom reported eight deaths, bringing its total death toll to 152. The UK said it would begin including deaths in care homes in its daily reports, as official figures show they account for almost a quarter of the total death toll in England and Wales, with yet more occurring in private homes, hospices or elsewhere. Britain also expanded the list of those eligible for coronavirus tests, with health secretary Matt Hancock saying asymptomatic NHS and care staff, over-65s and those who travel to work will now qualify. He previously promised there would be 100,000 tests per day by the end of April. More than 3 million people around the world have been infected with coronavirus, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, while 212,345 are confirmed to have died. But the figures are likely to represent significant underestimates due to suspected underreporting. Harley-Davidson has reported a 45% drop in quarterly profits, as motorcycle sales are hit by the global coronavirus pandemic. The US manufacturer said Covid-19 had \u201cdramatically changed\u201d its business environment and it would need to make widespread cost cuts. Net income fell to $70m (\u00a356m) in the first three months of the year, from $128m in the same period last year. The Milwaukee-based company said global sales in the first quarter fell 18% to 40,439 motorcycles. Jochen Zeitz, acting president and chief executive of Harley-Davidson, said: Covid-19 has dramatically changed our business environment and it is critical we respond with agility to this new reality. We have determined that we need to make significant changes to the company: to our priorities, to our operating model and to our strategy to drive more consistent performance as we emerge from this crisis. The president of Portugal has announced the country\u2019s state of emergency to tackle the coronavirus pandemic will end at the weekend, AFP reports. Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa said the third 15-day period of the state of emergency will end at midnight on Saturday and \u201cwe hope it will not be necessary to use it again in the future,\u201d the president told the media. But, he warned, a return to normal activity would proceed \u201cin stages\u201d. Sunday will also be a lockdown day, meaning that only essential workers will be able to leave their residence during the coming long weekend, which begins on 1 May. The prime minister, Antonio Costa, is on Thursday due to unveil the areas of activity that can resume from Monday. Next Tuesday, Costa is due to meet the president of the Portuguese Football Federation and the leaders of the country\u2019s three biggest clubs - Benfica, Porto and Sporting Lisbon - to discuss a possible resumption of the league from the start of June at the earliest. It comes as Portugal reported 295 new confirmed cases of coronavirus, bringing the total number in the country to 24,322. There have been 948 deaths from Covid-19, after 20 more were announced on Tuesday. People in Germany have been advised to stay at home as much as possible and continue to apply physical distancing as official data appeared to indicate the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic was once again accelerating, reports Philip Oltermann, the Guardian\u2019s Berlin bureau chief. The basic reproduction number (R), indicating how many new cases one infected person generates on average, has come to be seen as the key indicator over whether restrictions on public life can be loosened after Angela Merkel stressed the importance of keeping the number below one. On Tuesday, the German government\u2019s disease control agency, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), announced the reproduction number for Monday 27 April had risen to 1, after having put it as low as 0.7 in mid-April. Lothar Wieler, the RKI\u2019s president, later specified that the reproduction rate for Monday was 0.96, and therefore technically still below one. Scientists believe the basic reproduction rate of Covid-19, R0, to lie somewhere between 2.4 and 3.3. Without measures taken to curb the spread of the virus, the rate of new infections would grow exponentially, until about 70% of the population has been infected. Wieler appealed to the German public to \u201cpreserve our success\u201d of having prevented health services from being overwhelmed, by continuing to apply physical distancing even though federal authorities have already begun to relax restrictions on social movement. Justin Trudeau has urged caution as Canada\u2019s most populous provinces announce plans to ease their lockdown measures, highlighting the challenge of balancing public health recommendations with a growing pressure to loosen coronavirus restrictions, writes Leyland Cecco in Toronto. Trudeau said on Tuesday: The measures we\u2019ve taken so far are working. In fact, in many parts of the country the curve has flattened. But we\u2019re not out of the woods yet. We\u2019re in the middle of the most serious public health emergency Canada has ever seen and if we lift measures too quickly, we might lose the progress we\u2019ve made. Quebec \u2013 the hardest-hit region in the country with more than 1,600 deaths \u2013 plans to reopen elementary schools and childcare facilities on 11 May. The province has opted to suspend the return of high school until autumn, fearing that 1 million students descending on schools could trigger a second wave of Covid-19 cases. But officials have acknowledged growing concerns the sustained lockdown could have on younger children. \u201cLife must go on,\u201d said the premier, Fran\u00e7ois Legault, adding that parents would not be required to send their children to school and that older teachers with health concerns would be permitted to work from home. On Tuesday afternoon, Quebec is set to announce plans for businesses to reopen. Ontario, in contrast, has taken a far more cautious approach, announcing what the premier, Doug Ford, called a \u201croad map\u201d rather than \u201ccalendar\u201d on Monday. \u201cThe framework is about how we\u2019re reopening \u2013 not when we\u2019re reopening,\u201d said Ford. A riot sparked by coronavirus fears in an overcrowded jail in Lima, Peru, has left nine inmates dead, according to the Peruvian prison service INPE . Prisoners lit fires and broke out of confinement in their wings into communal areas in the Miguel Castro Castro prison early on Monday afternoon, reports Dan Collyns from Lima. Television images showed prisoners holding up banners and signs which read: \u201cWe want to live but outside these walls\u201d and \u201cRight to life\u201d, demanding their release. Others showed inmates on the rooftops of the jail clashing with police officers who responded with teargas and firearms. By the evening, some 200 police officers and 70 soldiers had quelled the riot but questions are being asked about the proportionate use of force after initial reports of three dead prisoners rose to nine. Five police and 60 prison officers were injured in the incident, the authorities said. The prisoners were protesting over the lack of medical attention and personal protective equipment after an inmate was suspected to have died from coronavirus in the notorious jail on the outskirts of Lima. Local media reports claim the violence flared after the body was left in a communal area of the prison, but the head of Peru\u2019s prison service Gerson Villar denies this. Villar told local media that the prison service was investigating the deaths. \u201c[The officers] did not use firearms, they used buckshot shotguns,\u201d he said, insisting that officers were issued with \u201cnon-lethal arms\u201d. Some 631 prisoners were found to be infected with coronavirus after 1,393 rapid tests were conducted in Peru\u2019s jails, Villar added. Throughout Latin America, prisons are notoriously overcrowded and violent, and Peru is no exception. Covid-19 has impacted hard on its prison population of around 97,500. At least 500 inmates were infected with the virus and 13 were reported to have died along with five prison officers, the authorities reported last week. Some human rights groups are calling on the Peruvian government to allow house arrest during the pandemic. Around 3,000 vulnerable inmates were to set be released amid fears about Covid-19 propagation in the country\u2019s jails, the justice ministry announced last week. Peru has confirmed 28,699 cases of coronavirus and 782 deaths, the second-highest total in Latin America after Brazil. The government in Spain on Tuesday announced details of its lockdown strategy, as the country\u2019s daily death toll continued to decline and the rate of contagion fell, Stephen Burgen reports from Barcelona. With 301 deaths recorded over the past 24 hours, compared to 331 yesterday, the number of dead now stands at 23,822 out of a total of 210,000 reported cases. The \u201cplan for a transition to normality\u201d outlined by Pedro S\u00e1nchez, the prime minister, proposes a transition in four phases, each lasting approximately two weeks, without setting a specific date when bars and restaurants can reopen or sporting and other events can resume. It divides the transition into areas of activities including work, personal life, culture, sport, tourism and religion, each of which will be assessed in accordance with progress in the battle against the virus. The easing of the strict lockdown began last Sunday when for the first time in seven weeks children under 12 were allowed out with their parents. This Saturday adults will be allowed out for exercise. S\u00e1nchez said the pandemic had been asymmetrical and this would be reflected in the exit strategy. The majority of cases have been concentrated in cities, Madrid and Barcelona in particular, and restrictions will be loosened sooner in some rural areas and the Canary and Balearic Islands where the pandemic seems to be more under control. Initially some bars and restaurants with outside terraces will be allowed to open 30% of their outdoor tables and hotels will also be permitted to offer 30% of their rooms. Small businesses will be allowed to open under rules of social distancing, but not shopping centres. Cinemas and theatres will reopen, but only at 30% capacity. This will be relaxed gradually towards the end of the year. Freedom of movement will gradually be extended and should return to normal by the end of June, although it\u2019s recommended that people continue to wear masks. Schools will reopen in September. The ministry of health will coordinate the de-escalation of the lockdown which means that normality will return at different speeds in different zones, S\u00e1nchez said. Each area will have to meet certain criteria before advancing to the next phase. \u201cIt depends on all of us,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said. \u201cAny irresponsible behaviour will harm society overall. We have to curb our impatience and allow ourselves to be guided by the experts. Our behaviour can save lives and this is what patriotism means right now.\u201d The UK has recorded 586 new deaths from Covid-19, according to the country\u2019s health secretary, Matt Hancock, bringing the total death toll in British hospitals to 21,678. In the UK government\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing, Hancock said that the government will publish daily figures for the number of coronavirus deaths in care homes and in the community. It comes after consistent criticism of the UK\u2019s reporting of Covid-19 deaths, with the government producing daily figures showing just the numbers of deaths in hospitals then comparing them with daily death toll figures from other countries that include deaths in other settings. Hancock said the proportion of coronavirus deaths in care homes is around a sixth of the total, a figure that did not seem in line with the most recent reports from the UK\u2019s Office for National Statistics, which suggested that about 70% were in hospitals, while the rest were in private homes, hospices, or elsewhere. (See this post from our UK coronavirus live blog for more information on that.) Follow our UK blog for live updates on the briefing, and more news from the UK. Who is behind the US protests against coronavirus lockdown? Some experts have warned that the recent anti-quarantine rallies and counter-protests taking place nationwide could cause a surge in coronavirus cases in America. Guardian US writer Adam Gabbatt explains where these protests originated and who is behind them Governments planning to ease coronavirus lockdown restrictions must take action to prevent and control the spread of Covid-19 in workplaces, the International Labour Organisation said on Tuesday. In a statement marking international safety and health at work day, the ILO said authorities needed to seek active involvement from and dialogue with employers and workers to ensure people\u2019s safety at work. Guy Ryder, director general of the ILO, said: The safety and health of our entire workforce is paramount today. In the face of an infectious disease outbreak, how we protect our workers now clearly dictates how safe our communities are, and how resilient our businesses will be, as this pandemic evolves. It is only by implementing occupational safety and health measures that we can protect the lives of workers, their families and the larger communities, ensure work continuity and economic survival. The ILO called for risk control measures to be specifically adapted to the needs of workers on the frontlines of the Covid-19 pandemic, including health workers, nurses, doctors and emergency workers, as well as those in food retail and cleaning services. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization, said: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgent need for strong national programmes to protect the health and safety of health workers, medical professionals, emergency responders, and the many other workers risking their lives on our behalf. On World Day for Safety and Health at Work, I call on all countries to assure well-defined, decent and safe working conditions for all health workers. France has announced a detailed map for a \u201cprogressive and controlled\u201d exit from its strict lockdown from 11 May, even as official figures in Germany showed the Covid-19 infection rate starting to rise again after restrictions there were eased, writes Jon Henley, the Guardian\u2019s European affairs correspondent. The French prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, told parliament the decision to confine the population to their homes six weeks ago had saved 62,000 lives but it was now time to start lifting the lockdown to avoid economic collapse. He said: We are going to have to learn to live with Covid-19, and to protect ourselves from it \u2026 It is a fine line that must be followed. A little too much carelessness, and the epidemic restarts. A little too much caution, and the entire country sinks. France has so far suffered more than 23,000 deaths from the coronavirus, one of the world\u2019s highest death tolls. Philippe warned that since some parts of the country had been hit far harder than others, lockdown measures would be lifted by area, with d\u00e9partements classified as red, orange or green depending on their infection level. And if infection rates did not continue to fall as expected over the coming fortnight, the prime minister said, \u201cwe will not unwind the lockdown on May 11 \u2013 or we will do it more strictly\u201d Governments across Europe are wrestling with the conundrum of how best to lift confinement measures that are exacting a disastrous toll on their economies while avoiding a dangerous second wave of contagion, with Spain also set to announce its exit plan on Tuesday. Deaths from coronavirus in Italy rose by 382 on Tuesday, 49 more than on Monday, bringing the death toll to 27,359, Angela Giuffrida, the Guardian\u2019s Rome correspondent, reports. The number of people currently infected with the virus fell by 608 to 105,205. Italy has recorded 201,505 coronavirus cases to date, including the victims and 68,941 survivors. The World Health Organization warned Tuesday of the impact coronavirus could have in Middle Eastern conflict zones, AFP reports. \u201cThis fight has become even more challenging with the appearance of the virus in countries such as the Syrian Arabic Republic, Libya and Yemen,\u201d said the WHO\u2019s Eastern Mediterranean director Ahmed al-Mandhari. Years of turmoil and conflicts have destroyed healthcare infrastructure in these countries, leaving vulnerable populations prone to infectious diseases as they grapple with limited access to basic medical services, he told an online press conference from Cairo. Another serious challenge in these countries is political fragmentation, which has often hindered information sharing and humanitarian access in these countries, Mandhari added. Yemen, where half of healthcare facilities have been destroyed in a war between local rebels and an international coalition led by Saudi Arabia, has so far declared a single Covid-19 case. Syria, which has experienced a devastating nine-year war, has declared 43 cases. And Libya, which has been gripped by chaos and fighting since the 2011 removal and killing of longtime leader Moamer Kadhafi, has reported 61 cases. Six more people have died from Covid-19 in Serbia, taking its death toll from the coronavirus to 168, the country\u2019s health authorities reported on Tuesday, according to Serbian news site Telegraf. In the past 24 hours, a further 222 confirmed cases of coronavirus were detected, after 5,446 people were tested, making a total of 8,497 infections across Serbia since its outbreak began. Seventy-nine patients are being ventilated in Serbian hospitals. Serbia\u2019s latest figures come as the country eases its lockdown. People in the country were from today allowed out to visit parks and exercise outdoors again, while from from next Monday, 4 May, coffee shops and restaurants will reopen, although social distancing and face masks will be mandatory. (\u201cI don\u2019t know how we can eat with masks on, but i will update you on that one,\u201d Ivana Nikoli\u0107, Telegraf\u2019s world news editor, tells me.) Nursery schools and primary schools for children up to the age of 12 will reopen from 11 May. On 18 May, air traffic will resume. Refugees face worse consequences from the long-term economic disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic than they do from the disease itself, the head of the Red Cross has said. In an address to the African Union\u2019s peace and security council, Peter Maurer, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross said the Covid-19 pandemic came \u201con top of an already devastating humanitarian situation\u201d precipitated by conflicts, climate change and plagues of locusts. He warned that displaced people and refugees already have limited access to basic services, and face difficulties in maintaining basic hygiene and physical distancing measures. In his statement, published online on Tuesday, Maurer said: IDPs will also be disproportionately impacted by the economic repercussions of lockdown measures, given their already precarious circumstances and heavy dependency on external support from host communities and humanitarian actors. It is therefore the ICRC\u2019s view that if Covid-19 containment measures are imposed, authorities need to prepare and/or allow for alternate methods of delivering assistance and providing services to IDPs and host communities, in conditions that protect the health of both IDPs and staff involved. He added: The long-term economic disruption (and resulting social disruption) will be far worse than the health/pandemic itself. We must therefore work very hard collectively and in solidarity to accelerate responses not just in economic terms but also safety nets and given that the economic and social disruption in fragile contexts will be most acute, the international community needs to support the response through dedicated resources to these contexts. Experts have warned that a surge in gun-related Google searches and estimated gun sales in the US during the worst public health emergency in modern history could lead to higher suicide rates, writes Alexandra Villarreal in New York. From early March to mid-April, when the US began to experience the full force of Covid-19, its residents conducted roughly 2.1m Google searches about buying and cleaning guns, according to research conducted by Everytown for Gun Safety and shared exclusively with the Guardian. Those numbers signaled a 158% increase from what would have been expected absent the coronavirus pandemic. Estimated gun sales also soared to 2.58m in March, Small Arms Analytics and Forecasting reported, an 85.3% jump from the same time last year. Sarah Burd-Sharps, director of research at Everytown, said: This unprecedented spike in new guns in people\u2019s homes and this Googling about taking people\u2019s guns out of storage, combined with this drastic increase in unemployment, presents a huge risk for a collateral public health crisis, which is firearm suicide. Vladimir Putin has extended a non-working period in Russia until 11 May, as he warned the rate of infection in the country had not yet peaked, according to Reuters. The Russian president made the announcement during a televised meeting with senior government officials and regional heads. Restrictions were due to be lifted at the end of April, but Putin said the peak of Russia\u2019s coronavirus infections had not yet been reached. He ordered the government to come up with fresh measures aimed at supporting the economy and citizens, and to prepare recommendations on gradually easing the coronavirus lockdown restrictions by 5 May. The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Saudi Arabia has passed 20,000, after the country\u2019s health authorities reported 1,266 new infections on Tuesday. The kingdom also reported eight deaths from Covid-19, bringing its total death toll to 152. UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has said the coronavirus pandemic has exposed how fragile societies are but that if governments work together on common challenges, including global warming, it can be an opportunity to rebuild our world for the better. Speaking at a two-day international meeting on climate change, the United Nations chief said the only effective response to the worldwide health emergency is \u201cbrave, visionary and collaborative leadership\u201d. \u201cThe same leadership is needed to address the looming existential threat of climate disruption,\u201d Guterres said, noting that the past decade was the hottest in history since measurements began. An official in southern Spain has apologised for spraying the local beach with diluted bleach in an attempt to protect residents from Covid-19, writes Ashifa Kassam in Madrid. The picturesque fishing village of Zahara de los Atunes sent tractors equipped with sprayers along part of its beach last week as officials readied for the release of the country\u2019s children after six weeks of confinement. Spain has been among the countries hardest hit by coronavirus, with more than 23,800 deaths. The government imposed lockdown measures in mid-March, and this week the measures were loosened to allow children under the age of 14 daily outings of up to an hour. The decision to disinfect the beach has incensed environmentalists. \u201cIt\u2019s totally absurd,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Dolores Iglesias Ben\u00edtez. \u201cThe beach is a living ecosystem. And when you spray it down with bleach, you\u2019re killing everything you come across.\u201d With Europe and the US still the hotspots for the coronavirus pandemic, the response to the outbreak has so far focused primarily on its impact on the developed world, while poorer countries have to an extent been overlooked. An editorial in the medical journal the Lancet challenges this outlook. Headlined \u201cDecolonising Covid-19\u201d, it argues that even before the health impact of the pandemic has been felt in the developing world, it\u2019s economic impact is proving hugely damaging. UNDP has estimated income losses of US$220 billion in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) and that nearly half of all jobs in Africa could be lost. This, combined with the potential health impact, could be catastrophic. A Comment published in The Lancet Global Health in April found that a rapid acceleration in the number of cases in west Africa, as has been seen in Europe, could quickly overwhelm vulnerable health systems that typically have fewer than five hospital beds per 10,000 population. There is a risk, the Lancet says, that attempts to tackle the pandemic by richer nations could leave the developing world \u201cin the dark\u201d, whilst, at the same time, expertise developed in Africa from dealing with, for example, the Ebola epidemics, is not being respected. And, it adds, \u201ca sinister undercurrent has re-emerged\u201d as teams around the world race to develop treatments and vaccines for Covid-19. At the beginning of April, two French doctors sparked an intense backlash over comments made during a live television discussion about Covid-19 trials in Europe and Australia by saying that the studies should be done in Africa first \u201cwhere there are no masks, no treatments, no resuscitation\u201d, reasoning that certain studies on AIDS had been carried out in prostitutes \u201cbecause we know that they are highly exposed and that they do not protect themselves\u201d. Africa is a continent where the legacy of colonialism is particularly heavy. It is shocking to hear these remarks from scientists in the 21st century, at a time when the work of epidemiologists, infectious disease modellers, public health specialists and, indeed, all health workers, is in the public spotlight like never before. At the WHO press briefing on April 6, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus responded plainly, \u201cTo be honest, I was so appalled, and it was at a time when I said we needed solidarity. These kinds of racist remarks will not help. It goes against solidarity. Africa cannot and will not be a testing ground for any vaccine \u2026 The hangover from a colonial mentality has to stop.\u201d Read the rest of the article here.

With crucial protective gear in short supply, federal authorities in the US are saying health workers can wear lower-grade surgical masks while treating Covid-19 patients \u2013 but growing evidence suggests the practice is putting workers in jeopardy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently said surgical masks are \u201can acceptable alternative\u201d to highly protective N95 respirators unless workers are performing intubations or other procedures on patients with Covid-19 that could unleash high volumes of virus particles. But scholars, not-for-profit leaders and former regulators in the specialized field of occupational safety say relying on surgical masks \u2013 which are considerably less protective than N95 respirators \u2013 is almost certainly fueling illness among frontline health workers, who probably make up about 11% of all known Covid-19 cases.

The government will use more than \u20ac500m to protect jobs, almost \u20ac250m to fund healthcare and \u20ac330m to help small businesses, deputy prime minister Veronika Remisova said at a televised press conference. The European commission allowed a more flexible use of the unspent EU funds earlier this month. Here\u2019s our news story on the apparent end of the French domestic football season, after the prime minister said there could be no play, even behind closed doors, until September. It is not yet known whether there will be a champion \u2013 Paris Saint-Germain were 12 points clear at the top when the last games were played \u2013 or relegation. NHS England has announced 546 more deaths of patients who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 19,295. The full details are here (pdf). Of the 546 new deaths announced today: 93 occurred on 27 April 213 occurred on 26 April 79 occurred on 25 April Back to France, where \u00c9douard Philippe has announced an ambition to increase testing to 700,000 a week, including everyone who has been in contact with someone with the virus, whether they are symptomatic or not. \u201cIsolation is not a punishment or sanction, it is a measure of collective protection,\u201d he said, appealing to the \u201ccivic behaviour\u201d of everyone to isolate for 14 days if they test positive for the virus. He announced that nurseries and primary schools will reopen on 12 May, with no more than 10 children in a nursery group and 15 per school class. A limited reopening of secondary schools will begin on 18 May. South Africa and Nigeria - the two biggest economies in sub-Saharan Africa - will ease their lockdowns over the next days despite the continuing spread of Covid-19 on the continent. There are now around 32,000 confirmed cases of the virus and 1,400 deaths reported in Africa, though limited testing means this is likely to be a significant underestimate. But the social and economic pain inflicted by lockdowns, especially in poor, crowded neighbourhoods, is severe, and there have been growing if sporadic protests in many countries. More than 25 million residents in Abuja, Lagos and neighbouring Ogun state have been under a federal lockdown in Nigeria since 30 March. This will now be eased and new measures introduced. These include a nationwide night-time curfew, mandatory wearing of facemasks and a ban on \u201cnon-essential\u201d travel between different regions. But a new and immediate two-week lockdown will be imposed in northern Nigeria\u2019s largest city Kano after officials said they were probing reports of \u201cmysterious deaths\u201d that doctors say often involve pneumonia. In South Africa, where a strict nationwide lockdown has confined 56 million people to their homes for all but essential journeys since late March, restrictions are being loosened on Friday to allow some people to go back to work in designated industries and basic public transport to function. Schools however remain shut and sales of alcohol banned. South Africa has been lauded for its aggressive effort to root out pockets of infection with screening and testing, as well as its big economic relief package. However there are signs that the lockdown - which has been largely respected - is beginning to fray. In a national address last week, Cyril Ramaphosa described five stages of progressively looser lockdown. But no dates have been given for moving down (or up) the scale beyond May 1st and the shift to phase four, and different phases can be imposed in different parts of the country simultaneously. Strategies have differed across Africa. Kenya has imposed a loose lockdown in the capital Nairobi and port city of Mombasa along with a nationwide curfew. Ghana recently lifted most of the restrictions placed on inhabitants of major cities but has maintained a ban on social events and public gatherings are still banned. So too has the Democratic Republic of Congo, which imposed a loose lockdown on parts of the capital Kinshasa. In Malawi, legal action has blocked attempts by the government to impose a lockdown while in Tanzania, president John Magufuli has been criticised for not imposing one fast enough. Philippe also said there was a risk of France\u2019s economy collapsing if the lockdown was not ended, and that the country\u2019s hospitals had held up well to the challenge posed by the virus. \u201cThe risk of a second wave, which might mean another lockdown, is a risk we have to take seriously,\u201d he said, adding France had to \u201cprotect, test and isolate\u201d. The lockdown would be followed by a monitoring phase, which would continue until 2 June, with regulations differing between regions. \u201cOur national strategy has to be adapted to different circumstances,\u201d Philippe said, adding that he would be meeting local officials on Wednesday and unions on Thursday to discuss the end of lockdown measures. \u201cSo, we have to live with virus, to end the lockdown progressively and adapt to circumstances; these are the three elements of our strategy,\u201d he said. Philippe said the availability of masks had been a subject that angered and upset a lot of French people. \u201cGiving masks to medical workers, necessarily meant depriving others of them,\u201d he said. He said local authorities that bought masks would be reimbursed by the government for half the price, and that there would be enough masks in the country for the general public by 11 May, the day the lockdown ends, but said it would be some time for masks to be freely and widely available in shops. The French prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, has begun outlining the schedule for the end of the coronavirus lockdown in France to MPs in the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale. Philippe began saying the situation was unique. \u201cWho could have envisaged a France where schools, universities, caf\u00e9s, restaurants, the majority of businesses, libraries \u2026 beaches, stadia \u2026 would be closed. We have never known this situation in our country. Not during the war, not during the occupation, not during previous epidemics,\u201d he said. \u201cThe country cannot be locked down for a long time \u2026 it is efficient against the virus, to stop its spread and the saturation of our hospitals and protect vulnerable people.\u201d \u201cAn instrument is only useful if in the long term the positive effects are greater than the negative \u2026 We have to proceed to a progressive end of lockdown.\u201d Philippe said he would outline the \u201cnational strategy\u201d to end the lockdown. In medical terms \u201cwe have to learn to live with the virus \u2026no vaccine will be available in the short term, there is no treatment and we don\u2019t have what they call herd immunity\u201d. Philippe said it was implausible to think the virus would just \u201cdisappear of it\u2019s own accord\u201d. He also announced that there will be no League 1 or 2 football matches before August. New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, has said he wishes he had \u201cblown the bugle\u201d about Covid-19 earlier. According to figures from Johns Hopkins University, New York state has confirmed more than 290,000 coronavirus cases and approaching 23,000 deaths. Countries such as France, Italy and Spain have recorded more deaths but not by much, and New York City alone has the fifth-highest death total in the world, with the UK in fourth. Speaking to Axios on HBO, Cuomo discussed US reactions to the first news of the outbreak, from China in December. \u201cWhen we heard in December that China had a virus problem,\u201d he said, \u201cand China said basically, \u2018It was under control, don\u2019t worry,\u2019 we should\u2019ve worried. \u201cI wish someone stood up and blew the bugle. And if no one was going to blow the bugle, I would feel much better if I was a bugle blower last December and January \u2026 I would feel better sitting here today saying, \u2018I blew the bugle about Wuhan province in January.\u2019 I can\u2019t say that.\u201d More here: Reuters have posted on Twitter footage of Belgian families visiting care home residents from the relative safety of a window-cleaning crane: The Los Angeles Lakers have repaid a loan of roughly $4.6m from coronavirus business relief funds after learning the program had been depleted. The Lakers applied for the loan under the Small Business Administration\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program, a part of the federal government\u2019s $2.2tn stimulus package. The Lakers\u2019 request was granted in the first round of distribution, but after the fund ran out of money in less than two weeks, the team returned its loan, as did several wealthier business including Shake Shack and AutoNation. More here: Hello, Simon Burnton here, taking over for a bit while Damien has a breather. You can reach me on Twitter at @Simon_Burnton. How much do you know about the coronavirus? For months it has dominated the news agenda, and the national \u2013 nay global \u2013 conversation. But how much have you taken in? Test your knowledge with our coronavirus quiz, compiled by the Guardian\u2019s senior social reporter, Martin Belam, and you may learn something along the way. The president of Kyrgyzstan has extended a coronavirus state of emergency to 10 May, his office said on Tuesday, following similar moves by its Central Asian neighbours, Reuters reports. Kyrgyzstan has confirmed 708 cases of the disease and used the state of emergency to lock down major cities and several provincial districts where outbreaks were registered. No prizes for guessing the volume chosen for May\u2019s Guardian reading group: This month, we\u2019re going to read A Journal of the Plague Year by Daniel Defoe, free to read on Project Gutenberg. This has been a popular request, for obvious reasons. It\u2019s a book that will give us some useful perspective on our current crisis. It\u2019s also been a source of wonder for centuries, with its stories of \u201cthe face of London now indeed strangely altered\u201d, where, over 18 months in 1665 and 1666, the city lost 100,000 people \u2013 nearly a quarter of its population. Zambia reports six new cases of coronavirus, from 80 tests conducted in the past 24 hours. Lithuania\u2019s capital, Vilnius, has announced plans to turn the city into a vast open-air cafe by giving over much of its public space to hard-hit bar and restaurant owners so they can put their tables outdoors and still observe physical distancing rules, writes Jon Henley, the Guardian\u2019s European affairs correspondent. The Baltic state, which has recorded 1,344 cases of the coronavirus and 44 deaths, allowed cafes and restaurants with outdoor seating, hairdressers and almost all shops to begin reopening this week as part of a staged exit from lockdown. But the health ministry has imposed strict physical distancing rules and safety measures. Shops must limit the number of customers at one time, masks will remain mandatory in all public spaces, and cafe and restaurant tables have to be placed at least 2 metres apart. The Netherlands reported 48 more deaths from Covid-19 on Tuesday, its lowest figure in more than a month, bringing its total death toll from the virus to 4,566. A further 171 people tested positive for coronavirus, according to the the latest update from the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), fewer than any single day since 15 March. The economic crisis precipitated by the lockdowns to curb the spread of the coronavirus is beginning to bite across the world. In few places is that more apparent than Spain, where figures show the unemployment rate jumped to 14.4% in the first quarter of 2020. The jobless rate was up from 13.8% in the previous quarter, its lowest level since the third quarter of 2008 but still the highest rate in the eurozone after Greece, AFP reports. \u201cThis rise reflects the effect of Covid-19,\u201d secretary of state for the economy, Ana de la Cueva, told a news conference, adding the rise in joblessness was concentrated in the services sector and among workers with temporary contracts. Spain has been under lockdown since 14 March. The number of jobless rose by 121,000 people to hit 3.31 million at the end of March, according to the statistics office. But the figure may actually be higher since INE said many workers who lost their jobs were classified as \u201cinactive\u201d because the survey carried out to determine the jobless rate was disrupted by the lockdown. The jobless rate also does not include the roughly 3.9 million workers who the government says have been temporarily laid off from their jobs. How big-money measures are helping the economy through coronavirus \u2013 video explainer The global economy is heading for what the International Monetary Fund believes is the worst recession since at least the Great Depression after the Wall Street crash of 1929. This is as a consequence of governments around the world attempting to suppress economic and social activity through lockdown measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The Guardian\u2019s economics correspondent, Richard Partington, explains the unprecedented measures being taken to help protect individuals, households and businesses; how they are helping and the costs they may involve. Police in Ireland have launched a week-long sweep of patrols and checkpoints to deter people from travelling before and during the May bank holiday, writes Rory Carroll, the Guardian\u2019s Dublin correspondent. More than 2,500 garda\u00ed started deploying on Tuesday to enforce restrictions on movement amid growing public restlessness with the lockdown. Operation Fanacht will see patrols and checkpoints along main routes and back roads as well as at tourist locations and beauty spots until 4 May. It is a repeat of the operation that helped keep Ireland locked down during the Easter holiday, said John Twomey, the deputy commissioner. We need this compliance to continue. This is a critical week for the country. If we all work together, we can help save the lives of our family, friends, neighbours and colleagues. Government officials have expressed concern that compliance is fraying in anticipation of restrictions easing next week. Ireland\u2019s infection rate has subsided but delays in testing and contact tracing may push back significant relaxation of the lockdown to late May. Luxembourg has announced an ambitious plan to test its entire population for coronavirus in a month, L\u2019Essential reports. The government of the small, landlocked European country says it will begin the testing programme from 19 May. Claude Meisch, the research minister, said 20,000 tests can be performed every day across 17 stations in the country. Luxembourg has a population of about 600,000 people. It has so far detected 3,729 cases of coronavirus, of whom 88 patients have died and 3,123 have recovered. These are the latest headlines in our global coronavirus news coverage. Austria has announced it will lift its lockdown at the end of April. The country will allow gatherings of up to 10 people, but the health minister, Rudolf Anschober, emphasised the importance of people continuing to follow distancing rules. The German economy is expected to contract 6.6% in 2020 due to coronavirus. According to economic institute Ifo, Europe\u2019s largest economy shrank by 1.9% in the first three months of 2020 and is expecting a 12.2% contraction in the second quarter. The Covid-19 death toll in England and Wales was 52.9% higher than the daily figures. The Office for National Statistics said it had recorded 21,284 fatalities that mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate as of 17 April, compared with 13,917 in the daily hospital death stats published by the government. British energy firm BP recorded a $4.4bn net loss in the first quarter. As the coronavirus pandemic crushes demand for oil, the company\u2019s profits plunged, down from a profit after tax of $2.9bn in the first quarter of 2019. Turkey has sent a planeload of medical equipment to help the US. It has sent hundreds of thousands of masks, along with overalls, disinfectant and goggles to help the US as it grapples with the coronavirus outbreak. Spain\u2019s coronavirus death toll rises to 23,822 but the downward trend continues. There were 301 deaths recorded over the past 24 hours, compared with 331 yesterday and 288 on Monday. The prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, will today outline Spain\u2019s lockdown exit plan. Some children in the UK have died from a rare inflammatory syndrome that could be linked to Covid-19. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said some children without underlying health conditions had died. Italian and British medical experts are investigating a possible link between the coronavirus pandemic and clusters of severe inflammatory disease among infants who are arriving in hospital with high fevers and swollen arteries. The Egyptian president ordered the renewal for three months of a long-running state of emergency, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi cited health as well as security concerns for the extension of the state of emergency, which gives police broad powers of arrest and detention, and curtails constitutional rights such as freedom of speech and assembly. Diplomatic tensions escalated between Australia and China. Australia\u2019s trade minister, Simon Birmingham, called for the Chinese ambassador to explain what Australia called a threat of \u201ceconomic coercion\u201d in response to Canberra\u2019s push for an international inquiry into the source and spread of the coronavirus. The Scandinavian airline, SAS, said it could reduce its workforce by up to 5,000 full-time positions. It said the move was due to plunging demand and travel restrictions during the coronavirus outbreak. The head of Germany\u2019s Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases has called on Germans to stay at home as much as possible after new figures showed the coronavirus infection rate had increased. Lothar Wieler, president of the Robert Koch Institute, said the virus reproduction rate, dubbed \u2018R\u2019, is now at 1.0 in Germany, which means one person with the virus infects one other on average. Earlier this month, the rate was at 0.7. It comes after Germany eased some of its lockdown restrictions last week, allowing retailers with floor space of up to 800 sq metres to reopen, along with car and bicycle dealers, and bookshops. According to Reuters, Wieler told a regular news conference: Against the background of the easing (of restrictions), let\u2019s ensure we can continue to defend this success we have achieved together. We don\u2019t want the number of cases to rise again. Let\u2019s, insofar as is possible, stay at home, let\u2019s stick to the reduced contact. Academics have suggested public life may gradually return to normal if certain conditions are met, including the \u2018R\u2019 rate, stabilising at a low level. The number should stay below one, that is the big goal. The further it is below one, the more secure we can feel, the more leeway we have, but there are other numbers that are also important. The drop in new infections means that officials are now able to carry out contact-tracing again \u2013 something that had been abandoned in March when cases were rising too quickly, AFP reported. By contrast, the mortality rate from the disease has been rising day by day. On Tuesday, it had reached 3.8%, according to RKI figures, which remains well below some neighbouring countries such as France. The United Arab Emirates recorded 541 new coronavirus infections on Tuesday, and seven deaths, as it pushed forward with plans to end its lockdown. Akhtar Mohammad Makoii, who writes for the Guardian from Afghanistan, is using his Twitter feed to post daily reports of the latest coronavirus statistics from across the Middle East. He reports that total infections in the country have now reached 11,380, the death toll now stands at 89. The high number of infections comes at least partly because the UAE has rolled out one of the world\u2019s most comprehensive testing regimes. Authorities say more than 1 million tests have been administered a number expected to rise, the Associated Press reports. Like in Singapore, another small, wealthy nation that relies heavily on migrant labour, many detected cases are among UAE\u2019s population of low-paid labourers. They are particularly vulnerable to infection as they can live with up to 10 people in a single room. The latest from UAE comes as the country is opening up its cavernous malls and restaurants in a gamble to stimulate its economy while still trying to fight off the pandemic. According to AP, that\u2019s led to a new normal of temperature checks, social distancing monitors at supermarkets and marked-off empty seats on the city\u2019s driverless Metro. But crowds already have come to the malls and others are leaving their homes after weeks of a lockdown, eager to party in a city known for its nightlife and increasing the risk of the virus spreading. The death toll in Iran from the coronavirus pandemic rose by 71 in the past 24 hours to 5,877, health ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur said on state TV on Tuesday, according to Reuters. The total number of diagnosed cases in Iran, one of the Middle Eastern countries hit hardest by the virus, has reached 92,584, he said. Iran\u2019s defence minister, Brig Gen Amir Hatami, hailed his country\u2019s response to the outbreak on Tuesday, the Islamic Republic News Agency (Irna) reported. In a visit to a hospital in Tehran, the Iranian capital, he said the country\u2019s medical staff had fought coronavirus \u201cas if they were on the battlefield to combat enemies\u201d, and said it taught the country about how to deal with future threats.

Some children in the UK with no underlying health conditions have died from a rare inflammatory syndrome which researchers believe to be linked to Covid-19, the health secretary Matt Hancock said on Tuesday. Italian and British medical experts are investigating a possible link between the coronavirus pandemic and clusters of severe inflammatory disease among infants who are arriving in hospital with high fevers and swollen arteries. Doctors in northern Italy, one of the world\u2019s hardest-hit areas during the pandemic, have reported extraordinarily large numbers of children under nine years old with severe cases of what appears to be Kawasaki disease, more common in parts of Asia. Hancock told LBC Radio: There are some children who have died who didn\u2019t have underlying health conditions. It\u2019s a new disease that we think may be caused by coronavirus and the Covid-19 virus. We\u2019re not 100% sure because some of the people who got it hadn\u2019t tested positive, so we\u2019re doing a lot of research now but it is something that we\u2019re worried about. Children were until now thought to be much less susceptible than their parents or grandparents to the most deadly complications wrought by the novel coronavirus, though the mysterious inflammatory disease noticed in Britain, Spain and Italy may demand a reassessment. \u201cIt is rare, although it is very significant for those children who do get it, the number of cases is small,\u201d Hancock, one of the ministers leading Britain\u2019s Covid-19 response, said. He did not give an exact figure for the number of deaths. Kawasaki disease, whose cause is unknown, is associated with fever, skin rashes, swelling of glands, and in severe cases, inflammation of arteries of the heart. Turkey has dispatched a planeload of personal protective equipment to support the US as it grapples with the coronavirus outbreak. A Turkish military cargo carrying the medical equipment took off from an airbase near the capital, Ankara, on Tuesday, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported. It was scheduled to land at Andrews Air Force Base near Washington later in the day. A top official said Turkey is donating 500,000 surgical masks, 4,000 overalls, 2,000 litres of disinfectant, 1,500 goggles, 400 N-95 masks and 500 face shields. Turkey has sent similar medical equipment aid to a total of 55 countries including Britain, Italy and Spain in an apparent attempt to improve its global standing by positioning itself as a provider of humanitarian aid in times of crisis. The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday that it is stepping up shipments of diagnostic tests and protective equipment, with a new focus on Latin America where Covid-19 is spreading. Paul Molinaro, chief of WHO operations support and logistics, said global vaccine shipments were disrupted in April and if this continued into May there will be gaps in immunisations, as well as disruption in some food supply chains. Molinaro told a UN virtual news briefing in Geneva: We saw the international air transport system on which we are quite dependent for movement of cargo gradually shut down. So we are at the point now where we need to look for solutions to this. It was \u201calways willing to take more offers\u201d of commercial aircraft. Panama will serve as a hub for regional distribution of personal protective equipment and other supplies in Latin America, he said. The Kremlin said president Vladimir Putin would give a speech about the coronavirus situation in the country later on Tuesday. \u201cPresident Putin has a big speech planned, but I am not going to announce anything, let\u2019s wait until the meeting,\u201d said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. The Czech Republic has reported its lowest daily rise in new coronavirus cases in more than six weeks as it eases out of a lockdown imposed to curb the spread of infection. The number of cases rose by 41 on Monday, bringing the total to 7,449, with 223 deaths. The central European country with a population of 10.7 million has seen far fewer cases than its western European neighbours after taking quick action to close schools and most shops and require face masks in public. The daily increase in new cases has been below 100 since 22 April while businesses have put pressure on the government to lift some of its lockdown measures in place since mid-March. The government is planning a full-reopening of shops and restaurants by 25 May. Restrictions on gatherings have been loosened, with groups of up to 10 now permitted in public, up from a previous limit of two. Czechs are once more allowed to travel abroad but have to present a negative coronavirus test or quarantine when they return. The country\u2019s car manufacturing sector is also starting back up, giving some relief to an economy set to contract sharply this year. Skoda Auto, a unit of Volkswagen and the country\u2019s biggest exporter, returned to work on Monday after a more than five-week outage since major factories idled last month to fight the spread of the virus. The Covid-19 death toll in England and Wales was 52.9% higher than the daily figures for deaths in hospitals released by the government as of 17 April, according to official data that include deaths in the community. The Office for National Statistics said it had recorded 21,284 fatalities that mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate as of 17 April, compared with 13,917 in the daily hospital death stats published by the government. Spain\u2019s coronavirus death toll has risen to 23,822 but the downward trend continues, with 301 deaths recorded over the past 24 hours, compared to 331 yesterday and 288 on Monday. A total of 210,000 cases have been reported since the pandemic began. The prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, will today outline Spain\u2019s lockdown exit plan which has been flagged as being \u201cgradual and asymmetrical\u201d. Salvador Illa, the health minister, has suggested that the easing of lockdown restrictions should be staggered, with different groups of people, such as families with children and the elderly, being allowed out in shifts at different times of day. As of last Sunday, children under 12 were allowed out if accompanied by their parents and from next Saturday people of all ages will be allowed out for exercise, following seven weeks of strict lockdown. Surveys that tracked millions of mobile phones show that the overwhelming majority of Spaniards have adhered to the lockdown, with up to 95% not straying from their neighbourhood. It found that 30 million people had not gone further than 500 metres from their home. Madrid has ruled that masks must be worn on public transport, while in the Basque Country patrols will take the temperature of public transport users. Anyone with a temperature higher than 37 degrees will not be allowed to travel. In the southern region of Andaluc\u00eda, which includes the Costa del Sol and is heavily dependent on tourism, there are plans to reopen hotels in early June. Bars and restaurants will also reopen but restrictive measures will be in place to maintain social distancing. Meanwhile, the Barcelona restaurant association estimated that around a quarter of the city\u2019s 8,300 bars and restaurants won\u2019t survive the current crisis. The association is calling for a freeze on rents until the industry recovers. The Egyptian president, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, on Tuesday ordered the renewal for three months of a long-running state of emergency, citing health as well as security concerns. Egypt has been under a state of emergency since April 2017, when twin church bombings claimed by an Islamic State group affiliate killed dozens of people. The extension comes as the government battles to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic in the Arab world\u2019s most populous country. A presidential decree published in the official gazette overnight said: Given the serious health and security situation \u2026 the state of emergency has been declared across the country for three months starting Tuesday 28 April. The health ministry has so far recorded 4,782 Covid-19 cases in the population of 100 million. Of those, 337 people have died, while 1,236 have recovered. The state of emergency gives police broad powers of arrest and detention, and curtails constitutional rights such as freedom of speech and assembly. Last week, state media reported that parliament had approved amendments to the emergency law expanding the president\u2019s powers to curb the virus\u2019s spread. The amendments grant the president rights to close schools, suspend public sector work, restrict gatherings, quarantine inbound travellers and order private medical facilities to assist with general healthcare. Malaysian health authorities on Tuesday reported 31 new coronavirus cases, raising the cumulative total to 5,851. The health ministry also reported one new death, bringing total fatalities to 100. Australia has asked the Chinese ambassador to explain what it called a threat of \u201ceconomic coercion\u201d in response to Canberra\u2019s push for an international inquiry into the source and spread of the coronavirus. Trade minister Simon Birmingham said Australia was a \u201ccrucial supplier\u201d to China for critical imports like iron ore, and Australia\u2019s resources and energy helped power much of China\u2019s manufacturing growth and construction. Australia\u2019s recent call for an international investigation into the coronavirus pandemic has angered China, its largest trading partner. Cheng Jingye, Beijing\u2019s ambassador to Australia, told a local newspaper on Monday that Chinese consumers could boycott Australian beef, wine, tourism and universities in response. Birmingham said on Tuesday that Cheng had been called by the secretary of the department of foreign affairs and trade to explain his comments. Speaking on ABC radio, Birmingham said: Australia is no more going to change our policy position on major public health issues because of economic coercion, or threats of economic coercion, than we would change our policy position in matters of national security. The Chinese embassy published a summary of the conversation on its website later on Tuesday, which said Cheng had \u201cflatly rejected the concern expressed from the Australian side\u201d. Cheng also said \u201cthe fact cannot be buried that the proposal is a political manoeuvre\u201d, according to the statement, which added that Australia was \u201ccrying up wine and selling vinegar\u201d when it said the proposed review would not target China. China accounts for 26% of Australia\u2019s total trade, worth about A$235bn ($150bn) in 2018-19, and is the biggest single market for Australian exports such as coal, iron ore, wine, beef, tourism and education. In Afghanistan, the president has issued a decree to release thousands of prisoners in a bid to contain the spread of coronavirus in prisons The country\u2019s total number of confirmed cases reached 1,828 amid a continued surge of transmission in Herat, Kabul and Kandahar. Following a decree issued by President Ashraf Ghani on Monday, 12,399 prisoners convicted for different crimes will be pardoned as per certain parameters, Rashid Totakhail, the head of prison affairs said. This is in addition to 10,000 already in the process of being released. \u201cAll of the released prisoners have been directed to stay quarantined at their homes for at least 14 days as a precautionary measure in the wake of the coronavirus,\u201d Totakhail added. Wahidullah Mayar, a health ministry spokesman, said on Tuesday that 125 more patients tested positive for Covid-19 in last 24 hours, taking the total number of infections to 1,828. One patient died overnight bringing the death toll to 58. Most of the new cases were confirmed in the western province of Herat, which borders Iran. Thousands of Afghan migrants poured back from Iran in February and March, and the total number of infections in the province now stands at 444. Mayar said on Monday the next two weeks are \u201cvery critical\u201d and asked the nation to stay at home. But with streets crowded with people and vehicles, experts fear fighting with the virus will be challenging. The United Nations Mission in Afghanistan said on Monday that more than 533 civilians, including 152 children, were killed in the first quarter of 2020. The UN said the new figures \u201chighlight the urgent need for all parties to the conflict to do more to protect civilians from harm, especially in view of the looming threat posed to all Afghans by Covid-19\u201d. The Taliban had already rejected multiple offers to declare a ceasefire and intensified their attacks, as around 100 Afghan security forces and 34 civilians were killed over last week. Singapore\u2019s health ministry has said it is not able to test all migrant workers in dormitories and has been isolating some symptomatic patients first, a method that a government health adviser said was causing a lag in the reporting of cases. The island nation of 5.7 million people has nearly 15,000 confirmed coronavirus infections, one of the highest totals in Asia, largely because of outbreaks in cramped dormitories housing more than 300,000 mostly South Asian workers. The ministry on Tuesday confirmed 528 more coronavirus infections, the smallest daily rise in almost two weeks. Dale Fisher, chair of Singapore\u2019s National Infection Prevention and Control committee, told ChannelNews Asia that authorities had stopped testing some symptomatic patients in hard-hit dorms and that these infections were not being immediately reported in official tallies. \u201cDue to the need to prioritise, we are not able to test all in the dormitories at one go,\u201d the health ministry said in a statement late on Monday following Fisher\u2019s comments. \u201cBut if any worker were to report sick or show ARI (acute respiratory infection) symptoms, we will immediately pull aside and isolate the worker from his room-mates, and ensure that he receives the necessary medical care.\u201d The health ministry did not say whether these isolated workers would eventually be tested, but said only those confirmed with Covid-19 infection would be reported in official daily case numbers. The health ministry did not respond to a request for further comment. Fisher, a senior consultant at Singapore\u2019s National University hospital who chairs an infection control committee commissioned by the government, said this method would cause a lag in the reporting of cases. Singapore said it has been scaling up its testing capacity across the island, including in dormitories, from an average of 2,900 tests a day in early April to more than 8,000. Singapore says it has tested 2,100 people per 100,000, compared with 1,600 per 100,000 in the United States, and 1,000 per 100,000 in Britain. While the coronavirus has been spreading rapidly in the dormitories, many of which the authorities have sealed off, the spread in the community apart from the migrant workers has been much slower, with an average of 20 new cases a day over the past week. Fourteen people have died of the coronavirus in Singapore. The Philippines\u2019 health ministry on Tuesday reported 19 more coronavirus deaths and 181 infections. In a bulletin, the health ministry said total deaths have increased to 530 while confirmed cases have risen to 7,958. But 43 more patients have recovered, bringing total recoveries to 975. France is waiting for the prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe\u2019s, much anticipated address to the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale on Tuesday, detailing how France is going to \u201cdeconfine\u201d on 11 May. The lockdown, in effect since noon on 17 March, has been strict to the point of draconian in France, so the measures \u2013 and details \u2013 are important. The address will cover six areas: Health: Masks: will they be mandatory for going out, if so how will people obtain them? Tests: how many and who Schools: This is a particular worry for parents and a thorny question for the government. How will they reopen safely on 12 May? The country\u2019s scientific committee advising on Covid-19 has suggested schools remain shut until September and described Emmanuel Macron\u2019s announcement that schools will open progressively on 12 May as a \u201cpolitical decision\u201d. Work: Who can return to work and who should remain at home? Business: As above, what companies can reopen and how? Restaurants, caf\u00e9s and bars ordered to close at midnight on 14 March, are anxious this should be as soon as possible, but it certainly won\u2019t be 11 May and Philippe may not give a date. Transport: What obligatory measures will there be ie. will passengers have to wear masks? And where can people go within France and abroad? Public gatherings: What cultural and sporting events will be allowed and how many people in one place? Whatever the prime minister says has already been discussed and agreed with the president. The plan is the result of a fortnight of hasty consultation with French cabinet ministers who were all asked to come up with plans for the end of lockdown in their respective sectors, and the government\u2019s Covid-19 scientific committee. After Philippe speaks, there will be a short debate in the lower house of parliament and a vote. Opposition MPs are demanding they be given 24 hours to consider the end-of-lockdown plan, but the government, which has a large majority, wants the vote this afternoon. The number of new coronavirus cases in Russia climbed on Tuesday to 6,411, a record daily rise, bringing its nationwide tally to 93,558, the country\u2019s coronavirus crisis response centre said. The number of deaths rose by 72, also a daily record, taking the total number of fatalities to 867. The German economic institute, Ifo, on Tuesday said it expected the economy to contract by 6.6% in 2020 year-on-year due to the coronavirus pandemic. It said Europe\u2019s largest economy shrank by 1.9% in the first three months of 2020 and is expecting a 12.2% contraction in the second quarter. A return to the pre-crisis level is expected for the end of 2021, Ifo said. The Scandinavian airline, SAS, said on Tuesday it could reduce its workforce by up to 5,000 full-time positions due to plunging demand and travel restrictions during the coronavirus outbreak. Airlines worldwide are cutting flights and costs due to the pandemic, and SAS said in a statement it expected limited activity during the key summer season. The company said last month that it would temporarily lay off up to 10,000 employees, or 90% of the airline\u2019s total workforce, as the coronavirus brought international travel to a near standstill in March, while domestic travel has also been severely impacted. SAS CEO Rickard Gustafson said demand would probably be substantially lower this year and in 2021, while more normal levels could be reached in 2022. \u201cThat\u2019s the scenario we are working towards, and it\u2019s the best estimate we can give,\u201d he told Reuters. Rival Norwegian Air has warned it could run out of cash by mid-May and last week said 4,700 staff would lose their jobs after four Swedish and Danish units filed for bankruptcy, while US and European staff contracts were cancelled. Norwegian is seeking to convert debt to equity in a bid to qualify for state aid as it seeks to survive the crisis. SAS, part-owned by Sweden and Denmark, added that the potential reduction of the workforce would be split with approximately 1,900 positions in Sweden, 1,300 in Norway and 1,700 in Denmark. A further four residents have died at a care home in Western Sydney after testing positive for Covid-19, taking the total number of coronavirus deaths at the facility to 11 - 12.5% of the country\u2019s total death toll. These latest fatalities take the number of Australia\u2019s coronavirus-related deaths to 88. The outbreak at Anglicare Sydney\u2019s Newmarch House was first reported on 11 April, and \u201cit will be some weeks before the home is clear of the virus\u201d, the care home said in a statement. Another business to be battered by the coronavirus pandemic, HSBC on Tuesday said its first quarter pre-tax profits almost halved. The lender reported pre-tax profits of $3.2bn, down 48% from the same period in 2019, citing credit losses from clients struck by the economic slowdown as a major cause. \u201cThe economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our customers has been the main driver of the change in our financial performance since the turn of the year,\u201d newly confirmed CEO Noel Quinn said in a statement. Reported expected credit losses in the first quarter of the year were $3bn \u2013 $2.4bn more than the first quarter of 2019 and the bank\u2019s biggest bad loan bundle in almost nine years. The Asia-focused lender has embarked on a huge cost-cutting initiative as it battles multiple uncertainties caused by the grinding US-China trade war, Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union and now the pandemic. Earlier this year, it announced plans to slash 35,000 jobs, trimming fat from less profitable divisions, primarily in the US and Europe. British energy giant BP recorded a $4.4bn net loss in the first quarter as the coronavirus pandemic crushes demand for oil. That\u2019s down from a profit after tax of $2.9bn in the first quarter of 2019. Follow in more detail on our business live blog. Scandinavian Airlines (SAS), the flag carrier of Denmark, Norway and Sweden, has laid off 5,000 staff amid the coronavirus crisis, AFP reports. Parents should be vigilant about a severe inflammatory disease among infants that some medics fear may have a link to Covid-19, a junior British interior minister said on Tuesday. \u201cIt demonstrates just how fast moving this virus is and how unprecedented it is in its effect,\u201d Victoria Atkins MP told Sky News. \u201cThe chief medical officer has said that it\u2019s extremely rare but we must all be watching very carefully through this virus,\u201d she said. Italian and British medical experts are investigating a possible link between the coronavirus pandemic and clusters of what appears to be Kawasaki disease, a severe inflammatory disease, among infants who are arriving in hospital with high fevers and swollen arteries. China has criticised as \u201cunfair and irresponsible\u201d India\u2019s decision to stop using Chinese testing kits for Covid-19 because of quality issues, in the latest strain in ties between the countries. The Indian Council of Medical Research, the top agency dealing with the coronavirus outbreak, said on Monday it planned to return kits for antibody tests procured from two Chinese firms because of poor accuracy. The Chinese embassy said it was deeply concerned by the Indian decision and Chinese authorities had validated the equipment produced by the two firms, Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech and Zhuhai Livzon Diagnostics. \u201cIt is unfair and irresponsible for certain individuals to label Chinese products as \u2018faulty\u2019 and look at issues with preemptive prejudice,\u201d embassy spokeswoman Ji Rong said in a statement. The Chinese companies had exported equipment to several countries in Europe, Asia and Latin America without any problem, she said. The diplomatic flap comes days after China criticised an Indian decision to step up scrutiny of investments from neighbouring countries, seen as a move to stave off opportunistic takeovers by Chinese firms during the coronavirus outbreak. India ordered more than half a million Chinese kits for testing for antibodies to the coronavirus this month as a way to boost its screening, among the lowest per capita in the world. The antibody tests taken from blood samples do not always pick up early-stage infections but show whether a person had the virus in the past, even if the person had no symptoms. In comparison, the standard swab test determines whether a person has the virus at that moment by looking for it in secretions. Several Indian states said the Chinese tests had produced conflicting results. Three hundred thousand coronavirus masks sent to pregnant women in Japan as part of a government handout have been found to be faulty, media reports said, the latest in a string of complaints about how the government has dealt with the pandemic. The efforts of prime minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s government to distribute protective cloth masks in its fight against the coronavirus have been marred by complaints about mould, insects and stains in a number of the masks handed out so far. Just days after it began supplying every household with two washable, reusable masks at a total cost of $430m, complaints emerged of soiled or defective products, many of them from pregnant women. By Tuesday, the number of defective masks distributed to pregnant women had risen to 300,000 out of 500,000, public broadcaster NHK reported. The masks are being sent out in order of priority, with pregnant women and care homes for the disabled at the head of the list, though private households in Tokyo are also starting to receive theirs. The health ministry was not immediately available for comment, but the health minister, Katsunobu Kat\u014d, told a Tuesday news conference the safety of all the masks would be verified. General lockdown measures in Austria will expire on 30 April, said the country\u2019s health minister, Rudolf Anschober. He said gatherings of up to 10 people will be allowed, and the main requirement for the public will be to respect distancing rules. Kim Jong-un may have missed a key holiday on 15 April because of concerns over the coronavirus, not because he is ill, South Korea\u2019s minister for North Korean affairs said on Tuesday. The North Korean leader\u2019s absence from public ceremonies on the birth anniversary of his grandfather and founder of the country, Kim Il-sung, was unprecedented, and he has not been seen in public since. That has led to days of speculation over his health. South Korean officials emphasise they have detected no unusual movements in North Korea and have cautioned against reports that Kim may be ill. North Korea has said it has no confirmed cases of the coronavirus, but given the fact that the country has taken stringent steps to head off an outbreak, Kim\u2019s absence from the ceremonies is not particularly unusual, unification minister Kim Yeon-chul, who oversees North Korea engagement, told lawmakers. He said at a parliamentary hearing It is true that he had never missed the anniversary for Kim Il-sung\u2019s birthday since he took power, but many anniversary events including celebrations and a banquet had been cancelled because of coronavirus concerns. He said there were at least two instances since mid-January where Kim Jong-un was out of sight for nearly 20 days. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s particularly unusual given the current (coronavirus) situation.\u201d The US president, Donald Trump, said on Monday he has a good idea how Kim Jong-un is doing and hopes he is fine, but would not elaborate. The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said he was aware of reports on Kim\u2019s health and he was was paying close attention to developments. North Korea had cancelled some large events, and imposed a border lockdown and quarantine measures in an effort to prevent an outbreak of the coronavirus. But if Kim Jong-un is hiding out due to fears surrounding Covid-19, it would \u201cpuncture a hole in the state media narrative of how this crisis has been perfectly managed\u201d, said Chad O\u2019Carroll, CEO of Korea Risk Group, which monitors North Korea. Hello everyone, it\u2019s Jessica Murray here, I\u2019ll be taking you through coronavirus developments across the globe for the next few hours. As always I\u2019m keen to hear your experiences and observations - send them through to jessica.murray@theguardian.com / @journojess_ on Twitter, and I\u2019ll do my best to respond to as many as I can. In the Chinese city of Wuhan, a laboratory has rejected claims it was the origin of the coronavirus pandemic. The head of the lab told Reuters the claims have no basis in fact, adding there were still no conclusive answers as to where the disease started. Conspiracy theorists have claimed Covid-19, now responsible for more than 200,000 deaths worldwide, was synthesised by the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), based in the city where the disease was first identified. Though the scientific consensus is that the coronavirus evolved naturally, such claims have gained traction. The US president, Donald Trump, said on 15 April that his government was investigating whether it had originated in the Wuhan lab. Yuan Zhiming, professor at WIV and the director of its National Biosafety Laboratory, said \u201cmalicious\u201d claims about the lab had been \u201cpulled out of thin air\u201d and contradicted all available evidence. \u201cThe WIV does not have the intention and the ability to design and construct a new coronavirus,\u201d he said in written responses to questions from Reuters. \u201cMoreover, there is no information within the SARS-CoV-2 genome indicating it was manmade.\u201d Some conspiracy theories were fuelled by a widely read scientific paper from the Indian Institute of Technology, since withdrawn, claiming that proteins in the coronavirus shared an \u201cuncanny similarity\u201d with those of HIV. However, most scientists now say Covid-19 originated in wildlife, with bats and pangolins identified as possible host species. \u201cMore than 70% of emerging infectious diseases originated from animals, especially wild animals,\u201d Yuan said. \u201cIn recent years, we have seen increasing risks posed by close contact between humans and wild animals, with global climate change and the continuous expansion of human activities,\u201d he said. All seven known human coronaviruses have origins in bats, mice or domestic animals, scientists say. Yuan also rejected theories that the lab had accidentally released a coronavirus it had harvested from bats for research purposes, saying the lab\u2019s biosecurity procedures were strictly enforced. \u201cHigh-level biosafety labs have sophisticated protective facilities and strict measures to ensure the safety of laboratory staff and protect the environment from contamination,\u201d he said. With that, I\u2019ll hand over to my colleague Jessica Murray. Thanks for following along and stay safe. The Sun has \u201cTurning the tide\u201d alongside \u201cBoris back at last\u201d And the Financial Times has \u201cSunak commits to shield economy from \u2018cold turkey\u2019 jobless surge\u201d, leading on the plan to \u201cwind-down the furlough scheme\u201d. Here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s front page: The Telegraph has \u201cTime to fire up the engines\u201d While The Times has \u201cWe\u2019re moving to the second phase of battle\u201d. And as the UK and Europe wake up, here are some of today\u2019s front pages. The Independent has \u201cJohnson steps back into the office\u201d as well as \u201cOperations cancelled to be restored\u201d The Daily Mail has \u201cDoctors\u2019 PPE desperation\u201d Thailand has reported seven new coronavirus cases and two deaths, bringing the total death toll to 54 and total number of infections to 2,938. 2,652 people have recovered from the disease, the government said. We should add that the Australian app does not track your location, or access your GPS. It exchanges Bluetooth handshakes with other phones with the app if you are near them for 15 minutes. My colleague Josh Taylor has a full explainer here. In Australia, the federal police have been called in to investigate a potential hoax about the country\u2019s new coronavirus tracking app. The Australian government yesterday released its contact tracing app, called Covidsafe, which is based on Singapore\u2019s. However, an image has been circulating on social media that claims to show a text from the app \u2013 telling the user they\u2019ve been detected venturing outside their home and have 15 minutes to provide an excuse. Crucially, it\u2019s not clear if the hoax text has actually been sent as a text to people\u2019s phones, or it is a photoshop. Regardless, Australia\u2019s health minister Greg Hunt said today it had been referred to the Australian Federal Police. \u201cThat investigation has begun, and anybody who is found responsible will be charged with a significant criminal offence,\u201d he said. \u201cTo have a few people, or it may just be one person, who are doing something contrary to the public health messages, this isn\u2019t a game. This is about life and death. This is about saving lives and protecting lives.\u201d \u201cThe more people that are able to download and register, the more people who will be protected against inadvertently contracting a life-threatening disease,\u201d he said. Donald Trump has said the US will conduct \u201cserious investigations\u201d into China\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak and could pursue the country for billions in damages because China \u201ccould have stopped\u201d the coronavirus. He also claimed that he had \u201ca very good idea\u201d about the health of Kim Jong-un, but \u201ccan\u2019t talk about it now\u201d. The president added that he \u201cwishes [the North Korean leader] well\u201d. Trump also said he does not take responsibility for reports that people have may ingested disinfectant after his recent comments on its effectiveness. The head of the Japan Medical Authority said it would be \u201cdifficult\u201d to hold the Olympics, even after it was delayed until 2021, unless a vaccine is developed. New Zealand has partially relaxed restrictions and said that 75% of the economy is now operational as 1 million people return to work and restaurants open for takeaway. More than 2,200 Indonesians may have died from Covid-19, without being recorded in official death totals, according to a Reuters analysis. China has reported six new coronavirus cases and no deaths. Australia\u2019s Bondi Beach has reopened as the state of New South Wales said it would partially ease restrictions by Friday. Germany has recorded 163 new deaths from Covid-19 and 1,144 new infections, according to data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases The total death toll is now at 5,913 and total cases at 156,337. In Nigeria, authorities have denied that Covid-19 is responsible for a surge in deaths from pneumonia. Doctors in Kano in the country\u2019s north-west have reported a rise in fatal cases of pneumonia, but authorities have blaming malaria, meningitis, hypertension and other illnesses. In non-coronavirus news, the Pentagon has released footage of US Navy pilots encountering three unidentified flying objects. The videos were previously leaked, and show encounters from 2004 and 2015. The Pentagon said they released them to \u201cto clear up any misconceptions by the public on whether or not the footage that has been circulating was real or whether or not there is more to the videos\u201d . The video, and a full story is here: The UN\u2019s humanitarian affairs chief has said that the full impact of the pandemic has not yet hit the world\u2019s poorest, but will in the next three to six months. Mark Lowcock said in a video briefing that it would cost $90bn to provide income support, food and health care to 700 million vulnerable people. He said two-thirds of the $90bn could come from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, and the remaining third could be financed by a one-off increase in development assistance. The $90bn would be only 1 percent of the total combined stimulus packages that the world\u2019s 20 richest countries have already put in place. \u201c$90 billion is a lot of money but it is an affordable sum of money\u201d, he said. The South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, has said that the economic impact from the coronavirus will worsen in future, Reuters also reports. That\u2019s after the pandemic already pushed South Korea\u2019s economy in the first quarter into its biggest contraction since 2008. In Hong Kong, leader Carrie Lam has said most civil servants will gradually return to work from May 4, Reuters reports. Hong Kong has reported no new infections for the second day in a row, and Lam said said outdoor sports facilities, libraries and museums would also reopen from Monday although they would still be subject to a ban on gatherings of more than four people. But the government had not yet decided whether to ease travel and social distancing restrictions that are due to expire next week. A key consideration for Lam will also be whether to ease cross-border travel restrictions with mainland China. Hong Kong has confirmed 1,038 cases and four deaths since the outbreak began in January. And here is our piece for Australians in NSW on what the relaxed restrictions (from Friday) will mean: And here is our fuller report on the latest odds of the Tokyo Olympics going ahead On Monday, Tokyo saw the number of daily confirmed cases drop below 100 for two days in a row, with 72 cases reported on Sunday and 39 on Monday, public broadcaster NHK said. The numbers of cases reported at the weekends and on Mondays tend to be lower because some testing facilities are not open throughout the week. Tokyo has reported almost 4,000 infections, by far the highest number among Japan\u2019s 47 prefectures. China has reversed its tighter export controls on testing kits and other medical items, Caixin Global is reporting. For several month Chinese suppliers have been selling equipment to international buyers, or providing to the Chinese government to donate to other countries. After a few incidents of equipment not meeting standards, the Chinese government required Covid-19 test kits to be approved by the National Medical Products Administration and registered before they were exported. Now, according the report, exported products are now only required to meet the receiving country\u2019s product standards. The new rule also applies to medical masks, scrubs, ventilators and infrared thermometers. In early April, China banned the export of equipment which didn\u2019t meet its own standards, by requiring a domestic licence, but some manufacturers reportedly complained this was too difficult. The tight restrictions came after a series of controversial shipments which failed to meet international standards, including more than half a million facemasks which the Netherlands bought, more than 1.2m testing kits the Slovak government bought, and 50,000 which Spain bought. And here\u2019s the video of Trump\u2019s comments from earlier: The head of the Japan Medical Association has added his voice to speculation that the Tokyo Olympics, now due to be held next summer, could again be affected by the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cUnless an effective vaccine is developed I think it will be difficult to hold the Olympics next year,\u201d JMA president Yoshitake Yokokura told reporters in Tokyo on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m not saying at this point that they shouldn\u2019t be held. The outbreak is not only confined to Japan ... it\u2019s a worldwide issue.\u201d Several health experts have cast doubt on plans to hold the Games next July and August. Last week, Kentaro Iwata, a specialist in infectious diseases, said he thought it \u201cunlikely\u201d that the Games would be held just over a year from now. \u201cI am very pessimistic about holding the Olympic Games next summer unless you hold the Olympic Games in a totally different structure such as no audience, or a very limited participation,\u201d he said. Japan\u2019s organisers and the International Olympic Committee [IOC] agreed in March to postpone the Games by a year as the coronavirus spread across the globe. They have since said there is no \u201cPlan B\u2019\u2019 other than working for the Olympics to open on July 23, 2021. But IOC member John Coates, who is overseeing preparations of the Tokyo Olympics, said this month it was still \u201ctoo early to say\u201d if the outbreak could further impact the Games. There are growing fears of coronavirus spreading through Latin America\u2019s crowded prisons after photos were released over the weekend of inmates in El Salvador packed tightly together during a search. Associated Press reported that \u201cauthorities crammed prisoners albeit wearing masks tightly together in prison yards while searching their cell.\u201d This was after president Nayib Bukele ordered the crackdown after more than 20 people were murdered in the country Friday and intelligence suggested the orders came from imprisoned gang leaders. In Chile, the Puente Alto prison in downtown Santiago has more than 300 reported cases among 1,100 inmates. In the Dominican Republic, more than 5,500 inmates were tested at the La Victoria prison, with at least 239 testing positive. New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern is speaking now about the country\u2019s lifting of its most extreme restrictions. Today, 400,000 Kiwis will return to work, and takeaway food services will re-open. But she said that New Zealanders should be more cautious than ever, due to the virus\u2019s incubation period \u201cIt can take from two to 10 days for people to have been exposed to Covid-19 to come down with symptoms. That means we would not smell the smoke for a few weeks and that could put us back where we started before the lockdown. \u201cWith more people going back to work today, we need to be even more vigilant.\u201d \u201cLevel three will see 400,000 more New Zealanders back at work, taking the total to 1 million Kiwis working. At level three, 75% of the economy is working, with building and construction, forestry, manufacturing and contactless retail starting up, major infrastructure projects start again today.\u201d More than 2,200 Indonesians have died from Covid-19, but were not recorded, according to an investigation from Reuters. The official death toll from the virus in the country is 765, but the new figures would make Indonesia the worst-hit Asian country after China. Reuters reporters Tom Allard and Kate Lamb said they reviewed data from 16 of the country\u2019s 34 provinces. The most current data from the 16 provinces shows there were 2,212 deaths of patients under supervision because they have acute coronavirus symptoms. Indonesia\u2019s health ministry uses the acronym PDP to classify these patients when there is no other clinical explanation for their symptoms. The data is collated by provincial agencies daily or weekly from figures supplied by hospitals, clinics and officials overseeing burials. It was obtained by Reuters by checking websites, talking to provincial officials and reviewing World Health Organization (WHO) reports. The 16 provinces account for more than three quarters of the country\u2019s 260 million population. A senior member of the government\u2019s Covid-19 taskforce, Wiku Adisasmito, did not dispute the Reuters findings but declined to comment on the number of coronavirus victims he believed were to be found among the patients classified as PDP. He said many of the 19,897 suspected coronavirus sufferers in Indonesia had not been tested because of long queues of specimens awaiting processing at under-staffed laboratories. Some people had died before their sample was analysed, he said. \u201cI believe the vast majority of PDP deaths were caused by COVID-19,\u201d said Pandu Riono, an epidemiologist at the University of Indonesia, citing their COVID-19 symptoms and that there was no other identified cause of death. In Canada, just under half of people surveyed have said they would \u201chave reservations\u201d about sitting next to an Asian person on a bus, reports The Star. The poll, commissioned after a series of attacks on people of Chinese or Asian appearance, found 20% of Canadians surveyed thought it was \u201cnot safe at all\u201d to sit next to an Asian person on a bus, and an additional 24% were \u201cuncertain\u201d. Taiwan has thanked the US for lobbying for it to be included in the World Health Organization, Reuters reports. In a teleconference, Taiwan\u2019s health minister, Chen Shih-chung, thanked the US secretary of health, Alex Azar \u201cfor the strong support extended by the United States for Taiwan\u2019s participation in the WHO\u201d. Direct, public interactions between ministerial-level officials from Taiwan and the United States are unusual as the two do not have official diplomatic ties/ The United States, like most countries, only has formal relations with Beijing, though it is Taiwan\u2019s strongest backer on the international stage. China has reported 6 new coronavirus cases (3 domestic and 3 from overseas) and no deaths, according to the country\u2019s National Health Commission. That is up from 3 new cases total in mainland China yesterday. Three of the new cases were from Heilongjiang province and three were from returned travellers, according to the department. There were also 40 new asymptomatic cases, where people tested positive but had no symptoms, up from 25 new yesterday. The total number of cases in mainland China now stands at 82,836, and deaths at 4,633. And in New Zealand, the country\u2019s director general of health, Dr Ashley Bloomfield reacted yesterday to Trump\u2019s comments on bleach with nothing but silence. Pime minister Jacinda Ardern said they had not received any reports of Kiwis ingesting bleach, meaning that \u201cno New Zealander has listened to or given any credence to that suggestion.\u201d Argentina hit a new high of confirmed coronavirus cases when it overtook the four thousand mark Monday. With 111 new cases reported, the country\u2019s total reached 4,003 infected persons and 197 deaths so far. The national lockdown, which started 20 March, has been extended until 10 May, although one-hour outings within a five-block radius of homes will be allowed in a large part of the country. The exceptions are the capital city of Buenos Aires, the Greater Buenos Aires area and the main cities of C\u00f3rdoba and Santa Fe, where the majority of Argentina\u2019s population lives and where the largest number of cases are concentrated. The city of Buenos Aires leads with 34% of reported cases and the province of Buenos Aires with 26%. Buenos Aires city authorities say the lockdown in their area will probably remain total until the end of May at least given the continued growth of cases in Argentina\u2019s capital. In his press conference earlier, US president Donald Trump also suggested that he would want to seek damages from China over their handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Trump was asked about a recent German newspaper editorial calling on China to pay Germany $165 billion. Asked if the US would consider doing the same, he said \u201cwe can do something much easier than that.\u201d \u201cGermany is looking at things, we are looking at things,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are talking about a lot more money than Germany\u2019s talking about.\u201d \u201cWe haven\u2019t determined the final amount yet,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s very substantial. \u201cThis is worldwide damage,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is damage to the US, but this is damage to the world.\u201d Some more images of happy beachgoers returning to Bondi Beach in Australia. New Zealand has ended its strictest lockdown phase and entered Level 3, with 400,000 Kiwis returning to work, takeaways open, and fishing, surfing and swimming permitted. Local media reported lines outside McDonald\u2019s drive-through from 3am on Tuesday morning, and by 10am the food app Regulr \u2013 which many local cafes and restaurants are using to allow pick-ups \u2013 had crashed nationwide. Fast-food chains such as Dominos and Hells Pizza have warned customers to expect signficant delays as demand surges, and hired hundreds of extra employees to cope with the rush, and deliver food. NZ Domino\u2019s general manager Cameron Toomey said \u201czero contact delivery\u201d, more frequent hygiene and sanitisation practices, and physical distancing and temperature testing were now underway in all their stores, and essential workers would have priorities for pizza. Australia\u2019s most populous state, New South Wales, has announced it will start easing its lockdown restrictions from Friday. Currently, social visits to friends and family are not allowed, unless you already live in the same house. From Friday, up to two adults will be able to visit another household. \u201cTwo adults will be able to go and visit anybody else in their home on the basis of care, on the basis of reducing social isolation and everybody\u2019s mental health,\u201d the state\u2019s premier, Gladys Berejiklian said. However, people should still practice physical distancing and not visit friends if they were sick or even had \u201cthe mildest sniffle,\u201d she said. Sydney\u2019s iconic Bondi Beach also re-opened today, after weeks of closures due to overcrowding. And seeming to add to his criticism of China, Trump said that the response to coronavirus had led to \u201cso much unnecessary death\u201d. \u201cIt could have been stopped and it could have been stopped [faster] but someone a long time ago decided not to do it that way.\u201d Trump also claimed that he had \u201ca very good idea\u201d about the health of Kim Jong Un and said he wishes him well. The US president was asked if he had any information about the North Korean leader\u2019s health. He said: \u201cI can\u2019t tell you exactly. Yes, I do have a very good idea but I can\u2019t talk about it now. I just wish him well. \u201cI hope he\u2019s fine. I do know how he\u2019s doing relatively speaking. We will see \u2013 you\u2019ll probably be hearing in the not too distant future.\u201d In that latest US briefing, the Trump also announced an 8-part plan for increasing testing. He introduced the chief executive of pharmacy chain CVS Health, who said it would expand testing to 1,000 of its 10,000 stores. Hello and welcome to today\u2019s rolling global coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. It\u2019s Naaman Zhou here, bringing you the latest. Donald Trump has just given a White House briefing after an absence over the weekend, following his controversial remarks on Friday about injecting disinfectant. In a combative briefing, he said he \u201cdoes not\u201d take responsibility for reports that people have may have followed his suggestions which were universally discredited by medical experts. Trump also hit out at China, saying Beijing could have stopped the virus at its source and said his administration was conducting \u201cserious investigations\u201d into what happened: \u201cWe\u2019re doing very serious investigations ... We are not happy with China,\u201d he said. In other news, the World Health Organization\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, says that the agency sounded the highest level of alarm over the novel coronavirus early on, but that not all countries heeded its advice: \u201cThe world should have listened to WHO then, carefully,\u201d he said. Other key developments over the past few hours include: The number of people confirmed to have coronavirus has passed 3 million according to Johns Hopkins University, with 207,583 deaths globally. Switzerland and Nigeria say they will begin easing its restrictions. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said he is concerned about people missing vaccines for diseases such as polio and measles because of the coronavirus pandemic. UK hospital deaths rose by 360, taking the total to 21,902. Mexico\u2019s president declared the country had \u201ctamed\u201d its coronavirus outbreak, despite widespread suspicions that Covid-19 cases are being undercounted. WhatsApp claims to have cut viral messages by 70% after introducing a limit on the number of people to whom users could forward messages. Afghanistan has recorded its biggest one-day rise in cases, triggered by a continued surge of transmission in Kandahar. And Sydney\u2019s Bondi Beach has reopened again, after it was shut for being too crowded.",

By then, the country is likely to have eliminated Covid-19, providing an enormous boost for Jacinda Ardern\u2019s government, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/new-zealand-starts-gradual-exit-from-coronavirus-lockdown\">which is blitzing the immediate health crisis.</a></p> <p>However, at the election New Zealanders will also be evaluating the contrasting left-and rightwing prescriptions for dealing with a severe economic depression. And that could see a fiercely-ideological election debate based around economics and resources.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/why-do-female-leaders-seem-to-be-more-successful-at-managing-the-coronavirus-crisis\">Are female leaders more successful at managing the coronavirus crisis?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Currently, the treasury is forecasting unemployment could go as high as 26%. Regardless of whether this worst-case scenario comes to pass, there will be extreme economic dislocation and suffering. Politicians will need to provide voters with a compelling vision, backed by detailed policies, for rebuilding the country.</p> <p>Recreating the old order won\u2019t be good enough. After all, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/ardern-accused-of-making-new-zealand-businesses-sacrificial-lambs-in-covid-19-lockdown\">the looming depression </a>will come on top of huge pre-existing problems of inequality, poverty, a housing affordability crisis, and a creaking welfare state.</p> <p>If Labour is to embody the spirit of the times, it will embrace radical new economic policies. This means proposing new progressive income taxes, a wealth tax, a universal basic income, a massive state housing programme, and an overhaul of the public health system. And that\u2019s just for starters.</p> <p>If National is to keep to its conservative impulses, then it will campaign on being \u201cbetter economic managers\u201d, cutting regulations, reducing taxes on business, and generally letting the private sector lead the recovery.</p> <p>However, it\u2019s unlikely that a traditional austerity sales pitch will be welcome in 2020. The landscape has changed dramatically, with traditional rightwing economic prescriptions now jettisoned by governments of all colours. Instead of a small state being the answer, the crisis has required huge state intervention. As a number of economists have noted, we\u2019re all socialists now.</p> <p>The state has even bailed out of the most rightwing voice in New Zealand politics \u2013 the Taxpayers Union. For this neoliberal lobby group to apply for, and be given, $60,000 of subsidies in order to keep operating is testament to the fact that the old order of pro-market politics has died.</p> <p>National will have to do better than recycle policies from the neoliberal era. In fact, to be truly competitive it is very likely, come September, they will be proposing their own big-spending statist economic interventions. On issues such as infrastructure, National has the potential to be an even bigger party of government than Labour.</p> <p>Policies such as a universal basic income \u2013 once relegated to the political fringes \u2013 could even be adopted by the right.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/apr/23/covid-19-crisis-reset-economies-sustainable-footing\">The Covid-19 crisis creates a chance to reset economies on a sustainable footing | James Shaw</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For the immediate future, politics is going to be all about economics. In that sense it will mark the return of the traditional left-right politics that dominated the 20th century, before social issues gained the ascendancy. Since the 1960s, politics in countries like New Zealand have become less about economics (or what political scientists call \u201cmaterialist concerns\u201d) and more about post-materialist issues.</p> <p>These non-economic issues \u2013 debates on everything from nuclear weapons, abortion, sexual politics, racism and environmentalism \u2013 never fitted easily into the traditional left-right spectrum.</p> <p>Important debates raised by feminists, M\u0101ori nationalists, the peace movement, environmentalists and so forth also brought into play concepts such as culture wars, political correctness, identity politics, woke politics, and social liberalism. Alongside this, other non-materialist concerns around free speech, immigration, and religion have been central to understanding modern politics.</p> <p>The importance of these strains of contemporary politics wax and wane, and at various times the culture wars have receded. When the global financial crisis hit in 2008, there was a concentration on more basic economic issues. On the left there was a spike of concern about workers\u2019 rights, economic inequality, the welfare state, and so forth.</p> <p>Such concerns underpinned much of the debate in New Zealand\u2019s 2008, 2011 and 2014 elections. Then, with economic prosperity returning, post-materialist concerns came to the fore again. Issues like gender and ethnic inequality dominated, especially on the left. And climate change grew to become an overarching concern.</p> <p>In the wake of Covid-19, post-materialist issues are likely to weaken once again, becoming overshadowed by more basic concerns about putting food on the table.</p> <p>Labour and National, as the original left-right political parties, will be relatively well suited to this re-emerging debate on economic and resource issues.</p> <p>But where will the minor parties fit in? Even before the coronavirus crisis, the minor parties were struggling for relevance. This situation has only been made worse, and some could even be finished off by the return to a more economic focus.</p> <p>The Greens are unlikely to prosper, and may not even survive, as concerns about the environment take a back seat for voters dealing with an economic crisis.</p> <p>The rightwing Act party, which has at times played a central role in the culture wars, especially on free speech issues, will have to reorientate towards its original radical pro-business programme.</p> <p>The M\u0101ori party, currently out of Parliament, will have to prioritise being the voice of M\u0101ori at the bottom of the economic pile.</p> <p>There is still one rising non-economic concern that provides an opportunity for a minor party: nationalism. According to a number of opinion polls we\u2019re experiencing a surge of patriotism. People are celebrating New Zealand\u2019s stand-out success in battling the virus. There\u2019s one party that is uniquely equipped to surf that wave \u2013 Winston Peters\u2019 New Zealand First.</p> <p>Given National has ruled out building a government with Peters\u2019 help, any surge of nationalist support for NZ First will make the re-election of the Labour-led Government much more likely, regardless of what happens in the economic debates.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Bryce Edwards is a senior associate at the Institute for Governance and Policy Studies at Victoria University, Wellington, New Zealand</em></p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "When New Zealand holds its post-virus general election later this year, the country will go through a fiercely ideological debate about economics and resources. On 19 September, New Zealanders are scheduled to go to the polls. By then, the country is likely to have eliminated Covid-19, providing an enormous boost for Jacinda Ardern\u2019s government, which is blitzing the immediate health crisis. However, at the election New Zealanders will also be evaluating the contrasting left-and rightwing prescriptions for dealing with a severe economic depression. And that could see a fiercely-ideological election debate based around economics and resources. Currently, the treasury is forecasting unemployment could go as high as 26%. Regardless of whether this worst-case scenario comes to pass, there will be extreme economic dislocation and suffering. Politicians will need to provide voters with a compelling vision, backed by detailed policies, for rebuilding the country. Recreating the old order won\u2019t be good enough. After all, the looming depression will come on top of huge pre-existing problems of inequality, poverty, a housing affordability crisis, and a creaking welfare state. If Labour is to embody the spirit of the times, it will embrace radical new economic policies. This means proposing new progressive income taxes, a wealth tax, a universal basic income, a massive state housing programme, and an overhaul of the public health system. And that\u2019s just for starters. If National is to keep to its conservative impulses, then it will campaign on being \u201cbetter economic managers\u201d, cutting regulations, reducing taxes on business, and generally letting the private sector lead the recovery. However, it\u2019s unlikely that a traditional austerity sales pitch will be welcome in 2020. The landscape has changed dramatically, with traditional rightwing economic prescriptions now jettisoned by governments of all colours. Instead of a small state being the answer, the crisis has required huge state intervention. As a number of economists have noted, we\u2019re all socialists now. The state has even bailed out of the most rightwing voice in New Zealand politics \u2013 the Taxpayers Union. For this neoliberal lobby group to apply for, and be given, $60,000 of subsidies in order to keep operating is testament to the fact that the old order of pro-market politics has died. National will have to do better than recycle policies from the neoliberal era. In fact, to be truly competitive it is very likely, come September, they will be proposing their own big-spending statist economic interventions. On issues such as infrastructure, National has the potential to be an even bigger party of government than Labour. Policies such as a universal basic income \u2013 once relegated to the political fringes \u2013 could even be adopted by the right. For the immediate future, politics is going to be all about economics. In that sense it will mark the return of the traditional left-right politics that dominated the 20th century, before social issues gained the ascendancy. Since the 1960s, politics in countries like New Zealand have become less about economics (or what political scientists call \u201cmaterialist concerns\u201d) and more about post-materialist issues. These non-economic issues \u2013 debates on everything from nuclear weapons, abortion, sexual politics, racism and environmentalism \u2013 never fitted easily into the traditional left-right spectrum. Important debates raised by feminists, M\u0101ori nationalists, the peace movement, environmentalists and so forth also brought into play concepts such as culture wars, political correctness, identity politics, woke politics, and social liberalism. Alongside this, other non-materialist concerns around free speech, immigration, and religion have been central to understanding modern politics. The importance of these strains of contemporary politics wax and wane, and at various times the culture wars have receded. When the global financial crisis hit in 2008, there was a concentration on more basic economic issues. On the left there was a spike of concern about workers\u2019 rights, economic inequality, the welfare state, and so forth. Such concerns underpinned much of the debate in New Zealand\u2019s 2008, 2011 and 2014 elections. Then, with economic prosperity returning, post-materialist concerns came to the fore again. Issues like gender and ethnic inequality dominated, especially on the left. And climate change grew to become an overarching concern. In the wake of Covid-19, post-materialist issues are likely to weaken once again, becoming overshadowed by more basic concerns about putting food on the table. Labour and National, as the original left-right political parties, will be relatively well suited to this re-emerging debate on economic and resource issues. But where will the minor parties fit in? Even before the coronavirus crisis, the minor parties were struggling for relevance. This situation has only been made worse, and some could even be finished off by the return to a more economic focus. The Greens are unlikely to prosper, and may not even survive, as concerns about the environment take a back seat for voters dealing with an economic crisis. The rightwing Act party, which has at times played a central role in the culture wars, especially on free speech issues, will have to reorientate towards its original radical pro-business programme. The M\u0101ori party, currently out of Parliament, will have to prioritise being the voice of M\u0101ori at the bottom of the economic pile. There is still one rising non-economic concern that provides an opportunity for a minor party: nationalism. According to a number of opinion polls we\u2019re experiencing a surge of patriotism. People are celebrating New Zealand\u2019s stand-out success in battling the virus. There\u2019s one party that is uniquely equipped to surf that wave \u2013 Winston Peters\u2019 New Zealand First. Given National has ruled out building a government with Peters\u2019 help, any surge of nationalist support for NZ First will make the re-election of the Labour-led Government much more likely, regardless of what happens in the economic debates.
