Sydney\u2019s famous Bondi Beach, from Australian Associated Press.</p> \n  <p>The New South Wales government has temporarily closed Bondi Beach as authorities handed lifesavers unprecedented move-on powers amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n  <p>NSW Police David Elliott announced the drastic measure on Saturday afternoon after photos of throngs of beachgoers flocking to the iconic Sydney strip drew swift condemnation.</p> \n  <p>Thousands flocked to Bondi Beach on Friday amid temperatures in the high 30s, ignoring social distancing measures.</p> \n  <p>Pictures of big crowds were criticised by foreign media and on social media.</p> \n  <p>The decision comes as the number of coronavirus cases in NSW ballooned to 436 after 83 new cases were identified in the state.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a significant level of disappointment that we have to move today to not only remove people from Bondi Beach and it\u2019s a significant opportunity to remind people that the Health Act must be complied with,\u201d Mr Elliott said.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cWhat we saw this morning at Bondi Beach was the most irresponsible behaviour of individuals that we\u2019ve seen so far.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe cannot have an area where more than 500 people are gathered.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Under regulations introduced to control the spread of the deadly virus, outdoor gatherings of 500 people or more have been banned.</p> \n  <p>As part of that, lifesavers will have the power to close beaches and ask people to move on if a crowd of 500 or more is gathered at the same spot.</p> \n  <p>The minister said that if the crowd does not comply, NSW Police will have the powers to make people leave.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThis is not something we\u2019re doing because we\u2019re the fun police, this is not something that the government is doing because we want to make life easy, this is about saving lives,\u201d Mr Elliott said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cTomorrow in NSW we will probably crack 500 cases of coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIf the community does not comply with the regulations and the health warnings, this is going to become the new norm.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe are going to close down the type of activities we\u2019ve grown to love.\u201d</p> \n  <p>It came as Waverley mayor Paula Masselos on Saturday issued a public plea for people to stay away from Bondi amid the coronavirus pandemic and away from beaches.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cThe public must at all times keep a minimum safe distance from each other in public places and if you don\u2019t need to be out in public, please consider staying at home,\u201d Mr Masselos said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe all have a role to play in preventing the spread of COVID-19 and I am frustrated that people continue to ignore health advice about social distancing as observed yesterday at Bondi Beach.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt also hit out at people who flouted social distancing advice and risked spreading the virus.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cWhat happened in Bondi was unacceptable and the local council must take steps to stop that occurring,\u201d Mr Hunt said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cEach of us as individuals, as families, as groups, as councils, as state governments, as a national government has responsibility.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWhere something like this is occurring the local council must step in and that message is

second-highest number of daily positive diagnoses this week</strong>, following 152 identified on Wednesday, according to the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).<br><br>The pace of daily new infections had shown signs of slowing since the second week of this month after health authorities finished testing 210,000 followers of a secretive church that was at the centre of the country\u2019s outbreak.<br><br>Just over 100 of the new daily cases were from Daegu, the southeastern city where the church is located, and nearby North Gyeongsang province. The two locations account for about 60% of all of South Korea\u2019s Covid-19 infections. <br><br>There is concern, however, over a rise in infections in Seoul and among people arriving from overseas, Yonhap news agency said.<br><br>Seoul reported 15 additional cases and nearby Gyeonggi Province 12, while the number among people arriving in the country rose by six to 23.<br><br>In response, South Korea will require all arrivals from European countries to get tested for the virus and self-isolate for two weeks starting Sunday, Yonhap said, adding that temporary shelters had been set up to accommodate up to 1,000 European travelers while they wait for their test results.<br><br>South Korean health authorities have won praise for their mass testing regime, which has enabled them to quickly identify infection clusters. The number of people being checked for the virus and under quarantine came to 15,704 as of Friday, the KCDC said. The country has tested a total of 327,509 suspected cases, with 303,006 coming back negative.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-21T04:09:15.056Z\">at 4.09am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e758eb78f08dcc95cc2076e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-21T03:58:45.534Z\">3.58am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>People living in poorer areas of the Philippine capital, Manila, have begun building makeshift barricades to halt movement along the tight alleyways of their neighbourhoods, as this image, taken by Ezra Acayan for Getty Images shows.</p> \n  <p>The Philippine island of Luzon, which includes Manila, has been on lockdown since Monday.

He said people had to be more responsible and said the government was considering localised suburban lockdowns. What that means is, what may be necessary in a part of Sydney may not be necessary at all in rural NSW or in Perth or other parts of the country but please be assured that what we are working on is to ensure there is a consistent, as far as possible, set of measures and tools that state premiers and chief ministers can use to apply in each of the cases so if you see it happening in one part of the country, that does not necessarily mean it has to apply in your part of the country. There are parts of the country, particularly in Sydney, where these outbreaks have been more severe and I know the Premier of NSW has been focusing on these very, very keenly, particularly over the course of recent days as we have seen the increase of the number of cases in NSW. The Australian government is banning all non-essential domestic travel as it unveils a A$66bn stimulus program to deal with the virus impact. It has warned of more draconian measures to come. More in a minute on this but for all the details follow our Australia-focused live blog here: Summary UK military planners drafted in to help feed vulnerable. Key military officials are to help ensure food and medicines reach vulnerable people isolated at home during the coronavirus crisis, as part of a nationwide campaign to protect more than a million people most at risk of being hospitalised. Italian PM orders businesses to close all operations. Italy\u2019s government announced the closure of all \u201cnon-essential production activities\u201d across the country, after the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak rose by 793 to 4,825 on Saturday. \u201cGrocery stores and pharmacies will remain open,\u201d said the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte. \u201cBut all the rest of the non-essential production activities, including plants and offices, will close down.\u201d Former Real Madrid president Lorenzo Sanz dies of Covid-19. The former Real Madrid president Lorenzo Sanz has died of coronavirus aged 76, La Liga announced on Saturday. Sanz, Real\u2019s president from 1995 to 2000, had been admitted to hospital with a fever and tested positive for the virus. Rihanna pledges $5m to curb coronavirus. Rihanna has become the latest celebrity to join the effort to tackle the coronavirus pandemic. The singer\u2019s Clara Lionel Foundation announced on Saturday that it has donated $5million to a number of organisations responding to the outbreak. Bolivian presidential elections postponed amid coronavirus outbreak. Bolivia\u2019s interim government announced on Saturday it would postpone presidential elections originally slated for May 3 and institute a mandatory countrywide quarantine for 14 days as coronavirus spread across the Andean nation. The country\u2019s electoral authority said in a statement it would \u201csuspend the elections calendar\u201d for 14 days to match the quarantine, but did not set a new date for the vote. Britons stranded in Peru could be flown home early next week. Hundreds of Britons stranded in Peru due to the coronavirus pandemic could be flown home early next week, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has said. More than 400 British and Irish citizens are believed to be in the Andean nation and have been unable to leave following a 15-day government lockdown imposed since Monday. First coronavirus cases in Gaza Strip. The first two cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the densely-populated Gaza Strip, Palestinian health officials said. That\u2019s it from me (Aaron Walawalkar), in London, this evening. My colleague Helen Davidson, in Hong Kong, will be taking over. \u2018Disaster waiting to happen\u2019: visitors flock to UK seaside towns A dentist has warned of a \u201cdisaster waiting to happen\u201d as thousands of people flocked to his seaside town in spite of official guidance to stay at home to curb the spread of coronavirus. Hundreds of thousands of people were reported to have visited Skegness, in Lincolnshire, on Saturday, flouting the advice to maintain \u201csocial distancing\u201d. Marc Jones, Lincolnshire\u2019s police and crime commissioner, has called for the town\u2019s caravan sites and arcades to be closed, \u201cand quickly\u201d. In a video that has been viewed almost 25,000 times, Skegness dentist Dr Mitchell Clark also urged local businesses to shutter their shops and called for caravan parks to be closed. \u201cI view these actions as massively, massively socially irresponsible. I personally think that those involved should be ashamed of themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cNow is the time for us all to come together, to stay at home bar essential trips, to look after people and to do the right thing.\u201d Here\u2019s the full story: UK military planners drafted in to help feed vulnerable Key military officials are to help ensure food and medicines reach vulnerable people isolated at home during the coronavirus crisis, as part of a nationwide campaign to protect more than a million people most at risk of being hospitalised. My colleagues Michael Savage and Lisa Bachelor have the full report: Panama\u2019s government has said that two more people have died from coronavirus, bringing the nation\u2019s death toll to three. The first two cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the densely populated Gaza Strip, Palestinian health officials have said. Two Palestinians who had travelled from Pakistan and entered Gaza through Egypt had tested positive for the virus late on Saturday and have been in quarantine in Rafah, a town near the Egyptian border, since their arrival on Thursday, the Gaza health ministry said. Schools, public markets and event halls in Gaza have all been shut over the past two weeks to minimise the risk of coronavirus transmission. The coastal enclave, measuring 375 square kilometres (145 square miles), is home to around two million Palestinians, and poverty and unemployment rates are high. An Israeli-led blockade has put restrictions on the movement of people and goods for years, amid security concerns following the 2007 takeover of Gaza by the Islamist militant group Hamas, three subsequent wars and frequent rounds of violence. Last week Hamas said it would allow only patients requiring urgent medical treatment outside Gaza to cross into Egypt or Israel. According to the Palestinian health ministry, 53 coronavirus cases have been confirmed in the occupied West Bank. \u2018The worst is yet to come\u2019 \u2013 Spanish PM The Spanish government said on Saturday it would do whatever was needed to combat the coronavirus pandemic and warned that \u201cthe worst is yet to come\u201d after the national toll surpassed 1,300 deaths and reached close to 25,000 cases. The second-worst outbreak in Europe showed no sign of slowing as the death toll jumped by more than 300 from the previous day. \u201cWe have yet to receive the impact of the strongest, most damaging wave, which will test our material and moral capacities to the limit, as well as our spirit as a society,\u201d Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez told a news briefing. Sanchez said Spain had not lived through such a dramatic situation since its 1936-39 civil war, in which around half a million people died. Drawing parallels to a war economy, he said his government was working on plans to produce in Spain the equipment needed to battle coronavirus, such as masks. His leftist government a week ago declared a 15-day state of emergency nationwide barring people from all but essential outings. Sanchez praised the \u201cexemplary\u201d response and said he had no plans to strengthen the restrictions, which he called the toughest in Europe. The prime minister also made no mention of extending the state of emergency, though he warned of tough weeks ahead. My colleague Lorenzo Tondo has more on the latest in Italy: Italy\u2019s government has just announced the closure of all \u201cnon-essential production activities\u201d across the country, after the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak rose by 793 to 4,825 on Saturday. \u201cGrocery stores and pharmacies will remain open,\u201d said the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte. \u201cBut all the rest of the non-essential production activities, including plants and offices, will close down. This is Italy\u2019s most difficult challenge after WWII. If we stick together, we\u2019ll get through this.\u201d Rumours of closures of all non-essential commercial activities, including plants and offices, have circulated in the last few days, following complaints by workers who were still having to leave their houses. Several regional governors have already ordered the closure of supermarkets at the weekend. Authorities in northern Italy ordered the deployment of hundreds of soldiers to oversee containment measures in the coronavirus crisis. Italian police have so far pressed charges against more than 60,000 people for violating the lockdown, according to figures from the interior ministry. Prime minister Conte has said that supermarkets, pharmacies, postal and banking services will continue to remain open. Essential public services and transport will also remain in place, he added. Italian prime minister Guiseppe Conte has said businesses should close all operations apart from essential supply chains, according to Reuters. In Argentina\u2019s nationwide lockdown to stop the spread of coronavirus, one magical being has been handed a presidential exemption: the tooth fairy. President Alberto Fernandez earlier this week ordered all but essential workers to stay home and off the streets. But he was forced to amend the list of exceptions after receiving a message from the mother of a seven-year old boy who had recently lost his first tooth. \u201cDear @alferdez, I need to ask if the tooth fairy is among those exempted from quarantine? Joaquin has lost his first tooth and we don\u2019t know if we should leave him a letter (we can\u2019t find the tooth). We don\u2019t want to cause the tooth fairy problems or for the police to detain him.\u201d Fernandez reassured the boy an hour later that the tooth fairy was indeed on the official list of exceptions. \u201c@littlekbz Cecilita! The tooth fairy can leave rewards for fallen teeth because he is not under quarantine. But the rest of us are... Joaquin should leave the tooth beneath his pillow and enjoy the prize,\u201d Fernandez wrote on Twitter. Aside from the tooth fairy, Argentina has also exempted key agricultural and export industry workers from the lockdown, and allows people on the streets to buy groceries and medicine, and for urgent medical needs. The country thus far has confirmed 158 cases of coronavirus and four deaths from the disease. Moroccan airline Royal Air Maroc (RAM) suspended its domestic flights until further notice to fight the coronavirus outbreak, the state news agency said on Saturday. The Kingdom has reported 96 cases of the flu-like disease. Boris Johnson has warned the coronavirus outbreak is \u201caccelerating\u201d, as he urged people not to visit their parents on Mothers\u2019 Day. In stark message to the country, he said the NHS was in danger of being \u201coverwhelmed\u201d in the same way as the Italian healthcare system unless people heeded government advice on \u201csocial distancing\u201d. It came as ministers urged the 1.5 million people in England considered to be most at risk from the disease due to their health conditions to begin \u201cshielding\u201d themselves by staying at home. Letters will go out this week to those concerned, \u201cstrongly advising\u201d them not to go out for at least 12 weeks from Monday. At the same time, the government announced a new local support system to ensure people self-isolating at home without the support of family or friends can get basic groceries delivered. Military planners, already helping councils and local resilience forums in their responses to the outbreak, have been centrally involved in setting up the new network. It follows the dramatic announcement on Friday that all pubs, restaurants, cinemas and theatres are to shut in the latest move to combat the disease. Mr Johnson said that while \u201ceveryone\u2019s strongest instinct\u201d was to visit their mother on Mother\u2019s Day, the best single present they could give her was to stay away and spare her the risk of becoming infected. He added: This time the best thing is to ring her, video call her, Skype her, but to avoid any unnecessary physical contact or proximity And why? Because if your mother is elderly or vulnerable, then I am afraid all the statistics show that she is much more likely to die from coronavirus, or Covid-19. We cannot disguise or sugar coat the threat. The Scottish government has issued a travel warning and criticised the \u201cirresponsible behaviour\u201d of those travelling to the Highlands in a bid to isolate themselves from coronavirus. People with second homes and camper vans have reportedly been travelling to the area in recent days despite warnings to stay at home. The SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, posted on social media saying he had been contacted by the Nevis Range Centre in Fort William who \u201chad to turn away around 30 camper vans\u201d. He added: \u201cI urge everyone to do the right thing; follow the government advice and please do not travel here. \u201cIf these warnings are not heeded and people need to be stopped from travelling, then I am afraid that is what will have to happen. Those in camper vans, please go home.\u201d It comes a day after Scottish finance secretary, Kate Forbes \u2013 MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch \u2013 said the continuing flow of traffic which appears to be \u201cescaping the cities is not helping\u201d. Rural economy and tourism secretary Fergus Ewing is now urging people to stop travelling to the area, and indeed at all, in a bid to avoid the outbreak. Former Real Madrid president Lorenzo Sanz dies of coronavirus The former Real Madrid president Lorenzo Sanz has died of coronavirus aged 76, La Liga has announced. Sanz, Real\u2019s president from 1995 to 2000, had been admitted to hospital with a fever and tested positive for the virus. Here is the full report: Rihanna pledges $5m to curb coronavirus Rihanna has become the latest celebrity to join the effort to tackle the coronavirus pandemic. The singer\u2019s Clara Lionel Foundation announced on Saturday that it has donated $5million to a number of organisations responding to the outbreak. The organisations include Direct Relief, Feeding America, Partners in Health, The World Health Organization\u2019s COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund, the International Rescue Committee. According to a statement, the funds will support: Local food banks serving at-risk communities and the elderly in the United States; Acceleration of testing and care in countries like Haiti and Malawi, as well as the mobilisation of resources and additional capacity and support for Native communities; Protective equipment for frontline health workers and diagnostic labs, the establishment and maintenance of intensive care units, and acceleration of the development of vaccines and other therapies across the globe; Healthcare worker training, virus prevention and containment in countries that will be on the frontlines of the COVID-19 response; and, Distribution of critical respiratory supplies. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday that he was nearing a power-sharing deal with his centrist political rivals, but they swiftly denied it. The goal, according to the veteran conservative leader, was a government empowered to confront the coronavirus crisis and end an unprecedented political deadlock that has seen Israel hold three inconclusive elections in less than a year. He would head the government for 18 months, Netanyahu said, after which former general Benny Gantz would take over. \u201cThe details have all been agreed,\u201d Netanyahu said in an interview to Israel\u2019s Channel 12 News. \u201cI will evacuate (office) on the date we decide, there will be no tricks, no shticks. Millions of citizens are waiting for us to save Israel.\u201d \u201cThis is the last call for unity,\u201d Netanyahu added. Gantz\u2019s Blue and White Party immediately cast doubt on the sincerity of Netanyahu\u2019s offer. \u201cNetanyahu, anyone who wants unity doesn\u2019t impose ultimatums, use partial leaks and most certainly does not hurt democracy or the citizens and does not paralyse parliament,\u201d Gantz said on Twitter. Netanyahu\u2019s critics have accused him of compromising democracy while spearheading the country\u2019s fight against the coronavirus. Last week Netanyahu bypassed parliament and enacted emergency regulations to allow Israel\u2019s security forces to use anti-terrorist cyber-tracking of coronavirus patients in an effort to fight the epidemic\u2019s spread. Netanyahu\u2019s Likud and Blue and White have also been at loggerheads over the formation of legislative committees, including one that would address the phone-tracking issue. At least 883 coronavirus cases and one fatality have so far been confirmed in Israel. Netanyahu tightened a national stay-at-home policy this week which also limits any gatherings to 10 people. Netanyahu floated a proposal on Saturday to have mass blood tests to check people for antibodies of the virus, so that they can go back to work. Coronavirus: how Asian countries acted while the west dithered The first coronavirus cases in Taiwan and Italy came only 10 days apart. On Sunday Taiwan, which has deep cultural and economic ties to China, has recorded just 153 cases and two deaths. Italy has more than 47,000 cases and 4,032 people have died. My colleague Emma Graham-Harrison has the full report: Bolivia\u2019s interim government announced on Saturday it would postpone presidential elections originally slated for May 3 and institute a mandatory countrywide quarantine for 14 days as coronavirus spread across the Andean nation. The country\u2019s electoral authority said in a statement it would \u201csuspend the elections calendar\u201d for 14 days to match the quarantine, but did not set a new date for the vote. The tribunal said it would work together with all of the country\u2019s political parties and organisations to determine when to hold the election. Interim president Jeanine Anez earlier in the day told reporters the quarantine measure would begin Sunday and extend until April 4. Bolivia earlier this week closed its borders and canceled all international flights. Anez said supermarkets, hospitals, banks and pharmacies would continue to operate as normal during the quarantine. The government would provide cash payments to needy families with children beginning in April, she said. Bolivia has confirmed 19 cases of coronavirus. The Costa Rican president Carlos Alvarado has announced that only four new Covid-19 cases have been recorded in the last 24 hours in the Central American country, urging people not to \u201cdrop their guard\u201d. Saturday\u2019s announcement comes during an almost total lockdown across the country following a steady rise in confirmed cases throughout the week and the first deaths from the virus. President Alvarado said the lull in new cases, which centre around the capital San Jose, means measures to control the virus should be intensified and Costa Ricans should stay at home. Costa Rica has the second largest outbreak in Central America with 117 confirmed cases, behind Panama which has 200 after 63 new cases were recorded on Friday. There are concerns that healthcare systems in the region are unprepared to deal with a major outbreak and Central America countries have taken dramatic measures to contain the virus at an early stage. On Sunday, an eight-day curfew will begin in Guatemala as part of efforts to contain the virus after 17 people were infected, President Alejandro Giammattei announced on Saturday. The father of British actress Sophia Myles has died after being treated for coronavirus. Myles, best known for roles in Underworld, Doctor Who and Moonlight, confirmed the news in a tweet on Saturday. The 40-year-old, from London, had posted messages and videos on Twitter updating her followers about her father\u2019s illness and subsequent treatment in hospital. Earlier on Saturday, she shared a photo of her father on a respirator, along with the caption: Yesterday I went on a journey to see my father. This is the harsh reality of the Coronavirus.\u201d And in a video message, she thanked people for their support, saying: I just wanted to send a really short message to say thank you all so, so, so much for all your lovely, lovely tweets to me. Uganda has confirmed its first coronavirus case, the country\u2019s health minister has said. Kuwait has imposed a 12-hour nationwide curfew to fight the coronavirus outbreak, according to the country\u2019s state news agency. Donald Trump has sent a letter to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un as part of efforts to \u201cengage global leaders during the ongoing pandemic,\u201d a senior official in the president\u2019s administration told Reuters. Six footballers \u2013 including the Juventus forward Paulo Dybala \u2013 tested positive for Covid-19 on Saturday. Here is the full report: \u2018We have a responsibility to confront Covid-19\u2019 \u2013 London mayor The responsibility to tackle Covid-19 has fallen to Britain and Europe, with Donald Trump \u201crejecting the traditional leadership role of the US\u201d, the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has said. In a column for the Guardian, Khan urges the UK public to adhere to the expert advice on social distancing and self-isolation. He writes: We have a huge responsibility to look out for the elderly and vulnerable. That means Mother\u2019s Day this year will be like no other. If you know someone who needs help, reach out. Set up a regular call. Ask if you can pick up their shopping and leave it on their doorstep. Please don\u2019t buy any more food than you need. There is no shortage and there will always be enough to go around \u2013 if we only take our share. Read the full article here: Allergy UK, the patient charity for millions of people living with allergic conditions, is urging shoppers who are panic buying to think about those who rely on \u201cfree from\u201d foods. The charity said it is receiving reports that shoppers are stripping \u201cfree from\u201d fixtures bare as they buy up alternatives such as oat milk and gluten-free bread, pasta and biscuits when standard products are sold out. A mother of a young child with an allergy to cow\u2019s milk has told the charity that she could not buy the oat milk her child needed because the shelves had been emptied. Allergy UK said such families did not have the luxury of an alternative; a food allergy means complete avoidance of the allergen and they rely on certain \u201cfree from\u201d products to keep their children safe from reactions that can be serious and even fatal. Carla Jones, chief executive of Allergy UK, said: \u201cOf course we understand how anxious people are in the current circumstances. \u201cWe are all living through unprecedented times with a high degree of uncertainty, but we are asking people to please consider the needs of a large group of people who do not have the luxury of choice.\u201d UK prisons \u2018could see 800 deaths\u2019 from coronavirus without protective measures Failure to protect the most vulnerable inmates in the UK prison system from coronavirus could result in more than 800 deaths, experts have warned. Prisons have been a flashpoint in many countries\u2019 battles against the virus, with several, including Spain, the US and Iran, ordering the release of many inmates to lessen the risk of transmission among detainees and jail staff. My colleagues Mark Townsend and Jamie Doward have the full report: Angola has confirmed its first case of coronavirus, as the outbreak spreads in Africa. Hundreds of UK British nationals stranded in Peru due to the coronavirus pandemic could be flown home early next week, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has said. More than 400 British and Irish citizens are believed to be in the South American country, with some fearing they would be unable to leave following a Government lockdown. But the FCO said on Saturday that Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab had secured permission for a UK-organised flight to leave Peru for \u201cearly next week\u201d following a call with his Peruvian counterpart. In a Twitter post, Mr Raab said: \u201cAmidst all the challenges of tackling Coronavirus, we committed to working together in the coming days to enable UK nationals in Peru and Peruvian nationals in the UK to return home.\u201d The FCO said it would continue to work with the Peruvian government to arrange further flights in coming days. UK nationals in Peru earlier said they felt \u201clet down\u201d by the government\u2019s efforts to help them return home. The coronavirus death toll in Turkey has increased by 12 to 21, the country\u2019s health ministry has said. The UK\u2019s National Trust has announced that it will close its parks and gardens from midnight on Saturday, to help \u201crestrict the spread of the coronavirus\u201d. The decision has been taken ahead of Mother\u2019s Day, which the Trust predicts will attract more people to its parks despite government advice on social distancing. Houses, cafes and shops belonging to the charity were closed earlier this week. But following Boris Johnson\u2019s announcement on Friday that all pubs, clubs and restaurants would be closed, the Trust has ramped up precautions. Director general Hilary McGrady said: Despite our desire to keep our outdoor spaces open, the health and wellbeing of our staff, volunteers and visitors has to be our top priority. Having observed the numbers visiting our properties today, I am no longer convinced we can maintain social distancing over Mother\u2019s Day, when numbers are likely to grow, and beyond. McGrady added that the Trust would be taking measures to ensure that people did not lose their connection with nature, and that sites of natural beauty remained open \u201cvirtually\u201d. Jeremy Corbyn is urging the UK government to go further to ensure the economic security of everyone affected by the coronavirus pandemic. The Labour leader welcomed plans set out by Chancellor Rishi Sunak to underwrite the wages of millions of workers who otherwise stood to be laid off as economic activity dried up. But in a letter to Boris Johnson, he said the government needed to extend that support to cover the five million self-employed. He also called for protection for workers from losing their jobs, more support for renters, improved social security, and an increase in statutory sick pay. Mr Corbyn said Labour would continue to work \u201cconstructively\u201d with the Government and that its proposals were intended to strengthen its response to the crisis. He wrote: We welcome the direction of the Chancellor\u2019s announcements yesterday. But we continue to have concerns that the plans do not provide the economic security that everyone needs to be able to take precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus pandemic. A doctor who spent nine hours moving critically ill Covid-19 patients around London has issued a plea to the British public. Anaesthetic registrar Natalie Silvey posted the image of her face \u2013 reddened after hours spent wearing personal protective equipment \u2013 to Twitter on Saturday. She said: \u201cThose red/purple marks across my face are from my mask and are deeper than you think. Today I have seen just what Covid-19 is doing and now I just want to scream at people to listen to us. \u201cI volunteered to do this. The consultant anaesthetist I was with volunteered. This is bringing out the best of us. Now can the rest of the country please bring out their best and listen! #covid19\u201d Spain could use robots to boost coronavirus testing Spain has said it considering enlisting the help of robots to boost its coronavirus testing as the country\u2019s toll surpassed 1,300 deaths. Europe\u2019s second-worst outbreak showed no sign of improvement as the single-day death toll jumped to 1,326 from 1,002 the day before, according to Health Ministry data released on Saturday. The number of cases rose to 24,926 from 19,980. Last week the government imposed a 15-day state of emergency nationwide \u2013 barring all but essential outings. The government announced on Saturday that testing is set to increase. It has acquired over 640,000 testing devices and said that number could quickly reach a million. Raquel Yotti, director of Carlos III Public Health Institute, said the first devices were being distributed on Saturday and added the government was working on acquiring four robots that could bring the daily number of daily tests to 80,000. That would be up from 15,000-20,000 a day at the moment. Robots are helpful as they can conduct automated testing, she said. Disney+ follows Netflix in downgrading its quality Disney+ has become the latest streaming service to downgrade its quality, just a day ahead of its UK launch on Monday. The Walt Disney Company\u2019s chairman of direct-to-consumer and international, Kevin Mayer, said the decision had been taken in response to a request from the European Commission. Disney+ will be home to films and shows from Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic, as well as Disney, when it launches in the UK on Tuesday. It comes after Netflix said it would temporarily reduce the quality of videos on its platform to ease pressure on internet service providers during the coronavirus outbreak. Mr Mayer said: In line with Disney\u2019s longstanding commitment to act responsibly, we are responding to the request of European Commissioner for Internal Market Thierry Breton to work together to ensure the smooth functioning of the broadband infrastructure. In anticipation of high consumer demand for Disney+, we are proactively instituting measures to lower our overall bandwidth utilisation by at least 25% in all of the markets launching Disney+ on March 24. In the coming days, we will be monitoring internet congestion and working closely with internet service providers to further reduce bitrates as necessary to ensure they are not overwhelmed by consumer demand. We look forward to the launch of Disney+ and hope it will provide a much-needed respite for families in these challenging and trying times. My colleague Helena Smith has the latest from Greece: Greek authorities are increasingly raising the prospect of a curfew being imposed amid reports of citizens failing to adhere to restrictive measures to curb the novel virus. A lockdown that has limited movement and social interaction drastically may not be enough, the government spokesman Stelios Petsas warned tonight. Speaking shortly after the latest rise in coronavirus cases was officially announced \u2013 at 530 confirmed cases, an increase of 35 in the space of 24 hours \u2013 Petsas said officials wouldn\u2019t hesitate, if needed, to apply the measure to ensure that Greece remained \u201con a better path than other European countries.\u201d To date, 13 people, the vast majority men, have died from Covid-19. The government has expressed alarm at the exodus from Athens and other urban centres to villages in the countryside \u2013 seen in the dramatic jump in traffic through toll stations. The sight of packed ferries departing the port of Piraeus en route to islands has also raised concern. \u201cUnfortunately, yesterday, we saw extreme anti-social behaviour,\u201d the spokesman told local TV. \u201cWe are living in an emergency situation and again we appeal to everyone: if they have chosen to leave Athens and other urban centres to go to their villages, they must stay in their homes. They must not come in contact with local communities, they must not transmit the virus to regions that, until now, have had no cases. It would be catastrophic.\u201d While the centre right government had not \u201cuntil now\u201d entertained the notion of total lockdown \u2013 denying people the right to circulate at all \u2013 \u201cif required, we will do that as well,\u201d he said. Police have been arresting those violating measures, On Saturday the Bishop of Kythera, Serafeim, was arrested for conducting a church service on the island despite prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis demanding that all liturgies stop and the government banning gatherings of more than ten people. The average age of those who have tested positive for coronavirus is aged 76 with the vast majority of cases being reported in the Greek capital, professor Sotiris Tsiodras, heath\u2019s ministry spokesman on coronavirus told reporters this evening. Of the total number one hundred have been hospitalised and 18 are in intensive care, although those requiring life support is expected to rise. Greece was among the first EU countries to close schools and restrict movement to contain transmissions. From the outset, officials have voiced fears over the ability of a health system still reeling from years of budget cuts \u2013 the legacy of the country\u2019s long-running debt crisis - to cope with large numbers falling seriously sick. The deputy civil protection minister Nikos Hardalias, who updates reporters alongside Tsiodras, said Greeks should be mindful that, 24 days ago, Italy had the same number of confirmed cases and deaths that Greece has today. Trump dismisses report on early coronavirus warnings as \u2018inaccurate\u2019 Donald Trump has dismissed a report that he ignored early warnings from US intelligence agencies about the threat posed by the coronavirus outbreak in China and repeated recent attacks on the press. My colleague in Washington, David Smith, has the full report on today\u2019s White House briefing: Rainbow paintings are adorning windows across the UK as schools encourage their pupils to spread cheer under the cloud of Covid-19. From North Lanarkshire to Swinton, children have been busy painting pictures after school closures came into effect on Friday. Here is a selection of images shared on Twitter: The Dutch government on Saturday said it would halt all passenger flights from Spain to the Netherlands until at least April 4 in an effort to limit the coronavirus outbreak. The government said it would only make an exception for flights to repatriate Dutch people from Spain and for medical staff. A temporary halt on flights arriving at New York City airports and Philadelphia on Saturday has been lifted. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it issued a ground stop after a trainee at the New York Air Route Traffic Control Center tested positive for Covid-19. That forced the FAA to close some air space sectors and reroute flights. The order cited staffing issues at the New York Air Traffic Control Center before allowing flights to resume. Amazon.com will stop shipping non-essential products to consumers in Italy and France, according to an announcement the company published in Chinese on the WeChat social media platform on Saturday. The world\u2019s largest online retailer said merchants on Amazon were open to sell and ship directly to customers in the region. \u201cEffective immediately, Amazon will stop receiving FBA (fulfilment by Amazon) orders from customers on non-essential products on its Italy (Amazon.it) and France (Amazon.fr) site, so that operations employees can focus on fulfilling and delivering on the orders that consumers need the most now,\u201d Amazon.com said in a statement translated from Chinese. Ireland has reported 102 new cases of coronavirus, bringing the total to 785, the country\u2019s health department has said. In England, poultry producer Bernard Matthews is seeking an extra 200 new staff to fill jobs at its processing plants after demand for its turkey meat products soared by 35% since the outbreak of the coronavirus. The company is hiring temporary staff - predominantly to fill roles in its factories - at its sites in Great Witchingham in Norfolk and Holton in Suffolk - and will extend contracts on a week-by-week basis as needed. HR director Andrew Sherwood said demand for its turkey had soared due to consumers eating more at home as a result of the restrictions on going and dining out, and amid stockpiling of frozen and fresh chicken. \u201cYou don\u2019t need any prior experience in factory work to apply\u201d he said. \u201cWe know there are a lot of people in the hospitality sector who may be looking for a job, and this could provide a stop-gap for them.\u201d Eritrea has confirmed its first coronavirus case, the country\u2019s information minister, Yemane Meskel, said on Saturday. The patient is a traveller who arrived in the country from Norway. He added that the 39-year-old was an Eritrean national with permanent residence in Norway and was undergoing treatment. If you\u2019re only tuning in just now, here\u2019s is a round-up of some of the biggest coronavirus developments as of 6pm on Saturday. I am Aaron Walawalkar \u2013 bringing you the latest updates. If there\u2019s anything I\u2019ve missed, please DM me on Twitter @AaronWala. I\u2019ll try to read everything but due to overwhelming interest I may not be able to reply. The number of people to test positive for coronavirus in the UK as of 9am on Saturday is 5,018, up from 3,983 at 9am on Friday, the Department of Health said. A total of 72,818 people have been tested, with 67,800 negative results. New York\u2019s airspace has been partially closed after a trainee at an air traffic control tower tested positive for coronavirus. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a ground stop for New York airports as it adjusts its staffing to reopen the airspace. The coronavirus death toll in France has jumped by 112 in 24 hours to 562, the health ministry has confirmed. The country now has 14,459 confirmed cases, while 525 people are in intensive care \u2013 half of whom are under 60 years old. The true number of people who are thought to have contracted Covid-19 is estimated at 30,000\u201390,000. My colleague Lorenzo Tondo has the latest from Italy: Italy\u2019s government is evaluating whether to close all \u201cnon-essential\u2019\u2019 offices and plants, after the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak rose by 793 to 4,825 on Saturday. Rumours of closures of all non-essential commercial activities have circulated in the last few days, following complaints by workers who are still forced to leave their houses. Several regional governors have already ordered the closure of supermarkets at the weekend. Mayors and governors throughout the country have been demanding even stricter measures in recent days. Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, is widely expected to respond soon. Authorities in northern Italy ordered the deployment of hundreds of soldiers to oversee containment measures in the coronavirus crisis. The move came after a request from Lombardy\u2019s governor, Attilio Fontana, for the army to help police enforce the lockdown. While millions of Italians have been staying at home since 9 March, a minority of the population have violated rules requiring citizens to venture out only if strictly necessary, such as for work, health-related reasons or grocery shopping. Italian police have so far pressed charges against more than 60,000 people for violating the lockdown, according to figures from the interior ministry. Prince Harry has announced this year\u2019s Invictus games will be postponed until 2021. In a recorded statement posted online, he urged viewers to \u201clook out for each other\u201d. In the UK, supermarket giant Asda is the latest retailer to announce measures to help the most vulnerable, saying it will donate \u00a35m to FareShare and the Trussell Trust to bolster provision at food banks. The chain said the package would help provide over 4m meals to families in poverty impacted by coronavirus, as well as giving more than 3,000 charities and community groups access to free food over the next three months. Asda will also be giving priority to NHS workers in larger stores every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 8am to 9am. Like Tesco, and following government advice on hygiene, Asda is asking that wherever possible customers use card and contactless in order to reduce the volume of cash handled by staff. Writer and comedian Sandi Toksvig has launched a new initiative to help prevent loneliness as people across the UK maintain social distancing in a bid to curb the spread of coronavirus. Man charged with making fake coronavirus treatment kits A man has appeared in court charged with making counterfeit coronavirus treatment kits and sending them across the world, City of London police have said. Officers from the force\u2019s Intellectual Property Crime Unit (PIPCU) arrested Frank Ludlow, 59, of West Sussex, in a post office near his home address on Friday and he appeared at Brighton magistrates court on Saturday charged with one count each of fraud by false representation, possession of articles for use in fraud, and unlawfully manufacturing a medicinal product. He was remanded in custody until April 20. Police said his arrest followed a joint investigation with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the US Food and Drug Administration which was triggered when US customs officers intercepted a package on March 18 containing 60 fake kits labelled as \u201canti-pathogenic treatment\u201d that had been sent from the UK. US vice-president Mike Pence has said he will be tested for coronavirus after his aide tested positive for Covid-19. Pret a Manger closes UK stores High street coffee chain Pret a Manger has just announced that it will be closing all its 400 UK stores from this evening. On Wednesday, it switched to a takeaway model and closed seating areas, later telling staff it was cutting working hours and pay by a quarter as customers followed government advice to stay at home to dampen the spread of coronavirus. In a message to customers today, Pret\u2019s chief executive, Pano Christou, said: My priority is always to protect our teams as much as we can. For this reason, we will be closing all our UK shops temporarily from this evening. We will of course ensure any excess food goes to those who need it most. We look forward to being a part of your daily lives again soon. Until then, stay healthy and look after each other. On the UK\u2019s coronavirus death toll, NHS England said in a statement: A further 53 people, who tested positive for the Coronavirus (Covid-19), have died \u2013 bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in England to 220. Patients were aged between 41 and 94 years old and all had underlying health conditions. The coronavirus death toll in the UK has reached 233 after NHS England said a further 53 people had died in England after testing positive. The death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in Italy rose by 793 to 4,825 on Saturday, officials said. It is the largest daily rise in absolute terms since the contagion emerged a month ago. On Thursday, Italy overtook China as the country to register most deaths from the virus. The total number of cases in Italy rose to 53,578 from a previous 47,021, an increase of 13.9%, the Civil Protection Agency said. The hardest-hit northern region of Lombardy remains in a critical situation, with 3,095 deaths and 25,515 cases. Of those originally infected nationwide, 6,072 had fully recovered on Saturday compared to 5,129 the day before. There were 2,857 people in intensive care against a previous 2,655. President Trump introduces vice-president Mike Pence who has been leading the US\u2019 coronavirus taskforce. \u201cHe has not slept much. Maybe a tiny bit ... maybe a little. But not much,\u201d Trump said. White House press briefing begins Donald Trump has begun providing an update on the coronavirus at a White House press conference. A Guardian correspondent is at the briefing. Follow the latest developments on our US coronavirus blog: Leaders of Jerusalem\u2019s Church of the Holy Sepulchre, revered as the site of Jesus\u2019s crucifixion and burial, urged worshippers on Saturday to maintain social distancing to help fight the coronavirus. Church leaders at the ancient holy site in Jerusalem\u2019s walled Old City called on visitors to \u201cavoid any act of devotion that might include physical contact such as touching and kissing the stones, touching icons, vestments and the personne\u201d. In a statement, the church said worshippers should not enter in groups of more than 10 and maintain a distance of at least 2 metres between each other. \u201cThe Holy Sepulchre is the ultimate place of hope. Hope that faith will defeat doubt, light will defeat darkness and life will triumph over death,\u201d it added. With the usually busy Easter holiday approaching, the coronavirus crisis has led to a sharp decline in the number of visitors to the Holy Land. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is a particular favourite among pilgrims and tourists. Other sacred sites have ordered similar precautions, including the Church of the Annunciation, in Nazareth, and in Bethlehem, revered as Jesus\u2019s birthplace, the Church of the Nativity has shut down entirely. Jerusalem\u2019s Al-Aqsa mosque, Islam\u2019s third holiest site, has limited Friday prayers to the open outdoor areas of the mosque compound \u2013 one of the most sensitive spots in the Middle East \u2013 which Muslims refer to as the Noble Sanctuary and Jews call the Temple Mount. At the Western Wall, the holiest site in Judaism where Jews are allowed to pray, religious authorities have instructed the faithful to refrain from holding mass prayers and from kissing the stones of the ancient wall which abuts the Temple Mount/Noble Sanctuary complex. Israel has reported 883 confirmed cases of coronavirus to date and one death. The Palestinians have confirmed 52 cases in the occupied West Bank and none in the Gaza Strip. Alejandro Giammattei, the president of Guatemala, has ordered an eight-day curfew from Sunday to stem the spread of coronavirus in the Central American country. My colleague Helena Smith has this update on the coronavirus response in Albania: Albania has resorted to deploying the army to enforce a curfew that began at 1pm local time on Saturday \u2013 the country\u2019s latest bid to stem the spread of coronavirus. The measure, set to last 40 hours, was implemented after citizens continued to openly flout orders to stay at home. To date 76 people in the former Stalinist state have contracted the virus. Two deaths have also been recorded. With some 120,000 people having returned from Italy \u2013 like Greece, host to a large Albanian community \u2013 prior to the country cutting air and sea links with its neighbour on 9 March, there are mounting fears over the ability of the nation\u2019s health system to cope in the event of a sudden surge in confirmed coronavirus cases. The prime minister, Edi Rama said authorities wouldn\u2019t hesitate to use force if the curfew was violated. \u201cEveryone will stay inside after 13:00,\u201d he said. \u201cPolice and armed forces will use force against whoever breaks the law, including pensioners, and will use water canons and teargas if need be.\u201d Prior to the lockdown, Albanians had failed to uphold the appeals of authorities to social distance with news agencies in Tirana, the capital, describing joggers going out in groups to exercise, the elderly playing dominoes in the street and people converging on supermarkets with scant attention to those next to them. First coronavirus death in Bosnia A woman has became the first to die of the coronavirus in Bosnia, the manager of a hospital in the north-western town of Biha\u0107 said on Saturday. \u201cThe first victim is an elderly woman who died in the hospital even before her test for coronavirus showed positive. She had a history of chronic diseases,\u201d Hajrudin Havic said. Bosnia has declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus outbreak. It has so far reported 90 infections. Algeria said on Saturday that the number of confirmed coronavirus cases had risen to 139 from 95. The country has stopped international and domestic travel, closed mosques, cafes and restaurants and told half of state employees to stay at home to try to limit the spread of the virus. Turkey imposed a partial curfew on Saturday for citizens over the age of 65 and those with chronic diseases, effective as of midnight, as part of measures against the coronavirus outbreak. Details of the curfew would be announced later, the interior ministry said in a statement. Earlier on Saturday, Turkey suspended flights with 46 more countries and banned picnics and barbecues, after the number of cases roughly doubled every day for a week. A further two people have died in Wales after contracting coronavirus, bringing the total number of deaths there to five, health officials have said. In a statement, Dr Frank Atherton, the chief medical officer for Wales, said: It is with sadness I report that a further two people who tested positive for Covid-19 have died. This takes the number of deaths in Wales to five. I offer my sincere condolences to their families and friends, and ask that their privacy is respected at this sad time. The patients were a 75-year-old, who died at Singleton hospital, and a 98-year-old, who died at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd. Both patients had underlying health conditions. Brazil\u2019s far-right president is facing fierce criticism for what is widely seen as his chaotic and cavalier response to the coronavirus crisis. Despite this, governors of some of Brazil\u2019s key states are taking drastic action amid warnings that the country\u2019s health service could collapse because of coronavirus in the coming weeks. The governor of S\u00e3o Paulo state, Jo\u00e3o Doria, has just announced that it will begin a 15-day quarantine from this Tuesday. \u201cThis will mean the order to close all non-essential commerce and services,\u201d Jo\u00e3o Doria told reporters according to the Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper. S\u00e3o Paulo is Brazil\u2019s most economically important and populous state - home to more than 44 million of the country\u2019s 209 million citizens. Its capital is the megacity of S\u00e3o Paulo with somewhere in the region of 20 million residents. An Irish naval vessel is being transformed into a Covid-19 testing centre. The LE Samuel Beckett is berthed at Sir John Rogerson\u2019s quay on the Liffey River in Dublin city centre. Hundreds of cases of the virus have been recorded in Ireland. Army engineers provided power and lighting for the vessel, while others erected tents along the quayside close to the central bank. It is part of a major effort by the defence forces to support the health service\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic. Canada\u2019s death toll from the coronavirus outbreak has risen to 13 from 12 the previous day, with confirmed cases rising to 1,099, a government official said on Saturday. The government has tested around 83,000 people for Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, the official said. In the past 24 hours the coronavirus death toll in Lombardy, Italy\u2019s worst-affected region, has risen by more than by 546 to 3,095, according to official figures. Good afternoon, it\u2019s Aaron Walawalkar here taking over on the live blog from my colleague Aamna Mohdin. I\u2019ll be bringing you all the latest coronavirus developments. If there\u2019s anything I miss, please message me on Twitter @AaronWala. I\u2019ll try to read everything but may not be able to respond to all messages given the overwhelming interest. There is deep concern among hospitality industry workers on zero-hours contracts who are unable to work now that bars have been closed, a representative of bar workers in the capital has said. Drew Mallins, founder of the London Bartenders\u2019 Association, says measures announced yesterday to ensure 80% of employees\u2019 wages will be paid by the government were welcome but there is still a lack of clarity for those on zero-hours contracts, which is causing anxiety. The Facebook group for the LBA, which has more than 30,000 members, has been awash with worried bar workers over the last two weeks, Mallins said. The association is calling for the government to provide clarity for those not covered by the measures. Mallins has also been working with the Drinks Trust, the UK charity for the drinks industry, which is working to provide mental health resources for workers. \u201cWe think it\u2019s highly likely there will be people in the industry whose mental health problems will be exacerbated by the crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have also got a HR expert on board and they will be answering questions from the membership.\u201d On a positive note, he said some bars are finding ways to continue operating in London by providing food and drink to take away. \u201cLots of bartenders are really creative so they are doing things like bottled cocktails for delivery. There has been a rush to get listed on delivery apps and websites,\u201d he said. More than 500 travellers from the UK and Ireland are stranded in Peru as the window for repatriation closes. In a live TV interview on Friday night on Canal N, the main Peruvian national TV channel, defence minister Walter Martos stated that Peru\u2019s borders would close completely and they will \u201cclose all airports\u201d from Saturday night 21 March. When asked if there will continue to be flights available throughout the state of emergency, Martos\u2019s response caused alarm. He said: No, the day of tomorrow is the last day that we will be giving the facility for the foreigners to leave and for our compatriot Peruvians to return. We had made it flexible due to some problems that Peruvian compatriots in foreign countries had in repatriating themselves. From Sunday, they will close all airports. There are fears this will leave more than 500 UK and Irish nationals stranded throughout Peru in a desperate situation. \u201cThe government squandered their window of opportunity with inaction,\u201d says Anwen Greenaway from Oxford. In a letter to the British embassy in Peru, Fred Fransis, a stranded traveller in Peru, said: \u201cIt seems that a big opportunity has been missed. A week has passed with no solution regarding repatriation while other countries have succeeded. The situation has developed into a crisis. Reports here are that all borders will be strictly closed tomorrow, Sunday, and no more repatriation flights afterwards. There is only one day left for action on your part!\u201d John Lewis will be closing all 50 of its shops temporarily from Monday, the first time in the 155-year history of the business that it will not open its shop doors for customers. The company confirmed it will be closing the shops as a result of the impact of the coronavirus. The online site will continue to operate as normal, alongside Waitrose\u2019s physical and online shops. Chairman Sharon White said: The Partnership has traded for over 155 years, during which time we have faced many difficult periods, including two world wars and the 2008 financial crisis. On every occasion, thanks to our customers and Partners, and the long standing relationships with our suppliers and stakeholders, we have emerged stronger. We all need to continue to support each other and our strength and resilience will be tested. But they will not be broken. The NHS has struck a deal with private hospitals to provide thousands more beds, ventilators and extra healthcare staff from next week to aid in the fight against coronavirus. The extra resources, which include nearly 20,000 staff, will also help the NHS deliver other urgent operations and cancer treatments. The deal with independent hospitals is thought to be the first of its kind and will include the provision of 8,000 hospital beds across England, nearly 1,200 more ventilators, more than 10,000 nurses, over 700 doctors and over 8,000 other clinical staff. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said: This is great news for the hospitals and staff doing everything they can to combat coronavirus. Under the agreement, the independent sector will reallocate almost its entire national hospital capacity to the NHS and will be reimbursed at cost. Sir Simon Stevens, the NHS\u2019s chief executive, hailed the deal with the private sector, saying: We\u2019re dealing with an unprecedented global health threat and are taking immediate and exceptional action to gear up. The NHS is doing everything in its power to expand treatment capacity and is working with partners right across the country to do so. David Hare, the chief executive of the Independent Healthcare Providers Network, said: We have worked hand-in-hand with the NHS for decades and will do whatever it takes to support the NHS in responding to this pandemic. This significant additional capacity across the country will be a major boost to the NHS\u2019s efforts to treat those patients that need hospital care over the coming period and the independent sector stands ready to maintain that support for as long as needed. A Bosnian man became the first to die of the coronavirus in the Balkan country, Reuters reports. The death was confirmed by the manager of a hospital in the north-western town of Bihac. Bosnia has declared a nationwide state of emergency over the coronavirus outbreak. The country has so far reported 90 cases. A number of peers including Floella Benjamin, Melvyn Bragg, Joan Bakewell, John Birt, Rowan Williams and Lola Young have written a letter calling on the chancellor to put in place emergency funds to support the self-employed during the coronavirus pandemic. The letter notes: The current welfare system is just not devised for a situation where the government is strongly advising that the creative industries cease to work. Much of the workforce is not entitled to any notice or redundancy pay. It is entirely dependent on one-off engagements such as concerts, gigs, theatre shows and in the case of musicians, peripatetic teaching. If they do not work, they do not get paid. The welfare system is just not structured in a way that will support the vast number of musicians and creatives who are immediately out of work overnight. Other countries, such as Italy and Canada, have put in place emergency funds to support the self-employed in these uncertain times. The Chancellor last night announced a funding grant for small businesses of up to \u00a325,000 to cover costs due to COVID-19 \u2013the self-employed also operate in a similar way to these small businesses. If the government could consider a similar grant or emergency fund to assist the self-employed and those on zero-hour contracts with the loss of earnings, that would go some way in making up for the income that has been and will continue to be lost. The government must also extend statutory sick pay to all workers who are affected by COVID-19. Tesco has today announced that it will be giving a 10% bonus to its workers in stores, distribution centres and customer engagement centres across the country. The bonus will be backdated to Monday 9 March for all permanent colleagues, who will receive the increased hourly pay rate till 1 May, when the company will review the situation. Jason Tarry, Tesco\u2019s UK and ROI chief executive, said: It\u2019s been an extraordinary couple of weeks and despite the enormous challenges, it\u2019s been incredible to see how colleagues have stepped up and responded, doing an outstanding job during this uncertain and difficult time. This pay bonus is just one way we are saying thank you to our colleagues and recognising that they are on the frontline, helping to feed the nation. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Africa rose above 1,000 on Saturday, AP reports, as two heads of state appeared to defy their own travel restrictions. As of Saturday, 40 of Africa\u2019s 54 countries were impacted by the outbreak after Angola confirmed its first cases. Congo reported its first death, while Burkina Faso reported two new ones. Several government ministers in Burkina Faso have tested positive, including the minister of foreign affairs. The West African nation has one of the highest confirmed cases on the continent with 64. On Friday, the president, Roch Marc Christian Kabore, announced the country\u2019s two international airports would close for two weeks with the exception for military and cargo. Though Angola also closed its air, land and sea borders this week, Namibian media showed the president, Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o, at the inauguration of Namibian president, Hage Geingob. Also in attendance was Mokgweetsi Masisi, the president of neighbouring Botswana, which this week suspended international travel by all government employees. A hearing has been ordered by the high court after Detention Action launched a landmark legal challenge following the government\u2019s written response to the claim. The challenge is thought to be the first Covid-19-related case listed in England and Wales. The death toll from patients who tested positive for the coronavirus in Scotland has increased to seven. A total of 373 people have now tested positive for Covid-19, new figures from the Scottish government show. The number of cases has increased by 51 in the last 24 hours. The Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS area has the largest number of confirmed cases, with 110 people in the area diagnosed as having it. There are 49 cases in Lanarkshire, 44 in Lothian and 34 in Tayside. At the end of the briefing, Eustice reiterated that supermarkets were best placed to judge what stock item limits should be put in place. \u201cThere\u2019s no shortage of food. As I said, food manufacturing has geared up to meet an increase in demand and it is up by 50%.\u201d Asked about possible military involvement in the supply chain, Eustice said:\u201cWe are obviously giving increasing thought within government over how we will protect those who may be self-isolating because they are vulnerable and I know more will be said about this in due course.\u201d Eustice said supermarkets had experienced a surge in demand similar to the Christmas period. \u201cAnd food manufacturers have responded by increasing their production by up to about 50%,\u201d he explained, \u201cso there\u2019s no risk of food running out. The challenge we have is getting food to the shelves and keeping it there.\u201d Asked about possible government intervention restricting food purchases, Eustice said: \u201cThe reality is that most of the supermarkets are already, of their own accord, putting limits on certain items so I don\u2019t think it is necessary or appropriate for the government to dictate this.\u201d Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said at the daily Downing Street briefing that there was plenty of food in the supply chain. The issue is around people and lorries. She added there was \u00a31bn more food in people\u2019s houses than there was three weeks ago. \u201cSo we should make sure we eat some of it.\u201d NHS England\u2019s national medical director, Stephen Powis, mentions the video posted of a NHS critical care nurse who was in tears because she was unable to buy food in her local supermarket after a 48-hour shift. \u201cFrankly we should all be ashamed that has had to happen. It\u2019s unacceptable. These are the very people we will all need to look after perhaps us or our loved ones in the weeks ahead,\u201d he said. Speaking during the daily Downing Street briefing on Saturday afternoon, the environment secretary, George Eustice, urged people to be responsible and not to panic-buy. He said: \u201cWe recognise that this is a challenging time and there are many things the government is asking the nation to do differently as we work together to fight this pandemic. \u201cBe responsible when you shop and think of others. Buying more than you need means others may be left without.\u201d Welsh MP Liz Saville Roberts has released a video advising people against travelling to rural parts of the country to self-isolate. In the video, Roberts said: \u201cTo those people who are thinking of coming to rural areas either to stay in caravans or second homes, could I please beg of you, please think again. Is this essential travel? \u201cHere in North Wales the NHS will be hard pushed to cope as it is in coming weeks. And if you need to self-isolate surely you\u2019ll be better at home with your family and friend networks\u201d Roberts added she looked forward to welcoming tourists once the pandemic was over. The death toll from the coronavirus outbreak has continued to increase across Europe, including the first death in Finland. The Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare confirmed on Saturday the country\u2019s first coronavirus death, saying that an elderly patient in the capital had died, Reuters reports. \u201cFinland\u2019s first coronavirus death is very unfortunate, but not surprising,\u201d it said. The total number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country reached 521 on Saturday. Switzerland reported 6,100 coronavirus infections on Saturday, 25% more than a day earlier, and 56 deaths, the Swiss health ministry said. There were reports that hospitals in the canton of Ticino that borders hard-hit Italy were under intense pressure. \u201cThe situation in Ticino is very tense,\u201d said Daniel Koch, the head of the federal office of health\u2019s communicable diseases division. The Swiss military took delivery of 50 additional ventilators and deployed them in Ticino on Friday. In the Netherlands, the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus has risen by 637 to a total of 3,631, Dutch health authorities said in their daily update on Saturday, with 30 new deaths. The total death toll in the Netherlands now stands at 136. Boris Johnson is speaking to supermarket bosses today about how to overcome the panic buying that is gripping the UK. They will also discuss efforts to keep supplies flowing. The meetings come ahead of the government\u2019s daily press conference, which will be hosted by the environment secretary, George Eustice, in place of Johnson. Eustice is expected to be joined by government scientific and medical experts for the briefing, which takes place at 2pm. Scotland\u2019s chief constable, Iain Livingstone, has warned the police will enforce the ban on all pubs, clubs and restaurants staying open \u2014 a ban he said he fully supported. In a statement, Livingstone thanked \u201cthe overwhelming majority\u201d of people complying with the ban. \u201cTo be clear, no public houses or other entertainment venues should be opening for patrons until further notice,\u201d he said. We are aware of proposed legislation in relation to COVID-19 and are carefully monitoring its progress and considering what the implications for policing will be. In the meantime, those breaking the law will be dealt with appropriately to ensure the public is kept safe from risk and harm as we continue to police the country. I am grateful to all our officers and staff who continue to deliver an absolutely first class service in these challenging conditions for their continued dedication, hard work and support. We will continue to focus on public service and, by working together, we will come through this. Ali Milani, the Labour parliamentary candidate who ran against Boris Johnson in the 2019 general election, says his father has passed away after being diagnosed with coronavirus. In a tweet, Milani said: \u201cIn the early hours of this morning, my father tragically passed away after having contracted COVID-19. \u201cPlease keep him in your prayers. This virus is taking millions all across the world. Please ISOLATE and listen to medical advice!\u201d In a separate tweet, he shared a link for a fundraising effort for Islamic Relief, which his friends had set up in his Dad\u2019s memory. The organisers of the Eurovision Song Contest are looking to stage an alternative to the cancelled event, in the form of a television show or through its online platforms. The Eurovision song contest is one of the world\u2019s largest television events and had been scheduled to take place in the Dutch city of Rotterdam on 16 May. The European Broadcasting Union, which made the decision to cancel the popular event on Wednesday due to the coronavirus crisis, said it was \u201cexploring alternative programming, but not a competition\u201d. The organisers said: The EBU is very aware of how much the Eurovision song contest will be missed this year. It is our intention to honour the songs that have been elected for 2020. To help unite and entertain audiences around Europe during these challenging times. Eurovision features live musical numbers from each participating country - more than 50 in recent editions \u2014 reaching beyond Europe to Israel and Australia. The contest has been held annually since 1956, and was expected to draw up to 200 million viewers and a live audience of tens of thousands for the final this year. Spain\u2019s death toll surpasses 1,300 people. The latest death toll is an increase from 1,002 on Friday, according to the country\u2019s health ministry. The number of registered cases in the country rose to 24,926 on Saturday from 19,980 in the previous tally announced on Friday Pakistan and Vietnam suspend international flights. Pakistan will suspend international flights for two weeks, the civil aviation authority has said. Cargo and diplomatic flights will be exempt. Vietnam said it would be suspending all inbound international flights, but did not give a timeframe. European Union commission to suspend budget rules.

Iran suggests social distancing measures could end in three weeks. The president, Hassan Rouhani, said social distancing measures to combat the coronavirus outbreak in the country will only need to be applied for two to three weeks as he expects the crisis to ease by then. Bangkok closes its shopping malls. All shopping centres in Thailand\u2019s capital, Bangkok, will be temporarily closed, it was announced on Saturday, as the country reported its biggest rise in cases yet. Shopping centres, except for supermarkets, will be closed from Sunday until 12 April in an attempt to stop the outbreak from spreading further. Jeremy Hunt calls for NHS staff to have the protective equipment they need. The former health secretary shared his concerns that not all NHS staff were receiving the correct personal protective equipment (PPE) on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. Presenter Fiona Phillips tests positive for the coronavirus, while Lewis Hamilton goes into self-isolation. Phillips told her fans not to panic on Twitter. The 59-year-old breakfast TV star was inundated with messages of support after she made the announcement. Lewis Hamilton has revealed he has been in self-isolation but is showing no symptoms of the coronavirus after attending an event with Idris Elba and Sophie Trudeau. Major UK supermarkets have been asked to set aside supplies for food banks after a tumultuous few days in which several emergency food aid charities closed and others struggled to meet rocketing demand from people hit by the fallout from coronavirus. Many food banks said they were finding it impossible to replenish food stocks, even as thousands more people turned to them for help, and others said they had been overwhelmed as hundreds of elderly volunteer regulars were forced to go into self-isolation. Hungary\u2019s government is seeking to indefinitely extend a coronavirus-related state of emergency that would allow rule by decree, as well as introduce prison sentences of up to five years for those who spread false information about the pandemic. Hungary\u2019s anti-migration prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has long been accused of democratic backsliding and critics are likely to portray the move as trying to take advantage of a crisis. The government said the measures were necessary in case a large number of MPs became ill and parliament was unable to function. \u201cThe government is required to adopt responsible decisions and to introduce, if necessary, unusual and unfamiliar restrictions. Observing these measures, remaining united and maintaining discipline are our most important tasks,\u201d said a government statement. The bill is due to be put before parliament on Monday. Although Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party has the 2/3 majority required to pass it, bringing it to a vote out of schedule requires a 4/5 majority, Hungarian news outlets reported, meaning the country\u2019s liberal opposition may be able to block it. So far, central and eastern European countries have moved quickly to implement stricter lockdowns and travel restrictions at an earlier stage than western European nations, with most of the region still reporting relatively low levels of coronavirus infections. Hungary is so far reporting 103 cases and four deaths. However, there is concern that the low numbers could be due to underreporting and low testing levels, with the real figures much higher. The mayor of the London borough Newham has written to the government asking for powers to be given to local councils so they can take action against businesses seeking to profit from a national crisis. Rokhsana Fiaz, the Labour mayor, called on residents to tell the council about a business they think is acting unfairly during the coronavirus outbreak. Lewis Hamilton has revealed he has been in self-isolation but is showing no symptoms of the coronavirus after attending an event with Idris Elba and Sophie Trudeau. \u201cThere\u2019s been some speculation about my health, after I was at an event where two people later tested positive for coronavirus,\u201d Hamilton wrote on Instagram. \u201cI wanted to let you know that I\u2019m doing well, feeling healthy and working out twice a day. I have zero symptoms, and it\u2019s now been 17 days since I saw Sophie and Idris. I have been in touch with Idris and happy to hear he is OK.\u201d He added: \u201cI did speak to my doctor and double checked if I needed to take a test but the truth is, there is a limited amount of tests available and there are people who need it more than I do, especially when I wasn\u2019t showing any symptoms at all. So what I\u2019ve done is keep myself isolated this past week, actually since practice was cancelled last Friday and kept my distance from people.\u201d The actor Elba and Trudeau, the wife of the Canadian prime minister, have both since tested positive for Covid-19. Hamilton met the pair at an event in London on 4 March before flying out to Melbourne for the first race of the Formula One season, which was called off last Friday morning. The coronavirus crisis has sparked a ferocious political row in Brazil, pitting its far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, against a legion of critics from across the political spectrum and sparking nightly protests against what many see as Bolsonaro\u2019s weak response. There have also been powerful expressions of solidarity and support for the healthcare workers battling the pandemic. This video was shot last night in one of Latin America\u2019s biggest favelas, Rocinha, in Rio, and shows the level of support for Brazil\u2019s doctors and nurses as the situation worsens. The vast hillside favela is home to upwards of 100,000 Brazilians and is among the low-income Latin American communities experts fear could be worst affected by coronavirus, given the high population density. The death toll now stands at 1,326, while there are 1,612 people in intensive care. A total of 2,125 people have recovered from the virus. According to the latest figure from Spain\u2019s health ministry, the country now has 24,926 confirmed cases of the Coronavirus, up from 19,980 on Friday. The statistics show that more than a third of all of the country\u2019s cases are in the Madrid region, where there are 8,921 cases and where there have been 804 deaths. Hotels in central London will offer beds to rough sleepers to help protect them against coronavirus, PA Media reports. An initial trial will take place over the weekend, offering 300 rooms to vulnerable people known to homelessness charities. The mayor\u2019s office is working with Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG) to block book rooms, at a discounted rate, for the next 12 weeks. Rough sleepers are significantly more likely to have underlying health conditions, including respiratory problems, than the wider population. They are also far less likely to be able to follow Public Health England advice on self-isolation, social distancing and hand-washing. On Saturday, national homelessness charity Crisis launched In this together, a campaign to raise funds to support people who are homeless in the outbreak. Money raised will help to keep Crisis\u2019s services running \u2013 and those of local grassroots homelessness charities which are struggling in these unprecedented circumstances. Pakistan and Vietnam have suspended international flights in a bid to contain the coronavirus pandemic. Pakistan will suspend international flights for two weeks, the civil aviation authority said. Cargo and diplomatic flights will be exempt. Vietnam said it would be suspending all inbound international flights, but did not give a timeframe. The Pakistan civil aviation authority said in a statement: The government of Pakistan has decided to suspend operation of all international passenger, chartered and private flights to Pakistan, effective from 21st March 2020 (2000 hrs PST) to 4th April 2020 (2000 hrs PST) Pakistan has reported three deaths and 481 confirmed cases of the coronavirus. \u201c[Vietnam] will suspend all the flights carrying foreign passengers to minimise the number of people coming to the country,\u201d Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said in the statement. Vietnam\u2019s coronavirus cases rose to 92 on Saturday, with no death, according to the Ministry of Health. The Scottish finance secretary, Kate Forbes, called on the UK government to scrap tax and excise duties on alcohol that is being used to make hand sanitiser. Distilleries across the country, such as Brewdog and Leith Gin, have been switching production away from their usual products to make hand-cleaning gels. Forbes said she was \u201cheartened\u201d to see so many companies playing their part to replenish stocks. She added that in these \u201cexceptional\u201d times \u201cwhere it is clear that alcohol is being provided for the purpose of hygiene, sanitisation and medical use it should not be subject to excise or tax as a default\u201d. In her letter to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, Forbes wrote: \u201cI hope you agree the fewest barriers possible should be in place to support the Covid-19 response. \u201cIn this time of uncertainty and national crisis, I am heartened by the many generous offers of support from organisations and industries who believe they can help the NHS. \u201cThere are, for example, offers from the producers of alcoholic drinks, to turn their focus and activities towards the provision of hand sanitiser, and this is my reason for writing to you.\u201d Forbes added: \u201cGiven the exceptional circumstances the country is facing and the need to protect our key workers at this time, we would like to see the greatest flexibility applied - where it is clear that alcohol is being provided for the purpose of hygiene, sanitisation and medical use it should not be subject to excise or tax as a default.\u201d Air raid sirens echoed across Amman early on Saturday to mark the start of a nationwide curfew affecting 10 million Jordanian citizens to combat the spread of coronavirus. In one of the strictest measures yet, Jordan has ordered all shops to close and everyone to stay off the streets until at least Tuesday, when it plans to announce specific times for shopping. The army said anyone violating the curfew, which restricts movement beyond emergencies and essential services, could be jailed for up to a year. Wholesale traders at New Covent Garden market in London are launching fruit, veg and essential item boxes for delivery to the public, following a catastrophic collapse in regular orders from restaurant chains and pubs as a result of the closures ordered by the government. Normally the market\u2019s 150-plus traders supply the capital\u2019s vast food service network, from Michelin-starred establishments through to airlines, cruise ships, hotels, pubs and even food for the animals at London zoo. Companies such as Nature\u2019s Choice, Fresh Connect, LinkClass, EA Williams, IA Harris and Premier Food Service have refocused their efforts, and are seeking to avoid waste, by offering to deliver the freshest and best quality produce direct to homes in and around London. The move comes as traditional national veg box services such as Riverford and Abel &amp; Cole have buckled under the strain of exceptional demand. An NHS trust in Cambridge has begun to send patients that have recovered from the coronavirus home, Cambridge News reports. Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Trusts said they had been \u201cinundated\u201d with offers of support and money amid the coronavirus epidemic. Mike More, the chairman of the Cambridge University Hospitals Trust, thanked the local community in a statement. \u201cThe world is changing around us, both inside and outside of our hospital walls. I would like to publicly recognise the immense efforts of our NHS staff and volunteers. Many have offered to work extra hours to help out, and others have been redeployed to where they are most urgently needed.\u201d More added the trust has starting to send some patients home \u2013 with and without underlying health issues \u2013 who had been successfully treated for coronavirus. Manchester United and Manchester City have donated a combined \u00a3100,000 to local food banks in a joint initiative between the clubs to fight the threat of coronavirus to the most vulnerable. The move comes after Fans Supporting Foodbanks told the Guardian on Thursday it was launching a fund with MUFC Foodbanks to help schemes in the area. In a joint statement, City and United said: \u201cWe are proud of the role our supporters play in helping local food banks and recognise the increased strain likely to be placed on these charities by the impact of coronavirus. We are pleased to come together with our fans to help vulnerable members of society in a City United.\u201d Presenter Fiona Philips suspects she has coronavirus and said she is in bed recovering The 59-year-old told her fans not to panic on Twitter and later clarified she had not been tested, but was in bed with symptoms of the coronavirus. The 59-year-old breakfast TV star was inundated with messages of support after she made the announcement. This post was changed to clarify Phillips was not tested for the coronavirus. John Bird, the founder of the Big Issue magazine, has announced that it will be going digital during the coronavirus pandemic due to fears that street vendors could be put at risk. In a post on Twitter on Saturday, Bird wrote: \u201cWith heavy heart I have had to say to Big Issue vendors \u201cyour wellbeing comes first, so no selling on the streets. You have to be indoors. Out of harm\u2019s way.\u201d He called on people to buy the magazine online to continue to support vendors. Jake Knowles-Jenssen, a 27-year-old British freelancer, sent a photo from outside the normally bustling Ostbahnhof as Bavaria\u2019s stricter measures come into effect. He said that up until midnight last night restaurants could open until 6pm and only non-essential shops were closed, but people were still out in large numbers. Bavarian leader, Markus S\u00f6der, responded with stricter restrictions. \u201cNow we can only go out for essential food or exercise alone. Police will enforce and you have to justify your reasons for being outside your home,\u201d he said. Knowles-Jenssen moved to Germany in January. UK supermarket chain Morrisons has announced a number of measures to support frontline staff responding to the coronavirus epidemic and the most vulnerable groups affected by the crisis. Morrisons said it would take on staff from Marie Curie and CLIC Sargent charity shops, whose doors may close because of the coronavirus. It announced on Saturday that it would take on up to 500 colleagues to help the elderly and vulnerable in stores across the UK. Matthew Reed, the chief executive of Marie Curie, said: \u201cEvery day and night Marie Curie nurses and doctors continue to care for people at the end of the lives. As we face into this national emergency, communities, business and charities need to work together more than ever.\u201d It comes as Lidl announced it would be giving away thousands of bunches of Mother\u2019s Day flowers to NHS workers and worthy causes. Ryan McDonnell, the chief commercial director at Lidl GB, said: \u201cThis Mother\u2019s Day, we wanted to redistribute this surplus supply and show our thanks and appreciation to those working tirelessly through these extraordinary times. We hope that our beautiful bunches will help raise the spirits of those who receive them.\u201d Convenience retailer the Co-op will next week donate \u00a31.5m worth of food to FareShare, to help boost plummeting stocks at food banks which have suffered a huge slump in donations. FareShare \u2013 the UK\u2019s largest hunger fighting charity - supports over 11,000 charities and community groups, including food banks. The Co-op has pledged \u00a31.5m of essential food products which will be split amongst FareShare\u2019s 23 regional centres and then supplied to a network of local community groups across the country. Food banks remain a lifeline for those who rely on the donations to feed their families and demand is set to grow as the number of people who unexpectedly find themselves out of work increases. The Co-op has also announced measures to combat holiday hunger in pupils caused by unplanned school closures. Some 6,500 students across 25 Co-op academy schools who currently have free school meals will be given a \u00a320 voucher for every week that schools remain shut. The European Union commission moved to formalise an agreement reached by EU finance ministers to suspend budget rules that put limits on borrowing so that governments have a free hand in fighting the coronavirus, Reuters reports. The European Union executive proposed late on Friday to activate the \u2018general escape clause\u2019 in the rules to respond to the pandemic that has caused lockdowns in most EU countries and the closure of Europe\u2019s borders. \u201cIt will allow member states to undertake measures to deal adequately with the crisis, while departing from the budgetary requirements that would normally apply under the European fiscal framework,\u201d the Commission said. EU rules say that governments have to keep cutting their budget deficits until they reach balance or surplus and have to reduce public debt every year to bring it below 60% of GDP. Once the Commission proposal is formally accepted by EU finance ministers at their next meeting, government spending to fight the coronavirus will be excluded from Commission calculations of deficit and debt. UK car parking firm NCP is offering free parking to all NHS staff to help them to get to work at a time when slimmed-down transport networks are offering limited services. NHS workers can access the offer directly via the NCP website and pre-book their space each time they need to park. The offerapplies to more than 150 locations across the UK and is available to book any time up to an hour before arrival. The offer will run until the end of April and then be reviewed. NCP currently already offers discounted rates for NHS workers all year round in many car parks located near a hospital. Stephen Barclay, the Treasury chief secretary, said that providing protection for the the self-employed during the coronavirus outbreak would be \u201coperationally\u201d difficult to deliver, following criticism that current UK government plans to underwrite the wages of millions of workers did not cover freelancers, contractors and the self-employed. Barclay said the self-employed would benefit from measures such as the deferral of self-assessment tax requirements, holidays for mortgage payers and the strengthening of the welfare \u201csafety net\u201d. \u201cWe are looking at operationally what we can roll out to people,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cThe main thing we have done is twofold: it is to support the economy as a whole, because the best thing for people who are self-employed as for all people is to sustain the economy and ensure that we can return with those viable businesses, and alongside that strengthen the safety net.\u201d When asked whether the government would come forward with measures specifically for the self-employed, he said: \u201cI come back to this underlying point about operationally what is difficult to do and what can be delivered to the timescales were are working to.\u201d For some comic relief, Guardian media editor Jim Waterson has talked to the man behind the WhatsApp audio clip poking fun at coronavirus misinformation. Billy McLean, a 29-year-old Londoner who works in software sales, is the man responsible for a spoof WhatsApp audio clip that claimed the Ministry of Defence was about to requisition Wembley Stadium to cook the world\u2019s biggest lasagne. He told the Guardian that his \u201cviral\u201d success highlighted the risks of believing everything that gets sent to you on the messaging service. Indonesia has confirmed 81 new coronavirus cases and six more deaths, bringing the total number of cases to 450 and deaths to 38, a health ministry official told reporters on Saturday, Reuters reports. This comes a day after the governor of Jakarta declared a state of emergency in the Indonesian capital for the next two weeks. While the death toll in the country climbed to the highest in south-east Asia, the region, home to 1.9 billion people, appears to have been less hard hit than elsewhere in the world. The rates of new infections in Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Sri Lanka have accelerated, with a total of 869 detected cases and seven deaths. Bangladesh tightened its border controls while Sri Lanka arrested more than two dozen people for violating a nationwide curfew. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said social distancing measures to combat the coronavirus outbreak in the country will only need to be applied for two to three weeks as he expects the crisis to ease by then. On Saturday, Iran announced 123 more deaths from the coronavirus, bringing the toll to 1,556, with 20,610 confirmed cases. Iran \u201chas to do everything necessary to return economic production to normal,\u201d Rouhani said in comments broadcast on state TV. He also accused \u201ccounter-revolutionaries\u201d of plotting to shut down economic production. Iran is one of the countries most affected by the pandemic outside of China. The Highland hotel that attracted widespread condemnation on Friday after it sacked staff and made them homeless during the coronavirus outbreak has apologised and excused their actions as \u201can administrative error\u201d. The Guardian reported yesterday that more than a dozen workers at the Coylumbridge hotel near Aviemore received a letter on Thursday informing them management was \u201ctaking the latest government advice\u201d and that staff employment had been terminated, with those who live at the hotel complex asked to leave the premises immediately. The Britannia Hotels group, which owns the hotel, did not respond to requests from the Guardian for comment, but later told the Liverpool Echo: \u201cUnfortunately, the communication sent to these employees was an administrative error. All affected employees are being immediately contacted. We apologise for any upset caused.\u201d The government\u2019s message that there is enough food for everyone still hasn\u2019t stopped large queues forming outside of supermarkets. A reader sent the following two photos of the long queues of shoppers at 5.45am at Tesco Extra on Sunbury-on-Thames in Middlesex. The store\u2019s opening time was 6am. The husband of a British woman who died while on holiday in Bali after contracting coronavirus said he was able to say goodbye to her. Kimberley Finlayson, who had underlying health conditions, underwent two emergency operations before she died on 11 March. Her husband, Ken, said the couple had exchanged goodbyes \u201cfor a few minutes\u201d before she died. \u201cShe said that she loved me and we exchanged that for a few minutes and looked into one another\u2019s eyes,\u201d he told the BBC. The mother of four was the founder of a dental communication business based in Shenley, Hertfordshire. Her colleagues praised her \u201cpassion, creativity and determination\u201d. \u201cThose fortunate enough to know her will remember a whirlwind of energy and ideas - and an ability to make things happen that few can match,\u201d an online statement said. All shopping centres in Thailand\u2019s capital, Bangkok, will be temporarily closed, it was announced on Saturday, as the country reported its biggest leap in cases yet. Shopping centres, except for supermarkets, will be closed from Sunday until April 12 in an attempt to stop the outbreak from spreading further. Despite advice against panic buying, shoppers rushed to supermarkets, it was reported, while others tried unsuccessfully to book online food deliveries. Restaurants will be open only for takeaway orders, it was confirmed, while pharmacies will stay open. Boxing stadiums, beauty salons, arcades and other entertainment venues will remain shut. The measures were announced as Thailand reported 89 new cases of the coronavirus, bringing its tally to 411, with the majority of cases in Bangkok. The capital will also extend the closure of schools and bars for another 22 days, while both Thai AirAsia and Thai Lion Air have both suspended international flights. Hello, I\u2019m Aamna Mohdin taking over the liveblog from my colleague Rebecca Ratcliffe. Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt has said NHS staff treating coronavirus patients must have the protective equipment they need. He shared his concerns that not all NHS staff were receiving the correct personal protective equipment (PPE) on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. \u201cWe must sort this out. We are asking people to put their own lives at risk on the NHS frontline. We have all seen the terrible scenes as to what is happening in Italy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is absolutely heartbreaking when NHS frontline professionals don\u2019t have the equipment that they need.\u201d He added: \u201cI think thegovernment has done a lot in the last week. I think they have unblocked the supply chains, but there is this question about whether it is the right equipment.\u201d Lisa Anderson, a consultant cardiologist at St George\u2019s hospital in London, echoed Hunt\u2019s concerns. She said the government had changed the rules so they were no longer compliant with World Health Organization recommendations, which required medics to wear a full gown and visor. She said that since Monday, staff in the NHS only had to wear a simple face mask, short gloves and a pinafore apron. \u201cThis is not just about the risk to ourselves and our families. We are travelling home on the tube, on buses,\u201d she told the Today programme. \u201cSainsbury\u2019s this morning has announced that they are opening up the early hours to the frail, elderly and NHS workers. We are cross-infecting everybody at the moment,\u201d she said.

You can see his comments in full, posted on Twitter, here. \u201cLife is changing dramatically for many of us, but it\u2019s important to continue looking after your physical and mental health,\u201d he writes, adding that you can do so by adopting a healthy diet, limiting alcohol consumption, and exercising regularly. It\u2019s normal to feel stressed, confused and scared during a crisis. Talking to people you know and trust can help. If you\u2019re working at home during #COVID19, make sure you don\u2019t sit in the same position for long periods. Get up and take a 3-minute break every 30 minutes. Compassion is a medicine. Supporting other people in your community can help you as much as it does them. Check in on neighbours, family and friends.

A longtime employee of NBC News died on Thursday after testing positive for the coronavirus, NBC News chairman Andy Lack said in an email to staff members. Larry Edgeworth, 61, worked in an equipment room at NBC News\u2019 headquarters in New York. He had previously spent 25 years at NBC News working as an audio technician, and had traveled the world with many of the network\u2019s correspondents. \u201cMany of you were fortunate enough to work with Larry over the years, so you know that he was the guy you wanted by your side no matter where you were,\u201d Lack wrote. \u201cWe lost a dear colleague today. I wish you could have known him he brightened our lives and lifted our spirits with his love and kindness,\u201d Andrea Mitchell, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign affairs correspondent, wrote on Twitter.

The former Portuguese colony, with a population less than 1.3 million, was invaded by Indonesia in 1975 before becoming a sovereign state in 2002. It is located east of the Indonesian archipelago. The governor of Jakarta on Friday declared a state of emergency in the Indonesian capital for the next two weeks over the coronavirus outbreak as the death toll in the country climbed to the highest in south-east Asia. South Korea\u2019s prime minister Chung Sye-kyun has strongly recommended religious, sports and entertainment facilities suspend operations, and advised people to avoid socialising for the next 15 days. He added that the government will order any gatherings to disperse. His comments follow confirmation of 147 new coronavirus infections on Saturday, up from the previous day\u2019s 87.

The Philippines now has 262 coronavirus cases, after 32 new infections were confirmed, the country\u2019s health ministry said on Saturday. The deathtoll has also risen to 19. More than 57 million people in the island of Luzon, which includes the capital of Manila, were placed under lockdown this week to try to stop the spread of the virus. Jordan blew sirens on Saturday to mark the start of a curfew that will limit the mobility of its 10 million citizens indefinitely. The new restrictions prevent movement beyond emergencies and essential services. Anyone who flouts the rules can be jailed up to a year, the army has warned. Thousands of soldiers have been deployed inside cities and on main highways across the country to enforce the restrictions. Jordan has also closed land and sea border crossings with Syria, Iraq, Egypt and Israel, and suspended all incoming and outgoing flights since Tuesday. In Italy, balcony singing has spread across the country as people show solidarity with their neighbours. Here is a scene from Lebanon, where residents have been urged to stay at home. Lebanon temporarily shut its airports, borders and ports on Wednesday in an attempt to stop the virus from spreading. It has also closed non-essential government institutions, and asked private companies to suspend their work. The country has so far recorded 149 cases and four fatalities. Colombia will enter a nationwide quarantine from Tuesday night, President Ivan Duque said late on Friday. The quarantine in the country, which has 158 confirmed cases of the virus, will last for 19 days, reports Reuters. Duque said the action, which will include strict restrictions on citizens\u2019 movements outside the home, was necessary to fight the disease. \u201cIn the coming weeks we have the opportunity to collectively take away the virus\u2019 speed,\u201d Duque said. A government spokesman said more details would be released about the quarantine before Monday. Government sources said they will include movement exceptions for medical personnel, security forces and workers at pharmacies and supermarkets. Colombia\u2019s government has already said it will block incoming international flights from Monday and ordered people aged 70 and over to stay inside until the end of May. It has also closed land and water borders along with schools and bars. Thailand reported 89 new cases on Saturday, the largest daily increase in infections since the outbreak began, bringing the national tally to 411. The Thai government has asked people to avoid going out, but so far rejected calls for a lockdown, saying that the needs of workers who are unable to stay at home must be considered. Taweesin Wisanuyothin, a Public Health Ministry spokesman, said the new cases were linked to earlier infections from a boxing match, an entertainment complex and a religious gathering in neighbouring Malaysia. Cases have risen over the past week as health officials trace the contacts of confirmed patients. Of those infected, 366 are currently being treated, while 44 have recovered. One death has been recorded in the country. Japan has recorded 1,016 cases of domestically transmitted cases of coronavirus as of Saturday, according to public broadcaster NHK, hitting a new milestone as the nation grapples with pressure to avoid a health crisis ahead of Tokyo Olympics. The tally rises to 1,728 if 712 cases of infections from a cruise ship moored near Tokyo last month are included, according to NHK. Although the number of cases is still on the rise, Japan has started scaling back some measures to fight the spread of the virus. On Friday, Japan said it would not extend its request to close schools, setting the stage for classes to resume at the start of the academic year in April. The Tokyo Olympics, set to start from July 24, have been cast into doubt by the coronavirus pandemic and the cancellation of sporting events and qualifiers around the world. Olympics organizers have repeatedly said the Games will go on as scheduled. Singapore reported two coronavirus-related deaths on Saturday, marking the city-state\u2019s first fatalities from the infection, Reuters reports. The patients who died were a 75-year-old Singaporean woman and a 64-year-old Indonesian man, the health minstry said in a statement. Singapore, widely praised for its fastidious onslaught against the virus, has confirmed 385 cases of the infection and had so far managed to avoid any fatalities since the outbreak began in the city-state in late January. Here\u2019s some more on the closure of Sydney\u2019s famous Bondi Beach, from Australian Associated Press. The New South Wales government has temporarily closed Bondi Beach as authorities handed lifesavers unprecedented move-on powers amid the coronavirus pandemic. NSW Police David Elliott announced the drastic measure on Saturday afternoon after photos of throngs of beachgoers flocking to the iconic Sydney strip drew swift condemnation. Thousands flocked to Bondi Beach on Friday amid temperatures in the high 30s, ignoring social distancing measures. Pictures of big crowds were criticised by foreign media and on social media. The decision comes as the number of coronavirus cases in NSW ballooned to 436 after 83 new cases were identified in the state. \u201cIt\u2019s a significant level of disappointment that we have to move today to not only remove people from Bondi Beach and it\u2019s a significant opportunity to remind people that the Health Act must be complied with,\u201d Mr Elliott said. \u201cWhat we saw this morning at Bondi Beach was the most irresponsible behaviour of individuals that we\u2019ve seen so far. \u201cWe cannot have an area where more than 500 people are gathered.\u201d Under regulations introduced to control the spread of the deadly virus, outdoor gatherings of 500 people or more have been banned. As part of that, lifesavers will have the power to close beaches and ask people to move on if a crowd of 500 or more is gathered at the same spot. The minister said that if the crowd does not comply, NSW Police will have the powers to make people leave. \u201cThis is not something we\u2019re doing because we\u2019re the fun police, this is not something that the government is doing because we want to make life easy, this is about saving lives,\u201d Mr Elliott said. \u201cTomorrow in NSW we will probably crack 500 cases of coronavirus. \u201cIf the community does not comply with the regulations and the health warnings, this is going to become the new norm. \u201cWe are going to close down the type of activities we\u2019ve grown to love.\u201d It came as Waverley mayor Paula Masselos on Saturday issued a public plea for people to stay away from Bondi amid the coronavirus pandemic and away from beaches. \u201cThe public must at all times keep a minimum safe distance from each other in public places and if you don\u2019t need to be out in public, please consider staying at home,\u201d Mr Masselos said. \u201cWe all have a role to play in preventing the spread of COVID-19 and I am frustrated that people continue to ignore health advice about social distancing as observed yesterday at Bondi Beach.\u201d Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt also hit out at people who flouted social distancing advice and risked spreading the virus. \u201cWhat happened in Bondi was unacceptable and the local council must take steps to stop that occurring,\u201d Mr Hunt said. \u201cEach of us as individuals, as families, as groups, as councils, as state governments, as a national government has responsibility. \u201cWhere something like this is occurring the local council must step in and that message is absolutely clear.\u201d Guardian correspondent Justin McCurry has some more detail about the new cases reported in South Korea today: The 147 new coronavirus cases reported in South Korea on Friday - bringing the country\u2019s total to 8,799 - was the second-highest number of daily positive diagnoses this week, following 152 identified on Wednesday, according to the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). The pace of daily new infections had shown signs of slowing since the second week of this month after health authorities finished testing 210,000 followers of a secretive church that was at the centre of the country\u2019s outbreak. Just over 100 of the new daily cases were from Daegu, the southeastern city where the church is located, and nearby North Gyeongsang province. The two locations account for about 60% of all of South Korea\u2019s Covid-19 infections. There is concern, however, over a rise in infections in Seoul and among people arriving from overseas, Yonhap news agency said. Seoul reported 15 additional cases and nearby Gyeonggi Province 12, while the number among people arriving in the country rose by six to 23. In response, South Korea will require all arrivals from European countries to get tested for the virus and self-isolate for two weeks starting Sunday, Yonhap said, adding that temporary shelters had been set up to accommodate up to 1,000 European travelers while they wait for their test results. South Korean health authorities have won praise for their mass testing regime, which has enabled them to quickly identify infection clusters. The number of people being checked for the virus and under quarantine came to 15,704 as of Friday, the KCDC said. The country has tested a total of 327,509 suspected cases, with 303,006 coming back negative. People living in poorer areas of the Philippine capital, Manila, have begun building makeshift barricades to halt movement along the tight alleyways of their neighbourhoods, as this image, taken by Ezra Acayan for Getty Images shows. The Philippine island of Luzon, which includes Manila, has been on lockdown since Monday. The government has urged the island\u2019s 55 million residents to quarantine themselves at home, an impossible task for many of its poorer residents who need to leave their houses daily for work. The number of cases in the Philippines rose to 230 on Friday after an additional 13 cases were recorded. There have 18 fatalities in the country. The latest case numbers announced from the states and territories throughout the day means 1,049 cases of Covid-19 have now been confirmed in Australia, including seven deaths. It was also announced that Bondi Beach will close if more than 500 people gather. This is not something we are doing because we are the fun police. This is about saving lives. If the community does not comply with the regulations and the health warnings well then this is going to become the new norm. We will be closing down the type of iconic activities that unfortunately we\u2019ve come ... to love and adore about our lifestyle,\u201d said New South Wales police minister David Elliot. Elliot said surf lifesavers would conduct head counts and, if they find more than 500 people, would close the beach and order people to move on. If people do not comply, police would be called. The announcements comes after photos emerged of people defying social-distancing rules and gathering in thousands at the beach on Friday, when temperatures were unusually hot, reaching 35C. United Airlines has announced that it will cut its international schedule by 95% for April, after governments worldwide imposed unprecedented travel restrictions to to curb the spread of the coronavirus. United will suspend all flights to Canada from April 1, and will draw down its remaining trans-Atlantic, trans-Pacific and Mexico operations, the airline said in a statement, Reuters reported. The airline this week had announced a 60% reduction in domestic and international schedules for April, citing the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on travel demand. Malaysia\u2019s health minister has been criticised for suggesting that drinking warm water can prevent coronavirus, with experts pointing out that his comments are not evidence-based and that people should follow World Health Organisation advice. Health Minister Dr Adham Baba had told Malaysia\u2019s public broadcaster, RTM, that people should drink warm water because the virus cannot cope with heat. The water would flush the virus into the stomach, he said. Dr Amalina Bakri, a doctor based in the UK, said the comments were not backed up by science and that people should be wary of such myths. If you would like some fact-based information about the simple precautions you can take to reduce exposure and transmission from coronavirus, our science correspondent Hannah Devlin has written a very helpful guide. Following the news that Sydney\u2019s Bondi beach is set to close, here\u2019s a roundup of the latest developments in Australia, from the Guardian\u2019s Melbourne bureau chief, Melissa Davey. There are now 969 Covid-19 cases and seven deaths in Australia, and the health minister Greg Hunt says about 115,000 tests have been carried out. New South Wales is expected to announce at 2pm Sydney time the closure of Bondi Beach, after photos emerged of people defying social-distancing rules and gathering in thousands at the beach. A ban on non-citizens and non-residents entering Australia has taken effect. Questions are being asked about why passengers were allowed to disembark the Ruby Princess cruise ship in Sydney. The ship\u2019s 2,700 passengers have been told to self-isolate. Four people on the ship have now tested positive for the virus. Meanwhile, Victorian premier Daniel Andrews announced $1.7bn \u201ceconomic survival and jobs package\u201d, which will provide full payroll tax refunds for the 2019-20 financial year to small and medium-sized businesses with payroll of less than $3m. Payments will start being made next week. Syria will not allow visitors arriving from countries that are dealing with outbreaks to enter the country, as part of measures to prevent the spread of the virus. No cases have been recorded by the government, or in the large parts of the country that fall outside of government control. The World Health Organization has expressed deep concern about a possible epidemic in the country, which is already shattered by nine years of civil war, and where vast numbers of people are living in cramped camps and slum areas. The UN political affairs chief Rosemary DiCarlo warned on Friday of the potentially devastating impact of coronavirus in Syria. Damascus has also closed schools, parks, restaurants and various public institutions. The New South Wales government is set to announce it will close Sydney\u2019s Bondi Beach, the Guardian\u2019s Ben Smee reports. The announcement - to be made by NSW and emergency services police minister David Elliot at 2pm AEDT - comes after concerns were raised that large numbers of beachgoers were not abiding by public health advice. Images from Australia\u2019s most iconic beach in recent days have shown large crowds of people. Guardian Australia understands the closure will affect Bondi Beach alone at this stage, though the NSW government could extend the restriction to other beaches if they find more than 500 people gathered at any time. Five US states have either closed, or are set to close, all non-essential businesses account. Here\u2019s some useful background on the likely economic impact of the shutdowns. California, New York, Illinois, New Jersey and Connecticut \u2013 which are all issuing \u201cstay at home orders\u201d \u2013 Account for almost a third of the world\u2019s biggest economy. They rank first, third, fifth, eight and 23rd respectively among all 50 states by GDP, according to Reuters. California alone has a $3 trillion economy that accounts for 14.5% of the US output, making the state by itself a bigger economic powerhouse than all but four nations. Together, the five states produced $6.4 trillion in goods and services in 2018, Bureau of Economic Analysis data shows. For reference, President Donald Trump\u2019s administration and congress are currently negotiating a $1 trillion-plus economic stimulus package, which equates to about one-20th of annual US economic output. About 5.4 million residents across the five states do not have health insurance, according to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation. That is about 19% of the total US uninsured. The local prefect said the curfew, to be introduced from Saturday, was necessary to enforce the strict confinement measures decided by France. \u201cA curfew is going to be put in place,\u201d Prefect Bernard Gonzalez told BFM TV. \u201cThis decree is essentially aimed at those who find it funny to gather together and defy public authorities.\u201d The curfew will start at 11 pm local time (2200 GMT) and run until 5 am. Mexico\u2019s health ministry confirmed that the number of infections has risen from 168 to 203. A second death has also been reported. Details of the new cases are not yet clear. Mainland China reported no new locally transmitted cases of the coronavirus for a third day running, Reuters has reported. The daily log of infections involving travellers arriving from other countries continued to rise. Mainland China had 41 new confirmed cases of coronavirus infections on Friday, the country\u2019s National Health Commission said, all imported from abroad. That brought the total number of imported cases to 269. High in the charts was Beijing, with 14 new imported cases. Shanghai and six provinces also identified such cases. That brought the total number of confirmed cases in mainland China to 81,008, the health authority said in a statement on Saturday. The death toll from the outbreak in mainland China reached 3,255 as of the end of Friday, up by seven from the previous day and all from the central province of Hubei, the epicentre of the outbreak in China. South Korea has confirmed 147 new cases, brining the total to 8,799, it was reported on Saturday. The country has been praised for its efforts to contain the virus after it experienced a large outbreak in the city of Daegu. Authorities have remained high alert however, as new clusters have continued to emerge. I\u2019ll bring you more on today\u2019s cases later. Haitians rushed to buy food, gas, soap and face masks on Friday after two cases of the coronavirus were confirmed to have been imported into the country, Associated Press reports. President Jovenel Moise said Thursday that two patients had been quarantined after testing positive for the COVID-19 virus. One was a 31-year-old Haitian who had just returned from Paris and the other was a Belgian volunteering in a Port-au-Prince orphanage. Moise said the country was closing all airports, schools, factories and seaports. The measure is designed to halt new cases of the virus, but health workers said it could prevent the arrival of important medical supplies and volunteer doctors and nurses if the virus starts to spread inside the densely population nation of roughly 11 million people. According to the United Nations, some 35% of Haitians lack basic drinking water services and two-thirds have limited or no sanitation services, making it extremely difficult for people to regularly wash their hands as recommended to deter the spread of the coronavirus. The country just completed its first year free of cholera, a water-borne disease that was imported by U.N. peacekeepers and killed nearly 10,000 people over the last decade. New Zeland prime minister Jacinda Ardern has asked citizens to restrict their movements around the country, and cancel all non-essential domestic travel, the Guardian\u2019s Eleanor Ainge Roy reports from Dunedin. Ardern also asked those aged 70 and over, or with a compromised immune system to stay home for the foreseeable future. Those who could work from home should now do so, Ardern said, but reassured Kiwis that essential services such as supermarkets and pharmacies would remain open. There are four alert levels in New Zealand, and the country was currently at stage two. Ardern took a warm and smiley demeanor for her address, in a bid to reassure New Zealanders in \u201cunprecedented times\u201d. 14 new cases of the virus were confirmed today, bringing the total number of cases to 53. Two of the cases show no link to overseas travel, meaning community transmission may now be underway. \u201cProtecting New Zealanders from the virus is our number one objective, and we must take decisive action to prevent the worst occurring here,\u201d Ardern said. \u201cNew Zealand is fighting an unprecedented global pandemic. We must fight by going hard and going early with new measures to slow the transmission of the virus. \u201cThese measures are being taken in the national interest. We know people, business, and sports events will be impacted, but these are short-term disruptions for the overall health of our people and country. I know many New Zealanders are anxious. The alert system is designed to offer certainty around future action and the ability for people to plan and prepare for any future eventuality. Please be strong, be kind, and unite against COVID-19,\u201d Jacinda Ardern said. The number of coronavirus cases keeps rising in Argentina, with 30 new reported cases Friday, brining the tally up to 158, including three deaths so far. The largest number of cases are in the capital city of Buenos Aires and the province of Buenos Aires. A total of around 200 persons were arrested Friday for violating the nationwide obligatory quarantine announced by President Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez Thursday evening. Among them were 13 people arrested at an \u201chotel alojamiento\u201d (Argentina\u2019s equivalent of a \u201clove motel\u201d), a jogger, a drunk policeman and a doctor who broke her quarantine after testing positive for the virus in the northern province of Chaco. The hotline for reporting quarantine violators in the city of Buenos Aires alone had already received 116 calls by midday Friday, including 99 cases in which the reported persons resisted the police. Turkey on Friday recorded five more deaths from the novel coronavirus, bringing the overall total to nine, as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan urged people not to go out for \u201cnon-essential reasons\u201d. \u201cWe have lost five patients who are elderly and with a weak resistance,\u201d Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said on Twitter. Koca also said the number of cases has reached 670 after 311 out of 3,656 patients tested positive over the last 24 hours. Good morning and welcome to our coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. The number of cases reported worldwide has now passed a quarter of a million, according to Johns Hopkins University figures, which show there are now 272,167 infections globally and 11,299 deaths. Governments are continuing to ramp up restrictions to stop the spread of the virus. On Friday, the UK announced it will close all cafes, bars and restaurants and said that the government would pay 80% of wages of people not working. Meanwhile, Donald Trump invoked new powers to speed up virus supplies. The announcements came as both Italy and Spain reported their biggest single-day death tolls from the coronavirus. Elsewhere: Two people died in the United Arab Emirates; the first deaths suffered by the country. The country\u2019s official news agency, WAM, said each had suffered from previous health conditions. Israel also announced its first death. The country\u2019s health ministry has said an 88-year-old man who had been suffering from previous illnesses had died. A member of the US vice president\u2019s staff tested positive. The employee, who was not identified, had not come into close contact with either the US president, Donald Trump, or his boss, Mike Pence, who is in charge of the US\u2019s coronavirus response. The Chinese doctor who was reprimanded for \u201cspreading rumours\u201d after he sought to warn colleagues about the emergence of Covid-19 has been officially exonerated by an investigation into his death. The Tunisian president, Kais Saied, on Friday ordered a general lockdown, restricting public movement to counter the spread of the coronavirus. Thousands of British holidaymakers risk becoming stranded abroad, as flight cancellations, travel restrictions and lockdowns due to the global coronavirus pandemic complicate their journeys home. As many as 100,000 tourists may still be in Spain, despite a near-total lockdown and government orders that all hotels be shut down within the week.

But on a glorious bright March day, a late-season spark of brilliance against the encroaching autumn, the golden sand and blue-green waters were, if not deserted, uncannily quiet. Rangers carrying loud hailers marched up and down the beach in socks and shoes telling people the beach was closed and that swimmers, surfers and sunbakers must leave immediately. Entries to the beach were taped shut with red-and-white tape. Signs insisted \u201carea closed until further notice\u201d. Most people complied. (Despite Australians\u2019 cherished self-image as a band of rugged nonconformists, this is a country that, in fact, embraces obedience.) But there were defiant cases, official entreaties politely ignored. Surfers slipped under barriers or jumped into the water from the rocks at the north or south end of the beach. On the sand, Guardian Australia watched one exchange between a ranger and an elderly woman, who conversed with the official for several minutes before putting on her bathing cap and marching into the water. Lifeguards, apologetic at having to enforce a rule that is hazily understood at best, told people simply that the beach was closed and that they could not surf. Aware that over their shoulders a dozen surfers paddled for the best wave of the set, they warned the police boat would come and start handing out fines to those who refused to leave. There was widespread confusion at the rule and its enforcement. The unanswerable questions came rapidly: \u201cIs it just the beach that\u2019s closed, or the water as well?\u201d \u201cThere are not 500 people out there, why can\u2019t I go?\u201d \u201cIf someone gets out, can I go in?\u201d But the social distancing the beach closure was designed to enforce has had its intended impact. The numbers on the beach were a tiny fraction of what might be expected on a Sunday like this. Bondi Beach, a pictorial shorthand for Australia, has become emblematic of the nation\u2019s struggle to respond properly to the outbreak. The trajectory of Australia\u2019s coronavirus curve mirrors Italy more than it does Singapore. More than 1,000 cases have been reported, and while the death toll remains low, at seven, there are fears this could escalate if the health system becomes strained. \u201cSocial distancing\u201d is a lexical addition to every conversation, but its practice is haphazard.

At least five people from the Ruby Princess have since tested positive to Covid-19, some of whom boarded domestic flights home. Walking south from Bondi reveals the practical difficulties of enforcing a lockout rule along a rocky, meandering coastline, beyond the philosophical challenge of keeping Australians from the beaches they regard as their inviolable birthright. Immediately south of Bondi, the rocky McKenzies Bay was completely open and unguarded, while at Tamarama, next to that, high-wire fencing had been hurriedly installed warning the beach was off-limits for the foreseeable future. Bronte, the next beach south, was being slowly walled off by the same fences. The numbers were down, social distancing was being enforced, if imperfectly. But people were finding their way past.

After a few weeks his social skills had already improved; he was becoming more patient and better at working in groups. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/21/melbourne-city-win-w-league-grand-final-behind-closed-doors\">Melbourne City win W-League grand final behind closed doors</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As they were getting ready to go to training earlier this week, they got the news that all grassroots football had been postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Heartbroken, the boy picked up his brand-new size-5 ball and shuffled off to his room. He fell asleep with his boots and his shin-pads still on.</p> <p>There\u2019s been a lot of talk over the past week about what football means and why it matters. Even though sport itself has ground to a halt, the columns (including this one) have rolled onward. </p> <p>Who cares, some have asked, about sport \u2013 this thing that amounts to little more than a pageant of characters moving across a stage made of grass or wood or water \u2013 in \u2018times like these\u2019? What will sport look like once the curtains and the ropes fall away? To whom does sport turn if its audience\u2019s priorities are hastily, maybe irreversibly, rearranged? How will we keep the lights on?</p> <p>There, at least, lies one of sport\u2019s rapidly-shrinking offerings: a space where we can have these conversations. Ironically, it\u2019s in sport\u2019s collapse that its true value \u2013 and the value of all things, really \u2013 is being honestly discussed. We\u2019ve oscillated from sport meaning everything to sport meaning nothing, and now we\u2019ve landed somewhere in between: where meaning and value is relative, where things can be unimportant globally but still matter, sometimes profoundly so, to you.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e074ed269de0c6029ad5b2b8e93458511131e04\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e074ed269de0c6029ad5b2b8e93458511131e04/0_146_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steph Catley\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steph Catley of Melbourne City and her teammates celebrate winning the W-League grand final at an empty AAMI Park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Barbour/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Saturday afternoon\u2019s W-League final between Melbourne City and Sydney FC was, for 90 minutes, that conversation. In the grand scheme of things, as captains Steph Catley and Teresa Polias said in the days leading into it, this game didn\u2019t matter. Compared to the world outside, playing a game and winning a trophy doesn\u2019t matter. And while many have used the image of empty grandstands as a metaphor for sport\u2019s ultimate superfluousness, there is an inverse meaning to be found in this stripping-away of the colour and noise. Rather than show us why football doesn\u2019t matter in this global crisis, the W-League final \u2013 the thing on the pitch \u2013 showed us exactly why it does.</p> <p>For while the usually-heaving AAMI Park was empty after Football Federation Australia\u2019s behind-closed-doors ruling, you could still hear the gasps and the shouts of encouragement from the specially-invited family and friends scattered behind the benches.

      "bodyText": "My mother told me a story recently about her friend\u2019s young son who has autism. He finds it difficult to make friends and to concentrate at school, so this year his dad signed him up for his first season of football. After a few weeks his social skills had already improved; he was becoming more patient and better at working in groups. As they were getting ready to go to training earlier this week, they got the news that all grassroots football had been postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Heartbroken, the boy picked up his brand-new size-5 ball and shuffled off to his room. He fell asleep with his boots and his shin-pads still on. There\u2019s been a lot of talk over the past week about what football means and why it matters. Even though sport itself has ground to a halt, the columns (including this one) have rolled onward. Who cares, some have asked, about sport \u2013 this thing that amounts to little more than a pageant of characters moving across a stage made of grass or wood or water \u2013 in \u2018times like these\u2019? What will sport look like once the curtains and the ropes fall away? To whom does sport turn if its audience\u2019s priorities are hastily, maybe irreversibly, rearranged? How will we keep the lights on? There, at least, lies one of sport\u2019s rapidly-shrinking offerings: a space where we can have these conversations. Ironically, it\u2019s in sport\u2019s collapse that its true value \u2013 and the value of all things, really \u2013 is being honestly discussed. We\u2019ve oscillated from sport meaning everything to sport meaning nothing, and now we\u2019ve landed somewhere in between: where meaning and value is relative, where things can be unimportant globally but still matter, sometimes profoundly so, to you. Saturday afternoon\u2019s W-League final between Melbourne City and Sydney FC was, for 90 minutes, that conversation. In the grand scheme of things, as captains Steph Catley and Teresa Polias said in the days leading into it, this game didn\u2019t matter. Compared to the world outside, playing a game and winning a trophy doesn\u2019t matter. And while many have used the image of empty grandstands as a metaphor for sport\u2019s ultimate superfluousness, there is an inverse meaning to be found in this stripping-away of the colour and noise. Rather than show us why football doesn\u2019t matter in this global crisis, the W-League final \u2013 the thing on the pitch \u2013 showed us exactly why it does. For while the usually-heaving AAMI Park was empty after Football Federation Australia\u2019s behind-closed-doors ruling, you could still hear the gasps and the shouts of encouragement from the specially-invited family and friends scattered behind the benches. You could still see the reserve players pausing their warm-ups to applaud their team-mates for solid tackles and clever one-twos. And while regular fans were banned from the stadium, you could still watch them congregate elsewhere; organising online watch-parties and group chats from their various rooms in their various cities, isolated but not alone. This is one possible silver lining to football\u2019s global shutdown: the 2019-20 W-League final could be one of the most-watched Australian women\u2019s club games ever. Guardian Australia\u2019s liveblog tracked viewers not just around the country but around the planet, from the US and the UK to South Africa, Nigeria and India. What they saw, though, wasn\u2019t the \u201cproduct\u201d that professional football has become; the waves of branded fans, the glamorous stadium, the slick studio productions, the celebrity pundits.

      "bodyText": "The government has announced a second major economic rescue package worth $66bn, on top of an initial $17.6bn package and more than $100bn in emergency banking measures to prevent against a credit freeze. Framed as a \u201csafety\u201d package, the second wave of stimulus ramps up support for small business and also includes a major boost to welfare recipients and for people who lose work as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. The new suite of measures was described by prime minister Scott Morrison on Sunday as \u201cunprecedented\u201d and targeted at those on the front line who will be first to feel the hit of the downturn. In total, the government has now committed economic support worth $189bn \u2013 almost 10% of GDP \u2013 and has also flagged more packages as the crisis unfolds. So what does it mean for you? I am on income support \u2013 or might soon be \u2013 what will I get? The government announced in its second package that it is establishing a new, time-limited coronavirus supplement to be paid at a rate of $550 per fortnight for the next six months at a cost of $14.1bn. This will effectively double the current rate of Newstart, which is being renamed the jobseeker payment. (The rebranding was already under way.) The coronavirus supplement will be paid for the next six months. Eligible income support recipients will receive the full amount of the $550 coronavirus supplement on top of their payment each fortnight. Who is eligible? The extra payment will be paid to both existing and new recipients of the jobseeker payment, youth allowance jobseeker, parenting payment, farm household allowance and special benefit. Eligible income support recipients will receive the full amount of the $550 coronavirus supplement on top of their payment each fortnight. The government will also waive the asset test and waiting periods to access the payment. A full list of eligibility requirements is available here. I\u2019m a sole trader or self-employed, will I be able to access this payment? Yes. The government has announced that in the case of sole traders and the self-employed, anyone impacted by the economic downturn triggered by the coronavirus will be able to access the jobseeker payment and the coronavirus supplement. Applicants will make a declaration to Centrelink that their business has been suspended or had turnover reduced significantly as a result of the downturn. Sole traders that become eligible for the jobseeker payment will automatically meet their mutual obligation requirements during this period by continuing to develop and sustain their business. What about the $750 payment? In the first package, the government announced that 6.5 million lower-income Australians would receive a one-off $750 payment aimed at boosting domestic demand in the economy, costing the budget $4.76bn. The payment \u2013 which will be made from 31 March \u2013 will be made to all social security, veteran and other income support recipients and eligible concession card holders. This includes those on Newstart, those who have commonwealth seniors health cards, and families receiving family tax benefits. Around half of those that will benefit are pensioners. Full details of which payment recipients are eligible are available here. The first payment will be made from 31 March 2020 to people who will have been on one of the eligible payments any time between 12 March 2020 and 13 April 2020. Who will receive the second $750 payment? In the second package, the government has announced that it will provide an extra $750 payment to social security and veteran income support recipients and eligible concession cardholders. This won\u2019t be available if you get the $550-a-fortnight coronavirus supplement. This second payment will be made automatically from 13 July 2020 to around five million social security, veteran and other income support recipients and eligible concession cardholders. Around half of those that benefit are pensioners. To check if you are eligible, the full list is here. If you are eligible, you will receive the payment automatically. What\u2019s the deal with the superannuation changes? Can I now access my super? Under the changes announced in the second package, the government will allow individuals \u201cin financial stress\u201d as a result of the coronavirus downturn to have limited access to their superannuation savings, in a move costing $1.2bn. The amount you can access will be capped at up to $10,000 of their superannuation in 2019-20 and a further $10,000 in 2020-21. How do I prove I am financially distressed? You will be able to access your super if you are unemployed or eligible to receive a jobseeker payment, youth allowance for jobseekers, parenting payment (which includes the single and partnered payments), special benefit or the farm household allowance. Additionally, if after 1 January 2020 you were made redundant or your working hours were reduced by 20% or more you will also be granted access. Sole traders that have their business suspended or have a reduction in turnover of 20% or more are also eligible. How do I access my savings? Eligible individuals will be able to apply online through MyGov for access of up to $10,000 of their superannuation before 1 July 2020. They will also be able to access up to a further $10,000 from 1 July 2020 for another three months. They will not need to pay tax on amounts released and the money they withdraw will not affect Centrelink or veterans\u2019 affairs payments. What if I am a retiree? The government is also announcing a temporary reduction in superannuation minimum drawdown rates for account-based pensions and similar products. This will be a 50% reduction in the rate for 2019-20 and 2020-21, which the government says will benefit retirees by providing them with more flexibility as to how they manage their superannuation assets. And deeming rates for pensioners? How are they affected? If you are not sure what deeming rates are, you can find more information here. The government announced changes in both the first and second stimulus packages. On top of the deeming rate changes made at the time of the first package, the government is reducing the deeming rates by a further 0.25 percentage points to reflect the latest rate reductions by the RBA. As of 1 May 2020, the lower deeming rate will be 0.25% and the upper deeming rate will be 2.25%. The change will benefit around 900,000 income support recipients, including age pensioners. This measure is estimated to cost $876m over the forward estimates period. I am a small business. How is the government helping me? The latest package ramps up a previous wage subsidy to small business which will be increased from a $25,000 cash refund to a maximum payment of $100,000. The payment is open to businesses with a turnover less than $50m and also for not-for-profit charities. In round one, the measure was worth $6.7bn. Increasing the payment to $100,000 adds an extra $25.2bn in support, bringing the total to $31.9bn. How does it work? The tax-free payment is worth 100% of the tax that small and medium-sized businesses withhold from their employees\u2019 salary and wages up to a maximum amount of $100,000. The amount will be paid automatically by the Australian Taxation Office based on the business\u2019s monthly or quarterly business activity statements. This means it will be directly linked to keeping someone employed as the tax is calculated and withheld based on a worker\u2019s wage. Eligible businesses that pay salary and wages will receive a minimum payment of $20,000, even if they are not required to withhold tax. How many people will this help? The government estimates the payments will benefit around 690,000 businesses employing around 7.8 million people and 30,000 not-for-profits. What about loan guarantees? The government has also announced a new \u201ccoronavirus SME guarantee scheme\u201d, which will support lending to small and medium-sized businesses worth $40bn. It will be available to all businesses with a turnover of less than $50m. How does this work? Under the proposal, the commonwealth will guarantee 50% of an eligible loan through participating banks and non-bank lenders to businesses disrupted by the coronavirus. Loans will be used for working capital purposes and be unsecured and it will be for loans granted within six months starting 1 April 2020. Lenders will not be charged a fee for accessing the guarantee scheme. Loans will be repayment-free for six months. The maximum that can be borrowed under the guarantee facility will be $250,000 on terms up to three years. Do apprentices get help? Yes. In the first package, the government announced that employers would receive support to keep people in jobs. This will see $1.2bn made available as a wage subsidy of 50% of the apprentice\u2019s or trainee\u2019s wage for up to nine months from 1 January 2020 to 30 September 2020. Where a small business is not able to retain an apprentice, the subsidy will be made available to a new employer that employs that apprentice, whether that is a large business or a registered training organisation. The government estimates that up to 70,000 small businesses will access the incentive to support around 117,000 apprentices. What are the business investment incentives? In addition the business support announced in the second stimulus, the government keeps in place incentives worth $3.9bn aimed at encouraging businesses to spend. This includes increasing the instant asset write-off, by lifting the threshold to $150,000 (from $30,000) \u2013 and making more businesses eligible to use it. It will also introduce a time-limited 15-month incentive to invest, by accelerating depreciation deductions. Who is eligible and how do these incentives work? Businesses with a turnover of less than $500m will be able to deduct 50% of the cost of an eligible asset on installation, with existing depreciation rules applying to the balance of the asset\u2019s cost. The investment measures are expected to support more than 3.5 million businesses (over 99% of businesses) employing more than 9.7 million employees. What if I am in an affected industry? What support is being provided? In addition to the support for businesses and individuals that have been announced by the government, extra measures aimed at particular sectors have also been announced. This includes a $715m package for the aviation sector and a $1bn fund for regions \u201cdisproportionately\u201d affected by the coronavirus outbreak. These include areas heavily reliant on industries such as tourism, agriculture and education. Details of this fund are still being finalised. Is that it? No. The government says there will be more support coming. Morrison said on Sunday that the first two packages were focused \u201con those who are going to feel the first blows\u201d, but more would be needed over the next six months. \u201cThere will be more packages and more support,\u201d Morrison said.",

      "bodyText": "Australians who are laid off as a result of the coronavirus outbreak will be allowed to pull money out of their superannuation, Scott Morrison announced on Sunday. Withdrawals will be capped at $10,000 this financial year, and a further $10,000 next financial year, and will be tax-free, the prime minister and his treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said. The withdrawals will be available from April to those eligible for the coronavirus supplement as well as sole traders whose hours or income has fallen 20% or more as a result of coronavirus. The decision means some of those worst-hit by the outbreak will be able to pay rent, meet mortgage repayments and buy food. It also goes some way towards satisfying some, mainly on the right, who dislike compulsory super and have long seen early access as a way to weaken the sector \u2013 especially the much-hated industry funds that are jointly controlled by unions and employers. But it also means that if and when the crisis ends people who have drawn down will suffer a permanent hit to their retirement incomes \u2013 made worse by the fact that the sharemarket, where around half of super is invested, is down by a third due to the pandemic. Those most likely to need emergency cash are also those most likely to have low balances to begin with. The average balance of members of Hostplus, the industry fund that services the virus-ravaged hospitality and tourism sectors, is just $37,000. Because the sector is full of casuals and part-time workers, many will have much, much lower balances which they will exhaust if they draw down on their super. The move also presents a challenge to funds such as Hostplus and the retail industry fund Rest, which are likely to be inundated with redemption requests. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said that the super fund regulator, Apra, has assured him the move won\u2019t have \u201ca significant impact on the industry overall\u201d. The key words is \u201coverall\u201d. Every fund is different. To chase returns, funds have invested some of members\u2019 cash directly in so-called \u201cilliquid\u201d assets like airports, seaports and real estate, rather than in listed companies. They\u2019ve been able to do this while still meeting the flow of redemption requests because in normal times they have a very good grasp on how many people are likely to retire and need to start drawing down on their account in any one year. The flow of redemptions has easily been met by the amount invested in \u201cliquid\u201d assets \u2013 cash or easy-to-sell assets like shares. But selling an airport, for example, takes a while at the best of times. These are not the best of times, and who would want to buy an airport right now anyway, when there\u2019s no traffic? And at what price? Hopefully no funds will be forced to freeze redemptions \u2013 as some did during the global financial crisis \u2013 or seek a government bailout. But even in the best-case scenario, the decision to allow drawdowns will crimp the ability of super funds to invest in long-term, high-growth assets when the much-hoped-for economic recovery finally kicks in. This is because it will suck out the cash of younger members who normally could be relied upon to stay in their super accounts for decades, skewing the system towards older people who are going to need their money sooner rather than later. Super funds will have to hold more cash and shares to meet those redemption needs. When people become used to drawing down on their super it will also be difficult to turn off the tap once the crisis ends. First homebuyers are already able to withdraw up to $30,000 of super to help buy a house, and the pressure will be on to allow yet more exemptions. This weakening of the super system has long been desired by some on the right who are suspicious about and hostile to industry super\u2019s association with the unions and the broader sector\u2019s love of long-term assets.",

      "bodyText": "Australia is approaching a nationwide lockdown, akin to those seen overseas, with states and territories closing their borders and enforcing mandatory self-isolation on travellers. Scott Morrison has told Australians to avoid all \u201cnon-essential\u201d travel, in particular interstate travel and longer distances intrastate. Four jurisdictions \u2013 the Northern Territory, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania \u2013 have effectively closed their borders to outside travel, while the ACT has urged all non-essential travel into surrounding NSW to be postponed. What does \u2018non-essential\u2019 mean? Under the national guidelines, travel to school, to workplaces and to shops to buy staples are all considered essential, as is travel on compassionate grounds, or for emergencies. The use of public transport for school or work is also considered essential. Australia\u2019s health department defines essential and non-essential events, for which travel is necessary. Essential activities also include healthcare appointments and pharmacy visits. On Sunday Victoria, NSW and the ACT all said they would be closing down many non-essential services over the following 48 hours, citing petrol stations, supermarkets, banks, pharmacies, freight and logistics and home delivery services among those deemed essential. That would override previous national definitions of non-essential indoor gatherings of fewer than 100 people (including staff), which included: cinemas and theatres; restaurants, cafes, pubs and clubs; weddings; funerals. Holiday travel interstate is non-essential. Holiday plans should be abandoned, the prime minister said. People should stay at home. But the definition of non-essential is dependent on individual circumstance, and the government has urged Australians to consider the health of the community\u2019s most vulnerable in deciding whether travel is essential or not. Exercise \u2018common sense\u2019 In his press conference Sunday, the prime minister defined \u201cnon-essential travel\u201d as \u201cthe sort of travel that would not be normally part of your normal life\u201d. \u201cGoing to the shops is something you have to do, get into work, other important tasks you have to do on a daily basis, but I think Australians can exercise their common sense about things they know are not essential and this is again the point I am making to people: we will give you as many rules and as many guidelines as we can but we need you to think carefully about what you are doing and your behaviour and the impact it has on others.\u201d Cancel all holidays Morrison said all holiday plans \u2013 international and interstate \u2013 should be postponed. \u201c[Cancelling non-essential travel] does mean that those holidays that you may have been planning to take interstate over the school holidays are cancelled. It is regrettable and I know the impact it will have on many people in those communities where those holidays were going to take place. These decisions are not taken lightly.\u201d Overseas travel is warned against by the Australian government, which has issued a level 4 advisory \u2013 the highest level: \u201cWe now advise all Australians: do not travel overseas at this time. \u201cRegardless of your destination, age or health, our advice is do not travel at this time.\u201d State and territory restrictions Tasmania was the first state to close its borders. All non-essential travellers to Tasmania will be required to self-isolate for a fortnight. The Northern Territory, Western Australia and South Australia have also announced border closures. South Australia will close its borders from 4pm Tuesday, with 12 designated crossing points. Travellers will be required to sign a declaration about their health and willingness to undertake mandatory self-isolation for two weeks. Also from 4pm Tuesday, anyone crossing the Northern Territory\u2019s borders into that jurisdiction will be required to self-isolate for a fortnight, with exemptions granted for \u201cessential arrivals\u201d such as health and emergency services, defence force members and police, flight crews and freight. Western Australia is closing its borders to all travellers from 1.30pm local time on Tuesday. Anyone arriving after that date will have to self-isolate for 14 days. The premier, Mark McGowan, urged prospective interstate visitors to cancel holidays they had booked in WA, \u201cotherwise you\u2019re going to be required to self-isolate\u201d. The ACT chief minister, Andrew Barr, said on Sunday the territory could not close its borders (given its small size and being surrounded by NSW), but the ACT had advised that non-essential travel by ACT residents should be suspended. \u201cThe only travel outside of the Canberra region should be for work, for compassionate reasons, and to ensure the essential supplies and services that our region needs. If you travel to the ACT for work or for your essential services, you are considered to be part of the Canberra region. We are urging Canberrans to take a common sense approach to this instruction. And carefully consider whether you need to travel outside of our region for any of these reasons,\u201d Barr said. \u201cThis means no holidays on the south coast. This means no weekends in Sydney or Melbourne. Visiting family and friends outside of the Canberra region has to be carefully considered and if it is not essential, do not do it.\u201d",

Instead, the Morrison government has instituted what one welfare expert called the largest-ever boost to benefits in Australia, committing to spend $14bn over six months on what it is calling a temporary \u201ccoronavirus supplement\u201d. The mammoth but \u201ctime limited\u201d increase to unemployment benefits far exceeds the most recent call from welfare groups for a permanent, $95- a-week boost to the dole, worth $4bn a year. Under sweeping changes to the welfare system, the government will also expand access to unemployment benefits by waiving the liquid assets waiting test, which will allow people to access income support without whittling down their savings. Prospective welfare recipients will no longer need to attend a Centrelink office to complete their claim, and the application process will be streamlined. The changes reflect the impending reality that thousands more people are set to engage with the welfare system in the coming months, including many for the first time in their lives. Crucially, although the Jobseeker Payment will still taper down according to the recipient\u2019s earnings, the additional $550 coronavirus fortnightly supplement will be paid in full as long as the person remains eligible for the dole. Already, about one million people receive payments that will make a person eligible for the extra $550 a fortnight: JobSeeker payment, Youth Allowance (Jobseeker), parenting payments, the farm household allowance and special benefit.

It will not apply to those who receive the $550 per fortnight coronavirus supplement. Welfare groups, unemployed activist organisations and their political allies have campaigned for years for an increase in benefits for jobseekers. The increase is the largest since the dole was introduced in the 1940s, Prof Peter Whiteford, of the ANU\u2019s Crawford School, told the Guardian. \u201cThis will come as a huge relief to so many right now,\u201d said the Australian Council of Social Service\u2019s Cassandra Goldie. \u201cThis increase is vital in order to prevent more people from falling into the poverty trap.\u201d Labor\u2019s treasury spokesman, Jim Chalmers, said the opposition was concerned some groups missed out on the coronavirus supplement, specifically noting that students were not eligible, \u201ceven if they lose their part-time job or have their hours cut\u201d. He was also concerned the lump sum payments for pensioners and other social security recipients would not flow fast enough. Although the boost to income support payments was widely welcomed by advocates, some also called for a more permanent change once the temporary supplement expires. The Greens senator Rachel Siewert, who has long called for an increase to unemployment benefits, said it was now \u201cabsolutely untenable to drop people back onto $40 a day\u201d when the crisis passed. The Australian Unemployed Workers Union also backed the increase, but was also disappointed that some welfare recipients, including students on Youth Allowance, Austudy and Abstudy, and those on disability support pensions, were excluded. While rates vary significantly, many students who receive Youth Allowance and Austudy receive about $465 a fortnight, while disability and aged pensioners get about $950 a fortnight. The boost to the unemployment benefit means jobseekers will now get more than people on the aged pension and disability support pension, who the welfare system acknowledges have limited or no earning power. However, they will be among the groups who receive two $750 lump sums, at the end of March and in July. Anticipating a deluge of claims, the government has also streamlined the application process and pledged to hire up to 5,000 staff at Services Australia, which runs Centrelink.",

The Miss World of 1970 was a concatenation of late-60s anger, a perfect storm in which feminist activists and similarly justified anti-apartheid movers and shakers descended, colliding and sometimes colluding, on the Albert Hall, and the world shifted a twitch on its axis.</p> <p>Hot on the heels of the new film <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/14/misbehaviour-review-miss-world-contest-jessie-buckley-gugu-mbatha-raw\" title=\"\">Misbehaviour</a></em>, a quite marvellous BBC Two documentary, <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000gghb\" title=\"\">Miss World 1970: Beauty Queens and Bedlam</a></strong>, sought, through tracking down a gratifying number of original participants, to convey just what a shock to the televisual assumptions of the time this must have been. As the woeful guest host Bob Hope stumbled through his patter, every patronising sneer or lustful lech unbelievably lower than the previous low, one activist stood up on the plush balcony and shook a football rattle: the signal for 100 feminists, sprinkled secretly throughout, to launch smoke bombs and pamphlets on the spangled audience below. And launched niggling thoughts, surely, in a tiny fraction of the 100 million viewers watching.</p> <p>And the world shifted on its axis, though it wasn\u2019t for the want of trying to stop it by the British press. The interrupters were near universally vilified as hairy-legged lesbians. And, coincidentally, two women of colour had triumphed: Miss Grenada won, Miss Africa South had trumped white Miss South Africa \u2013 a risibly false distinction by which that country\u2019s government was still seeking to segregate, only to be bitten right on the arse \u2013 to come second. They had it even worse than the feminist campaigners, with an odious News of the Screws headline: \u201cWell, <em>is</em> she the most beautiful girl in the world?\u201d seeking to suggest that a black woman could never be considered anyone\u2019s version of idealised beauty.</p> <p>But shift it did.

The other thing that struck was how graceful and eloquent both campaigners and contestants have become in late middle age: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/09/miss-world-contest-1970-new-film-misbehaviour-jennifer-hosten-first-black-winner\" title=\"\">Jennifer Hosten</a> and runner-up Pearl Jansen were mightily impressive, having become in their own way activists, even feminists; no less so the spirited ex-squatters.

There are jokes about 70s TV detectives, oat milk, newfangled \u201cpodcasts\u201d. One running gag is that everyone looks to their phones after the microwave pings. It is amusing precisely once. At one stage Kate (Blethyn) reprimands Koji (Akingbola) for getting pedantic about apostrophes with \u201call right Doc, no need to go all Rees-Mogg on us!\u201d, as if one had to go to Eton (because it\u2019s posh, see!) in order to have an outside chance of grasping the basics of the English language: it\u2019s that kind of lowest-com-denom writing. Utterly unhelped \u2013 in fact, hog-tied at the knees \u2013 by a canned laughter track that gives it not just the content but the feel of something that could have surfaced a full 30 years ago. There\u2019s even a rival \u2013 snobby \u2013 interfering councillor in the shape of Barbara Flynn.</p> <p>It\u2019s not unsalvageable. There\u2019s a (slight) warmth to be had in Kate\u2019s unthawing towards the 21st century, her refreshing lack of the old prejudices. Some gags show spark, but you don\u2019t even get to enjoy the spark, already tensing at the collective awfulness of the wave of laughter that you know is bound to tsunami in.</p>",

Bulletproof returned, with supercops Ashley Walters and Noel Clarke once again kicking bottom all over London. It\u2019s no Top Boy, and even less so any vestige of The Wire, but, in that Walters/Clarke chemistry, thoroughgoing enjoyable. As long as \u2013 and this is crucial \u2013 you take it for precisely what it is. It\u2019s a Laandan crime caper, innit? With beguiling leads, grand music, a certain ambient murk: a winning lack of pretension. What a pedigree Kate &amp; Koji appeared to have. Co-stars in Brenda Blethyn and Jimmy Akingbola, written by Guy Jenkin and Andy Hamilton (Drop the Dead Donkey, Outnumbered), and a bonkers-but-might-work premise about an asylum-seeking African doctor setting up a temporary surgery in a seaside caff in exchange for square meals from the reactionary biddy of an owner. My, it\u2019s grim, and what were you at all thinking, our sainted Auntie Vera? There are jokes about 70s TV detectives, oat milk, newfangled \u201cpodcasts\u201d. One running gag is that everyone looks to their phones after the microwave pings. It is amusing precisely once. At one stage Kate (Blethyn) reprimands Koji (Akingbola) for getting pedantic about apostrophes with \u201call right Doc, no need to go all Rees-Mogg on us!\u201d, as if one had to go to Eton (because it\u2019s posh, see!) in order to have an outside chance of grasping the basics of the English language: it\u2019s that kind of lowest-com-denom writing. Utterly unhelped \u2013 in fact, hog-tied at the knees \u2013 by a canned laughter track that gives it not just the content but the feel of something that could have surfaced a full 30 years ago. There\u2019s even a rival \u2013 snobby \u2013 interfering councillor in the shape of Barbara Flynn. It\u2019s not unsalvageable. There\u2019s a (slight) warmth to be had in Kate\u2019s unthawing towards the 21st century, her refreshing lack of the old prejudices. Some gags show spark, but you don\u2019t even get to enjoy the spark, already tensing at the collective awfulness of the wave of laughter that you know is bound to tsunami in.",

      "body": "<p>On Thursday, Northwick Park hospital in London declared a critical incident when it <a href=\"https://www.hsj.co.uk/news/hospitals-critical-care-unit-overwhelmed-by-coronavirus-patients/7027189.article\" title=\"\">ran out of intensive care beds</a> after a surge in the number of coronavirus patients coming through its doors. It is a sign that, in London, the spread of Covid-19 is already threatening to overwhelm hospital capacity. Other areas of the country will not be far behind. As infection rates rise, and the death toll inevitably increases, the experiences of other countries tell us that things will get much worse before they get better. We have been asked by the government to adopt a range of social distancing measures that, so far, have been less stringent than those adopted elsewhere. We implore our readers to stay home to save lives.</p> <p>Scrutiny of the government\u2019s response continues. To ask hard questions about what the government has so far got right and wrong is not to needlessly politicise a crisis: it is to hold our leaders to account in order to ensure that mistakes do not continue. Some aspects of government have inspired great confidence in the last week, others have sowed apprehension and trepidation among scientists and experts.</p> <h2>Why weren\u2019t we ready?<br></h2> <p>The first set of very real concerns are about the government\u2019s preparedness for the crisis; in the present, and ahead. Only last Monday did Matt Hancock, the health secretary, issue a public call for companies that might be able to assist with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/17/uk-manufacturers-regear-factories-build-ventilators-nhs\" title=\"\">ventilator production</a> to contact government. There are now three industrial consortia working quickly to develop a prototype of a medical ventilator that can be manufactured within a month. But the timing of Hancock\u2019s call raises the question: why were these efforts not under way weeks ago, when <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext\" title=\"\">scientists in China</a> were warning the world of the risk of a deadly pandemic? Similarly, the UK\u2019s lack of coronavirus testing capacity is holding it back from pursuing the strategies of mass testing, contact tracing and isolation that have been so successful in holding down infection and mortality rates in South Korea; there is insufficient capacity even to test frontline NHS and care workers who start to display symptoms, meaning they must immediately self-isolate. Why was testing capacity not expanded in preparation for this pandemic?</p> <p>We cannot change where we are now: but it is by understanding the answers to these questions that government can ensure similar errors of forward planning do not cost lives. In particular, the government must be thinking ahead about solutions such as ordering, in good time, those manufacturers who can do so to switch to the production of goods that will be critical in helping the country to weather this crisis.</p> <p>Second, there are real questions about the government\u2019s communications capabilities. In a public health crisis that relies so heavily on changing behaviour in order to control the spread of the outbreak, communication is not an optional extra: it is a critical tool in the fight to save lives. To its credit, Downing Street quickly responded to criticisms of being slow off the mark by introducing a daily press conference last week. But inaccurate news has continued to dribble out from government sources before those briefings; for example, the idea that London would soon see the imposition of a lockdown, which further fuelled panic buying. The government has been to slow to adopt effective messaging to discourage the public from stockpiling.</p> <p>Worryingly, the prime minister himself does not inspire confidence. He has struck the wrong tone at his press conferences, undermining the seriousness of the government message to stay at home as much as possible, for example suggesting that <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-mum-coronavirus-mothers-day-self-isolate-tv-address-today-a9415496.html\" title=\"\">he hoped to see his mother today on Mother\u2019s</a><a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-mum-coronavirus-mothers-day-self-isolate-tv-address-today-a9415496.html\" title=\"\"> Day</a> (a mistake his advisers sought to correct afterwards). His way of speaking to the nation stands in stark contrast to that of Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland, and Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, both of whom have struck far more capable, sober and reassuring tones.</p> <p>Third, there are concerns about the government\u2019s strategy to contain the spread of the virus, which is more lax than those adopted by European countries such as Italy, Spain and France. There appears to be disagreement among scientific and behavioural experts about the extent to which the government\u2019s delays will reduce deaths over the medium term by allowing it to keep stringent restrictions in place for longer when infection rates are even higher than they are now; or whether it is needlessly costing lives. Only time will tell.</p> <p>But, given our lack of testing capacity, a more stringent approach now could presumably buy more time to increase ventilator, critical care and testing capacity. The government distanced itself from its explicit suggestion that it was consciously trying to develop herd immunity by allowing 60% of the population to become infected in the coming months, once it realised that this would result in an intolerable number of deaths. We need confidence that Boris Johnson will not hesitate to introduce stricter restrictions in order to save lives, regardless of any personal distaste he may feel for temporary curtailments on people\u2019s liberties.</p> <h2>Cometh the chancellor</h2> <p>The government\u2019s economic response, coordinated by Sunak, has been far more confidence-inspiring. We applaud the chancellor for taking swift action to intervene to save jobs and increase the generosity of a benefits system that has been devastated by 10 years of austerity inflicted by his predecessors. The Treasury has announced that it will pay 80% of wages, up to \u00a32,500 a month, for employees that have been furloughed by their employers. In addition, the standard annual allowance of universal credit has been increased by \u00a31,000 for a year, and the link between housing benefit and local rents has been restored. This is a sorely needed package of measures that will run into the tens of billions at least. But as the <a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/press-releases/government-sets-out-unprecedented-but-essential-pledges-to-underwrite-wages-and-strengthen-the-safety-net/\" title=\"\">Resolution Foundation</a> has pointed out, there are significant gaps: there is very limited support for the self-employed, most of whom will have to claim unemployment benefit, and for the two million workers who do not earn enough to qualify for statutory sick pay.</p> <p>Many families will struggle to cope with the impacts of social distancing on their physical, mental and financial wellbeing. But those who have safe places to isolate are in an immeasurably better position than some of the most vulnerable and destitute in our society. There has been far too little action on protecting homeless people, those locked up in prison and immigration detention, vulnerable children and victims of domestic abuse. The government must urgently make more funding available to allow local authorities to take extraordinary action, for example, to follow the mayor of London\u2019s lead in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/21/coronavirus-live-updates-deaths-jump-in-spain-and-italy-millions-locked-down-in-us?page=with:block-5e75f9e88f08e0999e6b797c#block-5e75f9e88f08e0999e6b797c\" title=\"\">block-booking hotel rooms</a> in which to temporarily house homeless people.</p> <h2>We all have a role</h2> <p>The government has a critical role to play in minimising the death toll and economic pain that will result from this pandemic. But we cannot simply rely on government to get us through this. It is down to all of us: to businesses and employers, to civil society and to individuals to take government advice seriously and refrain from panic buying, to ensure that critical workers and those at risk are also able to feed their families. Even as some businesses have stepped up \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/21/coronavirus-live-updates-deaths-jump-in-spain-and-italy-millions-locked-down-in-us?page=with:block-5e75f4f88f08a08573fbedde#block-5e75f4f88f08a08573fbedde\" title=\"\">shifting manufacturing to produce hand sanitiser</a> for those in need and donating stock to food banks \u2013 others have sacked and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/21/scottish-hotel-admin-error-sacking-staff-covid-19\" title=\"\">made their employees homeless</a> with no notice, and extracted tens of millions in dividends for their owners while going cap in hand to the government for taxpayer support.</p> <p>Even as some people have thrown themselves into organising local aid groups for those who have to self-isolate, others have sought to profiteer by bulk buying and re-selling goods such as <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/coronavirus-desperate-mums-forced-pay-21717944\" title=\"\">baby formula</a>. Even as millions have heeded government advice to save lives and protect the NHS frontline by staying at home, others packed into pubs on Friday night for their last day of opening, no doubt encouraged by those like the Wetherspoons boss, Tim Martin, who have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/20/coronavirus-wetherspoons-boss-says-uk-pubs-will-stay-open-as-long-as-possible\" title=\"\">undermined government messaging</a> to try to protect their business.</p> <p>Perhaps a crisis of this sort was always going to hold up a mirror to the best and the worst of us. But it is within all of our power to ensure that we look after each other and do all we can manage to minimise the number of lives that will be claimed by this pandemic. Every day, NHS staff and care workers, teachers and nursery workers, delivery drivers and supermarket staff are exposing themselves to greater risk to ensure that people are cared for and can eat while we fight this threat. Every day, older people and the immuno-compromised will be self-isolating, worried about the possibility of contracting a virus that could cost their life. It falls to the rest of us to guard them from harm as much as we can. Stay at home; protect the NHS; save lives.</p>",

The party has no money, no policies and no obvious attraction for voters when the Lib Dems are offering much the same but with more chance of winning.</p> <p>Her Brexit party opponent in the south-west, where she is standing, is the ex-Tory minister Ann Widdecombe, whom she can\u2019t stand (they <a href=\"https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2018/01/19/celebrity-big-brother-rachel-johnson-evicted-calls-ann-widdecombe-a-misogynist/\" title=\"\">met and clashed in the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2018/01/19/celebrity-big-brother-rachel-johnson-evicted-calls-ann-widdecombe-a-misogynist/\" title=\"\">Celebrity Big Brother </a></em><a href=\"https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2018/01/19/celebrity-big-brother-rachel-johnson-evicted-calls-ann-widdecombe-a-misogynist/\" title=\"\">house,</a> of all places) but who still runs rings around her. Deployed as Change UK\u2019s celebrity secret weapon, Johnson ends up looking more like a liability, effortlessly skewered by the <em>Today</em> programme, and giving a disastrous interview to the <em>Times </em>in which she describes herself as a \u201crat on a sinking ship\u201d.</p> <p>There is something gloriously refreshing about an account of political failure in which nobody is trying to excuse or hide the buttock-clenching awfulness of it. But despite the refusal to indulge in self-pity, this is the most uncomfortable part of the book. The party would have crashed and burned without her putting her foot in it, but after all those years on Fleet Street did she really not know better? It\u2019s impossible not to sympathise with the blameless colleagues forced, not for the first time, to clean up behind her. And, yes, all that does remind me of someone.</p> <p>\u201cDoing what we are told not to do is a family trait,\u201d she writes. But so is what she calls the Johnson \u201cdeath wish\u201d, a compulsive desire to say exactly the wrong thing in public. These mini-explosions are not exactly gaffes, but more like the call of the void \u2013 that inexplicable urge to jump that some people feel when standing next to a sheer drop. Even when they know it\u2019s grossly inappropriate, the Johnson instinct is, she writes, to turn everything into \u201ca competition, a game or a joke\u201d, like commitment-phobes who shy away the minute a lover gets serious.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04e25f6f995c9b728e5910f46ce2e3f4d0b18179\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04e25f6f995c9b728e5910f46ce2e3f4d0b18179/0_9_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson and Rachel Johnson attend the London Evening Standard\u2019s 1000 Most Influential Londoners.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson and Rachel Johnson attend the London Evening Standard\u2019s 1000 Most Influential Londoners.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David M Benett/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a remorselessly competitive family \u2013 in which Rachel speculates that Boris\u2019s Euroscepticism might in part reflect a private \u201cOedipal struggle\u201d with his pro-European father \u2013 publicly standing against your own brother\u2019s party in an election is forgivable. But to let slip that you cared about it more than you let on, that you meant it \u2013 well, that would almost be more shocking.</p> <p>Was Rachel Johnson ever serious about standing? To a journalist all life is potential copy, but my hunch is that this was more than a cynical exercise in finding something new to write about. Brexit to her is a \u201ccompass error, harder to correct with every mile travelled\u201d that directly threatens her own children\u2019s futures; she was genuinely afraid, she writes, of what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/27/nigel-farage-immigration-is-not-being-talked-about-enough\" title=\"\">Nigel Farage represented,</a> of the \u201cenemies of the people\u201d rhetoric, and the general willingness to throw everything under the bus in pursuit of victory.</p> <p>There is the smack of female truth too about what she calls her \u201cpost-menopausal\u201d feeling that now the children are grown up, she can finally do something for herself.</p> <p>There is a sadder storyline occasionally struggling to get out, about the feeling of having compromised one\u2019s own ambitions for motherhood and promptly been leapfrogged by men who did not. (When six-year-old Boris famously told a family friend that he wanted to be \u201cworld king\u201d when he grew up, Rachel said she wanted to be a wife and mother, because that\u2019s what the women she knew did; as she ruefully points out, so it has essentially ended up.) Yet she is smart enough to know that this is all more palatable as high farce than impossibly gilded tragedy.</p> <p>The book isn\u2019t perfect, obviously \u2013 she\u2019s a terrible name-dropper, forever referencing what her doubles partner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron\" title=\"\">David Cameron</a> said at tennis, and the galloping speed at which it must have been written sometimes shows. But reading it is the definition of guilty pleasure. In times like this, grab that wherever you can.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em><em>Rake\u2019s Progress: My Political Midlife Crisis </em>by Rachel Johnson<em> </em>is published by Simon &amp; Schuster (\u00a316.99).<em> </em>To buy a copy go to <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/tba-9781471190414.html\" title=\"\">guardianbookshop.com</a>.<em> </em>Free UK p&amp;p over \u00a315.</p>",

It\u2019s impossible not to sympathise with the blameless colleagues forced, not for the first time, to clean up behind her. And, yes, all that does remind me of someone. \u201cDoing what we are told not to do is a family trait,\u201d she writes. But so is what she calls the Johnson \u201cdeath wish\u201d, a compulsive desire to say exactly the wrong thing in public. These mini-explosions are not exactly gaffes, but more like the call of the void \u2013 that inexplicable urge to jump that some people feel when standing next to a sheer drop. Even when they know it\u2019s grossly inappropriate, the Johnson instinct is, she writes, to turn everything into \u201ca competition, a game or a joke\u201d, like commitment-phobes who shy away the minute a lover gets serious. In a remorselessly competitive family \u2013 in which Rachel speculates that Boris\u2019s Euroscepticism might in part reflect a private \u201cOedipal struggle\u201d with his pro-European father \u2013 publicly standing against your own brother\u2019s party in an election is forgivable. But to let slip that you cared about it more than you let on, that you meant it \u2013 well, that would almost be more shocking. Was Rachel Johnson ever serious about standing? To a journalist all life is potential copy, but my hunch is that this was more than a cynical exercise in finding something new to write about. Brexit to her is a \u201ccompass error, harder to correct with every mile travelled\u201d that directly threatens her own children\u2019s futures; she was genuinely afraid, she writes, of what Nigel Farage represented, of the \u201cenemies of the people\u201d rhetoric, and the general willingness to throw everything under the bus in pursuit of victory. There is the smack of female truth too about what she calls her \u201cpost-menopausal\u201d feeling that now the children are grown up, she can finally do something for herself. There is a sadder storyline occasionally struggling to get out, about the feeling of having compromised one\u2019s own ambitions for motherhood and promptly been leapfrogged by men who did not. (When six-year-old Boris famously told a family friend that he wanted to be \u201cworld king\u201d when he grew up, Rachel said she wanted to be a wife and mother, because that\u2019s what the women she knew did; as she ruefully points out, so it has essentially ended up.) Yet she is smart enough to know that this is all more palatable as high farce than impossibly gilded tragedy. The book isn\u2019t perfect, obviously \u2013 she\u2019s a terrible name-dropper, forever referencing what her doubles partner David Cameron said at tennis, and the galloping speed at which it must have been written sometimes shows. But reading it is the definition of guilty pleasure. In times like this, grab that wherever you can. \u2022 Rake\u2019s Progress: My Political Midlife Crisis by Rachel Johnson is published by Simon &amp; Schuster (\u00a316.99).

Martin, uniquely among the bosses of FTSE 350 companies, is under the impression that he is obliged to broadcast his views on the best way for the government to tackle what he calls \u201cthe current health scare\u201d, and \u2013 surprise, surprise \u2013 he would prefer an approach in which the population remains free to frequent hostelries such as his. \u201cI\u2019m obviously not an expert but I\u2019ve got a view and that\u2019s all I can say,\u201d he said, just before he served up another round of non-expert analysis on Friday: \u201cMore people have caught the virus in one building, parliament, than in all our pubs combined.\u201d Martin, unfortunately, did not provide a source for this statistic, but he had wanted to keep open Wetherspoons\u2019 867 pubs in the United Kingdom. Matters were taken out of his hands on the same day he spoke, of course. Naturally, one hopes that Wetherspoons survives and then prospers once actual epidemiologists have assessed the \u201cscare\u201d as less scary. The business is successful, has many loyal customers and serves a decent pint at a fair price. \u2019Spoons is a great institution. Martin himself also enlivens the corporate scene on matters where his opinions carry more weight. A recent rant about the perils of box-ticking wonks and their one-size-fits-all approach to boardroom governance was widely applauded, even by one important fund management body. On that occasion, Martin could speak from long professional experience and provide oodles of evidence to support his argument. There are, though, subjects where he would be well-advised to put a sock in it. A national health emergency is one.",

During the leadership election the question was always, \u2018he\u2019s good on telly, can he be a prime minister?\u2019 We\u2019re going to test that,\u201d said one minister.</p> <p>Johnson has always been at pains to insist he has followed the evidence at every turn. Yet it is that commitment that appeared to precipitate last week\u2019s abrupt change of course. The initial stated desire to delay the peak of the virus and allow the build-up of \u201cherd immunity\u201d among the population came up against new evidence \u2013 a report by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies that the crisis was developing more quickly than thought, and the arrival on Monday of a jaw-dropping analysis by Imperial College London that \u201csocial distancing\u201d by the whole population was essential to bringing down deaths from 250,000 to possibly a few thousand.</p> <p>The shift has been widely described as a U-turn and last week led to some fairly hefty criticism about ministers\u2019 anti-Covid-19 policies.</p> <p>Why did we stick to mitigation when we should have gone straight to suppression of the virus?</p> <p>In fact, the government knew about these two scenarios for weeks but chose the less severe path until the most recent data showed this was not going to work. The problem is that lots of uncertainties underpin all the mathematical models that are being deployed to understand Covid-19, says Professor Mark Woolhouse of Edinburgh University. \u201cThere are also huge uncertainties about the social behaviour of people and about the way groups will respond to different controls being imposed on them.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ffbac7529e11c08aa8f9447e17a52c57fade3e5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ffbac7529e11c08aa8f9447e17a52c57fade3e5d/0_0_3500_2297/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A paramedic in Hertfordshire wears protective clothing for a call-out.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"656\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>A paramedic in Hertfordshire wears protective clothing for a call-out.</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters Photographer/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Armed with the new evidence, the prime minister used his first daily press conference on Monday to announce \u201ca very substantial change in the way that we want people to live their lives\u201d.

On Tuesday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/17/boris-johnson-coronavirus-press-conference-rishi-sunak-cabinet-as-rishi-sunak-set-to-announcing-coronavirus-financial-rescue-package-politics-live\" title=\"\">Sunak unveiled loans to businesses</a> to help them through. But why only loans? And what of employees and the self-employed?</p> <p>On Wednesday came the schools closure for all but \u201ckey workers\u201d. So how would students get to university \u2013 and who was a key worker? Meanwhile, rumours of a lockdown in London had begun to circulate and refused to go away.</p> <p>It was on Thursday, however, that Johnson\u2019s grip was really tested, as the case numbers grew and the terrible toll the disease was wreaking on Italy became ever more apparent. By now, unease was sweeping the Tory benches over the need for a huge rescue package for workers. A sign of the concerns emerged when Greg Clark, the former business secretary known for his caution in office, said the \u201cnation should pay wages\u201d to workers. Meanwhile, critics such as former Tory minister and independent London mayoral candidate Rory Stewart still maintained the government\u2019s strategy was wrong. \u201cThey are still fundamentally of the view that it is neither practical nor desirable to suppress the virus,\u201d he said on Thursday. \u201cThis is the very last chance now of following the policy of suppression. A suppression strategy involves much more radical action \u2013 not just isolating the elderly, it\u2019s isolating everybody It\u2019s shutting all schools and universities immediately. It\u2019s shutting all pubs, clubs, gyms. The most prudent move would be to impose isolation on the whole country and start testing vigorously.\u201d Others privately agreed. One Tory MP in London, where the virus is most widespread, said: \u201cWe do have to look at the messaging around bars and restaurants staying open and people being told to keep out. It\u2019s one or the other.

He began by talking about \u201cturning the tide within 12 weeks\u201d, striking an optimistic tone that he regards as a trademark. Yet by the end of the appearance, he had conceded: \u201cI cannot tell you by the end of June we will be on a downward slope.\u201d The next day, newly published scientific advice suggested strict social distancing measures could be dialled up and down, but would be needed for \u201cmost of a year\u201d.</p> <p>Amid the uncertainty, the government has also stubbornly remained attached to the idea that Britain might end the Brexit transition period at the end of the year, despite all the evidence \u2013 and widespread acceptance in Whitehall \u2013 that the period will have to be extended. \u201cNo senior minister or top official on the other side is spending serious time on this issue now,\u201d says Sir Ivan Rogers, the UK\u2019s widely respected former EU ambassador. \u201cRightly so. The real question for government though is whether, at a time when they are rightly focussed on trying to do everything possible to ensure that good firms survive this unprecedented crisis, they want senior people in companies battling to survive, to be spending a lot of time contingency landing for \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit nine months from now. Is that a sensible use of corporate leaders\u2019 time right now?\u201d</p> <p>So, was Johnson, who so admires Sir Winston Churchill, misjudging his response in the country\u2019s hour of need? Jill Rutter, senior fellow at the Institute for Government, has concerns. \u201cI thought the bizarre part of the communications was to say \u2018we\u2019re telling you to do this. We might have to do another thing, but you don\u2019t need to yet\u2019. That trailing of things was difficult. I do think it\u2019s unacceptable to put information out under \u201cDowning St sources\u201d. This is just too important for that. No 10 needs to be straight with the communications. This is not a time to be playing games with messaging.\u201d</p> <p>However, the size and speed of the challenge means that many in Whitehall remain sympathetic and willing to give Johnson leeway. \u201cYou have to act first and work through the implications,\u201d says one Tory MP who is not a natural Johnson supporter. \u201cThe school closures decision was a classic of that. How will people get to university? We\u2019ll figure it out. Who are key workers? We\u2019ll work it out. I\u2019m afraid the decisions have to be made.

Even more may be needed. Sunak has yet to heed calls for huge subsidies to transport companies suffering from a collapse in passenger numbers. Bus companies have asked for a \u00a31bn bailout while airlines have asked for a \u00a37bn package \u2013 in part to pay staff to stay at home. Meanwhile, groups representing the self-employed said they were the most obvious omission from the latest package of measures announced by Sunak. The 5.2 million army of self-employed and contract workers can access sickness benefit and universal credit, but will not benefit from the state pay offer.</p> <p>As one minister put it, the question of \u201cwhat the fuck happens after\u201d is yet to be properly asked, never mind answered. \u201cThe economy will change. The nation will change. Our habits will change. But that\u2019s for another day.\u201d So how long can British people remain in lockdown as uncertainties grow over food supplies, the economy, jobs and education? Relax the draconian measures and cases will start to rise again, threatening again to overwhelm the NHS. Neil Ferguson, the academic who led the Imperial research, believes current policies \u201cwill need to be maintained until large stocks of vaccines are available to immunise the population \u2013 which could be 18 months or more.\u201d Woolhouse is sceptical. \u201cWe need an exit strategy from this epidemic and I would not dignify the expectation of developing a vaccine as a strategy. It is a hope, no more than that.\u201d</p> <p>However, there are other reasons for optimism. As China eases its national lockdown, its experience may inform British moves to follow suit. In addition, as time passes, increased NHS capacity could allow further relaxation in social distancing. The complex situation is summed up by Professor Jimmy Whitworth at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine.</p> <p>\u201cThis disease is going to stick with us for a long time. It is going to be an experience that none of us have had before in our lifetimes.\u201d</p>",

A conversation with the internationally renowned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/tim-lang\" title=\"\">professor of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/tim-lang\" title=\"\">food </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/tim-lang\" title=\"\">policy</a> at London\u2019s City University will roam in detail from the repeal of the Corn Laws, through Brexit and back again, the narrative seasoned with detailed facts and figures. It\u2019s why he has been a consultant to the World Health Organization, special adviser to four House of Commons select committee inquiries and a food policy adviser to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. So when he says in his new book, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/feeding-britain-9780241442227.html\" title=\"\">Feeding Britain</a></em>, that, \u201calthough not officially at war, the UK is, de facto, facing a wartime scale of food challenge\u201d, it\u2019s worth paying attention. We are, he says, in serious trouble.</p> <p>Lang, who established the pioneering <a href=\"https://www.city.ac.uk/about/schools/health-sciences/research/centre-for-food-policy\" title=\"\">Centre for Food Policy</a> at City University in 1994, makes no apologies for the bluntness of the statement. \u201cI did not write that lightly,\u201d he says, when we meet in central London. \u201cI sat in my study, reviewing all the data. Things have just got worse.\u201d Even so, he recognises how it looks. Panic buying aside, our supermarket shelves are usually full. We have access to a greater range of ingredients at better prices than at any time in human history. The conversation around how and what we eat often feels like it sits front and centre of the culture. \u201cI like my food,\u201d he says. \u201cMore joy around food has come into our lives.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s a staggering gap between rich and poor in terms of wealth and income and therefore access to food</p> <footer> <cite>Tim Lang</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And yet, he says, all of that masks a bitter reality: we have a massively fragile just-in-time supply chain which could easily collapse; a depleted agriculture sector which produces only around 50% of the food we actually eat, leaving us at the mercies of the international markets; and production methods which are damaging to the environment and human health. \u201cWhen I looked at the numbers on inequality,\u201d he says, \u201cI was shocked. There\u2019s a staggering gap between rich and poor in terms of wealth and income and therefore access to food.\u201d As he says: \u201cFood is the biggest driver of NHS spending as a result of obesity, diabetes and heart disease.\u201d Food may look cheap, he adds, but too much of it creates vast, unsustainable costs elsewhere.</p> <p>His doorstep of a book attempts both diagnosis and cure. Consciously, it pushes the impact of Brexit to one side to get at the underlying dysfunction. Likewise, we agree to discuss the implications of coronavirus later. Nevertheless, he says, it all amounts to the same thing. \u201cThere is a mismatch between human need, the food system and its outcomes.\u201d</p> <p>At the heart of this crisis is a British willingness to let a small number of corporations dominate food retailing: just eight companies control 90% of our food supply. \u201cIt\u2019s the \u2018leave it to Tesco\u2019 approach,\u201d he says. The prioritisation of price has hollowed out UK agriculture, so that primary producers get the smallest slice of the cake. \u201cThey get about 5% or 6% of the value of the food we buy. They need double that. And that 50% self-sufficiency should be nearer 80%. Not out of nationalism, but so we are in a position to contribute globally. We have a default position of assuming someone else will feed us.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a685116511d8a98812d14017a1e7037fb161c33a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a685116511d8a98812d14017a1e7037fb161c33a/0_16_4339_2603/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An elderly woman looks at empty shelves at a Tesco supermarket in London, March 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We have a default position that someone else will feed us\u2019: empty supermarket shelves, one consequence of the coronavirus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The book comes freighted with eye-popping data. For example, of the six million hectares of cultivatable land in Britain, only 168,000 hectares are used for fruit and vegetables. As a result, we have to import vast amounts of crops we could otherwise be growing. Much of the remaining land is used for crops to feed livestock or for processed foods.</p> <p>\u201cThe government is now so reliant on the retailers, they are setting them up to fail,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the height of the arguments over a no-deal Brexit, the heads of the big food companies were briefing the government about just how fragile the food supply chain is. Brexit has shone a spotlight on that fragility.\u201d I ask where he thinks this dysfunctional system has come from. \u201cThere is a culture of British exceptionalism. We were the first industrial nation in the 18th century and then became the dominant imperial power in the 19th century and pursued that as a way of feeding ourselves.\u201d Critics often point out that we were less self-sufficient in food in the early 20th century than we are now. True, Lang says, but that was specifically because we had an empire which we ravaged to keep our tables and bellies full.</p> <p>He\u2019s at pains to acknowledge that he is not the first person to raise these issues. He first became interested in the subject in the 1970s when, having just completed his social psychology PhD, he started farming in Wales. He came across a book called <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Food-Problem-Relation-National-Defences/dp/B0055DAUGQ\" title=\"\">Our Food Problem and Its Relation </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Food-Problem-Relation-National-Defences/dp/B0055DAUGQ\" title=\"\">to Our National Defences</a></em>, published in 1939. One of its authors was Frederick Le Gros Clark, a sometime children\u2019s writer who went on to become an expert in malnutrition. Like Lang, he argued that the British<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/jul/29/saving-britains-food-supply-manifesto-jay-rayner\" title=\"\"> food supply chain was exceedingly delicate</a> and was not serving the health of the nation. The outbreak of war would prove him right. There was also a review of the British food system in 1936 by William Beveridge, later architect of the welfare state, who made similar arguments. \u201cBeveridge was totally ignored,\u201d Lang says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When the new agriculture bill was introduced in January, it had almost nothing about food</p> <footer> <cite>Tim Lang</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the summer of 2019, then Defra secretary Michael Gove announced he was establishing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/27/leon-restaurants-co-founder-henry-dimbleby-uk-food-system-review\" title=\"\">national </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/27/leon-restaurants-co-founder-henry-dimbleby-uk-food-system-review\" title=\"\">food </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/27/leon-restaurants-co-founder-henry-dimbleby-uk-food-system-review\" title=\"\">strategy</a>, which was broadly welcomed by the food industry. He put his friend Henry Dimbleby, the co-founder of the Leon healthy fast-food chain, in charge of the review, even though he has no academic credentials in the field. Lang is polite about the classic British choice of a non-expert generalist to lead the review, but he does say that he\u2019s concerned that, like Beveridge, Dimbleby\u2019s review will be ignored when it\u2019s eventually published. \u201cWhen the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/16/food-security-brexit-biggest-shake-uk-farming-40-years-agriculture-bill\" title=\"\">new agriculture bill was introduced in January</a>, it had almost nothing about food,\u201d he says.</p> <p>What\u2019s Lang\u2019s solution? It\u2019s detailed and includes the introduction of a food resilience and sustainability act, complete with legally binding targets. National nutritional guidelines should become the basis for food procurement contracts, both public and private. There should be an audit of food production in the UK and the budget for public health should be doubled from \u00a32.5bn of the \u00a3130bn health budget to \u00a35bn. It also proposes the creation of no fewer than nine bodies or institutions, including a royal commission to map a new set of \u201cmulti-criteria principles for the UK food system\u201d, a food resilience and sustainability council and a network of urban and rural food and farming colleges.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76f93351e43306362c66e65959efe40af78d9743\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76f93351e43306362c66e65959efe40af78d9743/0_219_5300_3181/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Apples being collected in an orchard in Somerset, England.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Among Tim Lang\u2019s solutions for sustainability is an audit of food production in the UK: apple harvesting in Somerset.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I suggest this is an old-fashioned 1970s corporatist approach; that he\u2019s proposing a massive expansion of the state to deal with the problem. \u201cI think I\u2019ve been pretty modest,\u201d Lang says. \u201cThe British state is failing us by not decentralising.\u201d He also calls for Tesco, which has around 30% of the food retail market, to be broken up, so that no one firm has more than 15%. Likewise, he calls for pension funds to disinvest from manufacturers of ultra-processed foods, as some have started doing with fossil fuels. The list goes on.

Might the coronavirus crisis help with the re-engineering of our food supply chain? He agrees, sadly, that it might. \u201cIt could prove a good reminder of the value of state institutions,\u201d he says. And the emptying of shelves as a result of panic buying may help people to \u201cthink about where their food comes from\u201d. He adds: \u201cWe need to move from a \u2018me\u2019 food culture to a \u2018we\u2019 food culture.\u201d It\u2019s a very simple message, but in the white heat of a crisis, defined by queues outside supermarkets, a useful one.</p> <p>\u2022 The headline of this article was amended on 23 March 2020 to more accurately reflect the content and context of the interview with Lang.</p> <p><em>Feeding Britain: Our Food Problems and How to Fix Them by </em><em>Tim Lang is published</em><em> on 26 March</em><em> (Pelican, \u00a325).

The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, said that in hindsight he would have waited for coronavirus test results before allowing passengers to disembark. \u201cIf I had my opportunity to have my two bob\u2019s worth, with the benefit of what we now know about those \u2026 people, I\u2019d have said yeah, maybe we should hold them on the ship,\u201d he said. The Ruby Princess was carrying 2,647 passengers and 1,148 crew. The majority of the crew stayed on board to remain in isolation. The ship is currently at sea off the NSW coast, south of Sydney. Four other cruise ships which docked in Sydney have also been linked to Covid-19 cases: Voyager of the Seas (two cases), which docked on 7 March and 18 March; the Ovation of the Seas (two cases), which docked on 18 March; and the Celebrity Solstice (one case reported in New Zealand), which docked on 20 March. Sixty-nine people in Australia have recovered from a confirmed case of Covid-19.",

With the finals spread across 12 cities from Dublin to Baku, it remains to be seen whether the current format can be retained in 2021 despite officials insisting not much will change. We have still yet to discover the fate of the 2021 women\u2019s tournament that was scheduled to be held in England next summer, with the first match at Old Trafford on 7 July. Uefa has said it will announce the new dates in due course but Ceferin hinted that the preferred option may be to hold the tournament in 2022. \u201cYes, that\u2019s one of the possibilities, one of the most likely to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that we should cannibalise the women\u2019s Euro with the men\u2019s Euro just one month before.\u201d As well as the final, on 12 July, Wembley is due to host both semi-finals of the rescheduled men\u2019s Euros next year, so there will be logistical concerns about holding another tournament in the same country so soon afterwards. New dates must also be found for the men\u2019s under-21s tournament due to take place in Slovenia and Hungary, plus the Nations League finals, but Uefa has at least given clubs a window in which to complete their domestic leagues and European competitions should the situation allow. Its president even expressed hope that the new spirit of cooperation could be here to stay after praising the swiftness with which his Fifa counterpart, Gianni Infantino \u2013 usually a sworn enemy \u2013 had acted to deal with the crisis by ensuring that the whole football world acts accordingly. \u201cThere is no more time for egotistic ideas,\u201d Ceferin said. \u201cThere is no more time for selfishness. This is a reset of world football.\u201d Time will tell on that front. When life does eventually return to normal, however, the challenge of finishing hundreds of league and cup programmes around the continent \u2013 not to mention the Champions League and Europa League \u2013 will be seismic. The \u201ccommitment to complete all domestic and European club competitions by the end of the current sporting season, ie 30 June\u201d that was signed by Uefa and most of Europe\u2019s domestic leagues also recognised that it may mean \u201cpossible limitations or drops of current exclusive calendar slots, potentially resulting in the scheduling of domestic league matches in midweek and scheduling of Uefa club competitions matches on weekends\u201d. The Premier League\u2019s announcement on Thursday followed suit, with the prospect of games being held being closed doors if necessary believed to be among the plans under consideration. Concerns over the expiration of many players\u2019 contracts on 30 June make it highly desirable that the season be over by then, although contingency measures including clubs offering temporary extensions to out-of-contract players or those on loan deals are also understood to be under discussion. There is one relatively isolated country in Europe, though, where football goes on oblivious to the rest of the continent\u2019s travails. The new season in Belarus began on Thursday, despite 51 reported cases of coronavirus in the former Soviet satellite. \u201cThere is no critical situation. So we decided that we are starting the championship in a timely manner. Today,\u201d said Vladimir Bazanov, chairman of the Football Federation of Belarus. \u201cWe have no prerequisites for this yet. We have no panic. The situation in the country is not such that we need to stop everything. Why escalate the situation?\u201d",

William Hill closed at 148.85p on 28 February. On Friday, it was down to 39.86p, a drop of 73% in three weeks. Flutter, the parent company of Paddy Power and Betfair, said on Monday that its profits could be down by between \u00a390m and \u00a3110m in 2020. William Hill\u2019s latest estimate is a hit of \u00a3100m-\u00a3110m, while GVC, which owns Ladbrokes and Coral, put the figure at \u00a3130m-\u00a3150m.</p> \n<p>Even at the best of times, few have much sympathy for bookmakers.

Yet the gambling industry as a whole \u2013 of which bookmaking and betting is a significant part \u2013 supports at least 90,000 jobs. Like other major employers, it will have a role to play in restoring some normality to the economy when the current crisis is over.</p> \n<p>Bet365, the biggest player in the online market but also a privately-owned business with no shareholders, announced a huge package on Friday to support more than 4,000 employees at its base in Stoke-on-Trent, guaranteeing that all salaries will be paid until the end of August.</p> \n<p>For employees of their rivals in what was, until recently, a fiercely competitive market, the future is less certain. \u201cOur primary focus continues to be on protecting the welfare of our colleagues,\u201d a spokesperson for SkyBet said. \u201cOf course, the cancellation of sporting events has had an impact on our business but our customers are still able to enjoy a selection of greyhound racing, global horse racing and some other sports that are still taking place around the world.\u201d</p> \n<p>It is a time to expect the unexpected. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing quite good trade on table tennis,\u201d Rupert Adams, of William Hill, says. \u201cIn terms of live matches and streaming, there\u2019s quite a lot still going on in eastern Europe at the moment. It\u2019s been quite a successful in-play event. It\u2019s good news for us that Irish racing is going ahead, and there\u2019s still racing from South Africa and Hong Kong, but it\u2019s hard and will continue to be for some time.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8d8096c4f99133115cf0332956f572d523a8891\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8d8096c4f99133115cf0332956f572d523a8891/0_181_5424_3256/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thurles in Ireland staged races on Saturday\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thurles in Ireland staged races on Saturday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA Wire/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>While Ireland is the only major European racing nation still staging meetings, greyhound racing continues behind closed doors in the UK, with no fewer than 160 races scheduled in Britain on Saturday, spread throughout the day from the 8.12am at Harlow to the 10.35pm at Crayford. Crayford, in fact, staged two cards: 14 races in the morning from 10.36am to 1.57pm, and 12 more from 7.27pm to 10.35pm.</p> \n<p>Betting on the dogs is often seen \u2013 perhaps fairly \u2013 as a product for an older generation of punters in the (now-closed) betting shops. But while turnover on the sport dropped below \u00a31bn for the first time in 2019, that suddenly feels like a market that is worth reassessing. One option which all firms are likely to pursue vigorously is pushing customers towards fixed-margin gaming products like roulette, bingo, online slot machines and virtual racing.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat side of our business has never been stronger,\u201d Adams says. \u201cTen years ago, before that side was so important, we would be in trouble, there\u2019s no doubt, but I think it is fairly robust, and of course, across more countries than before.\u201d</p> \n<p>A gambling medium which seems to sit somewhere between the two is esports: competitive video gaming which can be live-streamed for in-play betting. While the action is computer-generated, though, there are real people pushing the buttons, who have abilities and and form that can be assessed. This is very much betting and not gaming, while esports overall is already a robust, billion-dollar operation.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"37be4da9-c1a4-4346-8525-353ae037b1b4\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Downpatrick<br>1.40 </b>Barnaviddaun <b>2.10</b> Wajaaha <b>2.40 </b>Bread And Butter (nb) <b>3.10</b> Jimmil (nap) <b>3.40</b> Yeats Mardy <b>4.10</b> On The Sod <b>4.40</b> Ballyadam</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Punters used to betting on racing or football may take some persuading to unravel the ins and outs of League Of Legends and Defence Of The Ancients 2, but Quaran-team, a 128-team global FIFA 2020 tournament, could be much more appealing.</p> \n<p>Launched via a tweet on Leyton Orient\u2019s Twitter account less than a week ago with the aim of raising \u00a350,000 for charity, the competition will include players representing many well-known English clubs including Manchester City, Wolves, West Ham and Aston Villa, with some actual Premier League stars among them.

It\u2019s good news for us that Irish racing is going ahead, and there\u2019s still racing from South Africa and Hong Kong, but it\u2019s hard and will continue to be for some time.\u201d While Ireland is the only major European racing nation still staging meetings, greyhound racing continues behind closed doors in the UK, with no fewer than 160 races scheduled in Britain on Saturday, spread throughout the day from the 8.12am at Harlow to the 10.35pm at Crayford. Crayford, in fact, staged two cards: 14 races in the morning from 10.36am to 1.57pm, and 12 more from 7.27pm to 10.35pm. Betting on the dogs is often seen \u2013 perhaps fairly \u2013 as a product for an older generation of punters in the (now-closed) betting shops. But while turnover on the sport dropped below \u00a31bn for the first time in 2019, that suddenly feels like a market that is worth reassessing. One option which all firms are likely to pursue vigorously is pushing customers towards fixed-margin gaming products like roulette, bingo, online slot machines and virtual racing. \u201cThat side of our business has never been stronger,\u201d Adams says. \u201cTen years ago, before that side was so important, we would be in trouble, there\u2019s no doubt, but I think it is fairly robust, and of course, across more countries than before.\u201d A gambling medium which seems to sit somewhere between the two is esports: competitive video gaming which can be live-streamed for in-play betting. While the action is computer-generated, though, there are real people pushing the buttons, who have abilities and and form that can be assessed. This is very much betting and not gaming, while esports overall is already a robust, billion-dollar operation. Punters used to betting on racing or football may take some persuading to unravel the ins and outs of League Of Legends and Defence Of The Ancients 2, but Quaran-team, a 128-team global FIFA 2020 tournament, could be much more appealing. Launched via a tweet on Leyton Orient\u2019s Twitter account less than a week ago with the aim of raising \u00a350,000 for charity, the competition will include players representing many well-known English clubs including Manchester City, Wolves, West Ham and Aston Villa, with some actual Premier League stars among them. And it has already generated a lively betting market, with early favourite Sheffield Wednesday Esports displaced at the top of the market by Man City Esports at 8-1. With untold millions around the world under lockdown, it could be a much-needed distraction for punters and fans alike when the virtual players kick off at 7pm on Monday.",

We spend anxious time telling ourselves health is all that matters, fearing for jobs, setting up Skype accounts, cajoling parents and grandparents to stay indoors, keeping hands away from faces, going through stockpiled food too quickly, scrapping over loo roll, taking our temperatures, trusting official advice and not trusting official advice.</p> <p>One of the most remarkable lessons of the past seven days is just how quickly the mind can make the unthinkable thinkable.

Right now, all those habits have been shoved out of the window. There\u2019s a lot of confusion, but this is an opportunity to create new habits. So what to try? What\u2019s your new routine? It may be fluid and can change, but what do you want to try?</p> <p>There\u2019s lots of great online content available. Equinox\u2019s <a href=\"https://furthermore.equinox.com/\" title=\"\">Furthermore</a> platform offers a variety of workouts, but search the web to find a trainer or teacher you like and trust. John Berardi, a nutritionist I work with, is often asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the best vegetable to eat?\u201d His answer is that it\u2019s the vegetable you like and will eat regularly. Exercise is the same.</p> <p>There is a run on home gym equipment right now, but dumbbells, ropes and other useful products are still available online. Choose what\u2019s right for your space. I\u2019ve just ordered some competition kettlebells because they\u2019re something I really enjoy.</p> <p>There\u2019s copious anecdotal and scientific evidence showing how important fitness is for mental health: so during this very stressful time, it\u2019s even more important. It also boosts the immune system.</p> <p>But exercise isn\u2019t just about health \u2013 it\u2019s often a social activity, too. I\u2019m using FaceTime more than ever before because I\u2019m not having regular social contact. Work out with a friend on FaceTime or have an online dance party with your family. Last night I watched a band I like called Sofi Tukker DJ live on Instagram. That was a new experience. Find something like that and dance for half an hour and your cardio will be done.</p> <h2>Pickling</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"28f3673d46f506fd256517aebca12870605d24d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28f3673d46f506fd256517aebca12870605d24d7/67_152_5392_3236/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jack Monroe with pie in kitchen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jack Monroe in her kitchen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em><strong>Jack Monroe, food writer and activist<br></strong></em>In times of food scarcity and uncertainty, we have to make do with what we have. I haven\u2019t been so much panic-buying \u2013 not having a car limits that \u2013 but I have been guiltily hoovering up scraps from the reduced cabinet late in the day, to save them being discarded. This week\u2019s haul included three boxes of chestnut mushrooms, a withered bunch of wild garlic and a pile of French purple garlic, a little battered around the edges.</p> <p>I will dry the mushrooms, peel and pickle the garlic cloves, and knock the wild garlic with some nuts into a <em>sauce aillade</em>. This will keep for a month past the sell-by date that consigned it to the bargain bin in the first place. Preserving food is not going get us too far in a pandemic, admittedly, but pickling what we have now is an investment in future dinners. I am also pickling a slow cooker\u2019s worth of dried white beans in oil and vinegar, to use until tinned ones come back into stock.</p> <p><strong>Sweet-sour cannellini beans<br></strong><em>Makes a large jar</em></p> <p>400g dried cannellini beans<br>\u00bd a small onion<br>100g frozen peppers<br>80ml vinegar \u2013 red, white or cider<br>1 tbsp white sugar<br>100ml oil (any)</p> <p>Soak the dried beans overnight and then rinse thoroughly. Drain and rinse your beans, then pop them in a pan of cold water. Bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer. Simmer for 15 minutes then drain thoroughly then return to the pan.</p> <p>Add the onions and peppers, along with the vinegar, sugar and oil. Thoroughly clean and sterilise a large jar and its lid. Bring the pan to the boil very carefully. Do not take your eyes off it for a moment as you are dealing with hot oil, which poses a fire risk if unattended. As soon as bubbles start to form, remove it from the heat immediately.</p> <p>Allow to cool for a minute, stirring well, then pour into the sterilised jar, filling it as full as possible. Turn the jar upside down and allow to cool completely before placing in the fridge. Resist sampling them for at least seven days, as the flavour will develop in this time.</p> <p>In a clean and sterile jar, these can keep for a few months unopened. Once opened, use within a week.</p> <p><em>Jack Monroe\u2019s latest book is<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/tin-can-cook-9781529015287.html\" title=\"\">Tin Can Cook </a>(Bluebird, \u00a36.99)</em></p> <h2>Decorating</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"601e88eb255431b088b7534a96896316fd1dd0ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/601e88eb255431b088b7534a96896316fd1dd0ef/193_80_1209_725/1000.jpg\" alt=\"couple trying out paint colours\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trying out paint colours.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em><strong>Laura de Barra, \u2018She\u2019-I-Y expert and author</strong></em><br>If you want to use this time it to zhuzh up your home, start with paint. Consider the space and think about what mood you want works best. If you want your kitchen to give you a little lift each morning, go for light, bright tones. Avoid mistakes: that shade that looks gorgeous on the tin (or on Instagram), can look less appealing on walls with less natural light or in a different-sized room, so swatching is key.</p> <p>Test multiple swatches on every wall. Paint dries to a different shade, so don\u2019t be freaked out. Walk away and come back when it\u2019s fully dry before considering how it looks. If you\u2019ll need two coats, do two coats when you swatch. Pay attention to how the colour is affected by light at the times you use the room most.</p> <p>When it comes to painting a wall, use a brush to \u201ccut in\u201d first. This means painting the corners and edges before anything else \u2013 it gives a better finish. Rollers are ideal for large areas and easier on the hands. Make sure you have the correct roller for the surface \u2013 check with your paint supplier.</p> <p>I favour water-based paint \u2013 it doesn\u2019t trap moisture, it\u2019s kinder to the environment and the clean-up is easier. Also, while modern satin and sheen paint finishes are great, consider a matt paint in an older home: it won\u2019t bounce light from any dents and imperfections.

I knee-patched jeans, darned jumpers and, before you could say \u201ctreadle-powered Singer sewing machine\u201d, I had bought one and started making things from scratch. I shirted and trousered myself, and with knitting needles I socked and jumpered. I learned crochet so I could make Y-fronts using nettle fibre. (We\u2019ll all be wearing nettle when the cotton stops, so plant it now. And relax: the fibre doesn\u2019t sting.)</p> <p>Did people laugh? Well, it was meant to be funny. But not only funny. Like any activity that involves applying your mind to the physical universe, sewing is meditative. It puts you in the here and now.</p> <p>Gradually I set aside the angst that had got me started and started sewing for pleasure. Hoping others might follow, I let my repairs show themselves off, using thread of contrasting colours to edge holes in a jumper, and to stitch the slogan \u201cFresh Air Machine\u201d on the back.</p> <p>I published a book about all this, initially as a limited series of hand-bound books I stitched together, with bits of cereal box and old shirts for the cover. (Better than it sounds.) This, too, was meditative work.</p> <p>If you want to have a go, try darning something. (Look at YouTube.) Cut something up and use it to patch something else. Learn different stitches (for different effects), and experiment by combining materials. Using embroidery, write your name on your shirt or give it a luxury brand logo: it will make you smile, and might give joy to others.</p> <p><em>John-Paul Flintoff\u2019s book is <a href=\"https://www.flintoff.org/sew-your-own-book\" title=\"\">Sew Your Own</a> </em><em>(Profile Books, available on Kindle, \u00a36.40)</em></p> <h2>Fun with kids</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6cbaa1fdbc94b8212d77af828c415033118fd446\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6cbaa1fdbc94b8212d77af828c415033118fd446/0_62_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"young girls with facemasks and cucumber on eyes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Let the kids play beauty salons - and try not to get too involved.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachel Warne</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em><strong>Dawn Isaac, garden designer and author </strong></em><em><strong><br></strong></em>After three children and eight years of \u201cscreen-free family Sundays\u201d, I have plenty of ideas for entertaining children at home. First, get comfortable with mess. Kids having fun do not keep things neat. Manage the chaos with a \u201ctidy-up half-hour\u201d for everyone before they go to bed. Also give the kids some control \u2013 they\u2019re always more willing to throw themselves into things if they feel it was at least partly their idea. Let them lead: help them gather material for junk modelling, a fashion show or house construction, but resist getting too involved. Their imaginations are better than yours.</p> <p>On day one of any long stretch with the kids, we make a \u201cboredom buster\u201d. Take a large jar and lots of squares of paper. On each, one, write an activity everyone can do \u2013 play a board game, make a milkshake. Whenever anyone says \u201cI\u2019m bored\u201d, you pick an activity from the jar. The only rule is you all have to do it before you pick another.</p> <p>To add an element of trepidation, slip some chores into the jar: clean your room, empty the dishwasher. That way, the jar won\u2019t be empty by the end of day two, and the house might not look as if a bomb has hit it.</p> <p>Anything out of the ordinary is always more fun. If it\u2019s mealtime, why not have a picnic on the carpet rather than sitting at the table? If they want to run a cafe and serve the family lunch, or set up a library, let them have a go. Just don\u2019t expect perfection \u2013 they\u2019re still apprentices.</p> <p>Dawn Isaac\u2019s book, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/101-things-for-kids-to-do-screen-free-9780857835291.html\" title=\"\">101 Things for Kids to do Screen-Free</a> (Octopus, \u00a314.99), is published on 6 April</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

I\u2019m using FaceTime more than ever before because I\u2019m not having regular social contact. Work out with a friend on FaceTime or have an online dance party with your family. Last night I watched a band I like called Sofi Tukker DJ live on Instagram. That was a new experience. Find something like that and dance for half an hour and your cardio will be done. Pickling Jack Monroe, food writer and activist In times of food scarcity and uncertainty, we have to make do with what we have. I haven\u2019t been so much panic-buying \u2013 not having a car limits that \u2013 but I have been guiltily hoovering up scraps from the reduced cabinet late in the day, to save them being discarded. This week\u2019s haul included three boxes of chestnut mushrooms, a withered bunch of wild garlic and a pile of French purple garlic, a little battered around the edges. I will dry the mushrooms, peel and pickle the garlic cloves, and knock the wild garlic with some nuts into a sauce aillade. This will keep for a month past the sell-by date that consigned it to the bargain bin in the first place. Preserving food is not going get us too far in a pandemic, admittedly, but pickling what we have now is an investment in future dinners. I am also pickling a slow cooker\u2019s worth of dried white beans in oil and vinegar, to use until tinned ones come back into stock. Sweet-sour cannellini beans Makes a large jar 400g dried cannellini beans \u00bd a small onion 100g frozen peppers 80ml vinegar \u2013 red, white or cider 1 tbsp white sugar 100ml oil (any) Soak the dried beans overnight and then rinse thoroughly. Drain and rinse your beans, then pop them in a pan of cold water. Bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer. Simmer for 15 minutes then drain thoroughly then return to the pan. Add the onions and peppers, along with the vinegar, sugar and oil. Thoroughly clean and sterilise a large jar and its lid. Bring the pan to the boil very carefully. Do not take your eyes off it for a moment as you are dealing with hot oil, which poses a fire risk if unattended. As soon as bubbles start to form, remove it from the heat immediately. Allow to cool for a minute, stirring well, then pour into the sterilised jar, filling it as full as possible. Turn the jar upside down and allow to cool completely before placing in the fridge. Resist sampling them for at least seven days, as the flavour will develop in this time. In a clean and sterile jar, these can keep for a few months unopened. Once opened, use within a week. Jack Monroe\u2019s latest book is Tin Can Cook (Bluebird, \u00a36.99) Decorating Laura de Barra, \u2018She\u2019-I-Y expert and author If you want to use this time it to zhuzh up your home, start with paint. Consider the space and think about what mood you want works best. If you want your kitchen to give you a little lift each morning, go for light, bright tones. Avoid mistakes: that shade that looks gorgeous on the tin (or on Instagram), can look less appealing on walls with less natural light or in a different-sized room, so swatching is key. Test multiple swatches on every wall. Paint dries to a different shade, so don\u2019t be freaked out. Walk away and come back when it\u2019s fully dry before considering how it looks. If you\u2019ll need two coats, do two coats when you swatch. Pay attention to how the colour is affected by light at the times you use the room most. When it comes to painting a wall, use a brush to \u201ccut in\u201d first. This means painting the corners and edges before anything else \u2013 it gives a better finish. Rollers are ideal for large areas and easier on the hands. Make sure you have the correct roller for the surface \u2013 check with your paint supplier. I favour water-based paint \u2013 it doesn\u2019t trap moisture, it\u2019s kinder to the environment and the clean-up is easier. Also, while modern satin and sheen paint finishes are great, consider a matt paint in an older home: it won\u2019t bounce light from any dents and imperfections. C\u2019est bon!Laura de Barra is author of Gaff Goddess (Penguin, \u00a314.99) Sewing John-Paul Flintoff, writer and crafter Ten years ago, to be kinder to the planet, I took up mending clothes. I knee-patched jeans, darned jumpers and, before you could say \u201ctreadle-powered Singer sewing machine\u201d, I had bought one and started making things from scratch. I shirted and trousered myself, and with knitting needles I socked and jumpered. I learned crochet so I could make Y-fronts using nettle fibre. (We\u2019ll all be wearing nettle when the cotton stops, so plant it now. And relax: the fibre doesn\u2019t sting.) Did people laugh? Well, it was meant to be funny. But not only funny. Like any activity that involves applying your mind to the physical universe, sewing is meditative. It puts you in the here and now. Gradually I set aside the angst that had got me started and started sewing for pleasure. Hoping others might follow, I let my repairs show themselves off, using thread of contrasting colours to edge holes in a jumper, and to stitch the slogan \u201cFresh Air Machine\u201d on the back. I published a book about all this, initially as a limited series of hand-bound books I stitched together, with bits of cereal box and old shirts for the cover. (Better than it sounds.) This, too, was meditative work. If you want to have a go, try darning something. (Look at YouTube.) Cut something up and use it to patch something else. Learn different stitches (for different effects), and experiment by combining materials. Using embroidery, write your name on your shirt or give it a luxury brand logo: it will make you smile, and might give joy to others. John-Paul Flintoff\u2019s book is Sew Your Own (Profile Books, available on Kindle, \u00a36.40) Fun with kids Dawn Isaac, garden designer and author After three children and eight years of \u201cscreen-free family Sundays\u201d, I have plenty of ideas for entertaining children at home. First, get comfortable with mess. Kids having fun do not keep things neat. Manage the chaos with a \u201ctidy-up half-hour\u201d for everyone before they go to bed. Also give the kids some control \u2013 they\u2019re always more willing to throw themselves into things if they feel it was at least partly their idea. Let them lead: help them gather material for junk modelling, a fashion show or house construction, but resist getting too involved. Their imaginations are better than yours. On day one of any long stretch with the kids, we make a \u201cboredom buster\u201d. Take a large jar and lots of squares of paper. On each, one, write an activity everyone can do \u2013 play a board game, make a milkshake. Whenever anyone says \u201cI\u2019m bored\u201d, you pick an activity from the jar. The only rule is you all have to do it before you pick another. To add an element of trepidation, slip some chores into the jar: clean your room, empty the dishwasher. That way, the jar won\u2019t be empty by the end of day two, and the house might not look as if a bomb has hit it. Anything out of the ordinary is always more fun. If it\u2019s mealtime, why not have a picnic on the carpet rather than sitting at the table? If they want to run a cafe and serve the family lunch, or set up a library, let them have a go. Just don\u2019t expect perfection \u2013 they\u2019re still apprentices. Dawn Isaac\u2019s book, 101 Things for Kids to do Screen-Free (Octopus, \u00a314.99), is published on 6 April",

      "body": "<p>The coronavirus doesn\u2019t respect national borders, political ideologies or conventional thinking. As governments scramble to try to contain the pandemic and mitigate the fallout on economies and societies, the previously unthinkable is suddenly transformed into the essential. Policy ideas that were decried as madness yesterday are being redefined as the only sane response to this emergency. Positions once held to be immutable are being tossed into a great bonfire of discarded orthodoxies.</p> <p>This is an especially bracing challenge for politicians of the right, they who have been animated for decades by the belief that the only good government is a small one and that there is no problem to which the market cannot supply the answer. A philosophy rooted in the conviction that individualism and competition are the wellsprings of healthy and productive societies is found wanting when confronted by a crisis that can only be endured and resolved by rediscovering the virtues of collectivism and solidarity.</p> <p>You can see some of the tensions this creates in the strained and exhausted face of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/15/boris-johnson-to-hold-daily-coronavirus-press-briefings\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson</a> whenever he appears at the now daily news conferences. This instinctive libertarian, who used to earn his living by penning newspaper columns ridiculing \u201cthe nanny state\u201d is being impelled to introduce social controls of a kind not seen since the Second World War. Some of the constraints go further than that time of national trial. They didn\u2019t shut the boozers during the Blitz. He finds himself, and clearly hates having to be, the prime minister responsible \u201cfor taking away the ancient and inalienable right of every freeborn Englishman to go to the pub\u201d.</p> <p>As the beer taps are closed, the spending spigots are being turned up in a way never seen before. The Tory leader who only recently won an election in part by attacking Jeremy Corbyn as the last of the big spenders will now preside over the most dramatic escalation in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/mar/19/peacetime-constraints-ditched-in-the-war-for-economic-survival\" title=\"\">government expenditure </a>since the 1940s to try to save the economy from being ravaged by a depression.</p> <p>For government and voters alike, this crisis is a rushed tutorial in the case for the active and well-resourced state. Only government can take the exceptional measures required to curtail human activity in the hope that it will curb the spread of infection. Only government has the capacity to effectively perform as an insurer of last resort for the huge number of companies facing extinction unless they receive state aid. Only government can provide a safety net for workers deprived of the ability to earn their living because they are ill or trying to do the right thing by isolating themselves or because their employer is in trouble.</p> <p>Welfare is bad. Balance the books. It is not the role of government to bail out failing companies. All those beliefs long worshipped in the churches of conservatism are being sacrificed in the fierce urgency of the now.</p> <p>When events are moving at such an extraordinary pace, it can be easy to lose appreciation of the boggling scale of this transformation. Rishi Sunak\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/11/budget-2020-rishi-sunak-spending-coronavirus\" title=\"\">first budget</a> was just 10 days ago, but already feels like an artefact from another era. There was a bit of a collective swoon among Tory MPs at the \u00a312bn he initially allocated to dealing with the virus. What he then called \u201cunprecedented\u201d intervention now looks like small change. Just six days later, he was back to announce a package of tax holidays, grants and business loans worth \u00a3350bn, almost 30 times as much as he had originally proposed. The chancellor declared this to be proof that the government would do <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/so-far-whatever-it-takes-is-not-nearly-enough\" title=\"\">\u201cwhatever it takes\u201d </a>\u2013 only to be told that it would take a great deal more to see us through this crisis. The clamour came not just from opposition politicians, trades unions and charities.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Forced to decide between Tory doctrine and food riots, Mr Sunak made the right choice</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One of the arresting tableaux of the past few days has been Bernard Jenkin and other representatives of the Thatcherite right adding their voices to those of more centrist Tories such as Greg Clark, the former business secretary, to demand much broader help. Under that pressure, Mr Sunak came up with what was effectively his third emergency budget in less than a fortnight, when he announced higher welfare payments and a mammoth programme to subsidise the wages of workers who would otherwise be facing redundancy. \u201cThis is not a time for ideology and orthodoxy,\u201d remarked a man once known as a fiscal hawk as he dispatched another barrow-load of Tory sacred beliefs on to the bonfire of orthodoxies.</p> <p>He presented a confident face designed to mask the profound fear within government about the consequences of not taking the extraordinary step of making the state responsible for much of the economy\u2019s wage bills. The alternative was to see a massive and rapid surge in unemployment that would have overwhelmed the welfare system and threatened serious civil disorder. Forced to decide between Tory doctrine and food riots, Mr Sunak made the right choice.</p> <p>Similar things are happening around the world as governments battle to prevent an inevitable downturn from sliding into a deep depression. Donald Trump is even talking about sending a cheque from Washington direct to every American.</p> <p>This emergency differs in key respects to that of the <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/2008-financial-crisis-coronavirus-138263\" title=\"\">Great Crash of 2008</a>, but some useful lessons can be drawn from the last global crisis. One is that governments and central banks have to act quickly, decisively and at scale to give confidence to markets, households and businesses that the state has their back and that it is possible for people to plan for a future when the crisis is over. Near-zero interest rates, quantitative easing and bank bailouts, the tools used during the financial crisis, did avert a repeat of the Great Depression of the 1930s, but it was only slowly that people came to appreciate the negative social consequences that stretched wealth inequalities and stoked a wide and deep public alienation. The spectacle of shameless financiers walking away unscathed from a wreck of their own reckless making and then going on to further enrich themselves fed a righteous rage among the less affluent folk who felt the squeeze of subsequent austerity. \u201cWe all remember what happened in 2008,\u201d Mr Johnson remarked last week, alluding to the debates within his cabinet about the dangers of a massive public backlash if the government is seen only to be looking after big business. Time and again, he tells companies that the government is standing by them so they can stand by their employees.</p> <p>There are critics who say that the gargantuan amounts of government spending being fired at this crisis are too scattergun. Money will end up in the hands of badly run or badly behaved companies. Money will go to some who don\u2019t really need it. Money will be wasted. To which we can only say: so be it. There is no time for government to develop sophisticated schemes with complex delivery mechanisms. The need is to make financial assistance available as simply and swiftly as possible. This crisis calls not for the sniper\u2019s rifle but the bazooka.</p> <p>The hope \u2013 it can be no more than a hope at this stage of uncertainty \u2013 is that a sharp dive in the global economy will be followed by a strong bounce-back when restrictions can be lifted and millions go back to work and return to spending. But that can only happen if there are still businesses left standing.</p> <p>Ministers and officials cannot say how much all the emergency measures will cost, because they can\u2019t know. We can safely say that the sums will be huge. Robert Chote, the director of the Office for Budget Responsibility, would normally have something very chiding to say about a government prepared to let the deficit rip in such a staggering fashion. Now he observes: \u201cWhen the fire is large enough you just spray the water and worry about it later.\u201d</p> <p>Fiscal disciplinarians on the right are largely swallowing it on the grounds that there is no alternative. Libertarians of the state-shrinking and welfare-loathing disposition are reconciling themselves to measures that they\u2019d normally hate with the thought that they are temporary impositions that will be lifted one day. Once the virus is brought under control, either by the production of a vaccine or other measures, then politics can go back to business as usual.</p> <p>I rather doubt that. While it is far too early to make any confident predictions about the longterm ways in which this crisis will reshape society, it has already upended many of the assumptions that have governed politics here and elsewhere for decades. It is hard to believe that a once-in-a-century event will not have some once-in-a-century consequences.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</p>",

      "bodyText": "The coronavirus doesn\u2019t respect national borders, political ideologies or conventional thinking. As governments scramble to try to contain the pandemic and mitigate the fallout on economies and societies, the previously unthinkable is suddenly transformed into the essential. Policy ideas that were decried as madness yesterday are being redefined as the only sane response to this emergency. Positions once held to be immutable are being tossed into a great bonfire of discarded orthodoxies. This is an especially bracing challenge for politicians of the right, they who have been animated for decades by the belief that the only good government is a small one and that there is no problem to which the market cannot supply the answer. A philosophy rooted in the conviction that individualism and competition are the wellsprings of healthy and productive societies is found wanting when confronted by a crisis that can only be endured and resolved by rediscovering the virtues of collectivism and solidarity. You can see some of the tensions this creates in the strained and exhausted face of Boris Johnson whenever he appears at the now daily news conferences. This instinctive libertarian, who used to earn his living by penning newspaper columns ridiculing \u201cthe nanny state\u201d is being impelled to introduce social controls of a kind not seen since the Second World War. Some of the constraints go further than that time of national trial. They didn\u2019t shut the boozers during the Blitz. He finds himself, and clearly hates having to be, the prime minister responsible \u201cfor taking away the ancient and inalienable right of every freeborn Englishman to go to the pub\u201d. As the beer taps are closed, the spending spigots are being turned up in a way never seen before. The Tory leader who only recently won an election in part by attacking Jeremy Corbyn as the last of the big spenders will now preside over the most dramatic escalation in government expenditure since the 1940s to try to save the economy from being ravaged by a depression. For government and voters alike, this crisis is a rushed tutorial in the case for the active and well-resourced state. Only government can take the exceptional measures required to curtail human activity in the hope that it will curb the spread of infection. Only government has the capacity to effectively perform as an insurer of last resort for the huge number of companies facing extinction unless they receive state aid. Only government can provide a safety net for workers deprived of the ability to earn their living because they are ill or trying to do the right thing by isolating themselves or because their employer is in trouble. Welfare is bad. Balance the books. It is not the role of government to bail out failing companies. All those beliefs long worshipped in the churches of conservatism are being sacrificed in the fierce urgency of the now. When events are moving at such an extraordinary pace, it can be easy to lose appreciation of the boggling scale of this transformation. Rishi Sunak\u2019s first budget was just 10 days ago, but already feels like an artefact from another era. There was a bit of a collective swoon among Tory MPs at the \u00a312bn he initially allocated to dealing with the virus. What he then called \u201cunprecedented\u201d intervention now looks like small change. Just six days later, he was back to announce a package of tax holidays, grants and business loans worth \u00a3350bn, almost 30 times as much as he had originally proposed. The chancellor declared this to be proof that the government would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d \u2013 only to be told that it would take a great deal more to see us through this crisis. The clamour came not just from opposition politicians, trades unions and charities. One of the arresting tableaux of the past few days has been Bernard Jenkin and other representatives of the Thatcherite right adding their voices to those of more centrist Tories such as Greg Clark, the former business secretary, to demand much broader help. Under that pressure, Mr Sunak came up with what was effectively his third emergency budget in less than a fortnight, when he announced higher welfare payments and a mammoth programme to subsidise the wages of workers who would otherwise be facing redundancy. \u201cThis is not a time for ideology and orthodoxy,\u201d remarked a man once known as a fiscal hawk as he dispatched another barrow-load of Tory sacred beliefs on to the bonfire of orthodoxies. He presented a confident face designed to mask the profound fear within government about the consequences of not taking the extraordinary step of making the state responsible for much of the economy\u2019s wage bills. The alternative was to see a massive and rapid surge in unemployment that would have overwhelmed the welfare system and threatened serious civil disorder. Forced to decide between Tory doctrine and food riots, Mr Sunak made the right choice. Similar things are happening around the world as governments battle to prevent an inevitable downturn from sliding into a deep depression. Donald Trump is even talking about sending a cheque from Washington direct to every American. This emergency differs in key respects to that of the Great Crash of 2008, but some useful lessons can be drawn from the last global crisis. One is that governments and central banks have to act quickly, decisively and at scale to give confidence to markets, households and businesses that the state has their back and that it is possible for people to plan for a future when the crisis is over. Near-zero interest rates, quantitative easing and bank bailouts, the tools used during the financial crisis, did avert a repeat of the Great Depression of the 1930s, but it was only slowly that people came to appreciate the negative social consequences that stretched wealth inequalities and stoked a wide and deep public alienation. The spectacle of shameless financiers walking away unscathed from a wreck of their own reckless making and then going on to further enrich themselves fed a righteous rage among the less affluent folk who felt the squeeze of subsequent austerity. \u201cWe all remember what happened in 2008,\u201d Mr Johnson remarked last week, alluding to the debates within his cabinet about the dangers of a massive public backlash if the government is seen only to be looking after big business. Time and again, he tells companies that the government is standing by them so they can stand by their employees. There are critics who say that the gargantuan amounts of government spending being fired at this crisis are too scattergun. Money will end up in the hands of badly run or badly behaved companies. Money will go to some who don\u2019t really need it. Money will be wasted. To which we can only say: so be it. There is no time for government to develop sophisticated schemes with complex delivery mechanisms. The need is to make financial assistance available as simply and swiftly as possible. This crisis calls not for the sniper\u2019s rifle but the bazooka. The hope \u2013 it can be no more than a hope at this stage of uncertainty \u2013 is that a sharp dive in the global economy will be followed by a strong bounce-back when restrictions can be lifted and millions go back to work and return to spending. But that can only happen if there are still businesses left standing. Ministers and officials cannot say how much all the emergency measures will cost, because they can\u2019t know. We can safely say that the sums will be huge. Robert Chote, the director of the Office for Budget Responsibility, would normally have something very chiding to say about a government prepared to let the deficit rip in such a staggering fashion. Now he observes: \u201cWhen the fire is large enough you just spray the water and worry about it later.\u201d Fiscal disciplinarians on the right are largely swallowing it on the grounds that there is no alternative. Libertarians of the state-shrinking and welfare-loathing disposition are reconciling themselves to measures that they\u2019d normally hate with the thought that they are temporary impositions that will be lifted one day. Once the virus is brought under control, either by the production of a vaccine or other measures, then politics can go back to business as usual. I rather doubt that. While it is far too early to make any confident predictions about the longterm ways in which this crisis will reshape society, it has already upended many of the assumptions that have governed politics here and elsewhere for decades. It is hard to believe that a once-in-a-century event will not have some once-in-a-century consequences. \u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer",

If my son was from a rich family, he surely would have been found by now,\u201d said Nascimento, a security guard. Police investigators suspect a \u201cforced disappearance\u201d. Three military police officers who were in the patrol that searched the group have been suspended from duty. Cases of poor young black men who are stopped by police and then show up dead or disappear completely are common in Brazil \u2013 and they are on the increase, according to human rights advocates. \u201cIn almost all cases where the victim was last seen talking to police they are never seen alive again,\u201d said Ivanise Esperidi\u00e3o, founder of Mums of S\u00e9, an organization working with disappeared people. S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s public security secretariat has said \u201call the circumstances related to the case are being investigated\u201d. Nascimento\u2019s father alleges that the four other young men who were with Carlos Eduardo when he was taken away are scared to speak out for fear of violent police reprisals. Police impunity in the killings of poor, black or mixed-race victims is a notoriously longstanding problem in Brazil, the last country to abolish slavery. \u201cThey disappear victims to make investigations even more difficult and to ensure impunity,\u201d said Ariel de Castro Alves, a member of S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s human rights council. In a rare case in which police have been investigated over such incidents, 10 Rio de Janeiro police officers were charged with torture and murder in 2013, over the disappearance of bricklayer Amarildo de Souza who vanished after being stopped by police. But the case of Carlos Eduardo adds to growing fears about increasing police violence and abuse in Brazil under the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro. State governors control security forces in Brazil, but experts express fear that officers, have felt emboldened by the president\u2019s rhetorical support for police violence. Last year, Rio de Janeiro state \u2013 governed by former Bolsonaro ally turned political rival Wilson Witzel \u2013 registered its highest number of police killings on record. Most of the victims were black or mixed race. S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s rightwing governor, Jo\u00e3o Doria, won a narrow victory in 2018, promising tougher measures against crime.

Some times though bigger factors intervene, and there can be surely no doubt that the most important task at hand is for everyone to take whatever actions they can to combat the spread of this virus.</p> <p>A fond farewell to you - heed the advice, stay safe, wash your hands - and take the time to try new hobbies. Apparently I\u2019m about to be pressed into helping crochet a baby rug for an expectant pal. As the great Mae West said: try anything once, except incest and line dancing.

      "bodyText": "And so we leave Sportwatch with a whimper, not with a bang, on a day on which the nation\u2019s most powerful sporting organisation bowed to the \u201cmost serious threat in 100 years\u201d - the ravages of the coronavirus. The headline news: the AFL competition has been suspended for at least two months, while the AFLW final series has been cancelled with immediate effect, with no premiership awarded. The NRL and A-League have both put out statements in response to AFL boss Gillon McLachlan\u2019s bombshell, to the effect that they will play on until told otherwise; with a federal government cabinet meeting being held shortly the decision could yet be taken out of their hands. With Western Australia and South Australia closing their state borders in coming days it makes professional sport almost impossible - rugby league can say that doesn\u2019t effect them, not having teams in those states, but should others follow suit there seems little doubt both the NRL and A-League are merely delaying the inevitable. Sad news for sports fans (and the subset: Sportwatch fans) as this could be the end of our rolling weekend coverage for the next few months. Some times though bigger factors intervene, and there can be surely no doubt that the most important task at hand is for everyone to take whatever actions they can to combat the spread of this virus. A fond farewell to you - heed the advice, stay safe, wash your hands - and take the time to try new hobbies. Apparently I\u2019m about to be pressed into helping crochet a baby rug for an expectant pal. As the great Mae West said: try anything once, except incest and line dancing. Good night! NRL - Try! Gold Coast 6-20 Parramatta (Brown) 60 min: It\u2019s a lovely step, a pivot, a piroutte from the five-eight Dylan Brown who gets through the one-on-one tackle of Phillip Sami on the line, and is that goodnight nurse for the Titans? It\u2019s the Eels finishing stronger, and there\u2019s no home crowd to lift their chargers. AFL - half-time: West Coast 7.3 (45) lead Melbourne 3.6 (24) In fairness, that was a much better showing from the Demons, for whom Jack Viney has buzzed around like a man possessed. If only more of his teammates followed his lead. They peel the margin back by six but need to get their shooting boots on if they\u2019re to make more significant in-roads after the break. When you can\u2019t cry you may as well laugh - that\u2019s the mood I imagine for thousands of die-hard AFL fans around the country about now. NRL - half-time: Gold Coast 6-14 Parramatta And just a 31st minute Mitch Moses penalty to bother the scorers since that lively opening fifteen minutes, where injuries have been the bigger talking point. Tyrone Roberts also picking up an ankle injury, after Kevin Proctor went down in the warm up and Dale Copley went off injured shortly after scoring. Apart from that, it\u2019s been an error-prone showing from both sides. AFL - quarter-time: West Coast 5.1 (31) lead Melbourne 0.4 (4) \u201cIt\u2019s been competitive in general play, but the scoreboard doesn\u2019t reflect that\u201d, is the verdict from broadcast. Admittedly, handpasses going straight to your opponents to gift goals can often have that blow-out effect. An absolute wobbler of an effort from Lewis Jetta adds salt to the wounds late in the quarter, with Liam Ryan, Dom Sheed and Brendon Ah Chee (two) also on target for the Eagles. NRL - 20 min: Now, we do have games going on, despite the maelstrom surrounding the professional leagues today, where we\u2019re a quarter gone in the Titans v Eels clash. Early tries to Mitch Moses and Reed Mahoney had the Eels flying out of the blocks 12-0, but Dale Copley\u2019s 14th minute try and a subsequent penalty has it sitting 6-12 for the home side. Titan\u2019s have copped some early injuries though - the tryscorer Copley is in the sheds already, while Ryan Kelly faces a concussion test. It really is a bizarre situation - professional athletes do have to prepare carefully to put themselves in the best mental as well as physical position to perform on matchday, but in these contexts that\u2019s increasingly hard to do. AFL sideline spoke to West Coast\u2019s Tim Kelly ahead of his debut for the club today - forget that he\u2019s playing in front of an empty stadium instead of family and friends, now he\u2019s just found out the season could end in just over a few hours. \u201cYeah, I got the call from the misso on the way to the ground [that the season had been suspended] - it\u2019s a bit of a dull feeling, really\u201d. A-League to continue to assess situation - pending goverment advice So, here\u2019s the official word from the FFA, who appear to be following the NRL\u2019s \u201cwait and see\u201d approach: Football Federation Australia (FFA) today announced that it continues to assess the ongoing operations of the Hyundai A-League as the response from all levels of Government to the spread of COVID-19 evolves. FFA CEO James Johnson said: \u201cThe health and wellbeing of the players continues to remain our top priority and we will not be afraid to make decisions to ensure this, no matter how hard they might be. \u201cWe were very comfortable to take the initial decision to allow the Leagues to continue with additional measures in place and have worked through a number of scenarios to facilitate the completion of the A-League season. However, we remain under no illusions as to how fluid this situation is so we will remain agile and responsive to the challenges this pandemic brings. We are continuously assessing our position based on the latest directives and advice from the Government and Chief Medical Officer, and in consultation with our National COVID-19 Working Committee. \u201cWe are taking every precaution in line with Government advice and working closely with the League and clubs which have implemented additional measures to ensure players remain healthy and in good physical and mental condition. Our priority is to ensure that this remains the case to give the clubs and players the best chance of achieving their sporting aspirations.\u201d FFA will consider the outcomes of the National Cabinet meeting this evening and provide further advice on the 2019/2020 Hyundai A-League season tomorrow. This announcement follows the FFA\u2019s decision last week to suspend all grassroots football until 14 April 2020. So a reminder (if you\u2019ve inexplicably missed it) - here\u2019s the latest on the suspension of the AFL and the immediate cancellation of the AFLW: NRL will, at this stage continue, until the government advises it that it is no longer safe to do so, while the A-League has just put out an advisory. More on that, shortly. Statistically it was a pretty close affair, but decision making ball-in-hand proved the difference for the Hawks, who blew away late on to make it comfortable - a comical Luke Breust goal the cherry on top as the Lions defence stopped for a whistle that never came. Hawks win their opening game, who knows when they\u2019ll play their second though. It\u2019s two from two for the Knights who run over a hapless Tigers outfit late on. You can\u2019t imagine \u201cMadge\u201d Maguire will be too happy with that defensive showing. They let in eight tries, the home side, and the were some definite issues in areas like one-on-one tackles that simply shouldn\u2019t have been there. Still, credit the Knights - Pearce in particular was superb in steering his troops. But with so much uncertainty flying round today, hard to say whether they\u2019ll take \u201cmomentum\u201d from this if we\u2019re not even sure if there will be footy next weekend. NRL statement: And here\u2019s the latest from the NRL - where it\u2019s still \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d (minus the fans, of course) despite the AFL announcement, with Sunday\u2019s federal government cabinet meeting looming as a key discussion. NRL - Try! Wests Tigers 24-32 Newcastle Knights (Pearce) 64 min: Mitchell Pearce has come to haunt the team his father made his name at, it\u2019s a fine step from the halfback who carves open the Tigers backline. What a topsy-turvy contest this one\u2019s turned into - on balance you\u2019d say Knights are far ahead, but the Tigers continue to find ways to stay in this contest, despite some defensive lapses. It\u2019ll probably finish 40-40. AFL - 3/4 time: Hawthorn 10.2 (62) leads Brisbane 7.7 (49) They led by two at the first quarter, the Lions, but from there it\u2019s been largely the Hawks shading it. Nine points the margin to the home side, and they\u2019ve extended that to 13 at three-quarter thanks to a goal from three-time ACL recoveree Jonathon Patton after fine work from Burgoyne. Burgoyne with three of his own, with Luke Breust bagging two, while Charlie Cameron and Eric Hipwood have two apiece for the Lions. A surreal vibe for this final quarter you\u2019ll imagine - these players won\u2019t have heard the news of the league\u2019s cancellation presumably, but word may filter out before the final quarter commences. NRL - Try! Wests Tigers 12-22 Newcastle Knights (Lee) 46 min: So apologies in advance if I\u2019ve lost track of this one a little, what with the minor distraction of \u201cthe end of all sport TM\u201d going on in the background. I can update that some of this Tigers\u2019 defending has been abject at best. Edrick Lee given a free stroll to the line, and if hard words were had at half-time they haven\u2019t been heeded. Knights ahead, but not home and hosed, yet. So, it\u2019s bad news for sports fans (but probably pretty good news for fans of \u201cpublic health\u201d and/or \u201cpeople\u201d). Already scrambling for a silver lining, it\u2019s pretty good news for retro cricket fans if this man\u2019s archives are to go off. Keep your eyes across YouTube for forthcoming offerings from Rob Moody: So that\u2019s the situation with the AFL and AFLW - but what does this mean for the NRL or A-League? There are of course no Western Australian or South Australian-based NRL sides (RIP Adelaide Rams), but you\u2019d suspect this automatically makes Perth Glory and Adelaide United\u2019s seasons unworkable (with Wellington Phoenix already in an untenable position). We\u2019ll bring you news on that front as soon as we hear it, but the speculation has already begun: So - huge news there. Our trusty ears and eyes on the box JP Howcroft has captured some of the live snippets direct from the McLachlan press conference: \u201c[re AFL competition] Games will be suspended until May 31. The situation will be reviewed at the end of April.\u201d \u201cNo premiership will be awarded in the AFLW, as per the recommendation by the executive.\u201d \u201cAll training will be suspended\u201d. \u201cDepending on medical advice that 31 May date could be extended.\u201d \u201cThe AFL industry is facing its biggest financial crisis in its history.\u201d \u201cOur key focus, like every organisation in the country, is to do everything to slow the spread of the virus.\u201d \u201cTo say this is the most serious threat to our sport in its history is an understatement.\u201d \u201cEveryone involved in our game will be impacted by the decision and many people will suffer significant hardship. But we all have a responsibility to the community and each other.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve been given advice by the government and the CMO [chief medical officer] that we could start the season but that the season would be paused at some stage. It was right to start the season and now it\u2019s right to stop.\u201d \u201cThe plan is to play the remaining games this year.\u201d McLachlan then opened up for questions, where he intimated that the governing body would work with clubs to establish protocols and to establish lines of credit to help with immediate cash flow / finances. In response to questions: \u201cWe hoped this day would be a little further down the track, but as soon as the measures hardened it\u2019s time for our game to suspend for 60 days.\u201d \u201cClubs are shocked. It\u2019s become very real in the last couple of hours and it\u2019s going to be a very real couple of days as we have honest conversations with staff.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re working collectively to secure liquidity.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll do what we need to do to survive as an industry.\u201d As mentioned, Gillon McLachlan is currently addressing the nation\u2019s AFL media, and if I\u2019ve got this correctly, following the news that South Australia has closed its state borders, the boss of the AFL has announced a two-month shutdown leaguewide, effective immediate until 31 May. The AFLW finals series has also been cancelled - no premiership will be awarded. This from AFL.com: \u201cClubs were on Sunday afternoon informed of the decision reached by the AFL Commission. The scheduled Hawthorn-Brisbane and West Coast-Melbourne games will be completed to finish off round one.\u201d It\u2019s understood the NRL and A-League are still considering their options. Big news - but perhaps understandable given the context. NRL - Try! Wests Tigers 6-16 Newcastle Knights (Mann) 24 min: We\u2019re just past a quarter-gone from an empty Leichhardt Oval where the Knights have been very much on top until an intercept try to Nofoaluma. A clever pass from Klemmer has put Fitzgibbon into a hole though, and it\u2019s Mann backing up on the outside who restores the Knights\u2019 breathing room. Ponga with a good conversion. \u201cOh no, he\u2019s fumbled it\u201d. Cheers JP - if it had been a pass I\u2019d have caught it, different folks, different skill sets really. Afternoon all - I hope this finds you safe and secure like Bilbo\u2019s ring. Some big news coming through from the AFL as Gillon McLachlan addresses the nation\u2019s press as we speak, but first a quick update from the NRL. A quick handball to Richard Parkin who will steer you through the remainder of the day. Cheers! AFL: QT: Hawthorn 3.1 (19) v 3.3 (21) Brisbane - That was open, even quarter of footy with the lead changing hands pretty much with every goal. When the siren sounds it\u2019s the Lions with their noses in front, just, courtesy of a Charlie Cameron set shot after the small forward moved superbly to earn front position at a marking contest - much to the chagrin of Hawthorn\u2019s James Sicily. AFL: Q1: 4 mins remaining: Hawthorn 2.1 (13) v 2.3 (15) Brisbane - Things have tightened up at the MCG after that fast start. Shaun Burgoyne kicked the Hawks in front, no mean feat for the 37-year-old, by two years the oldest player in this year\u2019s competition. But that has just been answered by Lachie Neale, the ball magnet adding a goal to his already bumper haul of disposals. Australian sport: AFL CEO Gillon McLachlan will speak to the press later today and the expectation is he will announce a competition suspension in the region of two months in response to the restrictions announced by the federal and state governments. The latest from the NRL is they intend to continue, while the A-League is yet to go on the record. AFL: Q1: 12 mins remaining: Hawthorn 1.1 (7) v 1.2 (8) Brisbane - The second AFL contest of the day is underway at a sun-drenched MCG and it\u2019s been a fast start from both sides with the trading of early goals. Australian sport: The sporting agenda has moved quickly today with first the federal government and subsequently a number of states imposing tighter restrictions on movement and activities to limit the impact of the coronavirus. Follow the latest updates here: Huge comeback victory for North Melbourne! Second best for the opening half they flew out of the blocks in the third quarter, without the injured pair of Josh Walker and Jack Ziebell before eventually running down St Kilda in the closing stages. AFL: Q4: 1 mins remaining: North Melbourne 8.8 (56) lead St Kilda 7.12 (54) Incredible pressure inside North Melbourne\u2019s defensive 50 but smother after spoil after desperate one-percenter keeps the Saints at bay! Drama! AFL: Q4: 2 mins remaining: North Melbourne 8.8 (56) lead St Kilda 7.12 (54) St Kilda\u2019s Rowan Marshall misses a set shot from 30m out straight in front after being paid a pretty generous mark. Time running out... AFL: Q4: 3 mins remaining: North Melbourne 8.8 (56) lead St Kilda 7.11 (53) North Melbourne hit the front late! Ben Cunnington has kicked his second, to go with his 24 disposals, to put the Roos ahead with time running out. AFL: Q4: 4 mins remaining: North Melbourne 7.8 (50) trail St Kilda 7.11 (53) This one is going down to the wire. Australian sport: This story is moving rapidly as Australian sporting bodies respond to the earlier press conference by the federal government announcing travel restrictions, and the statement by South Australia that they are closing their borders. NRL boss Peter V\u2019landys remains adamant his competition will continue as long as possible and do all it can to make up lost time in the advent of a suspension. The AFL is yet to respond formally, presumably waiting to factor in the ramifications of Victoria stepping up restrictions of movement that are expected to be announced over the next 48 hours. The A-League has already made a number of alterations to its calendar with further sure to follow. AFL: 3QT: North Melbourne 6.7 (43) trail St Kilda 6.11 (47) An almighty turnaround for the Kangaroos after half-time, salvaging a dire situation to kick four goals in a row to set up a nail-biting final quarter at Marvel Stadium. Jared Polec is leading the way with 24 disposals. We are the navy blues rings around an empty Princes Park to celebrate Carlton\u2019s progression to a second preliminary final in a row. The Blues dominated after quarter-time, pressing home their advantage on the scoreboard after the main break. Georgia Gee\u2019s three goals were the highlight while Maddy Prespakis saw the most footy with 18 touches. Up next, theoretically at least, is a date with Conference A winners North Melbourne next weekend. AFLW: Q4: 8 mins remaining: Carlton 5.7 (37) v 2.3 (15) Brisbane: That\u2019ll do for the Blues. Georgia Gee has just snapped her third to cap an electrifying performance and ice a preliminary final spot for Carlton. AFLW: Q4: 12 mins remaining: Carlton 4.6 (30) v 2.3 (15) Brisbane: Carlton will be happy the opening few minutes of the final quarter have been a scrappy stoppage-filled midfield battle. AFLW: 3QT: Carlton 4.6 (30) v 2.3 (15) Brisbane: Madison Prespakis is the leading ball-winner on the ground but she is currently on the bench having her ankle re-strapped following an awkward fall in the third quarter. Australian sport: For now, Australia\u2019s football codes intend to press on despite the latest federal government advice to stop all non-essential travel and South Australia\u2019s plan to close its borders. AFLW: 3QT: Carlton 4.6 (30) v 2.3 (15) Brisbane: The Blues could not convert their second-quarter dominance into a healthy lead but they kicked clear of the Lions after the main break until a brain fade in the shadow of the siren opened the door for Brisbane to kick a momentum changer. AFL: HT: North Melbourne 2.2 (14) trail St Kilda 6.7 (43) A terrific start to the season for St Kilda, dominating the opening half against North Melbourne at Marvel Stadium. There\u2019s even more bad news for the Roos with Josh Walker out for the remainder of the match after hurting his neck and shoulder in a very ugly fall after rising for a marking contest. AFLW: HT: Carlton 2.2 (14) v 1.2 (8) Brisbane: Carlton\u2019s quarter but Daniel Harford will be rueing his side\u2019s inability to kick clear of the Lions. All the play was in Brisbane\u2019s defensive half but the Blues failed to fashion many clear cut scoring opportunities. Five Blues are into double figures for possessions, led by Kerryn Harrington\u2019s 13. AFLW: Q2: 3 mins remaining: Carlton 2.2 (14) v 1.2 (8) Brisbane: It\u2019s still all on Carlton\u2019s terms but Brisbane have done well to restrict damage on the scoreboard. Prespakis could have done better with a makable set shot on an angle in the left forward pocket. AFLW: Q2: 7 mins remaining: Carlton 2.1 (13) v 1.2 (8) Brisbane: Carlton all over Brisbane in this second quarter, applying ferocious forward pressure to keep the ball in dangerous territory - Hosking especially to the fore. The Blues\u2019 ball movement isn\u2019t particularly efficient though so they\u2019ve been unable to convert their territorial advantage into goals. AFLW: Q2: 10 mins remaining: Carlton 2.1 (13) v 1.2 (8) Brisbane: Darcy Vescio wastes little time kicking the Blues back in front after quarter time. AFL: QT: St Kilda 3.3 (21) lead North Melbourne 1.1 (7) Coronavirus: Ok, so while I\u2019ve been setting up today\u2019s blog and keeping an eye on the AFLW, the Prime Minister has been speaking Canberra. For all those details check in here: The impact on sport seems inevitable, with further restrictions on movement on the way. The South Australian state government has imposed its own measures which will inevitably impact the AFL and A-League. I\u2019ll bring you reaction from league bosses as it comes through. AFLW: QT: Carlton 1.0 (6) v 1.2 (8) Brisbane: A breathless, keenly contested opening quarter ends with the Lions a couple of behinds ahead. AFLW: Q1: 5 mins remaining: Carlton 1.0 (6) v 1.0 (6) Brisbane: Carlton waste no time hitting back. Dominating possession from the centre bounce a frustrated Brisbane defence eventually snaps, conceding an unnecessary free-kick on the arc then guaranteeing Tayla Harris a goal with the addition of a 50m penalty. AFLW: Q1: 6 mins remaining: Carlton 0.0 (0) v 1.0 (6) Brisbane: A manic but largely unstructured start to this contest has just been punctuated by Jess Wuetschner opening the scoring, the Lion throwing the Sherrin onto her right boot and snapping through after the ball bobbled loose following a spell of possession inside attacking 50. AFLW: Carlton 0.0 (0) v 0.0 (0) Brisbane: We\u2019re underway in the last AFLW semi-final of the weekend. The winner of this one at the old Princes Park in Melbourne will face North Melbourne in a prelim. The Blues host this final after finishing second in Conference B with a 5-1 win-loss record. The Lions were 3-2 in Conference A, good enough for third place. Hello everybody, and welcome to another edition of Sportwatch. Improbably, and possibly idiotically, a few Australian sporting competitions are continuing to defy the global orthodoxy and are keeping calm and carrying on. That means (pending last-minute cancellations) our rundown looks something like this... The AFLW contains the most important action of the afternoon with Carlton hosting Brisbane in the last semi-final from 1.10pm. The AFL men\u2019s competition continues its opening round with North Melbourne taking on St Kilda at 1.05pm, Hawthorn renewing hostilities with Brisbane at 3.40pm before West Coast round everything off at 6.40pm with the visit of Melbourne. The NRL still has unfinished business with Wests Tigers and the Knights doing battle from 4.05pm followed immediately afterwards (6.15pm) by the Titans and Eels. Alongside this, inevitably, there will be news filtering through during the day as the impact of the latest government-imposed measures to restrict the spread of Covid-19 filter through.

      "body": "<p>Images of empty museums, cinemas, concert halls and galleries across the country are quickly becoming emblems of our changing life. And this weekend there is fresh speculation that the world\u2019s biggest arts festival in Edinburgh will not take place this August.</p> <p>The end of live performance and public cultural activity is one of the most comprehensive of the myriad shocks to the British economy, as well as to a sense of normality. Theatre doors were closed by a puritanical English regime in 1642, but this total shutdown covers every form of shared entertainment and built heritage. And what now worries the country\u2019s arts institutions is how this world-beating resource can be protected during lockdown.</p> <p>The lights began to go out in the West End of London last Monday when the prime minister classed theatres and cinemas among places to avoid. The Old Vic, where Daniel Radcliffe was starring, reluctantly brought down the curtain first.</p> <p>Almost every other production and solo show in the land followed. From the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-on-Avon and the opera house in Covent Garden to a popular touring production of Helen Forrester\u2019s work <em>By the Waters of Liverpool</em>, the news was the same. The sentiments of Rob Fennah, this new show\u2019s writer and co-producer, were typical: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let this get the better of us. We will relaunch early next year, bigger, bolder and as glorious as ever!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>As Boris Johnson was speaking, almost a week ago, thousands of actors, musicians and comedians were still preparing to perform. At London\u2019s small and unsubsidised Jermyn Street Theatre, a highly acclaimed new production of Shakespeare\u2019s <em>The Tempest</em>, with veteran star Michael Pennington, went on with the director reading a part played by an actor who had suddenly been put into isolation by new symptoms. On Tuesday, a final performance was filmed without an audience. In Eastbourne, the cast of Alan Bennett\u2019s <em>The Habit of Art</em>, starring Matthew Kelly, swiftly organised a similar filmed performance on Wednesday. The actors did not want to walk away without a record.</p> <p>From self-isolation, Melvyn Bragg told the <em>Observer</em> it would be difficult for artists to boost general morale, as Myra Hess did during the war by playing piano in the National Gallery. \u201cIt is much worse than what we know of the blitz, sadly,\u201d said Lord Bragg. \u201cTheatres did not all shut in the blitz. This is a different thing altogether because performers are endangering everyone.\u201d</p> <p>The government\u2019s initial advice to the public prompted anger from many commentators.The playwright Lucy Prebble said that it was unfair to leave the decision up to imperilled arts companies and venues. \u201cWhat a dereliction of duty,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lucyprebblish/status/1239608334845652992\" title=\"\">she argued on Twitter</a>, \u201cto pass on the decision to confused small business owners, performers and consumers.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7097e5d08945ebca2bdeb8cdb45158698022c777\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7097e5d08945ebca2bdeb8cdb45158698022c777/0_0_5906_3544/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two visitors look over the gate of Anne Hathaway\u2019s cottage in Straford-on-Avon, now closed to the public.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two visitors look over the gate of Anne Hathaway\u2019s cottage in Straford-on-Avon, now closed to the public.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Society of London Theatre, having been forced to cancel the Olivier awards, spoke on Friday on behalf of the major booking companies to reassure those with tickets. Everyone will be contacted with a credit note or refund, it promised: \u201cThere is nothing you need to do.\u201d</p> <p>Big-name comedians such as Rob Brydon have had to abort their touring schedules. \u201cRefunds are available,\u201d he announced on social media, \u201cLet\u2019s stay safe.\u201d</p> <p>The reactions of such prominent stars are the most noticed, but well known names are at least often financially cushioned. Supporting cast and stage crew have nowhere to look for work. This weekend they may have been able to take some comfort from Rishi Sunak\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/20/government-pay-wages-jobs-coronavirus-rishi-sunak\" title=\"\">revised provisions to protect vulnerable businesses </a>and those in rented homes. But the chancellor\u2019s latest measures are not enough, according to Christine Payne, the general secretary of the actors\u2019 union, Equity. </p> <p>\u201cEntertainment workers have been badly let down by the government,\u201d she said. \u201cThe chancellor claims that \u2018any employer\u2019 will be eligible for the job retention scheme \u2013 not in our sector. Suspension of the universal credit minimum income floor and tax deferrals are a drop in the ocean compared to the losses experienced by our members, and fall far short of the support available to workers elsewhere in the economy.</p> <p>\u201cWe will fight on to put the case for our members who have provided billions in revenue for the UK but are not being protected in their hour of need.\u201d\u200b</p> <p>Last week saw the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/18/glastonbury-festival-postponed-due-to-coronavirus\" title=\"\">cancellation of Glastonbury\u2019s 50th anniversary </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/18/glastonbury-festival-postponed-due-to-coronavirus\" title=\"\">festival</a>, with headliners Paul McCartney and Taylor Swift asked to bide their time.

      "bodyText": "Images of empty museums, cinemas, concert halls and galleries across the country are quickly becoming emblems of our changing life. And this weekend there is fresh speculation that the world\u2019s biggest arts festival in Edinburgh will not take place this August. The end of live performance and public cultural activity is one of the most comprehensive of the myriad shocks to the British economy, as well as to a sense of normality. Theatre doors were closed by a puritanical English regime in 1642, but this total shutdown covers every form of shared entertainment and built heritage. And what now worries the country\u2019s arts institutions is how this world-beating resource can be protected during lockdown. The lights began to go out in the West End of London last Monday when the prime minister classed theatres and cinemas among places to avoid. The Old Vic, where Daniel Radcliffe was starring, reluctantly brought down the curtain first. Almost every other production and solo show in the land followed. From the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-on-Avon and the opera house in Covent Garden to a popular touring production of Helen Forrester\u2019s work By the Waters of Liverpool, the news was the same. The sentiments of Rob Fennah, this new show\u2019s writer and co-producer, were typical: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let this get the better of us. We will relaunch early next year, bigger, bolder and as glorious as ever!\u201d As Boris Johnson was speaking, almost a week ago, thousands of actors, musicians and comedians were still preparing to perform. At London\u2019s small and unsubsidised Jermyn Street Theatre, a highly acclaimed new production of Shakespeare\u2019s The Tempest, with veteran star Michael Pennington, went on with the director reading a part played by an actor who had suddenly been put into isolation by new symptoms. On Tuesday, a final performance was filmed without an audience. In Eastbourne, the cast of Alan Bennett\u2019s The Habit of Art, starring Matthew Kelly, swiftly organised a similar filmed performance on Wednesday. The actors did not want to walk away without a record. From self-isolation, Melvyn Bragg told the Observer it would be difficult for artists to boost general morale, as Myra Hess did during the war by playing piano in the National Gallery. \u201cIt is much worse than what we know of the blitz, sadly,\u201d said Lord Bragg. \u201cTheatres did not all shut in the blitz. This is a different thing altogether because performers are endangering everyone.\u201d The government\u2019s initial advice to the public prompted anger from many commentators.The playwright Lucy Prebble said that it was unfair to leave the decision up to imperilled arts companies and venues. \u201cWhat a dereliction of duty,\u201d she argued on Twitter, \u201cto pass on the decision to confused small business owners, performers and consumers.\u201d The Society of London Theatre, having been forced to cancel the Olivier awards, spoke on Friday on behalf of the major booking companies to reassure those with tickets. Everyone will be contacted with a credit note or refund, it promised: \u201cThere is nothing you need to do.\u201d Big-name comedians such as Rob Brydon have had to abort their touring schedules. \u201cRefunds are available,\u201d he announced on social media, \u201cLet\u2019s stay safe.\u201d The reactions of such prominent stars are the most noticed, but well known names are at least often financially cushioned. Supporting cast and stage crew have nowhere to look for work. This weekend they may have been able to take some comfort from Rishi Sunak\u2019s revised provisions to protect vulnerable businesses and those in rented homes. But the chancellor\u2019s latest measures are not enough, according to Christine Payne, the general secretary of the actors\u2019 union, Equity. \u201cEntertainment workers have been badly let down by the government,\u201d she said. \u201cThe chancellor claims that \u2018any employer\u2019 will be eligible for the job retention scheme \u2013 not in our sector. Suspension of the universal credit minimum income floor and tax deferrals are a drop in the ocean compared to the losses experienced by our members, and fall far short of the support available to workers elsewhere in the economy. \u201cWe will fight on to put the case for our members who have provided billions in revenue for the UK but are not being protected in their hour of need.\u201d Last week saw the cancellation of Glastonbury\u2019s 50th anniversary festival, with headliners Paul McCartney and Taylor Swift asked to bide their time. Deposits already paid by fans were rolled over for a year. Eurovision is also over before it began. Yet both rock and classical musicians, denied access to an audience, have been among the first to react by trying to reach the public online. Singers including Rufus Wainwright have been posting solo performances recorded at home for fans, and on Friday the London Symphony Orchestra released details of Always Playing, a digital programme of concerts which will be streamed free on the LSO YouTube channel this month and next, replacing its scheduled performances at the Barbican in London. The Royal Opera House has also unveiled a selection of free ballets and operas available on its Facebook and YouTube channels. Perhaps the most unnerving cultural news for the wider population has been the production paralysis of filmed and televised drama, mainstays of the national conversation. Continuing series such as the BBC\u2019s EastEnders and Holby, and Channel 4\u2019s Hollyoaks, have either been paused or scaled down. ITV has changed the scheduling of Coronation Street and Emmerdale, but aims to continue filming in Manchester and Leeds \u201cwhilst carefully adhering to the latest health advice\u201d. Postponed alongside Daniel Craig\u2019s James Bond, who will not be operational again until next year, is Disney\u2019s live-action remake of Mulan. But much of the entertainment impact will not be felt until next year, as filming of hit returning drama series including the BBC\u2019s Peaky Blinders and Netflix\u2019s The Crown and Stranger Things, has all halted, in addition to all major movie productions. Warner Brothers has suspended production on The Batman while another Disney live-action remake, The Little Mermaid, is now waiting indefinitely in the wings. In addition, Jurassic World: Dominion is no longer being filmed by Universal. Tom Hanks, perhaps the world\u2019s highest-profile coronavirus sufferer, was to play \u201cColonel Tom\u201d Parker in Baz Luhrmann\u2019s biopic of Elvis Presley, but production stopped well before he and his wife could finish their period of isolation together in Australia. On Thursday, organisers of the Cannes film festival admitted defeat. The showcase on the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur has been shifted back to high summer at the earliest.

      "body": "<p>Ai Weiwei\u2019s studio can be found behind unmarked, black metal doors in a grand square in the old east Berlin. You immediately descend two flights of very steep stone stairs before emerging, blinking for light, into a vast, brick-lined cavern that has the proportions of a church. The temperature drops a few degrees. The space was originally, back in the mid-19th century, the cooling warehouses for the Bavarian brewer Joseph Pfeffer. But, since Ai fled China five years ago, this has been his main place of work \u2013 and, given that the 62-year-old artist and activist is almost always working, more besides.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m here, it\u2019s like my home,\u201d says Ai, who wears a blue hoodie and comfortable shoes, his beard less unruly than it appears in photographs. \u201c<em>Like</em> my home,\u201d he clarifies. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a home. In China, my studio was often destroyed. So for me, it\u2019s a shelter \u2013 a shelter not so different from refugees in the camps that gradually build up. I can leave, of course, but since 2015, I have stayed here, never had a holiday or weekends. I\u2019m working all the time.\u201d His face crinkles into a smile: \u201cI love work.\u201d</p> <p>Ai\u2019s output is prolific and diverse. In 2008, he was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/07/olympics2008.china\" title=\"\">artistic consultant for the Olympic Stadium </a>in Beijing, the Bird\u2019s Nest. Two years later, he filled the Turbine Hall at Tate Modern with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/oct/15/tate-modern-sunflower-seeds-ban\" title=\"\">100</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/oct/15/tate-modern-sunflower-seeds-ban\" title=\"\">m</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/oct/15/tate-modern-sunflower-seeds-ban\" title=\"\"> handmade and painted porcelain sunflower seeds</a>. Early in his career, he made a photo series of himself <a href=\"https://publicdelivery.org/ai-weiwei-dropping-a-han-dynasty-urn/\" title=\"\">dropping a splendid, 2,000-year-old Han dynasty urn</a>. Recently, he has created several powerful works \u2013 installations, video and a documentary \u2013 on<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/02/refugee-crisis-human-flow-ai-weiwei-china\" title=\"\"> the refugee crisis.</a> War and its fallout is also the subject of his latest work, <em>History of Bombs</em>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In China they say, you\u2019re born as a nude person, you die as a nude person. You should understand both ends</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Until the coronavirus outbreak, Ai\u2019s design \u2013 a grid of 50 explosive devices from a 1911 grenade to a 2019 guided nuclear missile \u2013 was due to cover the floor of the Imperial War Museum London\u2019s vast atrium, underneath the suspended Spitfire and Harrier jet, leading visitors to the spring exhibition, Refugees: Forced to Flee.</p> <p>Now the exhibition is postponed and Ai says when contacted last week: \u201cCultural institutions are probably the last to be damaged, but the first to show how severely this can affect our understanding about art and culture, which reflect tragic human moments like this. It is very hard to predict the future, but it seems like the situation is not going to be easily resolved and will have a strong impact. All the factors that allowed for this incident still remain the same \u2013 this could happen again \u2013 and a more thoughtful response in terms of social structure and the philosophical understanding of this situation is required.\u201d</p> <p>Ai\u2019s notoriety now of course reaches far beyond the art world. He took the 99-year lease on his Berlin studio in 2010 when he was starting to worry about his safety \u2013 his freedom \u2013 in China. He was right to be concerned: in April 2011, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/apr/03/ai-weiwei-detained-chinese-police\" title=\"\">he was arrested and jailed</a> for 81 days on insubstantial charges. His passport was confiscated and only returned to him in 2015, at which point he came to Germany.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bcf3c19a9198c9f99e7c4d197e4aa2f27ad003ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bcf3c19a9198c9f99e7c4d197e4aa2f27ad003ec/0_411_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ai Weiwei in his Berlin studio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ai Weiwei in his Berlin studio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steffen Roth/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhen a friend showed me the space, it was in a very bad condition,\u201d Ai recalls. \u201cThat\u2019s why nobody wanted it: it\u2019s dark, it\u2019s wet, it\u2019s cold. There\u2019s no light down here. So I said: \u2018I want it.\u2019 He was surprised and said: \u2018Why do you want it?\u2019 And I said: \u2018Because there are so many problems, and I like to solve problems!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Before Ai was an artist, he was an architect, and it shows. The studio now has natural light from goodness knows where, and is clinically clean and dry. For the most part, anyway. A while back, he discovered water dripping from the ceiling, so he went to see his upstairs neighbour, the Danish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson, about it. \u201cOlafur is my dear friend, but we don\u2019t see each other very often, maybe once every three months,\u201d says Ai. \u201cSo I said: \u2018Olafur, it\u2019s leaking!\u2019 And he said: \u2018Oh, I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 And I said: \u2018No, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll call it a waterfall and when you have the chance, come down to sign it!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Those who follow Ai\u2019s work and pronouncements might be surprised to learn that he still has a base in Berlin. At the end of last year, he moved with his partner and 10-year-old son to Cambridge. In January, he gave an interview to the <em>Guardian</em> in which he was so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jan/21/ai-weiwei-on-his-new-life-in-britain-germany-virtual-reality-film\" title=\"\">excoriating about life in Germany</a> that you might imagine that he would never set foot in the country again. Germans, he said, \u201cdeeply don\u2019t like foreigners\u201d. He went even further: nazism \u2013 by his definition, as an ideology that dismisses alternative viewpoints \u2013 \u201cperfectly exists in German daily life today\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa63426c6105bea8a4f61782832679aea4e44a01\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa63426c6105bea8a4f61782832679aea4e44a01/0_277_4852_2911/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of six containers that comprise Ai Weiwei\u2019s work S.A.C.R.E.D, 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of six containers that comprise Ai Weiwei\u2019s work S.A.C.R.E.D, 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What has been the reaction to these comments in Germany? \u201cWhen I chat like this, it is only because journalists ask me and I have to answer,\u201d says Ai. \u201cThe German response was very heavy, very dark \u2013 a form of \u2018love it or leave it\u2019, or \u2018go back to China\u2019 . Or the more intellectual was: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s only a few taxi drivers.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Yes, but that is a long ride.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Ai guffaws, but he\u2019s totally serious. He has to keep his studio in Berlin for now, but would like to relocate. \u201cI know I would never get a place like this, but so what?\u201d he says. \u201cMany people have to leave their nation barehanded, and maybe before they used to have a palace. In China they say, you\u2019re born as a nude person, you die as a nude person. You should understand both ends.\u201d</p> <p>One of the differences Ai sees between the UK and Germany is the engagement with his work and his opinions. He says that he has done more interviews in one week with the British media than in five years with German outlets. \u201cThe Hong Kong riots, the corona situation \u2013 I thought the German press would ask what we think about it, right?\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not blaming them or asking for this, but it makes me feel kind of like I\u2019m in China, because my name cannot be written.\u201d</p> <p>On the evidence of this feature, a You Ask the Questions special, there is certainly an intense fascination with Ai in Britain (there are also at least a couple of questions from Germany, and submissions from all over the world). The many hundreds of inquiries ranged from his early life (Ai\u2019s father Ai Qing was a notable poet who was ostracised for criticising the Maoist regime; the family lived in a cave for five years and his father was made to clean the village toilet) to his opinions on music and food (he\u2019s obsessed with one, not the other). At one point Ai stops me mid-sentence and marvels: \u201cYou have important questions from a lot of powerful people! Amazing!\u201d</p> <p>Subject to any further disruption due to coronavirus, IWM plans to open History of Bombs this summer at IWM London as part of IWM\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.iwm.org.uk/events/refugees-forced-to-flee\" title=\"\">Refugees season</a>.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2><strong>Questions from cultural figures</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1f8e1e873ab909caa4cf97edaac3746695c87230\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f8e1e873ab909caa4cf97edaac3746695c87230/0_0_619_619/500.png\" alt=\"Maria Balshaw\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Maria Balshaw</strong><br>Director of the Tate galleries</h2> <p><strong>You have moved to the UK just as we leave the European Union.

But hardship can also be defined as a long period of mental and intellectual struggle.</p> <p>Marcel Duchamp\u2019s work, <em>The Large Glass</em> [also known as <em>The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even</em>] looks very casual.

For me, that period lasted almost 45 years: I either didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do or I knew what I wanted but I didn\u2019t get the chance to do it. But since 2005, when I touched a computer for the first time and started to learn how to type, I began working on the internet and have been reborn.

So in that sense art is dangerous because art doesn\u2019t accept any kind of regulation or any kind of principle; instead you have to go to an unknown area. Art helps our human understanding of our situation. Words like \u201crefugee\u201d and \u201cterrorist\u201d are a simplification and those words destroy the humanity.</p> <h2>* * *</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2d609a1a8fd01a4913541234d442f46d1c1a0e6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d609a1a8fd01a4913541234d442f46d1c1a0e6f/0_0_619_619/500.png\" alt=\"Elif Shafak.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Elif Shafak<br></strong>Writer</h2> <p><strong>After creating so many works of art that give voice to the voiceless across the world, I wonder what are the emotions that you find easier to think, write or express in Chinese and what are the emotions you find easier to think, write or express in English?

And that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2><strong>Questions from readers</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af233a7d4fd51458ca8d540a193a157043eebe4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af233a7d4fd51458ca8d540a193a157043eebe4b/0_99_4669_2802/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chinese students and their supporters hold a memorial for coronavirus whistleblower Dr Li Wenliang, UCLA, Westwood, California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chinese students and their supporters hold a memorial for coronavirus whistleblower Dr Li Wenliang, UCLA, Westwood, California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Ralston/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Aren\u2019t you discouraged by the lack of political change in China after fighting for so long?</strong><br><em><strong>Anonymous, Croatia</strong></em><br>I\u2019m totally discouraged.

They are for someone who doesn\u2019t mind seeing a dentist, because they will break their teeth on them! But seriously, in China, all the activists love these seeds, they call them the seeds of freedom. So we\u2019ve sent out a few million seeds. It\u2019s very costly, but they give them to their loved ones as wedding or engagement presents. They make a little earring or something. They really love them. I don\u2019t know why.</p> <p><strong>How did you and your family survive living in a hole in the ground for five years?</strong><br><em><strong>Anne Gray, UK</strong></em><br>We survived and had many happy moments in that hole [during the cultural revolution, Ai\u2019s family had to live in an underground cavern previously used for farm animals].

      "bodyText": "Ai Weiwei\u2019s studio can be found behind unmarked, black metal doors in a grand square in the old east Berlin. You immediately descend two flights of very steep stone stairs before emerging, blinking for light, into a vast, brick-lined cavern that has the proportions of a church. The temperature drops a few degrees. The space was originally, back in the mid-19th century, the cooling warehouses for the Bavarian brewer Joseph Pfeffer. But, since Ai fled China five years ago, this has been his main place of work \u2013 and, given that the 62-year-old artist and activist is almost always working, more besides. \u201cWhen I\u2019m here, it\u2019s like my home,\u201d says Ai, who wears a blue hoodie and comfortable shoes, his beard less unruly than it appears in photographs. \u201cLike my home,\u201d he clarifies. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a home. In China, my studio was often destroyed. So for me, it\u2019s a shelter \u2013 a shelter not so different from refugees in the camps that gradually build up. I can leave, of course, but since 2015, I have stayed here, never had a holiday or weekends. I\u2019m working all the time.\u201d His face crinkles into a smile: \u201cI love work.\u201d Ai\u2019s output is prolific and diverse. In 2008, he was the artistic consultant for the Olympic Stadium in Beijing, the Bird\u2019s Nest. Two years later, he filled the Turbine Hall at Tate Modern with 100m handmade and painted porcelain sunflower seeds. Early in his career, he made a photo series of himself dropping a splendid, 2,000-year-old Han dynasty urn. Recently, he has created several powerful works \u2013 installations, video and a documentary \u2013 on the refugee crisis. War and its fallout is also the subject of his latest work, History of Bombs. Until the coronavirus outbreak, Ai\u2019s design \u2013 a grid of 50 explosive devices from a 1911 grenade to a 2019 guided nuclear missile \u2013 was due to cover the floor of the Imperial War Museum London\u2019s vast atrium, underneath the suspended Spitfire and Harrier jet, leading visitors to the spring exhibition, Refugees: Forced to Flee. Now the exhibition is postponed and Ai says when contacted last week: \u201cCultural institutions are probably the last to be damaged, but the first to show how severely this can affect our understanding about art and culture, which reflect tragic human moments like this. It is very hard to predict the future, but it seems like the situation is not going to be easily resolved and will have a strong impact. All the factors that allowed for this incident still remain the same \u2013 this could happen again \u2013 and a more thoughtful response in terms of social structure and the philosophical understanding of this situation is required.\u201d Ai\u2019s notoriety now of course reaches far beyond the art world. He took the 99-year lease on his Berlin studio in 2010 when he was starting to worry about his safety \u2013 his freedom \u2013 in China. He was right to be concerned: in April 2011, he was arrested and jailed for 81 days on insubstantial charges. His passport was confiscated and only returned to him in 2015, at which point he came to Germany. \u201cWhen a friend showed me the space, it was in a very bad condition,\u201d Ai recalls. \u201cThat\u2019s why nobody wanted it: it\u2019s dark, it\u2019s wet, it\u2019s cold. There\u2019s no light down here. So I said: \u2018I want it.\u2019 He was surprised and said: \u2018Why do you want it?\u2019 And I said: \u2018Because there are so many problems, and I like to solve problems!\u2019\u201d Before Ai was an artist, he was an architect, and it shows. The studio now has natural light from goodness knows where, and is clinically clean and dry. For the most part, anyway. A while back, he discovered water dripping from the ceiling, so he went to see his upstairs neighbour, the Danish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson, about it. \u201cOlafur is my dear friend, but we don\u2019t see each other very often, maybe once every three months,\u201d says Ai. \u201cSo I said: \u2018Olafur, it\u2019s leaking!\u2019 And he said: \u2018Oh, I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 And I said: \u2018No, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll call it a waterfall and when you have the chance, come down to sign it!\u2019\u201d Those who follow Ai\u2019s work and pronouncements might be surprised to learn that he still has a base in Berlin. At the end of last year, he moved with his partner and 10-year-old son to Cambridge. In January, he gave an interview to the Guardian in which he was so excoriating about life in Germany that you might imagine that he would never set foot in the country again. Germans, he said, \u201cdeeply don\u2019t like foreigners\u201d. He went even further: nazism \u2013 by his definition, as an ideology that dismisses alternative viewpoints \u2013 \u201cperfectly exists in German daily life today\u201d. What has been the reaction to these comments in Germany? \u201cWhen I chat like this, it is only because journalists ask me and I have to answer,\u201d says Ai. \u201cThe German response was very heavy, very dark \u2013 a form of \u2018love it or leave it\u2019, or \u2018go back to China\u2019 . Or the more intellectual was: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s only a few taxi drivers.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Yes, but that is a long ride.\u2019\u201d Ai guffaws, but he\u2019s totally serious. He has to keep his studio in Berlin for now, but would like to relocate. \u201cI know I would never get a place like this, but so what?\u201d he says. \u201cMany people have to leave their nation barehanded, and maybe before they used to have a palace. In China they say, you\u2019re born as a nude person, you die as a nude person. You should understand both ends.\u201d One of the differences Ai sees between the UK and Germany is the engagement with his work and his opinions. He says that he has done more interviews in one week with the British media than in five years with German outlets. \u201cThe Hong Kong riots, the corona situation \u2013 I thought the German press would ask what we think about it, right?\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not blaming them or asking for this, but it makes me feel kind of like I\u2019m in China, because my name cannot be written.\u201d On the evidence of this feature, a You Ask the Questions special, there is certainly an intense fascination with Ai in Britain (there are also at least a couple of questions from Germany, and submissions from all over the world). The many hundreds of inquiries ranged from his early life (Ai\u2019s father Ai Qing was a notable poet who was ostracised for criticising the Maoist regime; the family lived in a cave for five years and his father was made to clean the village toilet) to his opinions on music and food (he\u2019s obsessed with one, not the other). At one point Ai stops me mid-sentence and marvels: \u201cYou have important questions from a lot of powerful people! Amazing!\u201d Subject to any further disruption due to coronavirus, IWM plans to open History of Bombs this summer at IWM London as part of IWM\u2019s Refugees season. * * * Questions from cultural figures Maria Balshaw Director of the Tate galleries You have moved to the UK just as we leave the European Union. What does the idea of the nation state mean to you? If you take a historical view, our map is always changing. It continues to evolve. That might be a king\u2019s decision or the people\u2019s decision in a democracy. I don\u2019t think Brexit is a problem. I\u2019ve asked many people and Britain is Britain. It has problems, but it\u2019s still there and this doesn\u2019t add more problems. So it\u2019s a time for people to rethink what Britain is and how to survive. * * * Julian Schnabel Artist and film-maker What is the most satisfying thing to you about being an artist? To not even think that I am an artist has been very satisfying for my work. * * * Wolfgang Tillmans Artist In free societies, people often have the romantic feeling that better art is produced in circumstances of hardship. What would you say to that? This is a tricky question. I would say that many bad artworks have come from circumstances of hardship. But hardship can also be defined as a long period of mental and intellectual struggle. Marcel Duchamp\u2019s work, The Large Glass [also known as The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even] looks very casual. Duchamp had the lightest attitude towards art but his mindset was formed over a long time, taking in poetry, French literature, the attitudes of that generation, Dadaism and surrealism. The Large Glass speaks of all of that. * * * Jude Kelly Theatre director If artists aren\u2019t active in the political space, do you think that they are essentially supporting the status quo? An artist must also be an activist \u2013 aesthetically, morally, or philosophically. That doesn\u2019t mean they have to demonstrate in street protests, but rather deal with these issues through a so-called artistic language. Without that kind of consciousness \u2013 to be blind to human struggle \u2013 one cannot even be called an artist. * * * Hans Ulrich Obrist Artistic director, Serpentine Galleries What is your unrealised project? That will be death. In my life I have gone through pretty much every single trauma: communism, postmodernism, post-capitalism and globalisation, but the only project I think everyone realises is death. I know nothing about death. I haven\u2019t met anybody who has come back to tell me their experience. So I\u2019m waiting for the moment and it will come sooner or later. I\u2019m happy with the work I\u2019ve done, even though I have done so little. Often in life you don\u2019t get the chance to do what you want. For me, that period lasted almost 45 years: I either didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do or I knew what I wanted but I didn\u2019t get the chance to do it. But since 2005, when I touched a computer for the first time and started to learn how to type, I began working on the internet and have been reborn. So in the past 15 years, I basically did everything and I\u2019m pretty satisfied. If I have to die now, I have no regrets. * * * Tim Marlow Director of the Design Museum Given you\u2019ve designed buildings as well as installed art in a whole variety of different spaces, what can artists and architects learn from each other? This is a bit technical, but I think artists and architects are the same profession, if they\u2019re good ones. Even doctors or politicians, they should have vision and they should understand human behaviour and try to offer possibilities for surviving intellectually or physically. * * * Alexandra Pringle Group editor-in-chief of Bloomsbury publishers How can art help the plight of refugees? Art helps human consciousness, art is about individuals\u2019 emotions or ideas or concepts relating to a larger cultural definition of who we are. And art can break boundaries: there\u2019s no \u201crefugees\u201d or other names, even \u201cterrorists\u201d, we\u2019re all human. Art tries to illustrate or explain the situation we are in. So in that sense art is dangerous because art doesn\u2019t accept any kind of regulation or any kind of principle; instead you have to go to an unknown area. Art helps our human understanding of our situation. Words like \u201crefugee\u201d and \u201cterrorist\u201d are a simplification and those words destroy the humanity. * * * Elif Shafak Writer After creating so many works of art that give voice to the voiceless across the world, I wonder what are the emotions that you find easier to think, write or express in Chinese and what are the emotions you find easier to think, write or express in English? I am curious what is your relationship with each language, and how do they differ, if at all, emotionally. For Chinese readers, the sensitivity and storytelling about common feelings and people\u2019s everyday behaviour are the most effective. For western readers, since I was not raised in the west, my arguments are more about matters of ethics and philosophy. Rationality is easier for any audience to understand. * * * Lord Alf Dubs Politician What steps do you think can we take to persuade European public opinion to be more sympathetic to taking in refugees, especially in Britain? It\u2019s not possible to persuade anybody. You can only warn people what the consequences will be of not doing it. The idea of helping the unfortunate has always existed in most religionsIt\u2019s easy to understand but I don\u2019t think people will do it in practice. So, in my work, I\u2019d rather warn about wh at will happen if we are not more sympathetic towards refugees. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. * * * Questions from readers Aren\u2019t you discouraged by the lack of political change in China after fighting for so long? Anonymous, Croatia I\u2019m totally discouraged. But I\u2019m very fortunate I committed to fighting China because China is the ideal opponent. He never dies, you cannot beat him with one punch. So it is my life\u2019s work. You mostly look unhappy. Are you happy, Mr Weiwei? Uwe Wache, Germany I am the happiest person with the saddest face on Earth. Where did all the sesame seeds go?

We have started to analyse and measure and categorise them. We\u2019re still working on that. At the moment, we don\u2019t have a plan for them. We never do anything without totally understanding the situation, or at least thinking that we totally understand the situation. We want to find joy, then we can turn it into some other kind of joy. Would you rather fight a horse-sized duck or 100 duck-sized horses? Ian Tinkler, Shetland I have no preference. I don\u2019t see the difference between my opponents. What I am fighting is an ideology, which has no clear shape or size. As a young man, you destroyed art and cultural artefacts. Do you still see those acts in the same way you did then? Amy Thompson, Mexico My work has a solid understanding, but, at the same time, it happens intuitively. It cannot be repeated or clearly defined by the author. Do you enjoy cooking? What would you serve at a dinner party? Nigel Simpson, UK Yes, tremendously, mainly because my stomach is very sensitive, particularly to food. Cooking is relaxing. Cooking or cutting hair or whatever is a total break from other activities, and stops you getting burned out. What I cook depends on what\u2019s there when I open the refrigerator. I always find something, but my cooking secret is that I cannot cook the same dish twice. I automatically avoid cooking anything the same. It doesn\u2019t matter if it is such a good dish: \u201cCan you redo it?\u201d No, not possible. I see it as art. And I\u2019m not the kind of artist that repeats the same work for 20 years.",

Now Dr Deborah Birx is taking on Covid-19</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many Americans have drawn parallels between HIV and Covid-19, noting the inept government response, the stigmatization of certain groups and the heroism of frontline health workers. Like a ghoulish reboot of a television show, some of the same people have returned. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-dr-deborah-birx-hiv-aids\">Deborah Birx</a>, a longtime HIV doctor in the US military who later became the United States Global Aids coordinator, now serves as the response coordinator for the White House Coronavirus task force. Anthony Fauci, an immunologist, has been the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984.</p> <p>\u201cWe had another silent epidemic: HIV,\u201d Birx said at a White House press conference on Monday. \u201cAnd I just want to recognize the HIV epidemic was solved by the community: the HIV advocates, and activists who stood up when no one was listening and got everyone\u2019s attention.\u201d</p> <p>Her words are unmistakably direct, but for many, the comparison is a cautionary one. HIV has killed nearly 40 million people worldwide since the early 1980s, roughly 700,000 of the victims were Americans \u2013 almost 20,000 of them in San Francisco. The coronavirus has not proven nearly as lethal. Contracting it is certainly not the death sentence that HIV was for so many years, and some advocates are reluctant to push the analogy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"83a11d3471e40ef0f00ee859218acd30a1dd2f88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83a11d3471e40ef0f00ee859218acd30a1dd2f88/47_387_2825_1694/1000.jpg\" alt=\"HIV has killed nearly 40 million people worldwide since the early 1980s, almost 20,000 of them in San Francisco.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">HIV has killed nearly 40 million people worldwide since the early 1980s, almost 20,000 of them in San Francisco.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan Read/Fairfax Media via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey\u2019re both viruses, obviously, and there are some overlapping parts of this that obviously can be compared,\u201d says John Cunningham, the executive director of the National Aids Memorial in San Francisco, which had been set to debut the quilt in early April, for Golden Gate park\u2019s 150th anniversary. \u201cBut in totality, I would never want to draw that direct comparison. That being said, the National Aids Memorial and the Aids Quilt take very seriously our responsibility to share the stories of the epidemic and the stories of a tragic virus that befell a community.\u201d</p> <p>That the Bay Area is a focal point in both epidemics is not lost on longtime Aids activist Cleve Jones. When the city of San Francisco got involved in the fight against HIV, it was spending more than the federal government was, he says.</p> <p>\u201cThe most glaringly obvious similarity is that both pandemics began with Republican administrations and a Republican president who did not acknowledge the gravity of the situation,\u201d Jones says. \u201cAnd the failure of a strong early response led to tragic consequences.\u201d</p> <p>The similarities extend to nomenclature. In the early days, before the term \u201cacquired immunodeficiency disease\u201d, Aids was known as Grid, for \u201cgay-related immune deficiency\u201d \u2013 when it wasn\u2019t simply called the \u201cgay cancer\u201d or the \u201cgay plague\u201d, that is. When Donald Trump insists on tweeting about the \u201cChinese virus\u201d, he claims to be playing tit-for-tat with Communist party <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/conspiracy-theory-that-coronavirus-originated-in-us-gaining-traction-in-china\">propaganda that the virus is of U</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/conspiracy-theory-that-coronavirus-originated-in-us-gaining-traction-in-china\">S</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/conspiracy-theory-that-coronavirus-originated-in-us-gaining-traction-in-china\"> origin</a>. But it ignores the dangers of scapegoating in a time of panic.</p> <p>Racist tropes, like homophobic stigma 35 years ago, can also inspire false confidence in groups who presume they won\u2019t be affected.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CleveJones1/status/1238256075910062080\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://t.co/x3WhkmPcKE\">pic.twitter.com/x3WhkmPcKE</a></p>&mdash; Cleve Jones (@CleveJones1) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CleveJones1/status/1238256075910062080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 13, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>\u201cIn the early days of the Aids epidemic we were told it only affected gay people,\u201d Jones says, \u201cthe result of which was the death of tens of millions of heterosexual men, women and their children\u201d.</p> <p>But before the millions of residents in the six-county Bay Area were told to shelter in place, a meme had spread far and wide among LGBTQ+ Americans. It has two panels, upper and lower. The upper one reads, \u201cStraights: I can\u2019t believe the government would just ignore an epidemic that threatens thousands of lives.\u201d The lower panel reads, \u201cGays: You don\u2019t say...\u201d superimposed over a picture of the Aids Memorial Quilt spread out over the National Mall in Washington DC.</p> <p>It\u2019s a bit harsh and oversimplified, maybe. But the question it presupposes is a valid one in a region on near-lockdown \u2013 because for some people, HIV and coronavirus aren\u2019t separate at all. The fear among long-term survivors of HIV/Aids is potent, according to Dr Lary Abramson, a retired San Francisco physician who treated patients during that epidemic\u2019s early phases.</p> <p>\u201cI can tell you that the people I know who are currently on meds for HIV, who have survived our plague, are taking extreme precautions,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to get anywhere near this coronavirus and are doing all they can to follow the guidelines the NIH is promulgating.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dadff0d84d96f5c96d93fe2db6d964ce38a9a9dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dadff0d84d96f5c96d93fe2db6d964ce38a9a9dc/0_117_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A lone rose sits at the World Aids Day Ceremony at the National Aids Memorial Grove in Golden Gate park on 1 December 2004.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A lone rose sits at the World Aids Day Ceremony at the National Aids Memorial Grove in Golden Gate park on 1 December 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Paul Morris/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For younger generations, the instinct is essentially the opposite: to come together in tough times. Even though social acceptance of LGBTQ+ people has arguably never been higher, queer people reflexively seek refuge in queer spaces. Juanita MORE!, a well-known San Francisco drag performer whose parties have raised tens of thousands of dollars for various LGBTQ+ causes, has to balance her advocacy for nightlife against a consistent message of \u201cStay the fuck home!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs a mother to so many people in San Francisco, I have noticed that a lot of people are having a hard time \u2013 and did all the way up until the quarantine was instated \u2013 staying in,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen we were in that first year of the Aids crisis, that was also hard for a lot of people, and the reason was that everyone had just come to San Francisco. They had just gotten free and come out, and were told again they couldn\u2019t. Those comparisons, to me, are the same.\u201d</p> <p>As of Thursday, some 70 San Franciscans have tested positive for coronavirus, while approximately 15,000 are living with HIV. For Cunningham of the National Aids Memorial, the trauma lingers.</p> <p>\u201cI lived in the Castro during the darkest days of the epidemic,\u201d Cunningham says, referring to San Francisco\u2019s famous gay neighborhood. \u201cAnd since Covid-19 came upon the scene, there has been a building wave of emotion inside of me and others. I\u2019ve had many conversations and it\u2019s bringing up a lot of unresolved grief and anger.\u201d</p> <p>But, he says, the noble impulse to help one another \u2013 within the strictures of a shelter-in-place order \u2013 are a welcome parallel between HIV and the coronavirus.</p> <p>\u201cWhat gave hope and galvanized individuals to step forward out of what was a tragedy, with the discrimination and prejudice and the lack of a response from the government, we saw some of the best in humanity. We saw neighbors helping neighbors. \u2026 Some of the best examples of what it means to be a community were born there.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"abd0b3f7593f000bb6292acff866073d3178dad1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abd0b3f7593f000bb6292acff866073d3178dad1/0_167_5000_3001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump speaks during a news conference with Mike Pompeo, Mike Pence, Dr Deborah Birx and Dr Anthony Fauci.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump speaks during a news conference with Mike Pompeo, Mike Pence, Dr Deborah Birx and Dr Anthony Fauci.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If people can\u2019t feed one another, we can always check in with a phone call or by Zoom. Regarding public-health leadership under a conservative Republican presidential administration, Cunningham observes that it\u2019s \u201cironic that two of our heroes, Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx, were there in the days of the Aids crisis and are here today\u201d.</p> <p>Jones notes the surreality of their presence as well.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the things that almost every longtime survivor I know has commented on is how eerie it is to see them up there smiling and nodding while this fool blathers on,\u201d he says. \u201cOne can only imagine what is going on inside their head. I think both of them are, every day, probably laying out the degrees of harm: If they were to overly criticize Trump, they would be fired.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, Fauci has been conspicuously effusive in his praise for the president. But for nurses at Zuckerberg San Francisco general hospital like Sasha Cuttler, the reassuring presence of capable figures at the top doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into an adequate response on the ground. There, too, a resemblance to the Aids crisis years is unsettling.</p> <p>\u201cWhat strikes me is the casual disregard of the voice of nurses and others on the frontlines. That [comparison] is not off at all,\u201d Cuttler says, adding that they\u2019ve been removed from field nursing in retaliation for speaking with the media about a lack of urgency and coordination in testing for Covid-19.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"88841707ce18084d1ec84debf457febd672991e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88841707ce18084d1ec84debf457febd672991e2/0_42_1006_604/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People march down San Francisco\u2019s Market Street for the 10th international Aids candlelight march in 1993.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People march down San Francisco\u2019s Market Street for the 10th international Aids candlelight march in 1993.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denis Poroy/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As it was with Aids patients during the 1980s at the hospital\u2019s experimental and nurse-led <a href=\"https://ari.ucsf.edu/clinical-care/ward-86\">Ward 86</a>, the frontline caregivers are \u201cpredominantly women and queer people\u201d, Cuttler adds. \u201cAnd we\u2019re doing it with love and caring, making it clear to the patients that we do this job because it\u2019s our job \u2013 and we\u2019re not afraid of them or judging them. Both epidemics are used to blame people for their own illness and doing something bad to spread it.\u201d</p> <p>In the meantime, misinformation has continued unabated, much of it from prominent voices. Displaying considerable ignorance of why residents of the Bay Area were urged to remain at home \u2013 and of how contemporary HIV medications work \u2013 the conservative commentator Mark Steyn remarked on Rush Limbaugh\u2019s show that \u201cIt\u2019s a big gay town, San Francisco, and they\u2019re the ones with all the compromised immune systems from all the protease inhibitors and all the other stuff. And they don\u2019t want all the gays dropping dead on the San Francisco mayor\u2019s watch.\u201d</p> <p>Those words could have been uttered on Tuesday, or on any given Tuesday in 1986.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Because of the coronavirus, the 7 million people who live in the San Francisco Bay Area have been one step shy of a full lockdown since Tuesday. Amid all the canceled plans, cratering small businesses and disruptions to everyday life, another poignant postponement stands out: The Names Project Aids Memorial Quilt\u2019s return to Golden Gate park has been delayed. A viral pandemic, one whose scale we haven\u2019t fully grasped, has interacted with another. Many Americans have drawn parallels between HIV and Covid-19, noting the inept government response, the stigmatization of certain groups and the heroism of frontline health workers. Like a ghoulish reboot of a television show, some of the same people have returned. Deborah Birx, a longtime HIV doctor in the US military who later became the United States Global Aids coordinator, now serves as the response coordinator for the White House Coronavirus task force. Anthony Fauci, an immunologist, has been the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984. \u201cWe had another silent epidemic: HIV,\u201d Birx said at a White House press conference on Monday. \u201cAnd I just want to recognize the HIV epidemic was solved by the community: the HIV advocates, and activists who stood up when no one was listening and got everyone\u2019s attention.\u201d Her words are unmistakably direct, but for many, the comparison is a cautionary one. HIV has killed nearly 40 million people worldwide since the early 1980s, roughly 700,000 of the victims were Americans \u2013 almost 20,000 of them in San Francisco. The coronavirus has not proven nearly as lethal. Contracting it is certainly not the death sentence that HIV was for so many years, and some advocates are reluctant to push the analogy. \u201cThey\u2019re both viruses, obviously, and there are some overlapping parts of this that obviously can be compared,\u201d says John Cunningham, the executive director of the National Aids Memorial in San Francisco, which had been set to debut the quilt in early April, for Golden Gate park\u2019s 150th anniversary. \u201cBut in totality, I would never want to draw that direct comparison. That being said, the National Aids Memorial and the Aids Quilt take very seriously our responsibility to share the stories of the epidemic and the stories of a tragic virus that befell a community.\u201d That the Bay Area is a focal point in both epidemics is not lost on longtime Aids activist Cleve Jones. When the city of San Francisco got involved in the fight against HIV, it was spending more than the federal government was, he says. \u201cThe most glaringly obvious similarity is that both pandemics began with Republican administrations and a Republican president who did not acknowledge the gravity of the situation,\u201d Jones says. \u201cAnd the failure of a strong early response led to tragic consequences.\u201d The similarities extend to nomenclature. In the early days, before the term \u201cacquired immunodeficiency disease\u201d, Aids was known as Grid, for \u201cgay-related immune deficiency\u201d \u2013 when it wasn\u2019t simply called the \u201cgay cancer\u201d or the \u201cgay plague\u201d, that is. When Donald Trump insists on tweeting about the \u201cChinese virus\u201d, he claims to be playing tit-for-tat with Communist party propaganda that the virus is of US origin. But it ignores the dangers of scapegoating in a time of panic. Racist tropes, like homophobic stigma 35 years ago, can also inspire false confidence in groups who presume they won\u2019t be affected. \u201cIn the early days of the Aids epidemic we were told it only affected gay people,\u201d Jones says, \u201cthe result of which was the death of tens of millions of heterosexual men, women and their children\u201d. But before the millions of residents in the six-county Bay Area were told to shelter in place, a meme had spread far and wide among LGBTQ+ Americans. It has two panels, upper and lower. The upper one reads, \u201cStraights: I can\u2019t believe the government would just ignore an epidemic that threatens thousands of lives.\u201d The lower panel reads, \u201cGays: You don\u2019t say...\u201d superimposed over a picture of the Aids Memorial Quilt spread out over the National Mall in Washington DC. It\u2019s a bit harsh and oversimplified, maybe. But the question it presupposes is a valid one in a region on near-lockdown \u2013 because for some people, HIV and coronavirus aren\u2019t separate at all. The fear among long-term survivors of HIV/Aids is potent, according to Dr Lary Abramson, a retired San Francisco physician who treated patients during that epidemic\u2019s early phases. \u201cI can tell you that the people I know who are currently on meds for HIV, who have survived our plague, are taking extreme precautions,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to get anywhere near this coronavirus and are doing all they can to follow the guidelines the NIH is promulgating.\u201d For younger generations, the instinct is essentially the opposite: to come together in tough times. Even though social acceptance of LGBTQ+ people has arguably never been higher, queer people reflexively seek refuge in queer spaces. Juanita MORE!, a well-known San Francisco drag performer whose parties have raised tens of thousands of dollars for various LGBTQ+ causes, has to balance her advocacy for nightlife against a consistent message of \u201cStay the fuck home!\u201d \u201cAs a mother to so many people in San Francisco, I have noticed that a lot of people are having a hard time \u2013 and did all the way up until the quarantine was instated \u2013 staying in,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen we were in that first year of the Aids crisis, that was also hard for a lot of people, and the reason was that everyone had just come to San Francisco. They had just gotten free and come out, and were told again they couldn\u2019t. Those comparisons, to me, are the same.\u201d As of Thursday, some 70 San Franciscans have tested positive for coronavirus, while approximately 15,000 are living with HIV. For Cunningham of the National Aids Memorial, the trauma lingers. \u201cI lived in the Castro during the darkest days of the epidemic,\u201d Cunningham says, referring to San Francisco\u2019s famous gay neighborhood. \u201cAnd since Covid-19 came upon the scene, there has been a building wave of emotion inside of me and others. I\u2019ve had many conversations and it\u2019s bringing up a lot of unresolved grief and anger.\u201d But, he says, the noble impulse to help one another \u2013 within the strictures of a shelter-in-place order \u2013 are a welcome parallel between HIV and the coronavirus. \u201cWhat gave hope and galvanized individuals to step forward out of what was a tragedy, with the discrimination and prejudice and the lack of a response from the government, we saw some of the best in humanity. We saw neighbors helping neighbors. \u2026 Some of the best examples of what it means to be a community were born there.\u201d If people can\u2019t feed one another, we can always check in with a phone call or by Zoom. Regarding public-health leadership under a conservative Republican presidential administration, Cunningham observes that it\u2019s \u201cironic that two of our heroes, Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx, were there in the days of the Aids crisis and are here today\u201d. Jones notes the surreality of their presence as well. \u201cOne of the things that almost every longtime survivor I know has commented on is how eerie it is to see them up there smiling and nodding while this fool blathers on,\u201d he says. \u201cOne can only imagine what is going on inside their head. I think both of them are, every day, probably laying out the degrees of harm: If they were to overly criticize Trump, they would be fired.\u201d Indeed, Fauci has been conspicuously effusive in his praise for the president. But for nurses at Zuckerberg San Francisco general hospital like Sasha Cuttler, the reassuring presence of capable figures at the top doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into an adequate response on the ground. There, too, a resemblance to the Aids crisis years is unsettling. \u201cWhat strikes me is the casual disregard of the voice of nurses and others on the frontlines. That [comparison] is not off at all,\u201d Cuttler says, adding that they\u2019ve been removed from field nursing in retaliation for speaking with the media about a lack of urgency and coordination in testing for Covid-19. As it was with Aids patients during the 1980s at the hospital\u2019s experimental and nurse-led Ward 86, the frontline caregivers are \u201cpredominantly women and queer people\u201d, Cuttler adds. \u201cAnd we\u2019re doing it with love and caring, making it clear to the patients that we do this job because it\u2019s our job \u2013 and we\u2019re not afraid of them or judging them. Both epidemics are used to blame people for their own illness and doing something bad to spread it.\u201d In the meantime, misinformation has continued unabated, much of it from prominent voices. Displaying considerable ignorance of why residents of the Bay Area were urged to remain at home \u2013 and of how contemporary HIV medications work \u2013 the conservative commentator Mark Steyn remarked on Rush Limbaugh\u2019s show that \u201cIt\u2019s a big gay town, San Francisco, and they\u2019re the ones with all the compromised immune systems from all the protease inhibitors and all the other stuff. And they don\u2019t want all the gays dropping dead on the San Francisco mayor\u2019s watch.\u201d Those words could have been uttered on Tuesday, or on any given Tuesday in 1986.",

I will never forget it.</p> <p>On TV, in the hotel bar, Turds looked like death, and not even death warmed up, just death left on a cold pavement and then urinated on by passing dogs. Turds hadn\u2019t seemed this terrified since the morning he won the Brexit referendum, a vote he had clearly intended to lose, having backed Brexit merely for personal career advancement. After two decades battling the imaginary EU phantoms he himself conjured in the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>, Turds now has to fight something real, which can\u2019t just be bullshitted, belittled and bullied into submission. Dominic Cumming\u2019s conveniently fabricated culture war against manufactured traitors is the luxury of another Turds. An actual virus, embodied as a Lovecraftian entity beyond good and evil, with the face of Yog-Sothoth and the voice of Lawrence Fox, is upon him, and death does not recognise puns about Pliny and Horace.</p> <p>I did the maths. I was in a better position than most. In a worst-case scenario, where I didn\u2019t work for 18 months, we\u2019d be OK, unless Turds\u2019s fudged vagueness somehow made me responsible for refunds for shows I never got paid for. For a while it looked as if liability confusion meant I might be contractually obliged to tour the virus-ravaged country anyway, performing jokes to empty theatres, the logical end point of a snobbish stage persona that affects to find the audience approval irrelevant.</p> <p>Within days of the virus gripping Italy, the online adult content provider Pornhub had offered free pornography to isolated Italians; in Britain, in a gesture that identified the key cultural difference between our nations, the National Trust declared its gardens open at no cost. We could do worse than cede the management of Turds\u2019s virus-ridden Britain to decisive staff drawn from the arenas of online pornography and heritage property management, the latter also able to provide exotic locations for the former.</p> <p>On Tuesday morning I wandered Canterbury waiting to find out if that night\u2019s show was cancelled. I went to the museum to see paintings by the war artist Laura Knight, and the actual Bagpuss, but corona had closed it. In the street people were unusually friendly. I talked to a nice old woman who had been to Folkestone to see Ben Fogle \u2013 I had often wondered who would go to Folkestone to see Ben Fogle \u2013 and to a hilarious Turkish chef, who insisted that eating chilli sauce in excess would crush corona, surely a future member of Turds\u2019s top team.</p> <p>The phone rang. Most venues were pulling shows in March and April at their own personal cost and refunding or rescheduling, despite there being no promise of Turds\u2019s support. I was cancelled in Canterbury. Doubtless we all had little moments last week where the reality of what we are about to go through as a species bites. Mine was just then, when I threw my smelly old standup stage jacket in the back of the van in the Canterbury car park. When would I wear it again? Was it even worth getting it dry-cleaned?</p>",

I will never forget it. On TV, in the hotel bar, Turds looked like death, and not even death warmed up, just death left on a cold pavement and then urinated on by passing dogs. Turds hadn\u2019t seemed this terrified since the morning he won the Brexit referendum, a vote he had clearly intended to lose, having backed Brexit merely for personal career advancement. After two decades battling the imaginary EU phantoms he himself conjured in the Daily Telegraph, Turds now has to fight something real, which can\u2019t just be bullshitted, belittled and bullied into submission. Dominic Cumming\u2019s conveniently fabricated culture war against manufactured traitors is the luxury of another Turds. An actual virus, embodied as a Lovecraftian entity beyond good and evil, with the face of Yog-Sothoth and the voice of Lawrence Fox, is upon him, and death does not recognise puns about Pliny and Horace. I did the maths. I was in a better position than most. In a worst-case scenario, where I didn\u2019t work for 18 months, we\u2019d be OK, unless Turds\u2019s fudged vagueness somehow made me responsible for refunds for shows I never got paid for. For a while it looked as if liability confusion meant I might be contractually obliged to tour the virus-ravaged country anyway, performing jokes to empty theatres, the logical end point of a snobbish stage persona that affects to find the audience approval irrelevant. Within days of the virus gripping Italy, the online adult content provider Pornhub had offered free pornography to isolated Italians; in Britain, in a gesture that identified the key cultural difference between our nations, the National Trust declared its gardens open at no cost. We could do worse than cede the management of Turds\u2019s virus-ridden Britain to decisive staff drawn from the arenas of online pornography and heritage property management, the latter also able to provide exotic locations for the former. On Tuesday morning I wandered Canterbury waiting to find out if that night\u2019s show was cancelled. I went to the museum to see paintings by the war artist Laura Knight, and the actual Bagpuss, but corona had closed it. In the street people were unusually friendly. I talked to a nice old woman who had been to Folkestone to see Ben Fogle \u2013 I had often wondered who would go to Folkestone to see Ben Fogle \u2013 and to a hilarious Turkish chef, who insisted that eating chilli sauce in excess would crush corona, surely a future member of Turds\u2019s top team. The phone rang. Most venues were pulling shows in March and April at their own personal cost and refunding or rescheduling, despite there being no promise of Turds\u2019s support. I was cancelled in Canterbury. Doubtless we all had little moments last week where the reality of what we are about to go through as a species bites. Mine was just then, when I threw my smelly old standup stage jacket in the back of the van in the Canterbury car park. When would I wear it again? Was it even worth getting it dry-cleaned?",

The potential impact of it spreading doesn\u2019t bear thinking about.\u201d Many charities the Guardian spoke to said there was political will to tackle the crisis at both a national and local level, a steely determination in the third sector, and compassion in the wider community. On Saturday, Crisis launched the campaign In This Together to raise funds to support people who are homeless during the outbreak. \u201cMaybe if we manage to find shelter for all who need it in this crisis, we will actually see that a home for all is possible,\u201d said Melissa Kerschen of Glass Door. \u201cIt sounds like a cliche, but our fates are all interlinked, and this crisis is showing us that.\u201d On the streets of Glasgow, Willy simply hopes he will have a roof over his head soon. \u201cI want to get in somewhere, I\u2019m sick of living on the street,\u201d he says. \u201cI just don\u2019t feel safe. I feel very vulnerable right now.\u201d",

SK, London Businesses are having to make painful decisions very quickly and, to be fair to the nursery chain, it probably can\u2019t commit to paying staff when it doesn\u2019t know how long it will have to remain closed. Parents\u2019 contracts will almost certainly include a cancellation clause which will allow families to stop paying after a certain amount of notice. In which case the company\u2019s income will plummet \u2013 although the government has declared it will get a year-long holiday from business rates, and the chancellor\u2019s offer to pay 80% of wages should help to prevent redundancies. Bright Horizons did respond to my questioning and says it will now not be charging parents fees for April. \u201cWe continue to pay colleagues and are very mindful of their financial wellbeing and our responsibilities,\u201d it says. My partner and I have a honeymoon booked via Opodo in Japan next week. We paid an extra \u00a3122 on top of the \u00a32,500 cost for its \u201cCancel for Any Reason Guarantee\u201d. This entitles you to your money back minus a 20% service charge. I\u2019m chronically ill with hypothyroidism and asthma so want to postpone the trip to avoid infection. However, Opodo is refusing to pay out. AM, Stevenage, Hertfordshire You are one of several readers to have contacted me about Opodo\u2019s guarantee. Despite the reassuring name of the policy, two words in the small print could cost you your honeymoon. \u201cForce majeure\u201d events are exempted from full refunds in the terms and conditions and customers can only reclaim the cost of the guarantee and any taxes refunded by the airline, unless the airline cancels the flight, in which case a fare refund is due. \u201cIn the current situation, the policy is unfortunately not valid for travel to countries that are heavily affected,\u201d Opodo says, although it has since offered you the option to rebook for no extra charge within the next 12 months.",

      "body": "<p>Congressional leaders in the United States are likely to put a very ugly deal in front of the American people, and if it passes, America may be unrecognizable after this pandemic. But there is a way to stop it, if people on the populist left and people on the populist right work together.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the situation. Mitch McConnell, Chuck Schumer and the Trump administration is negotiating a bailout package to address the coronavirus crisis. There\u2019s been a lot of chatter about the need to support workers as the economy goes into a freeze. This is happening around the world; the British government, for instance, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/20/government-pay-wages-jobs-coronavirus-rishi-sunak\">willing to pay 80% of worker wages</a> during this downturn for those affected by the crisis.</p> <p>But in the US, our leaders seem to be falling prey to what can only be called a corporate frenzy of favor-seeking. \u201cAny time there is a crisis and Washington is in the middle of it is an opportunity for guys like me,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/k-street-lobbyists-get-ready-to-feast-on-coronavirus-stimulus\">one lobbyist</a>.</p> <p>Now first I should say that I don\u2019t know exactly what is going to be in the final bill, because the whole process is opaque and being negotiated right now by some untrustworthy political leaders. We will only find out the details at the last minute. So all I have to go off is rumor and reporting. But if we wait until we know the full contours, it will likely be too late to act. I hope I\u2019m wrong, but the list of what lobbyists are asking for is long, and ugly, and often the requests for money or legislative favors are done to cover up mistakes made before the coronavirus hit.</p> <p>Take Boeing. The aerospace giant of course wants a $60bn bailout. Financial problems for this corporation predated the crisis, with the mismanagement that led to the 737 Max as well as defense and space products that don\u2019t work (I noted <a href=\"https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/the-coming-boeing-bailout\">last July</a> a bailout was coming). The corporation paid out $65bn in stock buybacks and dividends over the last 10 years, and it was drawing down credit lines before this crisis hit. It is highly politically connected; the board of the corporation includes Caroline Kennedy, Ronald Reagan\u2019s Chief of Staff Ken Duberstein, three Fortune 100 CEOs, a former US Trade Representative, and two Admirals, one of whom is the board\u2019s only engineer. Using the excuse of the coronavirus, Boeing is trying to get the taxpayer to foot the bill for its errors, so it can go back to making more of them.</p> <p>But that\u2019s not all. Defense contractors want their payments sped up, and I\u2019ve heard they want to widen a giant loophole called \u2018other transaction authority\u2019 to get around restrictions on profiteering. Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/lobbyists-pile-on-to-get-wins-for-clients-into-coronavirus-stimulus-package-11584792000\">want</a> \u201c$5 billion in grants or loans to keep commercial space company employees on the job and launch facilities open.\u201d They also want the Internal Revenue Service to give them cash for R&amp;D tax credits.</p> <p>CNBC <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/21/coronavirus-1-trillion-rescue-package-might-not-be-enough-for-businesses.html\">reported</a> that hotels want $150bn, restaurants want $145bn and manufacturers wants $1.4tn. And the International Council of Shopping Centers wants a guarantee of up to $1tn. The beer industry <a href=\"https://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-a-lobbying/488541-beer-industry-calls-for-5-billion-in-federal\">wants</a> $5bn. Candy industry wants $500m. The New York Times reported that \u201cAdidas is seeking support for a long-sought provision allowing people to use pretax money to pay for gym memberships and fitness equipment.\u201d Gyms are of course closed. Meatpackers want <a href=\"http://nppc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/PorkIndustryConcernsLetter.pdf\">special visas</a> so they can undercut wages of their workers, and importers want to <a href=\"https://app.emarketeer.com/a/plink/row/v1-t13j3SHcM7T2YTuhSALEzd4miQYO53k~AiO8DKEwbSo.html\">stop paying duties</a> they incurred for harming domestic industries for illegally dumping products into the US.</p> <p>Now, I\u2019m not opposed to supporting industries. This is a crisis, and we do not want a lot of the productive capacity of the United States to fall apart because of a pandemic. But the key to supporting enterprises is to make sure that there are <a href=\"https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/how-to-structure-the-coronavirus\">strict conditions</a>, so that power doesn\u2019t consolidate into the hands of monopolists and financiers cherry-picking distressed assets. Otherwise, America will simply be unrecognizable after this pandemic. CNBC personality Jim Cramer, for instance, is worried that after this pandemic America will <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/20/cramer-us-could-end-up-with-three-retailers-amazon-walmart-costco.html\">have just three</a> retailers. And he\u2019s right to be worried about that.</p> <p>Here\u2019s how we can stop it. There are enough members of Congress to act and prevent what really looks less like a relief package and more a corporate coup. However, the problem is that this group is split into different political parties, and Congressional leadership is taking advantage of that dynamic to jam this through. US Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell wants big business to rule, so he\u2019s playing a trick. He is refusing aid to workers. Democrats are negotiating with him to try to get unemployment assistance and social welfare. McConnell knows Democrats won\u2019t pay attention to corporate bailouts if he takes the public hostage, and Democrats know that they can hand out favors to big business if they just talk about how they got larger checks for workers.</p> <p>So McConnell will put a bill down in front of Nancy Pelosi, with some good stuff like unemployment insurance, but also the really ugly stuff to hand over America to big business. The corporatists in the Democratic party will tell her \u201cPass the corporate coup bill, after all we have to do something right now!\u201d And because she doesn\u2019t have the votes from within her own caucus because of these corporatists, and because she doesn\u2019t particularly care if America is sold off to big business, she will do that. The only hope is to get together a bipartisan group from the right and the left to oppose this charade.</p> <p>And there\u2019s a precedent.</p> <p>In 2008, when Congress was on the brink of passing a $700bn bailout to Wall Street, something astonishing happened. A motley bipartisan group of roughly a hundred members, as well as outside experts, formed what was called the \u201cSkeptic\u2019s Caucus,\u201d and organized enough votes to take down the package. Congressional leaders then attached some minor tweaks, and forced the package through after the stock market crashed. Ultimately, the skeptics failed, and the bailouts ended up shifting power and wealth to an unaccountable elite class.</p> <p>But for that brief moment, it became clear that opposition to Congressional leadership on corporate subsidies is possible. We will need another Skeptic\u2019s caucus, and quickly. And this time, it can succeed. Because this time, no one is fooled by what is happening. We can see it plainly.</p> <p>So whether you are a Republican or Democrat, join a new Skeptic\u2019s caucus. And demand your member of Congress represent <em>you</em>, and not just big business. Help the people by dealing with unemployment, rent, mortgages, not big business executives trying to save their cushy positions.</p> <ul> <li><p>Matt Stoller is a fellow at the Open Markets Institute and the author of Goliath: The Hundred Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy</p></li> </ul>",

      "body": "<h2>Sunday</h2> <p>A member of staff calls me. She has been diagnosed with the virus at Addenbrooke\u2019s hospital, but they haven\u2019t tested her and aren\u2019t planning to. I spend the afternoon calling the Department for Education helpline and my local health protection team to find out if I should close the school. They say carry on as normal, because you haven\u2019t got a confirmed case.</p> <p>I\u2019m sitting there thinking: this is ridiculous. I know I haven\u2019t got a confirmed case, but that\u2019s because they\u2019re not testing. I send out an email to parents explaining the situation.</p> <p>Messages start coming through from other staff saying they\u2019ve got coughs and other signs of coronavirus too \u2013 and staff in high-risk groups are isolating. In total, 14 staff are unable to come to work. We try to pull in supply teachers, but it\u2019s hard to find any.</p> <p>I email parents again to say that we\u2019re not sure whether we\u2019re going to be able to open the next day but we are going to do our best.</p> <p>Senior leaders work until 11pm, putting together a plan of how we can keep the school open. Each time we think we have one, another staff member calls in sick.</p> <h2>Monday</h2> <p>I wake up wondering how many members of staff I will lose that day. But the staff response is amazing. Part-time staff, who weren\u2019t due to come in, offer to work. Parent volunteers and parents who are part-time teachers at other schools say they will help too. It is moving to receive so much support. But by the end of the day, we are 23 staff members down, including some of the key staff who were organising how we would stay open. I work until midnight. I am in practical mode, but I feel worried. How many days are we going to be able to keep going like this? The situation is untenable.</p> <h2>Tuesday</h2> <p>In case the school needs to close, we decide to roll out a new online learning platform so teachers can set activities for pupils at home. We have a staff meeting, and deliver five days\u2019 worth of training in about 40 minutes. But lots of children are not in school, so we cannot give them their log-ins.</p> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <p>We send out another message to parents and carers warning them to start planning emergency childcare arrangements.</p> <p>Since the government is still saying schools will not close, we spend hours coming up with a plan of how we can stay open, with staff numbers dropping each day. In some year groups, only one teacher is left to cover three classes, with supply teachers and high-level teaching assistants trying to help. One teacher who is in that situation is newly qualified and in her first year of teaching. She works her socks off, like everyone else in the school.</p> <p>At 5pm, Boris Johnson announces schools will close on Friday, except for vulnerable children and those whose parents are key workers. I feel relief, but wonder why I, a headteacher, am learning this from a press conference. I think that was extremely disrespectful. Schools should have been informed earlier so we could start working on what to do.</p> <p>We end the day 30 staff members down.</p> <h2>Thursday</h2> <p>The next morning the government still hasn\u2019t told us what the definition of a key worker is. So we are left with two days to try to put some childcare provision together for Monday, and we have no idea how many children are going to be in school and who will be eligible. This is terrible for us, and terrible for the parents who are key workers. They are all asking me: am I meant to be making arrangements or not? The uncertainty is awful.</p> <h2>Friday</h2> <p>At lunchtime, we come down to the staffroom and find that our PTA has put on the table this lovely selection of food, bottles of wine and even emergency toilet rolls that staff could just help themselves to. It is a beautiful moment. Staff start crying. We are aware that it may be the last day at our school for all the children in year 6. That hits us hard. All the lovely things we normally do for the children leaving \u2013 the end-of-year play, the leavers\u2019 assembly, the residential trip. We can\u2019t see any of them happening now.</p> <p>So we give the kids elbow bumps in the playground at the end of the day and say goodbye. It is really emotional. Teachers form a real bond with the children in their class, and vice versa. To have that snipped off in such a brutal fashion is tough. We have a staff meeting to talk everything through at the end of the day, and teachers break down in tears.</p> <h2>Saturday</h2> <p>We decide we will provide as much outdoor learning as we can next week, and disperse the children who do come in throughout the school. I am conscious that key workers in the NHS are the people most likely to be coming into contact with coronavirus cases, and that their children are probably most likely to get infected as a result. At school, these children will all come together, and potentially infect other kids who will return home to the families of the other workers we are most dependent on.</p> <p>Given the way the government has been behind the curve, very reactive and flip-flopping, I haven\u2019t got a huge amount of faith this has been well thought through. But all schools can do is make sure the children aren\u2019t crammed up against each other where possible.</p> <p>When I reflect on the last week, what gives me hope is how often I\u2019ve seen people being supportive, kind and understanding. We\u2019re in uncharted waters but I know I\u2019ve got the most amazing team of people around me \u2013 everyone from our office staff, teaching assistants and teachers to our parents and kids. The strength of our community has been really uplifting and heartwarming. We were already a really close knit community school, but this has brought us that much closer together.</p> <p>When we get our school back, when we get our lives back, we will know what\u2019s most important to us, and I hope we will treasure and value it. Because that will be an amazing foundation for the future.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

Do you understand? If we stay together, we survive.\u201d</p> <p>Rarely is teamwork imprudent and yet, when it comes to infection with Covid-19, close proximity to others might just prove fatal. Until the start of this week, <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/\">official government guidance</a> was that anyone who developed a persistent cough or fever above 37.8C needed to self-isolate at home for seven days. Then, the government ramped up its social distancing measures with the announcement that <em>every</em> member of a household must remain in self-isolation for 14 days if any family member develops a continuous cough or fever.</p> <p>Abruptly, thousands of healthy individuals have found themselves newly quarantined for two weeks, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/the-family-lockdown-guide-how-to-emotionally-prepare-for-coronavirus-quarantine\">most often with family</a>. The new guidance has created unusual household dynamics in which the healthy and the sick co-exist, unable to leave the family home, and possibly bewildered by how best to support each other.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/\">NHS website</a> offers superb, clear, concise practical information on how to manage self-isolation.

Russell Crowe\u2019s hard-boiled hero of the 2000 blockbuster Gladiator has the best one-liners in the whole history of amphitheatres. These are not normal times \u2013 yet I still think that Maximus\u2019s wisdom can work its magic. His most inspiring line of all speaks to the complexities of how we endeavour to care for each other in these daunting days of coronavirus. \u201cWhatever comes out of these gates,\u201d Maximus tells his rag-tag huddle of fledgling gladiators, \u201cwe\u2019ve got a better chance of survival if we work together. Do you understand? If we stay together, we survive.\u201d Rarely is teamwork imprudent and yet, when it comes to infection with Covid-19, close proximity to others might just prove fatal. Until the start of this week, official government guidance was that anyone who developed a persistent cough or fever above 37.8C needed to self-isolate at home for seven days. Then, the government ramped up its social distancing measures with the announcement that every member of a household must remain in self-isolation for 14 days if any family member develops a continuous cough or fever. Abruptly, thousands of healthy individuals have found themselves newly quarantined for two weeks, most often with family. The new guidance has created unusual household dynamics in which the healthy and the sick co-exist, unable to leave the family home, and possibly bewildered by how best to support each other. The NHS website offers superb, clear, concise practical information on how to manage self-isolation. In essence, the person with symptoms should stay, ideally, in a well-ventilated room with a window that can be opened, keeping a minimum distance of two metres away from other people in the home. No one in the household should go outside, even to buy food or other essentials. Exercise outside is permitted, provided it takes place at a safe distance (two metres) from others.

The National Protocol does not direct jurisdictions to do such assessments but instead, leave it to the State\u2019s discretion.</p> \n   <p>Contrary to some public statements made, every cruise liner that has entered NSW ports has been the subject of an assessment well beyond Federal requirements.</p> \n   <p>The National Protocol states \u201cprovided there are no concerns about the COVID-19 risk profile of a ship or suspected COVID-19 cases reported, the human bio-security officer may advise the bio-security officer that pratique can be granted and the ship may be allowed to continue the voyage while samples are being tested\u201d.</p> \n   <p>NSW Health undertook a full assessment of the Ruby Princess, notwithstanding under the National Protocol in place, it could have chosen not to do an assessment.</p> \n   <p>NSW Health again followed the National Protocol that states \u201cthe ship may be allowed to continue the voyage while samples are being tested\u201d.</p> \n   <p>However, as of midnight March 22, NSW Health will go even further beyond the National Protocol and its current own State protocols and will hold all cruise ships in port until any patients highlighted as having respiratory issues are tested for COVID-19.</p> \n   <p>The increased testing regime follows 26 confirmed cases of COVID-19 from the Ruby Princess, including 17 passengers and 1 crew member diagnosed in NSW, and 8 passengers diagnosed interstate (as of 8 pm yesterday).</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-22T08:03:05.716Z\">at 8.03am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7717978f08e0999e6b7e97\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-22T07:49:13.922Z\">7.49am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Carlton and United Breweries, the company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/dec/07/cub-55-workers-have-won-all-demands-in-industrial-dispute-says-union\">whose mistreatment of 55 workers</a> prompted national outrage in 2016, says it is <strong>concerned about brewery jobs</strong> after the Victorian government announced its shutdown of non-essential industries. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/rwillingham/status/1241628263107051520\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Carlton and United Breweries are worried about brewery jobs and beer supplies. \u2066<a href=\"https://twitter.com/abcmelbourne?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@abcmelbourne</a>\u2069 <a href=\"https://t.co/69gJxiWQvb\">pic.twitter.com/69gJxiWQvb</a></p>\u2014 Richard Willingham (@rwillingham) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rwillingham/status/1241628263107051520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 22, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7710948f08a08573fbf303\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-22T07:30:28.308Z\">7.30am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">ACT says schools will be 'pupil free' from Tuesday</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Just back to the ACT momentarily, the government has also announced it <strong>will be shifting rapidly to online learning in schools</strong>.

The SA police commissioner will also declare a major emergency in that state \u2014 that replaces the public health emergency that was previously declared, and means that emergency provisions are authorised under the Emergency Management Act and not the Public Health Act. </p> \n  <p>Police are responsible for enforcing that act, so the emergency management response will now be coordinated by the police commissioner. This is similar to what Tasmania announced on Thursday.</p> \n  <p>Marshall said the measure was announced after<strong> a number of cases in SA in recent days were of people who had contracted the virus after returning from interstate, or contracted it from people visiting from interstate.</strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This has forced our decision to close our borders in South Australia. We make this decision in the interest of public health in South Australia. <strong>People that are coming into South Australia, whether they are visitors or whether they are South Australians returning, will be required to undertake 14 days of self isolation.</strong> This is no longer something which is optional. It is mandatory. It is the social responsibility of every single person in this state to make sure that they are abiding by these rules. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The laws will come into force on 4pm on Tuesday. Border control stations will be set up at the airport, at train stations, and on roads entering SA \u2014 repurposing heavy vehicle inspections stations and biosecurity stations that already exist on the border.</p> \n  <p>Marshall said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When people come into South Australia, from four o\u2019clock onTuesday afternoon, they will be required to understand precisely the orders that will be in place. <strong>They will be asked to sign a declaration that they will self isolate and they will be required to provide SA Police with information on where they will be undertaking their self isolation</strong>. There will be tests on this important declaration and this commitment individuals regarding this very, very important Public safety initiative. </p> \n   <p>There will be some arrangements put in place along borders because we know that in country South Australia, sometimes two towns on either side of the border have a high level of interaction ... People that do live in those communities will be allowed to move between those communities once they have been identified as somebody in on of those communities but, I stress, if there is any reason to believe that there is an outbreak on the immediate other side of the border, then that\u2019ll have to also be curtailed.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Marshall said there would be some \u201clogical exceptions\u201d to the quarantine requirements, particularly around freight.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-22T03:38:01.470Z\">at 3.38am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e76d8078f08a08573fbf24c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-22T03:17:00.864Z\">3.17am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">NSW premier says she will introduce a 'more comprehensive' lockdown of non-essential services</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here is the full statement from the NSW premier, <strong>Gladys Berejiklian</strong>, on a \u201cmore comprehensive lockdown of non-essential services\u201d in NSW.<br></p> \n  <p>The statement reads:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p><em>Tonight I will be informing the National Cabinet that NSW will proceed to a <strong>more comprehensive shutdown of non-essential services.

We\u2019ve obviously heard some pretty dramatic new restrictions announced by the prime minister this evening, after what has been a confusing day of back and forth on school closures and non-essential service shutdowns between NSW, Victoria, and the federal government. More detail is expected to emerge from tomorrow and we\u2019ll continue to keep you up-to-date, both through our live blog and our dedicated Covid-19 reporting. Stay safe, readers. Please, please do comply with the advice on hand hygiene and social distancing. If you don\u2019t care about your own health, at least do it for others. Do you really want to be responsible for giving someone a potentially fatal illness? Just a quick recap on that significant press conference from the PM. He told us: From midday tomorrow, registered and licensed clubs, licensed premises in hotels and pubs, entertainment venues and cinemas, casinos and nightclubs will all close Restaurants and cafes will be restricted to takeaway only. Indoor sporting venues and places of worship will close. Enclosed spaces for funerals and \u201cthings of that nature\u201d will have to follow the strict four square metre rule which will be enforced. on schools, Morrison said the clear medical advice is that schools should remain open. He said he does not want children to miss a school year. Victoria and NSW would re-open schools after the imminent school holiday period, he said, so long as the medical advice allowed it. Schools would move toward online learning but remain open for students who needed it, he said. Morrison said this was only stage one of the social distancing measures. If Australians fail to adhere to the rules, more draconian measures will be introduced. Stage two has not yet been defined or discussed. Shopping centres are not being closed, he said, and there is no reason to hoard. Bottle shops are also remaining open. Home deliveries and takeaway food businesses will also continue to operate. Brendan Murphy is asked about children\u2019s ability to spread the virus. He says authorities cannot rule it out, but that there is no evidence that major spreading has occurred due to children. There is no data internationally anywhere in the world that shows that major spreading of this virus has occurred with children. We are not ruling it out. It is possible. But we think the risks and benefits are on the other side. I agree with you and we have been asked again by the national cabinet to consider next week which members of the workforce, both schools, healthcare, aged care, who are vulnerable because of their age and co-morbidities should not be required to go to work. That is a very important issue and we need to protect the workforce in every scenario. Morrison confirms hairdressers and beautician businesses will remain open. The only ones that can\u2019t remain open and provide those services are the ones I\u2019ve listed to you. Only those ones. That list again is: Registered and licensed clubs Licensed premises in hotels and pubs. Entertainment venues and cinemas, casinos and nightclubs. Restaurants and cafes will be restrict to takeaway only. Indoor sporting venues. Places of worship. Enclosed spaces for funerals and \u201cthings of that nature\u201d will have to follow the strict four square metre rule which will be enforced. Chief medical officer Brendan Murphy said the unanimous view of all state and territory chief medical officers was that schools should stay open. Murphy says there have been hardly any cases in children. We reaffirmed our position that the risk to children of coronavirus is extremely low. We\u2019ve had hardly any cases in children in primary school children and the international experience is that it is a very, very low risk of symptomatic infection. We don\u2019t know whether children may be transmitters. There isn\u2019t good evidence and there hasn\u2019t been evidence of published cases where there\u2019s been significant transmission in a school. There are some people who believe that closing schools may contribute to social distancing. Our view, the consensus view of all of the chief health officers we signed up to today was at this time schools should stay open. We are talking about measures for the long term for several months and that\u2019s why we made that decision. Morrison says Victoria and NSW had committed to reviewing the medical advice at the end of the imminent school holiday period and re-open them, should the health advice allow it. Morrison says there is no reason for people to hoard. People are not being confined to their homes. Shops will still be open. We are not putting in place lockdowns that put people and confine them to their home. That is not a measure that has been contemplated at this point. So there is no reason for anyone to do that. There is also no reason for anyone to rush to one of those venues tomorrow before midday. Shopping centres are not closing, he says. Shopping centres are not closed. I have not said that tonight. I\u2019ll go through the list again. Closure of pubs, registered and licences clubs, excluding bottle shops to these venues, the off-licence component, hotels in their licensed venues but excluding the accommodation, gyms and indoor sporting venues, cinemas, entertainment venues, casinos, night clubs, restaurant and cafes, which will be restricted to takeaway and/or home delivery as any other venue can. Religious gatherings, churches and places of worship, and for funerals or things of that nature in enclosed spaces it must be within the 4 square metre rule to apply to those venues. Morrison flags more strident measures if Australians do not follow the guidance on social distancing, including in shopping centres. As we\u2019ve just made very clear, that when that doesn\u2019t occur, then more dramatic measures have to be introduced. I would simply ask Australians to be calm and exercise some sensible judgement. Chief medical officer Brendan Murphy says our lives must change dramatically if Australia is going to get through the pandemic. Every Australian must play their role. Young people must remember that their actions could kill elder, more vulnerable Australians. If Australia is going to get through the challenge of this pandemic over the coming months, we have to live differently. We\u2019ve been making that point very clear over the last week. But it\u2019s also clear that some people haven\u2019t got it. I\u2019m particularly talking to young people who may think they\u2019re immune to the effects of this virus. It\u2019s true, most young people don\u2019t get significant disease. But as a young person you don\u2019t want to be responsible for the severe and possibly fatal disease of an elder, vulnerable Australian. We have to stop the rapid spread of this virus. There has been very significant increase in cases over the last few days. Still a lot of imported cases, but definitely some community transmission. The PM has said people have not been getting the messages and we have had to take, we\u2019ve recommended unanimously that these fairly dramatic and drastic recommendations be put in place because we have to stop those situations where viruses pass readily. Morrison says the medical advice on schools has not changed. He says children should go to school on Monday. He does not want to see children lose a year of their schooling. Arrangements for distance learning are being made, but these will take time, he says. But he says parents will also be allowed to keep their children at home, if they so choose. What we will be doing though is allowing parents in, to the end of this year\u2019s school term, to be able to keep their children at home where they choose to. But for all of those parents who wish to send their children to school, for an education at the school, those schools will remain open. In addition, schools will seek to provide learning at home in a distance learning framework but you cannot be assured that that will come in place immediately. Victoria\u2019s school term was due to end soon, anyway, he said, and they\u2019ve simply brought it forward. The premiers and chief ministers all have the same view that schools should reopen on the other side of the term break, subject to the health advice at that time. Parents who have choose - make the decision for the children to remain at home must take responsibility for those children. Those children are staying at home, it is not an excuse for them to go down to the shopping centre or to go and congregate somewhere else or potentially put themselves in contact with the vulnerable and elderly population. If you choose to keep your child at home, you are responsible for the conduct and behaviour of your children. He announces tough new measures on social distancing, which will see some businesses close from midday tomorrow. The restrictions are significant. This is only stage one of the social distancing regime, he says. From tomorrow, at midday, the following businesses will be closed or restricted in their trade. Registered and licensed clubs Licensed premesis in hotels and pubs. Entertainment venues and cinemas, casinos and nightclubs. Restaurants and cafes will be restrict to takeaway only. Indoor sporting venues. Places of worship. Enclosed spaces for funerals and things of that nature will have to follow the strict four square metre rule which will be enforced. Importantly, bottle shops will be exempt. They will not be restricted because they are not a place of gathering. Home deliveries and takeaway food businesses will continue. Scott Morrison is speaking now with the chief medical officer Brendan Murphy. He moves to reassure Australians about the national cabinet process. He says he will be announcing new measures on social distancing. He also makes a point of saying the advice on schools has not changed, despite plans in NSW, ACT, and Victoria to close schools to students. On social distancing, he says people have been disregarding the advice. This has warranted new measures. On the weekend, what we saw was a disregard of those social distancing practices. As people turned up to the beach in large numbers, crammed venues in our major cities. As I flagged this morning, this sent a very clear message to premiers, chief ministers and myself that the social distancing practices are not being observed as well as they should be. Social distancing in parliament\u2019s blue room, where the prime minister will speak shortly. We\u2019ve just got word that the prime minister will hold a press conference at 9pm. Sit tight. Morrison says Australians appear to have acted more sensibly in terms of hoarding and socialising today, as opposed to yesterday. I actually think the experience is different today. Supermarkets were more orderly and the scenes at Bondi were not repeated, he says. What we saw at Bondi beach was not OK. It was not even remotely OK. That sent a message [to governments]... that not enough Australians are taking this seriously. On the economy, Morrison says: The economy is going to be significantly battered by this in a way that I\u2019ve not seen in my lifetime. On potential death toll and infection numbers, he says nobody knows. He can\u2019t be sure. No one can be. What I can\u2019t do is forecast an unforecastable situation. Scott Morrison has done a series of pre-recorded interviews before heading into national cabinet. He\u2019s also spoken to 60 Minutes. He says: We\u2019re dealing with one of the most serious situations this country has seen, certainly since the second world war. Morrison says it\u2019s up to states to decide what measures to take in their own jurisdictions. He\u2019s asked why NSW and Victoria is taking steps like closing schools and shutdowns, which the federal government has said is unnecessary. I think we need to understand that this issue is moving extremely fast. Is there conflicting advice, Morrison is asked? No I have not seen conflicting advice coming forward to the national cabinet. I have not. Should the federal government take over sole responsibility for the response? I have no doubt that on some occasions on some issues, the states will go by themselves. He goes on: We need to recognise that states are responsible for what happens in their states. The federal government has just announced it will suspend the community development programme. That program is a work-for-the-dole scheme in remote areas, which is chiefly designed for Indigenous Australians. The scheme is widely criticised for its unfairness and unworkability. Ken Wyatt, the Indigenous Australians minister, said the work-for-the-dole activities will be suspended due to health concerns. ACTU head Michele O\u2019Neill said she would have preferred to see the federal government introduce a flat wage subsidy. That approach was taken in the UK. O\u2019Neill tells the ABC that the measures announced today overwhelmingly give money to business. 70% of the measures announced today go to business, and there is no guarantee, no absolute guarantee by those businesses that are going to get that money, that they\u2019re going to keep people in jobs. Of course, they\u2019ll get more money for the highest paid. The lowest paid you are, and if you\u2019re in the tax-free threshold, the Government will give nothing to the employer to keep you in a job. She\u2019s also critical of measures allowing early access to superannuation. Again, it\u2019s a measure that is designed for the very lowest paid to be able to drain what is going to be their retirement income. And the problem with that, for example, is that if you fall below $10,000 and many, many of the lowest paid workers mainly women and workers in vulnerable positions, if they do that, they then in the middle of a health crisis, are also losing their death and disability insurance, and that is a serious consequence here. Cassandra Goldie, the head of the Australian Council of Social Service, said it\u2019s a huge relief that the Jobseeker payment has been doubled. But Goldie, speaking to the ABC, warned there were groups who would miss out. She names carers and people with disabilities who are on the higher pension would not benefit. She also said it\u2019s her understanding that international students would be excluded, despite the prime minister saying they would be included if they were on youth allowance. Goldie: So there\u2019s a huge relief that we\u2019re seeing this doubling of the payment. And, of course, we\u2019ll continue to urge the Government to make sure that this is a longer term direction that we\u2019re seeing in terms of a substantial increase to Newstart. Look, we\u2019re really worried about... There are some significant groups that are not included in this particular announcement today, particularly flagging for carers and people with disabilities who are on the higher pension. But many are in contact with us saying, \u201cWe\u2019re really worried and very vulnerable\u201d. And the point, you asked about students - that\u2019s not our understanding that full time students will be included in this, nor international students. So we\u2019re going to urgently follow up on that. And asylum seekers as well. Just a quick recap on that interview with prime minister Scott Morrison, who appeared defensive and combative at times. Morrison said it is now \u201cacademic\u2019 whether Australia has a recession. He says he\u2019s just trying to save as many lives as possible. He said he was not annoyed by the decision of NSW and Victoria to announce state lockdowns ahead of tonight\u2019s national cabinet. Morrison could not give any real insight into what is meant by \u201cnon-essential services\u201d, which will be shutdown under plans in NSW, Victoria, and ACT. He said questions were on that point were ultimately for the state and territory governments. Morrison was pressed on the lack of coordination and cohesiveness in the response of state, federal, and territory governments. He says jurisdictions will respond according to their own situation. National cabinet, he says, was never meant to force total conformity in the responses of jurisdictions. Morrison said the onus is now on all Australians to ensure the health system is not overwhelmed. We\u2019re all fighting a war, he says. Morrison is asked whether a recession is inevitable. Those sorts of things are now becoming academic. He\u2019s asked if that means that \u201cit\u2019s going to happen\u201d. Well, that will be what it will be. What I\u2019m trying to do is save as many livelihoods and save as many lives as I possibly can. That is my daily mission. Morrison says the doubling of the Jobseeker payment, for those who lose their job in the current crisis, will begin almost immediately. There\u2019s the immediate payment that will come for them being on JobSeeker payment. There is the $750 payment which all of those on JobSeeker payment would receive that was from the package we announced a week ago. And then from then, the additional payments of $550 kick in every fortnight. That applies to sole traders whose business is down. They\u2019ll be able to do that while trying to keep their businesses alive. For those who are in casual employment, and their hours reduced, that\u2019s there for them, too. So what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve broadened the safety net and we\u2019ve made it stronger, because we know those who are going to be in that situation are in the front-line of the impacts of what is occurring, and it\u2019s already happening now and it is going to happen more in the future. And sorry to labour the point, but the more dramatic the measures we have to take to stop the spread of the virus, the more jobs will be lost. He says those on the youth allowance (other) payment and those on temporary visas would be able to access the new benefits. He says the onus is on all Australians to join the fight against Covid-19. He says whether the health system is overwhelmed \u201cdepends on all Australians\u201d. If Australians chose not to self isolate, if Australians choose to not observe the medical advice of keeping the distance that we\u2019ve recommended, and then, we\u2019d obviously be forced to take very draconian measures in shutting down, then if Australians don\u2019t play their part, they can\u2019t then believe that the system won\u2019t come under greater stress. And this is why we\u2019re trying to be so clear about this. Everybody, every Australian is enlisted against the fight against this virus. And if Australians don\u2019t do the right thing, then they are putting other lives at risk. Morrison says the army could be used to help with food deliveries, if necessary. Absolutely, of course it will. I\u2019ve already had the Defence Forces being deployed into the states to assist with medical check-ups and chase-ups, contact tracing. Because some states, particularly New South Wales, have become overwhelmed. Now, it\u2019s important that we provide that support and we\u2019re there to help, and the Defence Forces are turning up, now, just like they were during the bushfires. But it\u2019s a very different need. Morrison says Australia is putting in place plans to ensure there are no food or medicine shortages. He says Australia \u201cis better prepared on those issues than most countries in the world\u201d. And as I\u2019ve said, there is no need, as the medical experts have said - there is no need to rush out and do the things that we were seeing some weeks ago. But equally, I need to address this - the suggestion that you can just lock the country down, or a state, for two weeks or four weeks, and the virus passes, is naive, and it\u2019s false. That at the end of that two or four weeks and you ease restrictions, the virus just starts again. If you put arrangements in place that shut down large parts of the country and the economy, then you better be prepared to hold on to those arrangements for at least the next six months. Morrison is asked whether he thinks states and territories are frustrated on the issue of school closures, and announced their own measures prior to national cabinet because they didn\u2019t believe they\u2019d get the outcome they wanted. It was the states themselves who were the most adamant about a collective and agreed position on schools. They were the ones insisting on that consistent position between them all. Now, if they want to make different decisions, again, they are entitled to do so. But what they are doing is letting the other states know what they are doing - whether it is the decision made by the Premier, which was a sound decision, which dealt with the greater vulnerabilities of a greater population in Tasmania regarding travel. The same, absolutely, with Chief Minister Gunner, who I\u2019ve been working particularly closely with on the dangers for remote communities. Every state has different challenges. Their geography is different, the population is different, the rate of spread of the virus is different. Their exposure to international flights at the outset of the virus - completely different. So to think that there is a cookie cutter one size fits all approach to every single state and territory is naive. Morrison is asked about school closures. Just on the health advice, Dan Andrews in Victoria says his state chief health officer has advised they should shut down schools early from Tuesday. That\u2019s not your advice, is it? Morrison responds: The universal positions of all states and territories, including Premier Andrews, as recently as late last week, was that all schools should remain open. Victoria, of course, today announced it would close its schools. Morrison is asked if he is annoyed that Victoria made that announcement before national cabinet. No, I\u2019m not. Because it\u2019s not for any leader to be getting annoyed about anything. It\u2019s about leaders being focused on the job they have ahead of them and respecting the job of other leaders. The Premier of Victoria has a responsibility to the people in his state, as does Premier Gladys Berejiklian have responsibility to the people in her state. And they need to make decisions that they believe are in the best interests of their state, and I trust them to do that, and where we can do that on a more consistent basis, then, of course, that is helpful. So at the end of the day, I respect their sovereignty in their own states. They will make their decisions and they will explain their decisions and they will implement them to the best of their ability. Morrison is pressed on what is meant by non-essential services. Does it mean workplaces? How do people know whether they should be showing up to work this week? Morrison gives some idea of what it means, but says the question is ultimately one for the states and territories. I understand that workplaces have been defined as essential and non-essential, and the legislation that the Victorian Government put together on essential and non-essential, excluded workplaces. But many workplaces, including public sector workplaces, are engaging to rationing how many people are coming into an enclosed space on each day, and that helps, actually, reduce the pressure on public transport systems, and reduce the proximity on which people are travelling together. Scott Morrison is asked about the NSW and Victoria shutdowns of non-essential services. He says the decisions were a matter for the states, and notes the purpose of the national cabinet is not to have all states and territories making exactly the same decisions. The point of the National Cabinet is not to have the same decision in all the states, but to ensure that as a group, we\u2019re understanding the expert medical advice that\u2019s provided and the states are providing the decisions best suited to their situation. He\u2019s asked why the states didn\u2019t wait until tonight\u2019s meeting to announce the shutdowns. Tonight they will get further advice from the expert medical panel and they are taking advice from the medical experts in their own states, and that expert panel was held this afternoon, and I convened the meeting first thing this morning that we should meet tonight to consider their additional advice. But at the end of the day, David, the Premiers and the Chief Ministers will make their own decisions about what happens on those issues in their states. The Prime Minister does not make those decisions, they do. When they do, they will need to set out how that\u2019s going to work. He said the limits on non-essential travel, which he announced today, had been discussed and agreed to through national cabinet last night. We\u2019re about to hear from the prime minister Scott Morrison on ABC. He\u2019s due to speak at 7.40pm, though it\u2019s a pre-recorded interview, so it took place before the national cabinet. Reports of some long, long lines at bottle shops prior to the lockdowns in NSW and Victoria. Our political editor, Katharine Murphy, has described today as \u201cone of the early tipping points in the story of this pandemic\u201d. Sunday will forever be remembered in the history of this pandemic, she writes. Australia went over a cliff on Sunday. What I mean by this is when we look in the future to write the definitive history of this period, this Sunday will be seen as one of the early tipping points in the story of this pandemic. The main thing that happened was a significant spike in the number of coronavirus infections. Australia has now sprinted past 1,000 cases, with the number doubling over each of the past three days, and it is likely this acceleration is only the beginning. The relentless creep of this pandemic is what is driving the rapid fire reactions of all the governments. You can read the full analysis here. The ABC has been assured it will not be affected by the non-essential service shutdown. The prime minister Scott Morrison has just spoken to channel seven. He says the Covid-19 pandemic will be \u201cthe toughest economic situation we\u2019ve likely seen since the Great Depression\u201d. National cabinet will meet tonight and is expected to examine stronger social distancing measures, school closures and non-essential service shutdowns. NSW Health has issued a statement on the shocking decision to allow cruise ships, including the Ruby Princess, to dock in Sydney. More than 2,700 people were allowed to disembark from the Ruby Princess at Sydney\u2019s Circular Quay, despite more than 150 cases of illness being logged onboard. The Ruby Princess now accounts for 26 confirmed cases of Covid-19. The statement appears to, at times, shift the blame to the federal government. NSW Health says it was simply following, or exceeding, the requirements of the \u201cnational protocol\u201d used to manage cruise ships. Here it is in full: NSW assessments on cruise ships entering our ports has exceeded Federal Government protocols and was doing so, well in advance of the National Protocol*, that was issued on March 6 2020. Notwithstanding that, the Federal Government has not increased any protocol procedures relating to cruise ships since March 6. Today, the NSW Government further enhanced its procedures to minimise the risk of passengers with any respiratory conditions whatsoever from departing cruise ships until COVID-19 tests can be carried out on onshore laboratories. Since February 14, NSW Health has applied assessment procedures to all 63 ships entering Sydney Harbour. The National Protocol does not direct jurisdictions to do such assessments but instead, leave it to the State\u2019s discretion. Contrary to some public statements made, every cruise liner that has entered NSW ports has been the subject of an assessment well beyond Federal requirements. The National Protocol states \u201cprovided there are no concerns about the COVID-19 risk profile of a ship or suspected COVID-19 cases reported, the human bio-security officer may advise the bio-security officer that pratique can be granted and the ship may be allowed to continue the voyage while samples are being tested\u201d. NSW Health undertook a full assessment of the Ruby Princess, notwithstanding under the National Protocol in place, it could have chosen not to do an assessment. NSW Health again followed the National Protocol that states \u201cthe ship may be allowed to continue the voyage while samples are being tested\u201d. However, as of midnight March 22, NSW Health will go even further beyond the National Protocol and its current own State protocols and will hold all cruise ships in port until any patients highlighted as having respiratory issues are tested for COVID-19. The increased testing regime follows 26 confirmed cases of COVID-19 from the Ruby Princess, including 17 passengers and 1 crew member diagnosed in NSW, and 8 passengers diagnosed interstate (as of 8 pm yesterday). Carlton and United Breweries, the company whose mistreatment of 55 workers prompted national outrage in 2016, says it is concerned about brewery jobs after the Victorian government announced its shutdown of non-essential industries. Just back to the ACT momentarily, the government has also announced it will be shifting rapidly to online learning in schools. The government has reported that a student of Lyneham High School is a newly-confirmed Covid-19 case. Education minister Yvette Berry said all schools in the ACT will now go \u201cpupil free\u201d from Tuesday. What that means is no student will be coming to school. Schools will still be operational in that teachers and school staff will be at school on Tuesday March 24 until the school holidays begin. What teachers and school staff will be doing is preparing to move to a different kind of learning. Schools will instead shift to new forms of learning, primarily online. Berry and the ACT Chief Health Officer Dr Kerryn Coleman just held a briefing, with much more detail. You can watch it here: The Football Federation Australia (FFA) has just issued a statement on the future of the A-League. It says it will allow the \u201cleagues to continue with additional measures in place\u201d. But it also says it is closely watching tonight\u2019s national cabinet meeting and will make further announcements tomorrow. FFA CEO James Johnson said: The health and wellbeing of the players continues to remain our top priority and we will not be afraid to make decisions to ensure this, no matter how hard they might be. We were very comfortable to take the initial decision to allow the Leagues to continue with additional measures in place and have worked through a number of scenarios to facilitate the completion of the A-League season. However, we remain under no illusions as to how fluid this situation is so we will remain agile and responsive to the challenges this pandemic brings. We are continuously assessing our position based on the latest directives and advice from the Government and Chief Medical Officer, and in consultation with our National COVID-19 Working Committee. We are taking every precaution in line with Government advice and working closely with the League and clubs which have implemented additional measures to ensure players remain healthy and in good physical and mental condition. Our priority is to ensure that this remains the case to give the clubs and players the best chance of achieving their sporting aspirations.\u201d This announcement follows the FFA\u2019s decision last week to suspend all grassroots football until 14 April 2020. The National Farmers Federation is urging state and federal governments to classify the agriculture and the food supply chain as an essential service, thereby keeping it open in broader lockdowns. Fiona Simson, the NFF president, said the farmers federation had been in discussion with government as recently as this afternoon. The NFF has been assured that agriculture and the food supply chain will not be interrupted, despite the closure of travel between some states. This is in line with the prime minister\u2019s commitment to prioritising lives and livelihoods. The continued provision of quality fresh produce is paramount to safeguarding the wellbeing and health of the nation. A quick whip around the rest of the world: The Russian military will send medical help to Italy from today, including mobile disinfection vehicles and medical specialists. UK military planners have been drafted in to help feed vulnerable people. China is diverting all Beijing-bound international flights to other airports for checks before allowing them to continue. Singapore has banned the entry and transit of all foreigners, except those with work permits in essential services. Hawaii became the first US state to require 14 days quarantine for all arrivals. India has announced a curfew from 7am to 9pm Delhi time. The Italian PM ordered businesses to close all operations. More than 50,000 people queued to see the Olympic flame in northeast Japan. Meanwhile Olympic officials are reportedly workshopping delaying the games despite the Japanese government\u2019s insistence it go ahead. Thailand has reported 188 new cases on Saturday. Italy has reported 793 new cases South Korea has 98 new cases Mexico has 48 new cases Philippines has 73 new cases Mainland China reported 46 new cases, including the first domestic case in four days Argentina had 67 new cases, with the security minister not ruling out declaring a state of siege. The Caribbean region has surpassed 400 cases. Colombia recorded its first death. Guam reported the first death in the Pacific region. Bolivia has postponed its presidential elections. Former Real Madrid president Lorenzo Sanz died of Covid-19. Palestinian health officials have reported the first two cases in the Gaza Strip. The NRL\u2019s approach is seemingly unchanged by the AFL\u2019s announcement today. The NRL has just tweeted it will push on with games until told otherwise. NRL.com has just reported that: The NRL has reaffirmed its commitment on Sunday to continue playing the Telstra Premiership season for the time being. ARL chairman Peter V\u2019landys said it was the Commission\u2019s intention to proceed with the competition until there is advice from government to shut down matches. Here\u2019s the full statement from ACT chief minister Andrew Barr on the shutdown of non-essential services. The territory is still working to define what is essential, and what is non-essential. It will have an answer within 48 hours. But the ACT will model its approach on NSW\u2019s, so we\u2019re likely to see the shutdown of cafes, restaurants, and bars, among other things. Following similar announcements from the Premier of Victoria and the Premier of New South Wales, I will also be informing National Cabinet that the ACT will proceed to a more comprehensive shutdown of non-essential services over the next 48 hours. I expect all states and territories will do the same. I believe this decision is in the best interest of Canberrans, and will help slow the spread of COVID-19 in our community. Despite measures in place to discourage social interaction, there are still too many instances where people are exposing themselves to contracting the virus which is leading to an unsustainable increase in confirmed cases across the country. We must also face the reality that, as a Territory within NSW, it would be impossible for the ACT to have different arrangements than those in our surrounding region. We will ensure that Canberrans continue to have access to the services they need \u2013 supermarkets, petrol stations, banks, pharmacies, post offices and convenience stores. Freight and logistics will also be considered as an essential service. Over the next 48 hours, we will define these essential services and work closely with retailers on their requirements. As the ACT has maintained, we will be following the recommendations from National Cabinet on the operation of schools. We will be transitioning to an alternate distance education program for most students on Tuesday as well as continuing to provide a face to face education program for those students who need it. I will be updating the community following National Cabinet this evening on next steps for the ACT. Barr says the lockdown is needed to slow the spread of Covid-19. This is an unprecedented situation; we must all act together now to ensure we stop and slow the spread of this virus. We cannot stress the seriousness of this situation enough for our city, for our country. The ACT had 19 confirmed cases at midday. Barr says the shutdown will be discussed at national cabinet this evening. He says he expects all states and territories to take a similar stance. The ACT has become the latest jurisdiction to shut down non-essential services. The shutdown will take place within 48 hours. Andrew Barr, the chief minister, says the current measures to limit social contact have not prevented all Canberrans from \u201cexposing themselves to contracting the virus\u201d. \u201cWe must also face the reality that, as a Territory within NSW, it would be impossible for the ACT to have different arrangements than those in our surrounding region,\u201d Barr said. Barr says that supermarkets, petrol stations, banks, pharmacies, post offices, and convenience stores will stay open. Freight and logistics are also considered an essential service. \u201cOver the next 48 hours, we will define these essential services and work closely with retailers on their requirements.\u201d The social distancing messaging really does not seem to be getting through to people. This vision shows a closed Sydney beach. It\u2019s still crowded. In saying that, here\u2019s what Bondi looked like today, following its closure. A far better picture than yesterday, when it was packed. The shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has just issued a statement about the federal government\u2019s second stimulus package, announced this morning. Chalmers says the opposition is supportive of the stimulus, but has a range of concerns. He warns \u201cthis is no time for half measures or delay\u201d. While there are some welcome measures in this package, Labor is concerned this response lacks urgency, leaves gaps in support and does not go far enough to protect jobs. No measure announced today guarantees that support will be used to keep workers on, and many struggling households could miss out on support. Every Australian needs the government to get this right, which means getting the original stimulus and today\u2019s additional measures out the door as soon as possible, and urgently closing the gaps identified by Labor and others. Labor is concerned that there is no guarantee that businesses who get money will use it to keep workers on. They fear the new coronavirus supplement will not be available to many families, \u201cparticularly given there has been no change to the income test\u201d. Labor fears that payments to households, including pensioners, is coming too late and that cash flow assistance to businesses will not help otherwise viable businesses that are at risk of collapse. Chalmers says there is a lack of substantial support for sole traders and the self-employed to help them stay in business and raises concern about the early release of superannuation, which he says should only be done as a last resort. There are some groups that have missed out on the big boost to fortnightly income support payments announced by the Morrison government today. That includes age pensioners, disability support pensioners, and students receiving Youth Allowance, Austudy and Abstudy. The payment rates for students recipients varies significantly and are based on age, and other circumstances, but most people get about $452.50 per fortnight. The National Union of Students says these recipients should also get the $550 coronavirus supplement in a statement: Thousands of young people who are studying generally receive Youth Allowance (student/apprentice or Other), Newstart or Austudy/Abstudy to supplement their income, and for some, survive while studying. What this exemption means is that students now have an incentive to drop to part time study to receive the higher JobSeeker payment, jeopardising both their education and defunding higher education. By not extending this package to the payments we rely on, full time students who have lost their jobs and are now eligible for income support will be punished for being studying full time. This needs to be addressed immediately. The focus will now turn to other sports, chiefly the NRL and A-League. Danny Weidler, a reporter with channel nine, reports that the NRL still wants to play next week. We\u2019ve still heard little from the A-League. Let\u2019s recap on what we just heard from Gillon McLachlan, the AFL\u2019s chief executive. A sombre McLachlan announced the 2020 season had been suspended. No games will be played until at least May 31. The AFL will consider medical advice at May 31, and make a decision on whether it can resume matches. McLachlan said the AFL still wants to complete all matches at some point. But the organisation is still working out how that can work. McLachlan described the decision as unprecedented and unimaginable and said it represents the most serious threat to the game in its history. The AFL and clubs are now facing serious financial difficulties. McLachlan says there is work to be done to ensure clubs have liquidity and that the organisation is seeking credit to meet the shortfall it now faces. AFLW\u2019s season will be cancelled. No premiership will be awarded. McLachlan says the situation has changed dramatically in the past week. Clubs are shocked. It\u2019s become very real in the last couple of hours and it\u2019s going to be a very real couple of days as we have honest conversations with staff. He says the organisation is working collectively to \u201csecure liquidity\u201d . He says it was too difficult to name a premier in the AFLW competition, because the conference structure made it too complex. He says: We\u2019ll do what we need to do to survive as an industry. McLachlan is clearly shocked. He looks gutted and describes the situation as unimaginable and unprecedented. We hoped this day would be a little further down the track, but as soon as the measures hardened it\u2019s time for our game to suspend for 60 days. He says he\u2019s working with clubs to develop medical protocols and secure credit to help cover the shortfalls the sport will face. McLachlan says the AFL still plans to play its remaining games, somehow. Everyone involved in our game will be impacted by the decision and many people will suffer significant hardship. But we all have a responsibility to the community and each other. We\u2019ve been given advice by the government and the CMO that we could start the season but that the season would be paused at some stage. It was right to start the season and now it\u2019s right to stop. The plan is to play the remaining games this year. McLachlan is not mincing his words. He says the threat to the sport is grave. \u201cOur key focus, like every organisation in the country, is to do everything to slow the spread of the virus. \u201cTo say this is the most serious threat to our sport in its history is an understatement.\u201d McLachlan is speaking now. He says: \u201cGames will be suspended until May 31. The situation will be reviewed at the end of April.\u201d He confirms there will be no premiership awarded in AFLW. \u201cNo premiership will be awarded in the AFLW, as per the recommendation by the executive.\u201d Training is also to be stopped, and McLachlan says the May 31 date could be pushed back, depending on medical advice. \u201cAll training will be suspended.\u201d McLachlan says the situation is unprecedented. \u201cThe AFL industry is facing its biggest financial crisis in its history.\u201d Still waiting for Gillon McLachlan to speak to the press but the AFL website is carrying the statement that season 2020 is postponed and the AFLW season cancelled at the preliminary final stage. There has been no confirmation from either the NRL or A-League about their plans with both competitions currently progressing behind closed doors. Just back on sports, for a moment. Jonathan Howcroft, our reporter, tells me that both the A-League and NRL are still considering their options for the season. We also know that Super Rugby, which had already suspended its season, is attempting to restart it through a domestic competition that would stop any international travel. The AFL reportedly had a phone hook-up with club officials today, in which they were told that no games would be played before June. That timeframe could be \u201csignificantly pushed back\u201d, according to AFL.com.au. \u201cThere remains, though, a commitment to somehow play the remaining 144 matches of the 2020 season, which was last week reduced to a 17-game-per-team fixture.\u201d Chris Bowen also warns that the lack of coordination and mixed messaging between states and the federal government is creating confusion. That comes after NSW and Victoria announced their own tough shutdown measures today. While we understand states have made different approaches, we call on as much of a coordinated approach as is humanly possible, obviously led by this building, to ensure the rules are consistent. We\u2019re seeing confusion out there and people not understanding how the social distancing rules should work and whether they can go to the beach or not. With things moving so fast we do understand there will be some confusion. The more consistent the message, the more consistent the rules and approach, the more success we\u2019ll have. We cannot continue to see this virus double every three days or we will see more and more pressure on the health system. We just have to be honest about that. Anthony Albanese, the opposition leader, and Chris Bowen, shadow health minister, are speaking in Canberra. Labor has met with the prime minister today. Albanese says Labor will take a constructive approach to the government\u2019s stimulus. Labor will make constructive suggestions, but will not \u201cstand in the way of economic stimulus\u201d. Albanese: It may well be that we have a range of amendments and improvements, some of which we raised in the room, to suggest to the government of improvements in the way that the economic stimulus that was announced today and the one announced two weeks ago can operate. But we will be constructive and at the end of the day, if our suggestions aren\u2019t taken up by the parliament, we will not stand in the way of economic stimulus because this is an absolutely critical time for the nation. But Albanese has also warned that Australia is not doing enough, is changing its messaging too often, and is lacking a coordinated response. Our first priority is the health of Australians and making sure that we limit the health impact of the coronavirus. Hence we are concerned and raised our concern and will continue to do so of the fact that we\u2019ve seen a doubling in the rate of infections, reported every three days. That is not a path that we should be on. That is of real concern. And it shows that some of the measures simply aren\u2019t working. A bit more detail from our reporter Jonathan Howcroft, who tells me that the 2020 NAB AFL Women\u2019s season has been cancelled, with no premiership to be awarded. The AFL\u2019s website reports that clubs were told on Sunday afternoon of the postponement. The scheduled Hawthorn-Brisbane and West Coast-Melbourne games will be completed. That will finish round one. And just on that AFL announcement: we\u2019ve just heard that the 2020 season has been postponed. Clubs have just received the news from AFL. The suspension is expected to last until at least 31 May. It includes AFLW. We\u2019ll have more details as they come to hand, but here\u2019s our initial news report: Hi everyone. It\u2019s Christopher Knaus here taking over our live coverage of the Covid-19 crisis into the evening. We\u2019re expecting a series of major developments. Most imminent is an announcement from the AFL, which is scheduled for 4.30pm. Stay tuned. Here\u2019s a handy visualisation of social distancing, if you\u2019re trying to explain the concept to friends. With that I\u2019ll hand over to my colleague, Christopher Knaus. To summarise what we just heard then from WA: The WA border will close at 1.30pm Tuesday. NT and SA are also closing their borders from Tuesday. Anyone entering after that point will need to self-isolate for 14 days, and the police commissioner Chis Dawson indicated that self-isolation would occur at the point of arrival. So, if you attempt drive from Melbourne to Perth after Tuesday, you will have one 14-day period of self-isolation in Bordertown, SA, and another 14-day period of self-isolation at Eucla, WA. Exemptions will be made for freight, essential services, and 2,500 \u201ccritical\u201d staff in the mining and oil and gas industries, who are based interstate but will be allowed to fly in. The WA government is looking to acquire hotels in order to house people who have nowhere appropriate to undergo self-isolation, or who don\u2019t want to self-isolate. Rottnest Island, a former prison turned into a tourist destination, could be appropriated for this purpose. WA recorded 30 new cases, including a doctor from the Royal Perth hospital, bringing its total to 120 cases. Seven people diagnosed with Covid-19 in WA are in hospital, two in a critical condition. WA police commissioner Chris Dawson said the Aboriginal affairs minister, Ben Wyatt, had met with Aboriginal people in the Kimberley to ensure the border closure between WA and the NT was understood, and to ensure that people do not enter remote communities unnecessarily. Dawson: The Aboriginal communities of course want to be protected, and we have place engagement with them, and certainly if you do not have an entitlement to go into Aboriginal communities you will be denied access. But we want to do this in a culturally appropriate way to make sure we protect the most vulnerable. Premier Mark McGowan would not comment on whether he would close WA schools this week, saying it would be discussed at the national cabinet tonight. He also said he thinks that Western Australia is managing the arrival of cruise ships better than New South Wales. We have managed the cruise ships very, very well yesterday so quite different to what happened in NSW. Look, these are matters we will discuss later on this evening and these are extreme, extreme, extreme measures so we will discuss those this afternoon. They are extreme measures we are talking about but we want to do our best to protect all Western Australians so we will listen to the medical advice this evening. Any decisions we make are based on medical advice. The WA police commissioner, Chris Dawson, had a bit more info on those self-isolation rules. The requirement to self-isolate will not come into place until 1.30pm Tuesday. That\u2019s different to South Australia, which is requiring self-isolation of all new arrivals immediately, but not actually policing the border until 4pm Tuesday. Dawson said they were giving Western Australians 48 hours to return home. If you\u2019re travelling by road, you will need to be arriving over our border by 1:30pm on Tuesday, if you are not able to make it before then, and we want people to travel safely and calmly, then you either do not leave and stay where you are or if you are intending to come over, we will be putting in measures which may require you to stay for 14 days at that location. They will be only exceptions for essential travel Dawson said that cargo and essential services would be exempt from the quarantine requirement. Some travel associated with the mining sector will also be allowed, but that exemption only applies to critical staff on mine sites and oil and gas sites. That\u2019s about 2,500 people from interstate flying in to work on mine sites. Apart from those exceptions, people who arrive after 1.30pm on Tuesday will have to quarantine in place, Dawson said. If you cannot make it... you will have to make arrangements to stay there or when you do arrive, you may be required to stay at Kununurra or Euclid. (Those are the towns on the northern and southern roads into WA.) WA government looking at using Rottnest Island as a quarantine centre: WA premier Mark McGowan said the WA government was also looking at acquiring some hotels for self-isolation purposes, \u201cso that we can have places to quarantine people who have difficulty self isolating or who will not self isolate\u201d. He continued: In addition to that, we are now actively investigating using Rottnest for this purpose, taking Rottnest Island and turning it into a quarantine [location] for WA. The minister responsible for Rottnest is currently working on plans to ensure that we can put in place this measure as soon as we needed. These are extreme steps but these are extreme days and we need to all step up and play our part in one of the greatest crisis facing our state in its history. Western Australia is closing its borders to all travellers from 1.30pm on Tuesday. Anyone arriving after that date will have to self-isolate for 14 days \u2014 and it appears, from the way they are describing it, that the quarantine may occur at the point of entry. This brings the number of states and territories with domestic border controls to four. Premier Mark McGowan: Can I urge all people from around Australia who want to come to WA on holidays, please, cancel your holidays. Please, cancel your holidays, otherwise you\u2019re going to be required to self isolate in WA and there will be specific rules put in place for these people that the [police] commissioner will shortly outline. This is all about reducing the spread of coronavirus. WA premier Mark McGowan is speaking now, in Perth. He said that WA \u201cis now in a war\u201d. McGowan said WA has recorded 30 new cases overnight, bringing the total number of cases to 120. He said almost 9,500 tests have been undertaken so far. Seventeen of the new cases are related to overseas travel. Seven people confirmed to have Covid-19 are in hospital, and two are in a critical condition. One of the new cases is a doctor from Royal Perth hospital, who is directly linked to the previously confirmed case of a Royal Perth hospital clinician. The Australian Council of Social Service says a larger federal rescue package is needed. Acoss says that extending the small business cashflow support to community services and charities was welcomed, but that the sector needed more support. Acoss CEO Cassandra Goldie says: Cashflow payments will make a real difference to the capacity of the charities and not for profit sector to continue to support people at most risk in our community during this health crisis and economic downturn. We look forward to continuing to work with the federal government to ensure that a range of other measures are introduced as soon as possible to ensure that charities and not for profits can meet the inevitable increase to demand that will occur as a result of this economic downturn. It has recommended, among other things: extending all business related stimulus measures to the community sector and not-for-profit organisations; creating a fund to enable community services to guarantee continuity of service; provide program level funding to community services that rely on individual level funding; provide additional funding for the housing and homelessness sector; and guarantee access to personal protected equipment. Hospo Voice, the hospitality arm of the United Workers Union, has been tracking shifts lost in hospitality jobs due to the coronavirus. Since launching the tracking website yesterday, 1,200 workers have reported that they have lost shifts or lost their jobs. So far 900 jobs, and 4,800 shifts, have been lost, which is almost $1m in weekly wages. These shifts were lost before New South Wales and Victoria announced on Sunday that they would move to lockdown non-essential services. Caf\u00e9s, restaurants, and bars are were not listed by either government in their indicative lists of \u201cessential services,\u201d which did include supermarkets, petrol stations, pharmacies and freight services. The union is calling on the federal government to introduce a specific support package for hospitality workers. Here\u2019s national secretary Tim Kennedy: We are hearing horror stories daily from our members across all industries of the impacts of losing work. We know hospitality is already one of the most insecure industries, with wage theft and exploitation of workers widespread,\u201d Mr Kennedy said. Hospitality workers need urgent action now or we will find they are not able to pay their bills, put food on their tables or keep a roof over their heads. That is why we are calling on the Federal Government to step in immediately and make available a $2500 emergency payment plus a basic income payment while they are out of work of $740 per week (federal minimum wage) for at least the rest of 2020. In addition, we need ongoing support for struggling hospitality businesses that do the right thing, we need to address exploitation in the sector and we need a real plan to make the industry sustainable into the future. Importantly, any measures should also extend to migrant workers. The federal government stimulus package announced today includes an effective doubling of the jobseeker allowance for the next six months, and announced it would also waive the asset test and waiting periods to access the payment. So people left unemployed by this crisis will get about $1,115 per fortnight. Well. What a busy few hours. Just to recap: Victoria and New South Wales said they would move to a lockdown of non-essential services over the next 48 hours. Both said they would raise the issue in the national cabinet meeting this evening, but planned to go ahead even without national agreement. Essential services include petrol stations, supermarkets, banks, pharmacies, freight and logistics, home delivery services. That\u2019s presumably not an exhaustive list, but the items that both the Victorian and NSW premiers mentioned. Victoria is also pushing for a shutdown of schools. All Victorian schools will close from Tuesday \u2014 they were due to start term 1 school holidays on Friday. Premier Daniel Andrews said he would not yet say whether school would resume on 13 April, but would take advice from the chief health officer nearer to that date. NSW will make an announcement on schools on Monday. South Australia has closed its borders to non-essential travel, following the Northern Territory and Tasmania. From 4pm Tuesday, everyone entering SA will be made to undergo a mandatory 14 day quarantine. NSW has recorded 97 new cases in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 533. The Ruby Princess cruise ship has been linked to 18 confirmed cases. Victoria has recorded 67 new cases, bringing its total to 296. The number of cases in the ACT has almost doubled to 19, with 10 new cases recorded in 24 hours. The Australian government has announced the details of its $66bn \u201csafety net\u201d package, the full details of which you can read here. The Australian government has recommended against all non-essential domestic travel, adding to existing recommendations against non-essential international travel. But Australia\u2019s professional football codes have not cancelled their seasons. Victorian premier Daniel Andrews just released this statement, echoing an earlier statement from the NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian. It goes further in announcing a school shutdown from Tuesday. Term one School holidays are due to start in Victoria on Friday, Andrews said he does not know at this stage whether they will re-open after school holidays on 13 April. Here\u2019s the statement in full: I will inform National Cabinet tonight that Victoria will proceed over the next 48 hours to implement a shutdown of all non-essential activity across our state to combat the spread of Coronavirus. This is not something that we do lightly, but it\u2019s clear that if we don\u2019t take this step, more Victorians will contract coronavirus, our hospitals will be overwhelmed and more Victorians will die. Victorians will still be able to go to the supermarket, the bank, the pharmacy and other essential stores, like petrol stations and convenience stores. Freight, logisitics and home delivery are also considered essential and will remain open. I will also inform National Cabinet that school holidays will be brought forward in Victoria, starting on Tuesday 24 March. All measures to be implemented by Victoria are consistent with the health advice provided by the Victorian Chief Health Officer. The decision whether to re-open schools after the Term 1 holidays will likewise be determined following advice from the Chief Health Officer. I will have more to say on these measures tomorrow morning. Let\u2019s go back to the latest data on Covid-19 cases in New South Wales, which reported 97 new cases overnight and a new total of 533. Two particular groups are linked to clumps of new confirmed cases: backpackers in the Bondi area, and passengers on cruise ships. First to Bondi. NSW Health said that \u201cseveral\u201d new cases were linked to backpackers in the Bondi area, and the risk has been traced to two parties: Boogie Wonderland party at the Bucket List on Queen Elizabeth Drive, Bondi Beach, on Sunday 15 March between 4pm-11pm Party at Club 77 (77 William St, Darlinghurst) from Midnight Sunday 15 March to 4am Monday 16 March. Anyone who was at either of those parties has been asked to monitor their health closely and isolate themselves immediately should any symptoms consistent with Covid-19 develop. The number of cases among passengers of the Ruby Princess cruise ship has risen to 18. That ship docked in Sydney on 19 March. In all, there are five cruise voyages in Sydney linked to 25 cases. The Voyager of the Seas, which docked on 7 March, and returned on 18 March, is linked to one confirmed case on each visit. The Ovation of the Seas, which docked on 18 March, had two confirmed cases. The Celebrity Solstice, which docked on 19 March, has reported one case diagnosed in New Zealand. All passengers and crew have been notified and advised to self-isolate for 14 days and monitor symptoms. Investigations are continuing. Two more cases have also been linked to a service of the Sydney Church of Christ on 8 March at the Ryde Civic Centre. More than 300 people attended that service, and nine have so far tested positive. An additional two new cases with exposure identified as a Sydney Church of Christ service on March 8 at Ryde Civic Centre attended by more than 300 people, taking the total to nine. More detail on the South Australia border closure: While we have a moment, let\u2019s go back to the announcement that South Australia is closing its borders. Premier Steven Marshall announced this a short while ago. The SA police commissioner will also declare a major emergency in that state \u2014 that replaces the public health emergency that was previously declared, and means that emergency provisions are authorised under the Emergency Management Act and not the Public Health Act. Police are responsible for enforcing that act, so the emergency management response will now be coordinated by the police commissioner. This is similar to what Tasmania announced on Thursday. Marshall said the measure was announced after a number of cases in SA in recent days were of people who had contracted the virus after returning from interstate, or contracted it from people visiting from interstate. This has forced our decision to close our borders in South Australia. We make this decision in the interest of public health in South Australia. People that are coming into South Australia, whether they are visitors or whether they are South Australians returning, will be required to undertake 14 days of self isolation. This is no longer something which is optional. It is mandatory. It is the social responsibility of every single person in this state to make sure that they are abiding by these rules. The laws will come into force on 4pm on Tuesday. Border control stations will be set up at the airport, at train stations, and on roads entering SA \u2014 repurposing heavy vehicle inspections stations and biosecurity stations that already exist on the border. Marshall said: When people come into South Australia, from four o\u2019clock onTuesday afternoon, they will be required to understand precisely the orders that will be in place. They will be asked to sign a declaration that they will self isolate and they will be required to provide SA Police with information on where they will be undertaking their self isolation. There will be tests on this important declaration and this commitment individuals regarding this very, very important Public safety initiative. There will be some arrangements put in place along borders because we know that in country South Australia, sometimes two towns on either side of the border have a high level of interaction ... People that do live in those communities will be allowed to move between those communities once they have been identified as somebody in on of those communities but, I stress, if there is any reason to believe that there is an outbreak on the immediate other side of the border, then that\u2019ll have to also be curtailed. Marshall said there would be some \u201clogical exceptions\u201d to the quarantine requirements, particularly around freight. Here is the full statement from the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, on a \u201cmore comprehensive lockdown of non-essential services\u201d in NSW. The statement reads: Tonight I will be informing the National Cabinet that NSW will proceed to a more comprehensive shutdown of non-essential services. This will take place over the next 48 hours. Supermarkets, petrol stations, pharmacies, convenience stores, freight and logistics, and home delivery will be among the many services that will remain open. Schools will be open tomorrow, though I will have more to say on this issue in the morning. I will update NSW tomorrow morning about the impacts and our plans following the National Cabinet. ACT education minister Yvette Berry said public schools in Canberra were prepared and preparing to transition to online learning, should a decision be made to close schools. We are well placed for that shift and we have invested significantly in devices across our ACT school systems to ensure that we have the digital capability. Schools are being provided with both the time and support programs to make sure that we can do this transition as smoothly as possible when we need to make that decision. Berry said that school principals would have a teleconference on Monday morning to ensure all were across the situation. Victoria is expected to push the issue of school closures at the national cabinet meeting in Canberra tonight. Andrew Barr said the ACT government would undertake an immediate review of all locations across the territory where people may be continuing to gather together in significant numbers. If they are on public land, we will be closing these facilities, [closing] all these areas down. If they are on commonwealth land, we will be asking the commonwealth to do the same. He urged everyone to follow the advice on social distancing, and comply with self-isolation rules and travel restrictions. We cannot stress the seriousness of the situation for our country, for our city ... Every decision that has been made at all levels of government in Australia is painful and we know that it impacts on our local economies and the way of life that we have come to expect. But we\u2019re doing this try and save lives, but it will only be effective if Canberrans make the necessary changes to help slow the spread of the virus. So we need your support now than ever. We need you to take action, we need you to take the physical distancing measures seriously. You should not be within 1.5m of another person unnecessarily. No handshakes. No hugging. We need you to avoid all non-essential travel. We need you to wash your hands regularly and often. Otherwise, the consequences will be dire. This is an unprecedented situation. We must now act together to ensure that we stop and slow the spread of this virus. ACT chief minister Andrew Barr says that the territory could not close its borders, as Tasmania, the NT, and SA have done, but that the ACT had advised that non-essential travel by ACT residents should be suspended. Barr: The only travel outside of the Canberra region should be for work, for compassionate reasons, and to ensure the essential supplies and services that our region needs. If you travel to the ACT for work or for your essential services, you are considered to be part of the Canberra region. We are urging Canberrans to take a common sense approach to this instruction. And carefully consider whether you need to travel outside of our region for any of these reasons. This means no holidays on the south coast. This means no weekends in Sydney or Melbourne. Visiting family and friends outside of the Canberra region has to be carefully considered and if it is not essential, do not do it. These measures have been put in place nationally to slow the spread of the virus across regions. If someone is carrying the virus and they travel to multiple regions, while they are symptomatic, they are potentially spreading the virus. If you do not have the virus, but you travel to a region that does, you are increasing the likelihood of bringing the virus back to your hometown, to your place of work, or to your family ... The ACT cannot close its border but our region can be protected. And we will be working closely with New South Wales and surrounding local government areas to ensure that these measures work effectively. The ACT has reported 10 new cases of Covid-19, bringing the total as of midday to 19. The new cases include 7 males and 3 females, aged between 21 and 67 years. Eight of the cases are linked to overseas travel, one is a known close contact of a previously confirmed case, and one follows interstate travel from Queensland. There have been 2,395 negative Covid-19 tests in the ACT so far. Two patients are being cared for in Canberra hospitals, the rest are isolating at home. I\u2019ll bring you some comments from chief minister Andrew Barr shortly. Victoria\u2019s chief health officer, Professor Brett Sutton, said 67 new cases of Covid-19 were confirmed yesterday, bringing the total number of cases to 296. The number of cases of confirmed community transmission in Victoria has risen to three. Six people are in hospital, and 70 people have recovered. More than 22,900 people have been tested so far. All but those confirmed positive, or awaiting results, were negative. Only 25 of the positive tests were of people who live in regional Victoria. Cases have been recorded in the Geelong region, Ballarat, the surf coast, Warrnambool, the Macedon Ranges, Latrobe, Yarriambiack, Gannawarra, Hepburn, Moorabool, Mitchell, Mildura and Greater Shepparton. Most of those locations have only recorded one case. Sutton said: While most Victorians are voluntarily complying with requests to isolate, Police have strong powers to enforce the direction if it\u2019s required. Under the State of Emergency people who don\u2019t comply with a directive could receive a fine of up to $20,000. Companies face fines of up to $100,000. For the virus to spread, extended close personal contact is most likely required. Close personal contact is at least 15 minutes face-to-face or more than two hours in the same room. Extensive testing has shown that people who have passed through places where there was a confirmed case, known as casual contacts, have an extremely low risk of transmission and are not currently recommended for testing. This will help to ensure our hospitals, assessment centres and general practitioners can prioritise testing for those most at risk. Finally, Paul Kelly was asked whether Australia had enough ventilators. Ventilator capacity has been a key limiting factor in the ability of countries overseas to treat all the severe cases they have seen in their health systems. Kelly said Australia does have \u201cquite a lot of spare capacity\u201d in parts of the health system other than intensive care, and that will be used to support ICU. He also said Australia had domestic ventilator capacity \u2014 he didn\u2019t quantify that. Kelly: I am confident we can actually ramp up ICU substantially and just to say this, intensive care is not he only thing that people need. We need hospital beds and we need to consider hospital in the home and we need to consider a range of options and model of care which may look quite different to what we are used to in relation to people that are ill. And we\u2019re doing that work right now. We have another infectious disease consultant who has joined us this week, Dr Nick Coatsworth. He is working with the society for respiratory physicians as well as the infectious diseases society and intensive care to do exactly that work with a view to having that all locked down and very ready to go this week. Deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly was asked if he was concerned at apparent exponential increases in the number of positive cases in Australia, despite the raft of measures implemented by the Australian government in the past week. This is on the back of NSW reporting another 97 positive cases overnight. Kelly said this is not an unexpected growth rate, and that it will take a bit of time for the social distancing measures, mass gathering bans, and requirements for travellers to self-isolate to have an effect. Kelly said: So we\u2019re pretty much where I thought we would be so I\u2019m not surprised we have got to 1,000 at this point. The issue is that some of these things firstly are not being fully implemented and they need to be. We need to ramp up the communication to people about that, we need to make sure that people are listening, need to also start to consider enforcing some of these things, particularly in larger venues that are clearly not taking any notice of it. So these are things that we can do and must do over coming days. Most of these extra issues, including the border restrictions for all travellers last weekend, it is only one week old so it will take one week or two for those things to start to bite. And at the moment most of our cases we are seeing in Australia are related to travel. So now that so little travel is happening, that will start to decrease over time and just to reinforce that, anyone who has coming to Australia since last weekend must stay at home. And self-isolate. This is not a please do. This is a must. And that will be really ramped up over the coming days in terms of reminders and so forth to people that they must stay at home and they must self isolate for the protection of the community. On the issue of school closures, deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly said that he was aware of increasing rates of absenteeism from schools, as parents pull their children out, but he said the official advice, at this stage, was unchanged. The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, the national committee of chief medical and health officers, will discuss this when it meets at 4pm today. Kelly said that schools could reduce the potential spread of the virus by enforcing messages about hand washing, cough etiquette, staying home when sick, and adequate school cleaning. I recognise these are very difficult, particularly in the younger years of school, but reassuringly they have been very few cases of Covid-19 in children in Australia, similar to where we have seen the rest of the world, and of those cases, almost all of them have been extremely mild. Asked about the suggestion Victoria could close schools early, and would push for school closures at the national cabinet meeting tonight, Kelly said: In terms of what different states and territories might do, they will have to talk for themselves in relation to that. I know the prime minister is very keen on keeping a federal national approach but each of the states and territories have their own particular issues they need to deal with. In Victoria the Easter holidays are starting on Friday anyway so closing on Tuesday would not be a huge change to that. But they may need to take their own individual situations into account. Kelly said Australia had moved \u201cvery rapidly\u201d to expand testing in the last month, and was continuing to expand testing. He said we would move to new rapid testing as those tests became available. Kelly said that scenes like those at Bondi beach yesterday showed that the messaging on social distancing could be improved. He said that messaging could always be improved. He also directly addressed younger people, saying \u201cyou are not immune\u201d. While the majority of people who have experienced a severe infection worldwide have been older, young people have got a severe infection and some young people have died. All young people can transmit the virus to more vulnerable people. Professor Paul Kelly said that of the more than 1,000 cases recorded in Australia so far, there were \u201cvery few people with severe illness\u201d. Only a few people requiring intensive care. And only seven deaths. That is very unfortunate for those seven people but seven out of a thousand is very different to where we have seen other countries to when they got to that milestone of cases. He said that Australia had a high rate of testing and a low rate of positive tests. This is because we are testing a lot. Over 120,000 tests have been done in Australia. This is one of the highest rates per head of population in the world. We have very low positivity rate, less than 1%, which is again very different to the US, UK, Italy and other places which have reached this [1000 cases] milestone. We are testing, we are testing a lot and we are picking up cases early, getting them to isolate, finding their contacts and getting them to isolate and this is the way we can get on top of this epidemic. We will go back to the South Australian news shortly but first the deputy chief medical officer, Professor Paul Kelly, is talking now about social distancing measures. The most important thing is to make sure that we are indeed enforcing the measures that were introduced over the past week. We have seen many changes and this is continuing to impact on the lives of Australians and that is an unfortunate component of this but it is a really important one. Everyone needs to take this virus seriously, and if we do want to take it seriously, we need to act now to decrease the rise in cases. This is very important ... I want to reassure Australians that government is taking the best medical advice and we are giving that on a daily basis, if not more frequently. Kelly says that the social distancing rules are that everyone keep 1.5m apart, a ban on outdoor mass gatherings of more than 500 people, a ban on indoor mass gatherings of more than 100 people, and ensuring that indoor gatherings have space for at least four square metres per person. He also says the hygiene messages \u2014 particularly around washing your hands for 20 seconds very regularly \u2014 sound simple but are \u201cvery important\u201d. If you have symptoms of a cough, fever, shortness of breath, the symptoms of Covid-19, you should stay home. That would be the best for your health and also to decrease the transmission of this virus into the community. South Australia has followed Tasmania and the Northern Territory in requiring all new arrivals and people returning to its state, including South Australian residents and domestic travellers, to undertake a mandatory 14-day self-isolation upon return. You can watch the announcement from premier Steven Marshall here. As at 8pm, Saturday, 21 March, 2020, an additional 97 cases of Covid-19 have been diagnosed in New South Wales, NSW Health has said. That brings the total number of confirmed cases in NSW to 533. The source of infections to date: Overseas travel: 251 Locally acquired from contact with a confirmed case: 131 Untraced community transmission: 46 Under investigation: 105 The number of negative tests, to date, is 52,130 Quiet, with some defiance, as Bondi Beach succumbs to coronavirus closure Never have the perennially crowded waters on Bondi Beach looked so inviting. But on a glorious bright March day, a late-season spark of brilliance against the encroaching autumn, the golden sand and blue-green waters were, if not deserted, uncannily quiet. Rangers carrying loud hailers marched up and down the beach in socks and shoes telling people the beach was closed and that swimmers, surfers and sun bakers must leave immediately. Entries to the beach were taped shut with red-and-white tape. Signs insisted \u201carea closed until further notice\u201d. Most people were adherent. (Despite Australians\u2019 cherished self-image as a band of rugged nonconformists, this is a country that, in fact, embraces obedience.) But there were defiant cases, official entreaties politely ignored. Surfers slipped under barriers or jumped into the water from the rocks at the north or south end of the beach. Bondi Beach, a pictorial shorthand for Australia, has become emblematic of the nation\u2019s struggle to respond properly to the outbreak. The trajectory of Australia\u2019s coronavirus curve mirrors Italy more than it does Singapore. More than 1,000 cases have been reported, and while the death toll remains low, at seven, there are fears this could escalate if the health system becomes strained. \u201cSocial distancing\u201d is a lexical addition to every conversation, but its practice is haphazard. Cafes and restaurants are still full. People still seek out the beach on a sunny day. Too, there is an abiding resentment at the imposition on civil liberties that social distancing is, when such egregious official mistakes are made. On the same day that Bondi Beach was ordered closed, the NSW government allowed 2,700 people to walk off a cruise ship in Sydney\u2019s CBD which had reported more than 150 illnesses. At least five people from the Ruby Princess have since tested positive to Covid-19, some of whom boarded domestic flights home. And walking south from Bondi reveals the practical difficulties of enforcing a lockout rule along a rocky, meandering coastline, beyond the philosophical challenge of keeping Australians from the beaches they regard as their inviolable birthright. The physical distance rules are being strictly adhered to in the press gallery as well. Police have also been authorised under the public health emergency to enforce the physical distance rules in Queensland Queensland\u2019s health officer has authorised liquor licencing officers to enforce the physical distance laws in social situations. Queensland has also announced $17m investment to help fasttrack research at the University of Queensland for a vaccine for Covid-19. There are now 259 confirmed cases in Queensland, with most cases in the south-east, and the majority having picked up the virus overseas. Another 38 people were diagnosed in the last 24 hours. On the issue of closing beaches, Annastacia Palaszczuk says she is looking at it. She says she knows people live in those areas, which complicates things, but it is on the table. \u201cThere are people still out there who think this won\u2019t happen to us. Wake up,\u201d she says. On what Murph just reported about NSW and Victoria, Annastacia Palaszczuk says she expects tougher measures will be the outcome of the next national cabinet meeting. But the Queensland local elections are still, at this stage, on. The election is meant to be held this weekend. The Queensland premier says there will be \u201ctougher measures\u201d coming. \u201cI 100% back in what the prime minister said about social distancing and all non-essential travel must be cancelled.\u201d Things are moving very quickly today. National cabinet is meeting tonight instead of Tuesday. I\u2019ve confirmed that New South Wales and Victoria will seek a ban at today\u2019s meeting on all non-essential activities (that means pubs, clubs and restaurants \u2013 not supermarkets). The hope is to preserve a consensus rather than having states doing different things. Victoria also wants to shut the schools from Tuesday this coming week. Again the hope is to emerge with a consensus, but I gather Victoria is prepared to go it alone on schools in the event a consensus does not emerge. Annastacia Palaszczuk is holding a press conference \u2013 she is calling for people to \u201cstay in your neighbourhood as much as possible, unless you are working\u201d. \u201cCoronavirus is on the Gold Coast ... I need everyone on the Gold Coast to listen very clearly to the messages I am giving. ... As mush as possible over the coming weeks and months, I need you to stay in your village.\u201d Mike Bowers was at that press conference the prime minister and treasurer just held. Here is some of what he saw: With Victoria and NSW pushing for stronger lockdowns \u2013 including, in Victoria\u2019s case, schools \u2013 the pressure is on Queensland, which is seeing a potential community transmission outbreak on areas like the Gold Coast, to not only follow suit, but cancel the local government elections which had been scheduled for next Saturday. The government announcements can be found, in their entirety, here. The Paul Ramsay Foundation has announced $9m in grants to support coronavirus-related scientific support, including $3.5m to the University of Queensland to accelerate the development of a Covid-19 vaccine. Excitingly, the release from the foundation suggests the vaccine could be available worldwide in as little as six months, using the university\u2019s rapid response technology. That\u2019s 12 months quicker than the 18-month timeline most commonly referenced. The grants also include $2m to the Peter Doherty Institute, for the development of a \u201cpassive immunisation treatment\u201d. In a statement, the foundation said: \u201cIf successful, the treatment would involve production and injection of antibodies to provide immediate protection against infection, but which must be renewed every two months. \u201cThe foundation is advised that this passive immunisation approach is promising because it may provide an interim treatment should the vaccine require more time to develop. It would enable medical and nursing staff to continue to work amid exposure to Covid-19, meaning health systems could sustain service through even the worst-case outbreak.\u201d Additional grants are $2m to help high risk communities, particularly Indigenous communities, and $1.5m to support other researchers. This is also a live issue The retail industry is about to issue a multi-billion rescue package for the industry OK, there was, once again, a lot to take in there. The biggest takeaways: The JobSeeker payment will be essentially doubled, with those eligible able to also receive a $550/fortnight coronavirus payment People who see a 20% reduction in pay will also be able to access $10,000 from their superannuation. Another $10,000 will be made eligible in the next financial year. Those eligible for the $750 stimulus payment at the end of the month will receive a second one in July. Further \u201cdraconian\u201d measures will be applied in areas which see an outbreak of community transmissions of Covid-19. All non-essential domestic travel should be suspended. More stimulus measures will be made. The national cabinet is bringing its meeting forward to tonight, to discuss further lockdowns, including the closure of social businesses such as pubs and bars. Scott Morrison ends the press conference as he began it \u2013 with a message about strength: So look, while Australians may be self-isolating in many cases and keeping their distance from each other, I want to assure all Australians of this. That together we will get through this. We will not want to see anyone go through this alone, at the end of the day, through the support that we are providing. We need to support each other. We need to care for each other. And together, Australia, we will get through this, and we will emerge stronger. Can some of Australia\u2019s biggest businesses expect a line of credit from the government? That\u2019s a question on things like airlines, which are about to lose whatever customers they had left. Josh Frydenberg: As you know, one of the major pillars in our economic response, in addition to our two stimulus packages, has been the move by the Australian Office of Financial Management, as well as the RBA, to inject $105 billion of liquidity into the system. This will help the banks meet some of the demands from their existing customers. Let me emphasise, whether you are a big or small business, there is an alignment of your interest with the bank\u2019s interest. The banks want their customers to get to the other side. In fact, the banks know there is the other side to the coronavirus. I have been in daily discussions with the banks, and there is a real willingness to work with their customers to help them through this very difficult period. At this stage, AFL and NRL players can continue to travel for games. At this stage. Let\u2019s take a look at what the government is doing for people accessing Centrelink payments. The main takeaway is that JobSeeker Payment (previously called Newstart) will be almost doubled for six months. The rate for a single person with no children will now be $1,115.70 a fortnight. That will be accomplished with a massive $550 per fortnight top-up payment to everyone on JobSeeker Payment. It will apply to existing and new recipients. (For a sense of scale, social service groups calling for a permanent boost to Newstart wanted a $95 a week increase.) Crucially, the $550 top-up will not be affected by earnings. What this means is, while your dole payments will be tapered according to your earnings, as long as don\u2019t earn $1,100 in a fortnight (which means you lose your payments all together), you will still get the full $550 supplement. This will be crucial for casual workers and sole-traders, the government says. The government is also waiving the liquid assets waiting test, meaning people will not have to whittle down their savings before accessing Jobseeker Payment. People on Youth Allowance JobSeeker, Parenting Payment, Farm Household Allowance and Special Benefit will also get this $550 fortnightly top-up payment. Notably, disability support pensioners (who currently receive a maximum rate of $944 a fortnight) do not appear to be eligible for the extra payment, according to the press release. On top of the temporary boost to income support payments, there is also an extra $750 stimulus payment from 13 July 2020 to around 5 million welfare recipients, veterans and eligible concession card holders. The government says around half of those who will benefit from that will be pensioners. Josh Frydenberg says the super changes need a law change, but that the industry itself should be fine: It is a legislative change, and I just want to point out that the superannuation funds last year had about $300 billion in cash. So the superannuation funds have the ability to provide what Treasury estimate to be about a $27 billion injection into the economy. What we are talking about is less than 1 per cent of the funds that are currently under management in superannuation. This is the people\u2019s money, and this is the time they need it most. In respect to your second question, both the prime minister and I, as well as the finance minister, have said this is not our priority right now. That is not our focus right now. When it comes to some of the bigger companies, you would have seen in a sector like aviation, that was hit, we made a number of announcements that are providing some relief there. We continue to do some work around other measures that the government could take. But as we have both made very clear, the prime minister and I today, this is not about set and forget. This is the second package. The first package was a stimulus package. This second package is a safety net package. We will continue to do what is necessary to support the Australian economy, to support Australian jobs and support Australian businesses. And again on the issue of school closures \u2013 schools are to remain open for the time being: That is the position of the advice and that is the decision that national cabinet has taken. If there was any change to that, that would be based on any change to advice we have received from the medical experts, and any decision that has been made by the national cabinet. The issues that we have been presenting on, importantly, on the medical advice that we have had, remain the same challenges. It is still the case, and the evidence is, that the incidence of the coronavirus amongst younger people is far lower than it is for the rest of the population, and so the health risk to children is less, is our advice, than to other parts of the population. It is also still the fact that, if there were widespread school closures across the country, that would seriously impact and disrupt the health workforce that is needed to save lives. And so that is a paramount consideration also of the national cabinet. But we will continue to consider all of these issues based on the expert advice. We will do that in a calm and reasoned manner according to the disciplined process we have set for ourselves, which means we are all working together and being nationally coordinated in our responses. He then goes a little further on that same issue: In relation to the last question, I can assure everybody that I have been following the same health advice on attendance to school that I have offered to all Australians. I want to be very clear about that. But I would also ask, and this goes for all members of parliament and all public figures, I would ask you to be respectful about the privacy of our families and of our children. I am aware of circumstances where the children of members of parliament and the schools they are attending were the subject of some attention. I don\u2019t think that is fair to our kids, I really don\u2019t. At this stage, Scott Morrison says schools are remaining open. On the issue of whether some states are pushing for the closures, the prime minister says: My reaction to that is the medical expert panel, the AHPCC, is meeting this afternoon. That includes the health officers of all the states and territories. They will form a view on all the range of issues I have asked them to form a view on. That will be presented to all of the ministers this afternoon and we will meet as a national cabinet tonight to consider our response, and that is where I intend to provide any response to those recommendations. That is the orderly and calm way to deal with these things and to make decisions in the responsive matter. He also addresses the social media stories about his children being kept home from school (they were ill for a few days). I don\u2019t go into the health status of my children, thank you. On the issue of supermarkets not being able to meet delivery demand, Scott Morrison says Home Affairs is now involved: This is something the minister for home affairs has been working on in the national coordinating mechanism. There are a number of issues that need to be addressed in terms of better warehousing and distribution when it comes to home supply. Also you would have seen this week the Victorian government, I know that other state governments are doing it and we have done it also, to increase the resources going into things like Meals on Wheels and things of that nature to support things like home care packages, and we are very dependent on the services. So it is important that we provide that resource support. What I am impressed by is that these private companies, whether it is Coles, Woolies or others, working very closely with us to ensure that we can resolve some of those logistical challenges that have been presented, and the minister for home affairs, Peter Dutton, has been together with his department working closely with them to resolve some of those problems. If Australians don\u2019t stop flouting the social distance rules, and ignoring the bans on gatherings, including in bars and pubs, Scott Morrison says governments will have no choice but to step in: As you say, if there have been pubs and clubs that are heaving with people on the weekend, that is simply an invitation for the states and territories to shut them down. And if they are unable to get a handle on that, then they are bringing on what would be their worst outcome, and there is a responsibility, both on those who run those venues and the patrons, I underscore, and those who are going to these venues. I mean, coronavirus is not a secret. Everybody knows. It is wall-to-wall on every coverage, and every conversation happening around this country today. And so there is no excuse to say you don\u2019t know. It is one to 1.5m, it is a four square metre rule. You have to keep a healthy distance between each other. If Australians can\u2019t do that on a broad scale, then they are denying the governments and the authorities the most important weapon we have to save lives and to save livelihoods, and states and territories will have to take more severe responses to deal with that. So we are simply appealing to people to show common sense, to respect each other, and do the right thing when it comes to following these very simple rules. But inevitably, and I suspect soon, there will be need for in particular locations more extreme measures to be taken. But the prime minister is staying out of the bun fight over who is to blame for allowing the Ruby Princess passengers, who had been exposed to Covid-19, to disperse in Sydney: With the issues on the weekend, we will have lots of challenges and all of those who are working on those issues, whether those providing health clearances for those who leave the ships, which are down to the state level, or Border Force which is part of the process, they have to work together carefully. So I will not get into any issue or commentary on that event but what I will commit, as the premier and I discussed yesterday, is to double down on our commitment to working together as closely as we can. On every occasion things will not go exactly as we might like it. People are working under extreme stress, often with limited information and we are going to support those people to make the best decisions they can. And the states and territories standing shoulder to shoulder with each other, and the commonwealth and other states, could face the same situation and you always learn from these situations and I thank all of those, whether it is the NSW government or commonwealth government, and I\u2019m confident those issues will be addressed in the future. On those stuck overseas, or on cruise ships, Scott Morrison says Dfat is working on it: Those Australians who find themselves overseas on a cruise ship or isolated, like several hundred that we know to be in Peru. In terms of both groups, that is the priority of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and they are working on a range of measures how to best support and to return and enable people to return to Australia. It is not a straightforward issue but it is something that Dfat are working through to a range of options, well advanced from when that mission was first put to me. Same type of arrangements for Australians on cruise ships. If you have families or relatives stranded in any of those places or on cruise ships, it is very high on the list of Dfat to find a way to safely ensure that those Australians can return home, and even more importantly they can get access to medical treatment. And on who can access the new coronavirus payment: Sole traders can access their savings to get them through from superannuation but also the ability to keep working and keep earning income without income tax and ensure they can access the JobSeeker payment, and that JobSeeker payment, even if it would be at a low level because of the taper, they would still get the full $550 supplement. That goes to everybody who is on the JobSeeker payment and I know that, in addition to that, it also would enable them to access the energy supplement rate ... the pharmaceutical allowance. $185 for families with three or more children. Family tax benefit A and B which include supplements which could see hundreds of extra dollars per week for those families. Carers allowances, mobility allowances, education supplement, a range of other payments and supplements that are triggered by getting access to the JobSeeker payment and so this will go to people who stood down, not technically unemployed but stood down, and this is about keeping them connected to the business, keeping income flowing. I agree in a modest way and not what they would usually be getting but what we\u2019re trying to do with this package is to ensure it is targeted to those who would feel the blow first and most and give as much income support to them, with further income support to broader groups, well, that is something we can always look. On the $750 payments, those eligible will receive one at the end of this month, and another in July. Scott Morrison explains how that works: The nature of these payments and the purpose of these payments are changing. What next payment is to indicate is that this will go for six months. One payment for April, another for July for the next quarter. This is clearly saying that we expect this to go on for some time and we know that those vulnerable groups may need additional income support during those periods. Yes, it will provide some sort of support for the economy but it will also provide some very real financial support for the most vulnerable in our community. It has that broader purpose stop if we have to revisit these things, then of course we will. The May budget has already been cancelled (it will now, at this stage, be handed down in October). Parliament was also scheduled for May. Scott Morrison just said those sittings may not go ahead \u2013 in fact, the whole parliament sitting calendar looks like it is being thrown out, with the parliament to be called together when it needs to be \u2013 to pass emergency bills \u2013 but not just for general sittings. Morrison: We will be working through a range of issues of going through the operation of parliament in the months ahead and we have some specific proposals, which I do not propose to go through here because we have had discussion with the opposition this week, and I thank the leader of the opposition for facilitating the process and looking forward to meeting with him this afternoon here in the cabinet rooms. And we will also at that time be talking through the measures the treasurer has been announcing today and legislation around that, the supply arrangement we would need to put in place. We have to be conscious of the fact that because of the spread of the virus, it may not be physically possible to convene the parliament over the next six months and we have to prepare for those contingencies. The plan is to move to a much more emergency mode operation for parliament to ensure the primacy of the parliament is respected in ensuring any of the measures taken to support Australians are done so in consistency without parliament. Scott Morrison: It is regrettable and I know the impact it will have on many people in those communities where those holidays were going to take place. These decisions are not taken lightly and for those who are arguing for extreme measures all over the country, we would only take further measures based on medical advice because, at the same time that we are trying to protect lives, we are also trying to protect the livelihoods of Australians and that means acting on medical advice and ensuring that we remain totally in lockstep on the incremental changes where, regrettably, it is the case that that travel needs to be reduced to stop the spread of the virus across the country. Other states will be making other decisions about this issue and they will make further announcements today and I will leave them to make them. Whether it is Tasmania, NT or elsewhere, they are making this decision and in consultation with other premiers and chief medical officers. The prime minister then gets stronger. And details just how much life is about to change: What we are saying is non-essential travel should be avoided and particularly when we\u2019re talking about interstate travel and longer distances, the sort of travel that would not be normally part of your normal life. Going to the shops is something you have to do, get into work, other important tasks you have on a daily basis you have to do but I think Australians can exercise their common sense about things they know are not essential, and this is again the point I am making to people. We will give you as many rules as we can and as many guidelines but we need you to think carefully about what you are doing and your behaviour and the impact it has on others. This is incredibly important. It is not just about each of us individually but the person standing next to us, the person who lives across the road, the elderly resident in the same apartment building as you or whatever you might be. We have to think about making sensible decisions for ourselves and our families and also decisions we are taking and its impact on other Australians. So it does mean that those holidays that you may have been planning to take interstate over the school holidays are cancelled. That is what it means. Scott Morrison continues: Where possible it will be restricted but in some cases a suspect states and territories will take a broader application but this is what we are now facing, this is the next stage and this is what was anticipated some weeks ago, almost a month ago when we said we are now moving to prepare for pandemic like situations. And so that is why there has been enormous amounts of information flow between the states and commonwealth, everything from hospital arrangements to medical supplies and a lot of other measures so the national cabinet continues to work. On those more severe measures, that will include lockdowns. Scott Morrison: What we have done as a national cabinet is establish a baseline for healthy distances between people and a common set of rules that work across the country. You have really seen in Tasmania, in the NT, further measures taken because, in those cases especially, they have more vulnerable populations, so you have already seen a more tailored response in specific locations based on the risk presented. What I am saying is you will see more of this. You will see more regional focus to this, more targeted responses from states and territories, and that will be done at the instigation, based on their health advice and they will seek to do it as consistently as possible as states face with similar outbreaks in similar situations. Scott Morrison says it would be a mistake to compare Australia\u2019s data to others, when it comes to triggering a lockdown, but warns more severe measures will be on the way: I would be careful comparing Australia\u2019s data to other jurisdictions. We have one of the lowest, if not the lowest test positivity in the world at [present], .7% compared to USA at 13%, UK at 5% and Korea at 3%, and we are seeing a less severe impact of the virus on those who have contracted it in Australia than we have seen by the more general levels overseas, so I would caution people to be very careful about the international comparisons because the data is not necessarily directly comparable. But the point is the same and that is, as things escalate, more severe measures have to be taken and what I am telling you, they are coming. They will be coming and they will be applied by states and territories in more specific ways and they will be done in as consistent away as possible is considered by states and territories and will be considering some of those further this evening. Scott Morrison also gets stronger on the social distancing message: It is a challenge for Australians. It is very important, it is very serious, it is deadly serious and that is why I would appeal to them that they all have a role to play. People cannot be cavalier about these things and must take them extremely seriously because lives and livelihoods are at stake. What we saw on the weekend at Bondi Beach would have been done innocently but negligently done and it is important that serves as a wake-up call for the entire country to ensure they take these social distancing policies very seriously, and the states are moving quickly to mandate and enforce them and they will be taking even stronger measures in particular areas and potentially more widespread. They will upgrade as necessary but the more social distancing we do, the less severe the economic impacts have to be. And so that is why I appeal to Australians that you are enlisted in our fight against the virus. You have a role to play. Scott Morrison also talks about what the non-essential travel advisory means \u2013 and asks people to be understanding as they cancel their plans on what is happening for the person on the other end of the phone: There will be challenges there but I am confident by the business to business, government to business engagement taking place as people just solve practical problems, unforeseen problems and what I would say, particularly in terms of the last measures Josh was going through, if you have booked a wedding or if you have booked a trip, understand the person you have booked it with a going through a hard time as well and what we need to do is give each other a break at the moment and sit down and just work through these issues tactically as Australians. Understanding that, if you force your issue, you make someone else\u2019s issue harder which at the end of the day will make your issue harder so it is very important that Australians work together And a smaller part of the package \u2013 but one which will become increasingly important as this crisis rolls on - what happens to businesses which trade while insolvent? Josh Frydenberg: The third part of our package will provide regulatory shield for what are otherwise profitable and viable businesses that find themselves under severe financial pressure as a result of the coronavirus. Now is the time for more flexibility in insolvency and bankruptcy laws to keep these businesses alive and to trade through this period. The government is proposing to increase the threshold at which a creditor can take action to initiate insolvency or bankruptcy from as low as $2,000 today to $20,000 and giving companies and individuals six months instead of 21 days to respond. We will also provide relief from direct ... for directors for personal liability when the company is trading while insolvent. This relief will be provided over the next six months and will be vital to help companies get through this period. Josh Frdyenberg: Over the course of the last week, $105 billion is being injected into the financial system by the government and the Reserve Bank of Australia. The purpose of which was to lower the cost and increase the availability of credit, particularly to small and medium-sized businesses. Today the government is going one step further and is guaranteeing in a 50-50 partnership with the banks and other lenders, more lending to Australia\u2019s small and medium-sized businesses. This $40 billion scheme which will start in early April will provide loans of up to $250,000 for up to three years for a business with a turnover of less than $50 million. No repayments will be required for the first six months. These will be unsecured loans and they will help build a bridge for small and medium-sized businesses to the other side of the coronavirus and I urge small businesses to go and talk to their bank about these new opportunities that are available. Businesses again, are the biggest beneficiaries of the government package. Josh Frydenberg explains: We are increasing cash payment to SMEs to boost their cash flows and to keep their workers employed. All employing businesses will receive at least $20,000, all employing small businesses will receive at least $20,000 and some of the larger SMEs will receive up to $100,000 and we are extending this measure to around 30,000 not-for-profit organisations which have an annual turnover of less than $50 million. This will be a lifeline for hundreds of thousands of employers, like the local hairdresser, the local coffee shop, the local mechanic whose income has been significantly reduced over this difficult period. This is the single largest measure in the second package and, together with the first initiative in the first package for small businesses, is worth $31.9 billion in total. This payment will be automatically paid through the tax system, largely over the next six months with the first payment after 28th April so no new forms will be required from Australian small and medium-sized businesses. The prime minister\u2019s call for an end to non-essential travel shatters what is left of the businesses of Qantas, Virgin Australia and regional airline Rex. Qantas has shut international flights but still has 40% of its normal domestic flights in the air. Virgin, which didn\u2019t have a big international business in the first place, has half its domestic flights still on foot. Rex is entirely domestic and has already been screaming that it needs help. It is now very hard to see how nationalisation of the sector can be avoided. On the superannuation point, Josh Frydenberg, says it is open to anyone who sees their income fall by 20%: From April, those affected will gain access to that superannuation, capped at $10,000 this financial year and a further $10,000 next financial year. These withdrawals will be tax-free. I repeat, these withdrawals will be tax-free and available to those who are eligible for the coronavirus supplement as well as sole traders who have seen that hours work, or income fall, 20% or more as a result of the coronavirus. So if you are a sole trader or a casual and you have seen your income or your hours work followed by 20% or more as a result of the coronavirus, you will be able to get early access to your superannuation. Applications will be made online. Through a simple declaration to the tax office. Josh Frydenberg: The government will waive the asset test and waiting period for the JobSeeker allowance allowing more Australians more quickly access to support they need. The supplement will provide an additional $550 a fortnight on top of the existing JobSeeker or Newstart payment and will be available to sole traders, casual workers who meet the income test. This means, anyone eligible for the maximum JobSeeker payment will now receive more than $1,100 a fortnight, effectively doubling the JobSeeker allowance. Scott Morrison: The normal rules will not apply here. We want to make sure people are they on the other side. We have to change the rule for this period to make sure more and more Australians get through this to the other side so they can bounce back strongly when it is over. This will not be the Treasurer and my last visit to these podiums to make announcements on these measures. This is focusing on those who are going to feel the first blows. They will be more packages and more support. There will be more issues that even now have not presented themselves or could not even be conceived at this point with what we may face over the next six months and we will be working night and day to ensure we bring forward the measures Australia needs to get them on this bridge to the recovery on the other side. The more we work together, the more we share the load. The more we share the sacrifice, the more we do the right thing together as Australians, the more lives we will save, the more livelihoods we will be able to preserve and the stronger we will all be on the other side. Those are the new measures, which come on top of the business measures we have already heard about: \u2022 Boosting Cash Flow for Employers The government is providing up to $100,000 to eligible small and medium sized businesses, and not\u2011for-profits (including charities) that employ people, with a minimum payment of $20,000. These payments will help businesses\u2019 and not-for-profits\u2019 cash flow so they can keep operating, pay their rent, electricity and other bills and retain staff. Under the enhanced scheme from the first package, employers will receive a payment equal to 100 per cent of their salary and wages withheld (up from 50 per cent), with the maximum payment being increased from $25,000 to $50,000. In addition, the minimum payment is being increased from $2,000 to $10,000. The payment will be available from 28 April 2020. By linking the payments to business to staff wage tax withholdings, businesses will be incentivised to hold on to more of their workers. The payments are tax free, there will be no new forms and payments will flow automatically through the ATO. This measure will benefit around 690,000 businesses employing around 7.8 million people, and around 30,000 NFPs (including charities). Reducing social security deeming rates On top of the deeming rate changes made at the time of the first package, the government is reducing the deeming rates by a further 0.25 percentage points to reflect the latest rate reductions by the RBA. As of 1 May 2020, the lower deeming rate will be 0.25 per cent and the upper deeming rate will be 2.25 per cent. The change will benefit around 900,000 income support recipients, including Age Pensioners. This measure is estimated to cost $876 million over the forward estimates period. Temporarily reduce superannuation minimum drawdown rates The government is temporarily reducing superannuation minimum drawdown requirements for account based pensions and similar products by 50 per cent for 2019-20 and 2020-21. This measure will benefit retirees by providing them with more flexibility as to how they manage their superannuation assets. The government will allow individuals in financial stress as a result of the coronavirus to access up to $10,000 of their superannuation in 2019-20 and a further $10,000 in 2020-21. Eligible individuals will be able to apply online through myGov for access of up to $10,000 of their superannuation before 1 July 2020. They will also be able to access up to a further $10,000 from 1 July 2020 for another three months. They will not need to pay tax on amounts released and the money they withdraw will not affect Centrelink or Veterans\u2019 Affairs payments. This measure is estimated to cost $1.2 billion over the forward estimates period. Payments for households: In addition to the $750 stimulus payment announced on 12 March 2020, the government will provide a further $750 payment to social security and veteran income support recipients and eligible concession card holders, except for those who are receiving an income support payment that is eligible to receive the coronavirus supplement. This second payment will be made automatically from 13 July 2020 to around 5 million social security, veteran and other income support recipients and eligible concession card holders. Around half of those that benefit are pensioners. The first payment will be made from 31 March 2020 to people who will have been on one of the eligible payments any time between 12 March 2020 and 13 April 2020. This measure is estimated to cost $4 billion over the forward estimates period. We will give you a summary of this announcement, but as it comes, the social safety net has just been revved up, with Centrelink payments, in many cases, to be doubled. Support for workers and households Coronavirus supplement: The government is temporarily expanding eligibility to income support payments and establishing a new, time-limited coronavirus supplement to be paid at a rate of $550 per fortnight. This will be paid to both existing and new recipients of the JobSeeker Payment, Youth Allowance jobseeker, Parenting Payment, Farm Household Allowance and Special Benefit. The coronavirus supplement will be paid for the next 6 months. Eligible income support recipients will receive the full amount of the $550 coronavirus supplement on top of their payment each fortnight. This measure is estimated to cost $14.1 billion over the forward estimates period. An increase of up to 5,000 staff for Services Australia will assist to support delivery of new government measures. Scott Morrison again reiterates that Australia will not be coming out of this anytime soon. There is no 2-week quick fix, for we shut down and it all goes away and we get on with our business. I have seen those suggestions. The medical advice is very clear, there is no quick solution. We have to steel ourselves for at least the next six months and the measures were put in place we need to be prepared to carry on for at least the next six months. They need to be sustainable and scalable. What does a localised lockdown mean? What that means is, what may be necessary in a part of Sydney may not be necessary at all in rural NSW or in Perth or other parts of the country but please be assured that what we are working on is to ensure there is a consistent, as far as possible, set of measures and tools that state premiers and chief ministers can use to apply in each of the cases so if you see it happening in one part of the country, that does not necessarily mean it has to apply in your part of the country. There are parts of the country, particularly in Sydney, where these outbreaks have been more severe and I know the Premier of NSW has been focusing on these very, very keenly, particularly over the course of recent days as we have seen the increase of the number of cases in NSW. Scott Morrison says what happened on Bondi Beach on Friday \u2013 where thousands of people gathered \u2013 \u201cshould not have happened\u201d. He says the country needs Australians to start being more responsible. And then he moves on to the issue of localised lockdowns. Morrison: What happened at Bondi Beach yesterday was not OK. And served as a message to federal and state leaders that too many Australians are not taking these issues seriously enough. So the measures that we will be considering tonight means that state premiers and chief ministers may have to take far more Draconian measures to enforce social distancing particularly in areas of outbreaks than might otherwise be the case. The more Australians themselves assist us in this fight against the virus to protect lives and livelihoods, the more and better able we are to ensure that Australia comes out stronger on the other side. It is a simple plea, we need you. We need you to do your bit when it comes to social distancing and keeping that healthy distancing, to respecting and following the rules that we are setting down but more stronger measures will be coming and they will be coming in more localised areas to deal with outbreaks. Those decisions will be made by state premiers and chief ministers as they apply to their individual jurisdictions. We will also be working hard to ensure that the scaling of those measures and the identification of areas of outbreaks that require those measures will be as far as possible consistent between state and territory jurisdictions The prime minister says he has brought forward the national cabinet meeting (the one with the premiers) to tonight. Suburban lockdowns will be discussed \u2013 that was flagged on Friday, where the government says it will move to lock down areas which show community transmissions. And all non-essential travel \u201cshould be cancelled\u201d. That was also flagged on Friday, in terms of school holidays. Essentially, if you don\u2019t have to fly \u2013 and that includes for school holidays \u2013 you should not. We are referring to work-related and compassionate grounds \u2026 those types of arrangement is essential, but also essential supplies and other important arrangements needed to keep Australia running. Scott Morrison: But we must remember first and foremost that this is a health crisis. The health battle is the main battle that we face. The health battle is a battle that all Australians are enlisted in as we fight this virus stop is a national cabinet, they have already taken significant action but we know more will need to be done. Our capacity in hospital and aged care facilities and workforce challenges are all matters that the national cabinet is addressing as indeed individual cabinets at federal and state. Securing essential medical supplies has been a daily task that the health minister has been leading, together with industry Minister and other ministers across the cabinet. And enforcing the social distancing, keeping a healthy physical distancing from one another. This is one of our most if not our most important weapon against the spread of the coronavirus, which means we can save lives and we can save livelihoods. Scott Morrison: We cannot prevent all the many hardships, many sacrifices that we will face in the months ahead. And while these hardships and sacrifices may break our hearts on occasion, we must not let them break our spirit and we must not let them break our resolves as Australians. Today, we are making important announcements to support those Australians that would be in the front line of the blows that we will experience as a result of the global health crisis which is the coronavirus and its severe economic impacts. To cushion the blow as much as we can, to build a bridge to the recovery to the other side. Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg have both stepped into the prime minister\u2019s courtyard. We are a strong people. In the months ahead, we will find out just how strong we are,\u201d the prime minister says. The Business Events Council of Australia has reported $2.5bn per month is being lost, as gatherings are (understandably) banned. We don\u2019t have all the details from the new $66bn stimulus, other than the business and not-for-profit measures, with eligible businesses able to access up to $100,000 to help keep employees employed. There are also unsecured loan guarantees for up to $250,000 with loan repayments deferred for six months. The superannuation measure is a live issue, and one which could have future ramifications for when the next generation wants to retire. As our business reporter Ben Butler points out, superannuation investments have been absolutely smashed by the Covid-19 crisis. So individual accounts are already at lower levels. Topping those back up, is not going to be easy, and will have impacts for decades to come. That\u2019s why Labor is cautious \u2013 and should also give you an indication of just how long we are going to be impacted by this. Australia can not avoid a recession. It\u2019s about how it gets out of the coming recession now. One of the expectations for the coming stimulus announcement is that superannuation may be used as one of the income support measures. When asked about this on Friday by Katharine Murphy, Scott Morrison made it a point not to rule it out. Here is what Jim Chalmers, who, along with Anthony Albanese, has previously expressed concern about using superannuation as a stop gap, had to say about it this morning on Insiders: There are obviously already hardship provisions in superannuation. It\u2019s not clear to us yet whether the government intends to change that in a major way or not. And whether they\u2019ll need legislation to do that, or whether they\u2019ll just do that by regulation. If it was left up to us, solely, we wouldn\u2019t go down that path. We think that there are other ways to support people who are doing it tough. We think that early access to superannuation should be a last resort \u2013 not a first port of call. And we also think that there are real issues with encouraging people to divest from super when the market is in the condition that it is now. It\u2019s not good for them, it\u2019s not good for the system more broadly, and we don\u2019t want to create problems for people\u2019s retirement down the track. So we wouldn\u2019t go down that path, but let\u2019s see what they propose later on and we\u2019ll make our views known then. Victorian health authorities have announced another 50 people have been diagnosed with Covid-19. That brings the state\u2019s total to 279. Good morning \u2013 you have Amy Remeikis for the next little bit, as the prime minister announces the next step in the stimulus package. The press conference, which had been scheduled for 11am, has been put back 15 minutes, to 11.15am I am going to hand over to my colleague Amy Remeikis to walk you though the Australian government\u2019s new $66bn stimulus package. In the mean time, please enjoy Steve Martin playing the banjo. One of the better videos of celebrities entertaining themselves in lockdown. James Packer\u2019s Crown Resorts has finally responded to the end of its exemption to social distancing measures at its Melbourne casino, announced by Victorian premier Daniel Andrews on Saturday morning following fury from public health experts. It\u2019s been widely reported that the main gaming floor, which contains thousands of poker machines, has been closed, but Guardian Australia has not visited the casino to check and Crown\u2019s new statement does not make the position clear. A spokeswoman said Crown was complying with the Victorian chief health officer\u2019s orders and also put \u201cadditional social distancing measures in place aimed at reducing the spread of Covid-19\u201d. She said: These measures include limiting the number of people at any gathering at each undivided indoor space to 100 people or less depending on the size of the room, limits on density and further social distancing measures. It has been suggested that Crown might be able to instal dividers to keep some additional areas on the main floor operating. The company has been approached for clarification of the status of the main gaming floor and its high roller rooms. One of the main issues with shutting the casino down in the first place was that it is an extremely important employer in Melbourne \u2013 it\u2019s often described as the city\u2019s single biggest. The spokeswoman said: We recognise that this is a challenging time for all of our employees, and we remain focussed on keeping the 12,500 people who work at Crown Melbourne in a job and maintaining our supply chain, which supports over 4,000 businesses in Victoria. Meanwhile, Crown\u2019s Perth casino and the Sydney pokie pit operated by rival Star seem to be continuing to operate, but with half the machines turned off. Victoria to provide two-weeks worth of supplies to vulnerable people in self-isolation The Victorian government will provide emergency relief packages with two weeks of essential supplies to eligible people who are under mandatory self-isolation. Premier Daniel Andrews promised these packs earlier this week, but the detail was only released on Sunday. The program is intended to support people in mandatory self-isolation who have \u201clittle or no food, and no network of family and friends to support them\u201d, a government statement said. \u201cEach eligible household will receive a two-week supply of essential goods.\u201d It will be coordinated by the Red Cross in partnership with Foodbank Victoria and the Victorian state relief coordinator, and will start from Monday. Food packages will include goods like long-life milk, pasta, cereal, canned vegetables and sugar. Personal care packages will include soap, toothpaste and deodorant. Specialist items, like nappies and baby formula, will be provided based on the needs of the households. The packages will be delivered door to door. People who are not eligible for the government care packages are \u201cencouraged to be self-reliant and call on the help of family and friends wherever possible during the current pandemic\u201d. Minister for disability, ageing and carers Luke Donnellan said: We need to look out for each other over the next few months \u2013 but for people who have no one nearby to support them, we\u2019ll make sure they get what they need. There is plenty of food for all Victorians so please don\u2019t take more than you need. But if you do find yourself isolated, and can\u2019t access the basics, we have emergency relief packages for you. The program can be accessed by calling Victoria\u2019s dedicated coronavirus hotline on 1800 675 398. An update on the Ruby Princess, the cruise ship in Sydney that has been linked to a cluster of new Covid-19 cases. Four Tasmanians who were aboard the Ruby Princess are among the latest confirmed cases of Covid-19. Health authorities in Tasmania have contacted and are monitoring 54 other Tasmanian residents who were on the cruise and have returned home. The NSW government has identified another four cruise ships affected by Covid-19 in addition to the Ruby Princess, AAP reported, and is now scrambling to contact thousands of people who were on board ships that visited Sydney in March. Meanwhile, on Sky News, finance minister Mathias Cormann said the government \u201cwon\u2019t hesitate\u201d to lock down areas of the country to curb the spread of coronavirus, if that is what the medical experts recommend. You\u2019ll recall that Tasmania and the Northern Territory have already put state-based border controls in place on top of the national quarantine requirements. Anyone entering either Tasmania or the NT, even if it\u2019s from another Australian state, will have to self-isolate for 14 days. Cormann told Sky: We don\u2019t believe we can stop the virus from spreading but we certainly can continue to try and slow it down ... to save lives. He said that decision would only be taken in response to medial advice If that is the advice that comes through we won\u2019t hesitate. Jim Chalmers was also asked about the issue of closing schools, which has been one of the most contentious issues in managing Australia\u2019s response to the outbreak. The argument against closing the schools, as articulated by prime minister Scott Morrison, is that any measure undertaken today would have to be continued for at least six months and, at this stage, the advice of the national health advisors is it is not necessary. At this stage no state has declared it would close public schools, but in Victoria public schools have been told to \u201cconsolidate their preparations\u201d for a total shutdown. Six months is optimistic \u2013 a market-ready vaccine is at least 18 months away, and it\u2019s possible any measures to suppress the virus spread would need to be in place until there was widespread inoculation. Chalmers said the issue was front of mind for him, but he did not give a view on whether schools should close. He said that, like many families, he and his wife relied on grandparents to help with childcare. We did a bit of a trial of what that looks like without my mum last week for a few days, and it was mayhem, like it would be in a lot of households as we try to make it work. We\u2019re going to separate my kids from their nan for a while, which is very hard on the kids, and very hard on nan as well, but like a lot of families, we\u2019re just trying to do what we can here to do the right thing by each other and by the community more broadly, and everybody is making those sorts of decisions right now. Let\u2019s take a look at what we are expecting to see from the second stimulus package, to be announced by Scott Morrison today. On the ABC\u2019s Insiders program, David Speers and Guardian Australia\u2019s Katharine Murphy said they anticipated the package would include a provision for workers to access their superannuation. Full details on the support for workers have not been released, but it\u2019s not likely to match the United Kingdom\u2019s promise to pay up to 80% of the salary of workers who are stood down due to the coronavirus. Shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers was interviewed by Speers. He repeated the call for opposition leader Anthony Albanese to be included in the national cabinet with the state and territory leaders, but indicated Labor would not get in the way of the stimulus package. Chalmers said that the Australian government had \u201clost the capacity to go early\u201d with its economic response to the coronavirus. ... So what we need to see is \u2013 we need them to go big, go fast on jobs and incomes. And if we see that today, and we hope to, then we will play the constructive and responsible [role] in expediting that through the parliament. He said the opposition would ask the government to clarify whether there will be a link between assistance for small to medium businesses, and a guarantee by those businesses that they will keep people on. He said the cash guarantee, which pays the equivalent of withheld tax, is a \u201cbackward-looking measure\u201d and not a positive guarantee that businesses will keep staff on the books. He also said the government was not acting with sufficient urgency. Some of the assistance won\u2019t flow until the middle of next month. Some of the payments for individuals, for pensioners, won\u2019t flow for another week or so. So I think that there is a lack of urgency here, and one of the constructive roles that we do want to play in the opposition is to inject a sense of urgency where it\u2019s lacking or absent ... we can\u2019t afford there to be more dithering and delay. Chalmers said there were \u201creal advantages\u201d to the UK model, because it maintains the link between employee and employer \u2013 a requirement of the payment is that businesses keep people on their books, even if they are stood down. And he said Labor had concerns about moves to encourage people to divest from super, which he said would cause issues for people\u2019s future retirement, as well as issues to the superannuation system now. So we wouldn\u2019t go down that path, but let\u2019s see what they propose later on and we\u2019ll make our views known then. About 450 people showed up to Bondi despite beach closure, says NSW minister Some people are yet to grasp the message on social distancing. Remember those photos of crowds at Bondi beach yesterday? Well, about 450 people showed up up at Bondi this morning, despite it being temporarily closed. Guardian photographer Jessica Hromas watched rangers turning people away. This report from AAP: Hundreds of people have ignored authorities and flocked to a famous Sydney beach despite it being closed to slow the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. NSW police minister David Elliott says about 450 people who showed up at Bondi Beach on Sunday morning will be told to leave. \u201cWe are not doing this because we are the fun police. We don\u2019t close these public spaces because we want to punish people,\u201d he told Channel 7. \u201cSome people are just stupid and want to take the risk. Some people think they are above the law.\u201d Councils in Sydney have closed all the beaches in Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs, including Bondi, Tamarama, Maroubra and Coogee. This is in line with national rules banning outdoor mass gatherings of more than 500 people. Elliot said that beaches which potentially breached the public gathering regulations would be closed, and beachgoers who did not comply would be removed by police. On a similar note, Guardian Australia editor Lenore Taylor has written about her, and by extension our, approach to reporting the coronavirus and some of the issues we are grappling with. She writes that above all else, \u201cwe must provide reliable, factual, trustworthy information that holds firm against the conspiracy theories and misinformation swirling through social media\u201d. But we have to consider the implications of those questions at a time when faith in public institutions is already shaky. A deeply polarised country needs to trust and stick with a plan. Yes, politicians may have done much to breed that lack of trust, but there are consequences for everyone if contempt for government undermines the need for a unified and urgent response to public health measures. When does legitimate scrutiny cross the line to become counterproductive? These difficult judgments must be made on a daily basis. It follows the Guardian\u2019s global editor-in-chief Katharine Viner\u2019s promise to readers. You can read Lenore\u2019s full piece here. Meanwhile, Guardian Australia\u2019s political editor Katharine Murphy is on the virtual Insiders couch this morning, and just made this very good point about the way the media ought to cover the coronavirus crisis. At all times, and particularly now, we need to get our facts right. We need to get the information correct. We also need to counter, wherever we can, misinformation, which is ubiquitous in relation to this issue. There are rumours pounding through social media: there are outright deceptions. Fraudulent information is circulating. Whenever and wherever possible, the mainstream media needs to try to counter that misinformation and disinformation. The other thing we really need to do is to continue to ask questions, which is our job. Now, we can\u2019t be stunned into some sort of silence or timidity because the times are very serious... But what we need to very much desist from, in my view, is gratuitous reporting, grandstanding, and also seeking contention for its own sake. There\u2019s a lot of the 24-7 media cycle now where contention is baked into the business. Contention is basically the drum beat of modern news coverage. Now, we need to ask question, but we don\u2019t need to contention shop, for want of a better word. According to a survey of 1,723 people by the Australia Institute, 82.5% of respondents believe the government should guarantee two weeks of paid leave for all workers who are forced to self-isolate due to coronavirus. The paid leave proposal was put forward by the Australian Council of Trade Unions. The Australia Institute survey, conducted on Friday night, found that only 12.1% of respondents opposed or strongly opposed the proposal. Majority support for the proposal was seen across voters for all political parties. Ben Oquist, the executive director of the Australia Institute, said: It is in the community\u2019s best interest that no person should feel desperate enough to work while they have been ordered to self-isolate. A government guarantee of two weeks\u2019 paid leave to all workers in this situation will go a long way to ensuring self-isolation happens. Second Australian stimulus package to be announced today Prime minister Scott Morrison is expected to announce a $66.4bn dollar stimulus package today to support businesses and help those made unemployed keep afloat. It includes a $23.2bn measure to give 720,000 small enterprises \u2013 both small businesses and not-for-profits \u2013 cash payments equivalent to the tax withhold from their employees salaries. It also includes a new loan guarantee for small and medium enterprises, and additional income support measures. More details from political editor Katharine Murphy here. It is the second stimulus package announced by the Australian government and takes the total value of the economic stimulus to $189bn, which is equivalent to more than 9% of GDP Meanwhile the number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Australia has reached at least 1,071. From Tuesday, people entering the Northern Territory will be subject to a mandatory 14 days quarantine \u2014 similar to measures put in place in Hobart last week. In New South Wales, authorities are considering imposing tighter measures on cruise ships after the Ruby Princess cruise ship, which docked in Sydney, had four passengers who tested positive and recorded 158 instances of illness onboard \u2014 not confirmed to be coronavirus \u2014 before passengers were allowed to depart last week. And Timor-Leste is the latest country in south-east Asia to confirm its first case of Covid-19.

      "bodyText": "The police could use emergency powers to enforce rules on social distancing and reduce the further spread of coronavirus, the London mayor has said, amid concerns about mixed messages from central government on the issue. Following scenes of packed beaches and parks over the weekend, and worries that people fleeing cities for more remote parts of the UK could overwhelm less well-resourced local health services, Sadiq Khan urged people to stay at home if at all possible. \u201cMy message to all your viewers is simple: life has changed, we\u2019ve got to do things differently for a while now,\u201d he told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show. \u201cSocial interaction leads to the disease spreading, leads to people dying. Don\u2019t leave your home unless you really, really have to.\u201d London is considered to be several weeks ahead of the rest of the UK in the spread of coronavirus, and while public transport use has fallen sharply and pubs, clubs, restaurants and other venues were closed on Friday, this weekend people in the capital have flocked to parks, markets and other destinations. Asked whether such scenes could require police to enforce social distancing and lock down the city, as has taken place in Italy, Khan said an emergency coronavirus bill due to be considered by MPs on Monday would include such powers. \u201cBecause we face a public health emergency, because we face a social emergency, because we face an economic emergency, these measures are in that bill,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that the police are focused on the priorities that they\u2019ve got, dealing with violent crime and other issues, but clearly, if it is the case that people continue to act in a way that\u2019s leading to this disease spreading, then those sorts of things will have to be considered.\u201d Earlier the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, said new restrictions could not be ruled out. Asked on Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday show about the prospects of an Italian-style lockdown in the UK, he said: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to go down that route. We want to live in a free society where we can continue to go about our activities, whilst following the medical advice. But this isn\u2019t a game. This is very serious, and people need to follow that advice.\u201d There has been criticism of the message emerging from No 10, with Boris Johnson using one press conference to urge people not to see relatives on Mother\u2019s Day but saying he might try to see his own mother. In a subsequent message released for Mother\u2019s Day, the PM urged people to stay away, while the government announced plans to ask 1.5 million people in England most at risk from the virus due to health conditions to self-isolate for 12 weeks, with plans for food and medicines to be delivered to them. While not criticising the central government communications, Khan said he was keen to make sure there was \u201cno confusion or mixed messages\u201d, saying people should stay at home unless it was essential not to. Khan said he had lobbied the government to avoid any confusion on this. \u201cThis isn\u2019t advice, as far as I\u2019m concerned. These are instructions and these are rules we should obey to stop people dying.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m not somebody who says these things lightly, but I\u2019m quite clear: unless people stay at home, unless people stop using public transport unless it\u2019s essential, unless people stop interacting with each other, more people will die. These are extraordinary times.\u201d There are also concerns about the virus being spread by people fleeing from London and other cities to the coast or other destinations. On Sunday the leader of Plaid Cymru, Adam Price, wrote to the Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, demanding people be prevented from travelling to second homes or tourist accommodation such as caravan parks, lest they overwhelm local health services. Asked whether Londoners should be barred from travel elsewhere, Khan did not say so but urged people to think of the human cost of the virus spreading. \u201cThe numbers we\u2019re talking about, the 233 people who have died, they\u2019re not just numbers, they\u2019re people who have died, these are families who are grieving. That number is going to go higher, and quickly, unless we follow the advice.\u201d Speaking on the Sophy Ridge show, the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt, who now chairs the Commons health committee, said slowing the spread of the virus was vital to avoid the NHS being overwhelmed, as has happened with the Italian health system. \u201cI think it is a pretty well-prepared system,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the truth is, Italy is a well-funded health system, it\u2019s a well-respected healthcare system, and we\u2019ve seen the impact there a pandemic can have.

      "bodyText": "Schools will close in Victoria and the ACT on Tuesday, but apparently not in other states before the looming Easter break, while registered and licensed clubs, licensed premises in hotels and pubs, entertainment venues and cinemas, casinos and nightclubs will all close from midday on Monday, under new arrangements agreed between Scott Morrison and the premiers. After a meeting of the national cabinet on Sunday night, the prime minister insisted that schools needed to remain open, and he declared that all states, including Victoria, which has truncated the current term to allow a closure from Tuesday, would reopen for term two, subject to medical advice at that time. Morrison said parents who wanted to keep their children out of school would be permitted to do so \u201cto the end of this year\u2019s school term\u201d. But he issued a sharp warning to parents that they were responsible for keeping their children at home. \u201cThose children are staying at home, it is not an excuse for them to go down to the shopping centre or to go and congregate somewhere else or potentially put themselves in contact with the vulnerable and elderly population,\u201d the prime minister declared. \u201cIf you choose to keep your child at home, you are responsible for the conduct and behaviour of your children.\u201d After a fraught day, when the New South Wales and Victorian governments publicly signalled their intention to embark unilaterally on more draconian lockdowns and school closures ahead of Sunday night\u2019s leaders\u2019 meeting, Morrison emerged from the talks at 9pm with what he termed stage one of accelerated social distancing measures. As well as the closure of clubs and entertainment venues, such as cinemas, as of noon Monday, the prime minister said restaurants and cafes would be restricted to takeaway only, and churches and indoor sporting venues would be closed. Morrison said the restrictions would remain in place for months. Despite the obvious fracture during the day between himself and the premiers of Australia\u2019s two most populous states, Morrison declared the members of the national cabinet remained \u201cvery committed to its processes and its decisions\u201d. The ACT deputy chief minister, Yvette Berry, said on Twitter after Morrison\u2019s statement that the territory\u2019s plans to close its schools from Tuesday remained unchanged. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said in a statement earlier in the day she would have \u201cmore to say\u201d about schools on Monday morning. Morrison said more draconian measures needed to be pursued because the behaviour of the public over the weekend \u201csent a very clear message to premiers, chief ministers and myself that the social distancing practices are not being observed as well as they should be\u201d. Morrison said he was \u201cdeeply regretful that those workers and those business owners who will be impacted by this decision will suffer the economic hardship that undoubtably they will now have to face. That is a very, very regretful decision. But a necessary one in the view of the premiers and chief ministers and myself to ensure that we can control the spread of this virus.\u201d NSW and Victoria signalled their intention to accelerate social distancing controls early on Sunday, as Morrison was unveiling a new $66bn economic rescue package in Canberra, and ordering an end to all \u201cnon essential\u201d domestic travel to try to curb the virus spread. Shortly after the stimulus package was unveiled South Australia and WA also joined Tasmania and NT in announcing they would effectively close their borders this week to help deal with the unfolding crisis. NSW has been under pressure because of beachgoers at Bondi ignoring pleas to stay away, and because of a controversial decision to allow passengers to disembark from the cruise ship Ruby Princess \u2013 18 have now been found to be infected, NSW Health revealed on Sunday. The number of reported cases in Australia of the coronavirus is now more than 1,000, with significant increases in infection rates over recent days.

The RKI says those who were not tested for Covid-19 in their lifetime but are suspected to have been infected with the virus \u201ccan\u201d be tested after death, but in Germany\u2019s decentralised health system this is not yet a routine practice. As a result, it is theoretically possible that there could be people who may have died in their homes before being tested and who do not show up in the statistics. Practising medical specialists such as Addo do not believe this number of unreported cases to be statistically significant. \u201cI have yet to see any data that would suggest a large number of untested corona-related deaths that don\u2019t show up in the statistics,\u201d she said. \u201cClinics dealing with respiratory illnesses have been on high alert about the virus for weeks, so I would be very surprised if there was a significant figure of uncharted deaths.\u201d The RKI\u2019s official mortality figures include both people who have died of the virus as well as those infected and with underlying health problems, where the precise cause of death could not be determined.",

A non-profit way, as one restaurant operator put it to me \u2013 as he hurriedly tried to set up a delivery kitchen in a suburban rugby club \u2013 of generating some cashflow to cover staff wages and lay off as few people as possible. Nonetheless, the manner in which so many British food and drink businesses have reinvented themselves in the last week, as Friday\u2019s eventual formal shutdown became an inevitability, has been an incredible feat of energy and ingenuity. Bars and restaurants are now takeaways, bottle shops, delicatessens. Others are selling hampers, fresh meal-kits or offering cookery courses. In West Yorkshire, the Moorcock, previously known for envelope-pushing new-Nordic cuisine, is launching a wood-fired pizza and ice-cream takeaway. There is now a gin\u2019n\u2019beer drive-through in Salford, a sentence I\u2019ve been waiting all my life to write. In London, Cheese Bar\u2019s truck is delivering the ultimate in middle-class outreach: \u201cself-isolation survival kits\u201d of cheese and wine.

The country\u2019s real face of the coronavirus crisis, however, is Christian Drosten, the head of virology at Berlin\u2019s Charit\u00e9 hospital.</p> <p>As one of the scientists who discovered the infectious agents responsible for the Sars epidemic, Drosten has immaculate credentials. The curly haired 48-year-old also has a natural talent as a communicator that have led the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitungmade to describe him as \u201cthe nation\u2019s corona-explainer-in-chief\u201d.</p> <p>A daily half-hour podcast in which Drosten fields questions about the virus has attracted millions of listeners since he started it with the broadcaster NDR in mid-February. On social media, there have been joking calls for him to run for chancellor and riotous fan fiction: \u201cTouch my face, Christian Drosten.\u201d</p> <p>Drosten made his Sars research public via the internet before it was published in scientific journal, and he has favoured similar levels of transparency during the current crisis.</p> <p>He has been more pessimistic in his assessment of the risks than other virologists, suggesting up to 70% of the German population could catch the coronavirus. He has, however, also been more relaxed about what he sees as appropriate social responses, given the current level of spread in Germany.</p> <p>Last weekend he recommended Germans go for a walk and enjoy a good beer \u2013 although bottled beer was safer than draught, because the glass may not have been washed properly. <strong>Philip Oltermann</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3bedf12e9372e379610a3c0768631257697f1d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3bedf12e9372e379610a3c0768631257697f1d5/0_0_2000_1330/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Head of the Center for Coordination of Health Alerts and Emergencies (CCAES) Fernando Simon holding a press conference at the Moncloa Palace in Madrid, Spain, 18 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fernando Sim\u00f3n, the head of Spain\u2019s health emergency centre, gives a press conference in Madrid on 18 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jm Cuadrado Jimenez Handout/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Spain</h2> <p>For the second time in Spain\u2019s recent history, all eyes are on Fernando Sim\u00f3n. The lanky, unassuming epidemiologist stepped into the spotlight in 2014, after<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/06/nurse-spain-tests-positive-ebola\"> a nurse in Spain contracted Ebola</a> when a priest was repatriated to Madrid from Sierra Leone.</p> <p>The infection, the first outside Africa, put 15 people in quarantine and led to the monitoring of dozens more. As health officials scrambled to quell the spread of the deadly disease, Sim\u00f3n, who heads the country\u2019s health emergency centre, conveyed calm.</p> <p>As Covid-19 began its advance around the world in February, Sim\u00f3n stepped up again. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine the satisfaction that rippled through the press room when he entered,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20200307/473989540682/fernando-simon-centro-emergencias-sanitarias-coronavirus.html\">said a journalist with La Vanguardia</a> who praised his clear, concise explanations.</p> <p>Sim\u00f3n has since spoken to Spaniards nearly every day.

      "bodyText": "They are the faces of the crisis, the scientists explaining nightly to anxious audiences how the governments they advise plan to contain the coronavirus. Unknown to most a few short weeks ago, many have since become household names. But who are they? Germany When Angela Merkel talks to the nation about Covid-19, she is usually flanked by the head of the Robert Koch Institut, Germany\u2019s central public health institute. The country\u2019s real face of the coronavirus crisis, however, is Christian Drosten, the head of virology at Berlin\u2019s Charit\u00e9 hospital. As one of the scientists who discovered the infectious agents responsible for the Sars epidemic, Drosten has immaculate credentials. The curly haired 48-year-old also has a natural talent as a communicator that have led the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitungmade to describe him as \u201cthe nation\u2019s corona-explainer-in-chief\u201d. A daily half-hour podcast in which Drosten fields questions about the virus has attracted millions of listeners since he started it with the broadcaster NDR in mid-February. On social media, there have been joking calls for him to run for chancellor and riotous fan fiction: \u201cTouch my face, Christian Drosten.\u201d Drosten made his Sars research public via the internet before it was published in scientific journal, and he has favoured similar levels of transparency during the current crisis. He has been more pessimistic in his assessment of the risks than other virologists, suggesting up to 70% of the German population could catch the coronavirus. He has, however, also been more relaxed about what he sees as appropriate social responses, given the current level of spread in Germany. Last weekend he recommended Germans go for a walk and enjoy a good beer \u2013 although bottled beer was safer than draught, because the glass may not have been washed properly. Philip Oltermann Spain For the second time in Spain\u2019s recent history, all eyes are on Fernando Sim\u00f3n. The lanky, unassuming epidemiologist stepped into the spotlight in 2014, after a nurse in Spain contracted Ebola when a priest was repatriated to Madrid from Sierra Leone. The infection, the first outside Africa, put 15 people in quarantine and led to the monitoring of dozens more. As health officials scrambled to quell the spread of the deadly disease, Sim\u00f3n, who heads the country\u2019s health emergency centre, conveyed calm. As Covid-19 began its advance around the world in February, Sim\u00f3n stepped up again. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine the satisfaction that rippled through the press room when he entered,\u201d said a journalist with La Vanguardia who praised his clear, concise explanations. Sim\u00f3n has since spoken to Spaniards nearly every day. As Spain became the hardest-hit country in Europe after Italy, he has come to embody the toll the crisis is taking. Exhaustion lines on his face have deepened, his wavy hair has become ever more unruly and his rasping voice has almost given out. Spanish authorities have faced criticism for being slow to react, allowing tens of thousands to gather for International Women\u2019s Day rallies and pack into a Madrid football stadium a week before the country went into near-total lockdown, and there have been calls for Sim\u00f3n to resign. \u201cThe country is in intensive care and the doctor treating it has committed too many errors,\u201d one researcher wrote on Twitter. Others have defended Sim\u00f3n by highlighting the volatility of the virus and its spread. Ashifa Kassam US Tested by Donald Trump, who demands loyalty over facts, Anthony Fauci has earned praise from the US public for telling the truth about coronavirus, even when it means contradicting the president. As a member of the White House taskforce, Fauci has been unusually frank in his frequent news appearances and briefings. A senior figure in the government\u2019s research agency, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), he was applauded after he corrected the president about how quickly a coronavirus vaccine could be made available. Fauci, who has reported to six presidents, told Politico earlier this month: \u201cYou should never destroy your own credibility. And you don\u2019t want to go to war with a president ... But you got to walk the fine balance of making sure you continue to tell the truth.\u201d The Brooklyn-born doctor has been at the NIH since 1968, turning down repeated requests to lead the agency. In 1984, he was made head of its National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which researches infectious diseases such as HIV/Aids, tuberculosis and Ebola. Some of Fauci\u2019s most influential work contributed to the understanding of how HIV destroys the body\u2019s defences. In a 2019 analysis of Google Scholar citations, he was the 41st most highly cited researcher of all time. At 79, he is among those most vulnerable to developing severe coronavirus symptoms but is reportedly working 19-hour days. A dedicated runner, he told a Yahoo News reporter that he continues to run more than three miles a day. Amanda Holpuch The Netherlands The coronavirus has made the precise yet avuncular figure of Jaap van Dissel, the head of the Centre for Infectious Disease Control at the National Institute for Public Health, \u201cDutch doctor-in-chief\u201d, according to the NRC Handelsblad newspaper. During regular television appearances, his \u201ccalm authority lends credibility to the measures the government has adopted to slow the spread of the virus,\u201d the paper said, naming him its man of the week last week. A professor of internal medicine and infectious diseases at Leiden university medical centre, Van Dissel, 62, has also been a member of the Dutch health council\u2019s infectious diseases working group and vice-chair of the European Medicines Agency\u2019s anti-infectives scientific advisory group. White-haired and bearded, he is frequently called upon to explain why the Netherlands is adopting a resolutely different approach to containing the coronavirus more comparable with the UK\u2019s than many of its continental neighbours. He explained last week to the Nieuwsuur TV programme that the aim was for the virus to \u201ccirculate among people who will not have much problem with it, while simultaneously protecting vulnerable groups as far as possible\u201d. The objective was to flatten the infection curve and avoid the health system being overwhelmed, while also ensuring the virus did not \u201cbounce back\u201d in the future, he said \u2013 meaning 50% to 60% of the Netherlands\u2019 17.4 million people might need to catch it. The approach is far from universally accepted in the country, prompting some to call Van Dissel a \u201cmad scientist\u201d. Jon Henley Britain The British public may only just have discovered Chris Whitty as the calm, clear-headed expert at the helm of the nation\u2019s strategy to fend off coronavirus but he has long been regarded as a star in medical circles. A former epidemiologist, Whitty, 53, was professor of public and international health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) before being appointed chief medical officer in England and the UK government\u2019s chief medical adviser a few months ago. He spent much of his childhood in northern Nigeria. His father, who was shot dead in Athens when Whitty was a teenager in an apparent case of mistaken identity, worked for the British Council. Witty still speaks warmly of Nigeria, colleagues said. His time in Nigeria may have shaped a passion for global health. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation awarded him $40m (\u00a331m) in 2008 for malaria research in Africa. A year later, he was appointed chief scientific adviser to the Department for International Development (DFID). Whitty works hard. He puts in 16-hour days and has still found time to study a law degree and MBA in his spare time. He is also accustomed to the spotlight. He was acting chief scientific adviser to the government during the novichok poisonings in Salisbury in March 2018. \u201cHe\u2019s an absolutely extraordinary, brilliant man,\u201d said David Mabey, a fellow LSHTM professor. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t have a better person in charge.

All parties, including the opposition, have fully supported Italy\u2019s drastic quarantine measures, which have not, unfortunately, prevented Italy overtaking China as the centre of the largest outbreak. Angela Giuffrida Australia Brendan Murphy, Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, has become a fixture on the country\u2019s television screens, appearing alongside the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the health minister, Greg Hunt, at daily news briefings about the coronavirus. Murphy was supposed to step down from the role of principal medical adviser at the end of February and take up the role of health department secretary but as Covid-19 cases climbed and the first deaths from the disease in Australia were recorded at the beginning of March, he was asked to stay on until the crisis passes. A nephrologist, or kidney specialist, who has worked as a doctor, researcher and in health management for 40 years, he is accused by some of being unclear in his advice for managing the outbreak. This includes recommending that it was fine for people to continue to shake hands hours before Morrison told the country there were to be \u201cno more handshakes\u201d. There was also consternation when Murphy issued advice that the prime minister and cabinet did not need to self-isolate, despite having met the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, three days before he tested positive for the coronavirus. Dutton is believed to have contracted the virus while on a trip to the US, and those on his return flight, which occurred two days before the cabinet meeting, were asked to self-isolate. Kate Lyons",

      "body": "<p>Just over a week ago, our world looked very different from how it does today. The shift has been so rapid and frightening, it feels as if the ground beneath us has given way. It is disorienting, as if normal life is just over there, out of reach. I have been through two major bereavements, close together, and this has the same unanchored feeling of grief.</p> <p>The human brain is not wired to tolerate uncertainty, but it is wired to be alert to any threat. So, if you are feeling pandemic panic, it is only natural. Blame your brain. For most of us, life has never felt more uncertain, and uncertainty is, according to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/04/uncertainty-stressful-research-neuroscience\">a 2016 study by neuroscientists at University College London</a>, an even more stressful state to be in than actually knowing something bad will happen. It may explain \u2013 if you\u2019re young-ish and otherwise healthy \u2013 why you may be almost hoping to contract Covid-19, just to get out of that will I-won\u2019t I? mental tussle. Those of us who are older or more vulnerable don\u2019t have such a privilege.</p> <p>According to Robert Leahy, the director of the American Institute for Cognitive Therapy and author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-worry-cure-9780749927240.html\">The Worry Cure</a>, we are all locked in \u201can international human trauma, where everybody has a sense that their life, or the lives of people they love, is threatened\u201d. When we are anxious, he says: \u201cWe tend to equate uncertainty with the worst outcome. For example, after 9/11, I heard so many people say it\u2019s inevitable that there\u2019s going to be another major attack on New York City, or a nuclear attack by al-Qaida. That never happened. When we\u2019re anxious, we tend to treat the uncertainty as a bad outcome. But uncertainty is neutral \u2013 we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We want to be assured the way our world looks when we get up in the morning is the way it will look when we go to bed</p> <footer> <cite>Prof Daniel Freeman</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We can look to what has happened in other countries with understandable horror, but we can also hold on to the fact that measures such as testing, social distancing, quarantining and travel restrictions seem to have some effect, and that at some point, there will be potential treatments.

But the point is that at the moment, nobody really knows what is going to happen.</p> <p>Most of us crave stability. \u201cWe want predictability,\u201d says Daniel Freeman, a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Oxford. \u201cWe want to be assured that the way our world looks when we get up in the morning is the way it will look when we go to bed. And if change occurs, we prefer it to be on our terms.\u201d But sometimes life has other ideas.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to come to terms with such uncertainty,\u201d he says. After all, we already live with plenty of uncertainty and lack of control, even if it is on a much smaller scale, such as driving a car or being a passenger in one. \u201cWe have to accept that no action is 100% risk-free and that we can\u2019t totally control events, no matter how much we try. No matter how much we worry, we can\u2019t know what\u2019s in store for us. And we can\u2019t prevent problems happening just by worrying about them. In the end, it is best to concentrate on what is meaningful in our lives.\u201d</p> <p>As a lifelong catastrophiser, and despite knowing with hindsight that in every instance, my imagined worst-case scenarios didn\u2019t come true, my worry doesn\u2019t feel unwarranted at the moment. The question is: how helpful is it? Not very. \u201cWe know that this is a dangerous virus,\u201d says Natasha Page, a therapist and member of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy. \u201cBut are we catastrophising about some things? Are we trying to predict what the outcome is going to be? It can be helpful to think about what the best-case scenario could be as well. Anxiety can be a helpful emotion to have \u2013 it can help us to keep safe and do the right things \u2013 but fixating on the worst outcome is not a healthy thing to do.\u201d (Unless, of course, you\u2019re one of those in charge of stopping the spread.)</p> <p>Constantly checking the news may feel like a way of asserting control over events, says Freeman, but it can exacerbate anxiety. \u201cKnowledge is power. So make sure you get your information and advice from the very best sources. You\u2019ll also have to keep checking in to make sure your plan fits with the expert advice. There is an obvious temptation to seek out information all the time, but although this may be helpful as you first orientate yourself to what is going on, a moment comes when we need to put limits on it.\u201d</p> <p>He advises creating a plan in order to make it easier to deal with anxious thoughts so \u201cwe have formed our response and know what to do. A little time worrying isn\u2019t necessarily a problem, as it may alert us to modifications we need to make, but too much time spent worrying skews our thinking. We catastrophise when we worry, leading to less measured responses.\u201d Freeman suggests constraining worry to one or two set periods each day. \u201cWhen worry comes at other times, just note the thoughts down, then don\u2019t fight them but let them go. Notice the worry, acknowledge it, but don\u2019t let it distract you. Stay as calm as you can, focus on what you\u2019re doing and not what you\u2019re thinking, and watch the worry recede into the distance.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"970f953195c88ed52b19ccdd8e6fa193f4ec7e3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/970f953195c88ed52b19ccdd8e6fa193f4ec7e3f/0_29_5211_3127/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Try to be the person who calms a friend or partner down, and don\u2019t buy everything in the supermarket.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Try to be the person who calms a friend or partner down, and don\u2019t buy everything in the supermarket.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Greg Blatchford/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With understandable concerns about job security and how you will survive financially, \u201ctry to take as much control as you can over the situation,\u201d says Page. \u201cWe know there are things being set up in order to help people with mortgage or rent payments, and help for businesses.

With a pandemic, no one\u2019s imagining that future is going to be all sunshine and rainbows but at the same time we don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to pan out.\u201d When we\u2019re anxious, she says, we typically try to control more, but so much is now beyond our control. \u201cWe can only control what we are doing \u2013 staying at home for the sake of more vulnerable populations, if you\u2019re not already self-isolating because you are part of a more vulnerable population \u2013 not stockpiling. Be kind to yourself \u2013 anxiety is a normal reaction to have in a really unusual situation.\u201d</p> <p>Can you dare to think about the future? What if you had big plans that are now suddenly on hold \u2013 going to university, trying for a baby, moving house or changing career? Nobody can tell you what the best decisions for your life are right now, and it might be better to think no further ahead than a day or a week. \u201cDon\u2019t deny reality but remind yourself that this will pass, although we don\u2019t know when,\u201d says Cunningham. \u201cFor some people, being at home all of a sudden, there is time and space to think about what we want to do with our lives. A lot of people will be looking for more purpose and meaning. It might not be the best time to make big changes, but thinking about a happy future in which you\u2019re doing work that you love or you have the family you\u2019ve longed for will help. When we\u2019re stressed and creating cortisol, it perpetuates stress.\u201d Too much cortisol also compromises our immune systems. \u201cWhen we think happy thoughts \u2013 imagining the love we\u2019ll have for our future baby or the fulfilment we\u2019ll have in our future career,\u201d she says, \u201cwe might not only feel better, but we should also be boosting our immune function.\u201d</p> <p>Be aware that our emotional estimate of risk, says Leahy, \u201cis extremely high. What we tend to do when we\u2019re emotional is think about anecdotes, not probabilities. This is human nature \u2013 we\u2019re not evolved to calculate baselines and probabilities. So we think about stories and how they\u2019re related to us personally. The question is: what is the absolute probability that I\u2019m going to die from Covid-19?\u201d He believes someone is more likely to eventually die from cancer or heart disease. In China, which has a population of around 1.5 billion, at the time of writing 3,245 people have been killed by Covid-19 (and, Leahy points out, China has reported no new domestic transmissions). I\u2019m not sure how comforting this is, especially for those of us who are vulnerable \u2013 the virus still seems an unknown quantity, and we still don\u2019t know how much havoc it will wreak, how overwhelmed our healthcare system will get, or (if we do get a handle on it) when it will spring back again once the restrictions on our lives are lifted. So it comes back to building tolerance for uncertainty.</p> <p>\u201cThere are things you can do to boost your ability to cope in these uncertain times,\u201d says Freeman. \u201cOur lives are becoming much more restricted, so it is absolutely crucial that we have enough activities that we really want to do. Ideally these activities will be meaningful to us and build on our strengths. We need to think about new ways to connect with and support our friends, family and neighbours. In these times, our relationships with others become even more important.\u201d</p> <p>Anxiety is contagious, as <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306453014001243]showed\">a 2014 study by researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences</a> in Germany shows. \u201cEmpathetic stress\u201d increased as a result of witnessing someone else in distress, whether they were a loved one or a total stranger. When we see worrying on a global scale, it is not surprising that we will be affected. So try to be the person who calms a friend or partner down, and you should both benefit. Don\u2019t buy everything in the supermarket, don\u2019t go out with symptoms, check on your neighbours, help each other out \u2013 because <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/kindness-contagion/\">kindness</a> is contagious, too.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Just over a week ago, our world looked very different from how it does today. The shift has been so rapid and frightening, it feels as if the ground beneath us has given way. It is disorienting, as if normal life is just over there, out of reach. I have been through two major bereavements, close together, and this has the same unanchored feeling of grief. The human brain is not wired to tolerate uncertainty, but it is wired to be alert to any threat. So, if you are feeling pandemic panic, it is only natural. Blame your brain. For most of us, life has never felt more uncertain, and uncertainty is, according to a 2016 study by neuroscientists at University College London, an even more stressful state to be in than actually knowing something bad will happen. It may explain \u2013 if you\u2019re young-ish and otherwise healthy \u2013 why you may be almost hoping to contract Covid-19, just to get out of that will I-won\u2019t I? mental tussle. Those of us who are older or more vulnerable don\u2019t have such a privilege. According to Robert Leahy, the director of the American Institute for Cognitive Therapy and author of The Worry Cure, we are all locked in \u201can international human trauma, where everybody has a sense that their life, or the lives of people they love, is threatened\u201d. When we are anxious, he says: \u201cWe tend to equate uncertainty with the worst outcome. For example, after 9/11, I heard so many people say it\u2019s inevitable that there\u2019s going to be another major attack on New York City, or a nuclear attack by al-Qaida. That never happened.

With events such as the Premier League and Grand National cancelled, gambling companies are heavily promoting obscure sporting competitions, computer-generated \u201cvirtual\u201d sports and online casino games. An internal email sent by a senior manager at William Hill, seen by the Guardian, advises staff to \u201ctalk to your customers about what other things they can bet on \u2013 table tennis and Japanese baseball are proving very popular\u201d. The company has also posted social media adverts from its US Twitter account offering bets on \u201cinternational soccer action\u201d, meaning the Belarus Premier League. Firms including 32Red are advertising on Twitter in a bid to win more custom for online casino games, which have much higher rates of addiction than sports betting. Both Betway, recently hit with a record \u00a311.6m fine over problem gambling failures, and MansionBet have paid-for Google listings promoting \u201cvirtual\u201d events, where customers bet on computer-generated football matches. In one instance, a Spanish man who set up an international tournament for players of the Fifa computer game lashed out at bookmakers for offering odds on the games, urging them to stop. Gambling companies changed strategy after the cancellation of major sporting events, which has sent their share prices into freefall. In a letter to industry trade body the Betting &amp; Gaming Council, MPs in a cross-party group examining gambling-related harm urged firms not to put protection of their finances before customers\u2019 wellbeing. \u201cWe are deeply concerned that as we go deeper into this crisis, more and more people will turn to online gambling as a distraction,\u201d wrote Labour\u2019s Carolyn Harris, the Conservatives\u2019 Iain Duncan Smith and SNP MP Ronnie Cowan. \u201cIf the industry were to self-impose a daily limit of \u00a350 \u2026 it would be a clear demonstration that the industry is willing to act responsibly and do what they can to protect society and peoples\u2019 finances, at this dreadful time.\u201d The MPs also called for a block on customers opening multiple accounts and quicker intervention with customers who display signs of disordered gambling. Experts warned that people with a gambling disorder, many of whom will be cooped up at home during the coronavirus crisis, are prone to betting on events whose outcome they cannot possibly estimate. Matt Gaskell, clinical lead for the NHS northern gambling clinics, said: \u201cIn our clinics some of the most harmful gambling is that which diversifies to betting on things our patients know nothing about. \u201cThe industry continues to do all it can to increase profits, keep gamblers immersed and in continual play, at the expense of people\u2019s lives.\u201d Harris said: \u201cIf they\u2019re targeting someone to bet on this kind of sport, or computer-generated events, it can only be because that person is someone with a problem, to be gambling on something that obscure. \u201cIt\u2019s the industry trying to capitalise on a national disaster, encouraging problem gambling with reckless and foolhardy behaviour.\u201d Co-chair Duncan Smith added: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty appalling that in the midst of all this difficulty and suffering, gambling companies are so desperate to ensure that those who gamble can continue to throw their money away that they direct them to all sorts of little-known and little-watched sports.\u201d There has also been concern among industry employees that shops remained open for too long before they were eventually ordered to close by Boris Johnson. In the same email that offered advice on which sports to offer bets on, sent last week, William Hill staff were told it was \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d in the bookmakers\u2019 high street stores. The government had already advised against people gathering in social spaces such as bars and restaurants. Rival Betfred has also been criticised for continuing to welcome customers into shops, potentially putting staff and gamblers at risk. One Betfred employee, who asked to remain anonymous, said that staff had been told that they would get hand sanitiser but that it would not arrive for a while. \u201cThere were no gloves or nothing like that and we had to clean the shops and clear away the pens people use to write down bets. \u201cI was sitting in there and it was all older people coming in the shop, over-70s staying in there for ages, and it just seemed crazy. \u201cStaff were worried because they have nans and granddads and there are sick people in their families.

      "bodyText": "Frontline NHS staff are not getting the protective equipment they need to treat coronavirus patients, leaving them feeling like \u201ccannon fodder\u201d, a grassroots doctors\u2019 organisation has said. Healthcare workers in hospitals have been voicing frustration and fear over the lack of personal protective equipment, saying they are having to substitute the correct gear with items that are less effective \u2013 or even improvise with non-medical materials. Responding to staff concerns, Dr Rinesh Parmar, chair of the Doctors\u2019 Association, told BBC1\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show: \u201cWe have had doctors tell us they feel like lambs to the slaughter, that they feel like cannon fodder. GPs tell us that they feel absolutely abandoned. \u201cWe are all pleading with Boris Johnson that [the government] really look into arranging the vital personal protection equipment that all of us need on the NHS frontline. What our doctors are telling us is that although equipment is arriving, some of it is inadequate, some of it doesn\u2019t meet the World Health Organization guidance. That really doesn\u2019t fill frontline healthcare staff with the confidence that they need.\u201d Nurses in the Royal Free hospital in north London have been affixing clinical waste bags around their legs, the Guardian has been told, while at North Middlesex hospital they have been tying plastic aprons around their heads. One nurse, who did not wish to be named, said: \u201cWidespread nurses are making their own PPE. I know friends I trained with doing the same. We have to protect ourselves, some of us have children and babies. We are trying to help people but have to protect families. I don\u2019t know why we are not getting PPE.\u201d The lack of PPE raises the prospects of NHS staff falling ill \u2013 and potentially spreading Covid-19 \u2013 at a time of unprecedented demand, when attempts are being made to bolster the workforce. But there are also concerns that existing staff members who are unwell are not getting sufficient support or being tested. A nurse at a London trust said one of her colleagues was asking for help from her, having failed to get it elsewhere. \u201cOne of my colleagues was asking for help from me, to check if he can come to A&amp;E,\u201d she said. \u201cThe colleague\u2019s temperature is spiking at 40.3C [104.6F] \u2013 before, it never went below 38.6 [101.4F].

The investment arm, which says it aims to engage with polluters in an effort to change their behaviour, has pledged to divest from laggard companies by 2023. The C of E holds stakes in oil firms including Shell, BP and Exxon Mobil. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot resting on companies and we\u2019re hopeful that companies will rise to the challenge \u2026 and once the immediate crisis is over, we\u2019ll be ready to challenge companies, as appropriate, as well,\u201d Mason said.",

      "body": "<p>The outgoing BBC children\u2019s director has said YouTube and Netflix could not provide the same distinctive British children\u2019s programmes as those funded by the licence fee, as the corporation responds to the coronavirus outbreak by bringing forward the launch of a child-friendly version of iPlayer.</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian, Alice Webb defended the quality of the corporation\u2019s children\u2019s output in the face of threats to its funding package, suggesting British parents would miss high-quality children\u2019s shows if the broadcaster\u2019s budget was cut.</p> <p>On Friday, the BBC launched a new version of its iPlayer catchup service on smart TVs. This makes it easier for parents to find child-friendly content, by clicking on a monster shaped \u201cchildren\u201d button, which kids can then safely browse. The corporation is also preparing to unveil daily educational programming to fill the gap while schools are closed due to the pandemic.</p> <p>Webb, who has been the children\u2019s director for the past five years but is leaving the corporation this month, said the BBC had taken an active decision to keep much of its children\u2019s programming off YouTube because it was not a suitable platform. \u201cWe took the choice to not be fully on YouTube because we think it\u2019s not a platform that was designed for children. You\u2019re too close to things you wouldn\u2019t want your children engaging with it,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The BBC has struggled to secure other forms of television, such as big-budget dramas, which have been snapped up by Netflix. However, Webb said the corporation\u2019s commitment to directly funding 70% of its commission from British producers helped produce distinctive shows that parents could not find elsewhere. \u201cThere is a very bright future for public service children\u2019s broadcasting because it isn\u2019t Netflix or YouTube and it offers a distinctive and different alternative \u2026 The peril comes when we try to be them. We\u2019re not them and we don\u2019t try to be them.\u201d</p> <p>Highlighting the success of the CBBC documentary strand <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/shows/my-life\">My Life</a>, which explores the lives of children around the world, she said: \u201cChildren love variety, they love factual programmes that help them explain what\u2019s going on in the world. It\u2019s about having a real variety of quality content, stuff they can kick back and laugh at. Stuff that challenges them. Stuff that makes them really think.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/22/who-will-lead-bbc-tony-hall-bazalgette-davie-theatre-streaming-self-isolation\">Who will lead the BBC on the other side of the virus crisis? | Richard Brooks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There had been plans to end the afternoon broadcast of long-running children\u2019s programme Newsround and put the resources into online news coverage. This was due to the fact that many children were staying late for after-school clubs and not home when it was being shown. These plans have been put on hold as part of the mass mobilisation of BBC resources to inform the public about the risks of the coronavirus outbreak.</p> <p>While the CBeebies channel for very young children remains popular, the CBBC strand for older children has been affected by growing choice: \u201cBy the age of seven or eight they\u2019re taking independence but parents are having an increasing amount of influence. Parents tell us they really value the quality of what they produce, that it\u2019s British, that it shows other children like theirs, that it\u2019s not wall-to-wall cartoons.\u201d</p> <p>Webb also said while news outlets often covered changes to long-running children\u2019s shows such as Blue Peter, her job was to ensure the current generation were entertained and informed by such programmes: \u201cThe reality is that my audience isn\u2019t reading your paper. I wouldn\u2019t be doing my job if I let it become something in aspic in a museum. My job is to keep it amazing.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The outgoing BBC children\u2019s director has said YouTube and Netflix could not provide the same distinctive British children\u2019s programmes as those funded by the licence fee, as the corporation responds to the coronavirus outbreak by bringing forward the launch of a child-friendly version of iPlayer. In an interview with the Guardian, Alice Webb defended the quality of the corporation\u2019s children\u2019s output in the face of threats to its funding package, suggesting British parents would miss high-quality children\u2019s shows if the broadcaster\u2019s budget was cut. On Friday, the BBC launched a new version of its iPlayer catchup service on smart TVs. This makes it easier for parents to find child-friendly content, by clicking on a monster shaped \u201cchildren\u201d button, which kids can then safely browse. The corporation is also preparing to unveil daily educational programming to fill the gap while schools are closed due to the pandemic. Webb, who has been the children\u2019s director for the past five years but is leaving the corporation this month, said the BBC had taken an active decision to keep much of its children\u2019s programming off YouTube because it was not a suitable platform. \u201cWe took the choice to not be fully on YouTube because we think it\u2019s not a platform that was designed for children. You\u2019re too close to things you wouldn\u2019t want your children engaging with it,\u201d she said. The BBC has struggled to secure other forms of television, such as big-budget dramas, which have been snapped up by Netflix. However, Webb said the corporation\u2019s commitment to directly funding 70% of its commission from British producers helped produce distinctive shows that parents could not find elsewhere. \u201cThere is a very bright future for public service children\u2019s broadcasting because it isn\u2019t Netflix or YouTube and it offers a distinctive and different alternative \u2026 The peril comes when we try to be them. We\u2019re not them and we don\u2019t try to be them.\u201d Highlighting the success of the CBBC documentary strand My Life, which explores the lives of children around the world, she said: \u201cChildren love variety, they love factual programmes that help them explain what\u2019s going on in the world. It\u2019s about having a real variety of quality content, stuff they can kick back and laugh at. Stuff that challenges them. Stuff that makes them really think.\u201d There had been plans to end the afternoon broadcast of long-running children\u2019s programme Newsround and put the resources into online news coverage. This was due to the fact that many children were staying late for after-school clubs and not home when it was being shown. These plans have been put on hold as part of the mass mobilisation of BBC resources to inform the public about the risks of the coronavirus outbreak. While the CBeebies channel for very young children remains popular, the CBBC strand for older children has been affected by growing choice: \u201cBy the age of seven or eight they\u2019re taking independence but parents are having an increasing amount of influence. Parents tell us they really value the quality of what they produce, that it\u2019s British, that it shows other children like theirs, that it\u2019s not wall-to-wall cartoons.\u201d Webb also said while news outlets often covered changes to long-running children\u2019s shows such as Blue Peter, her job was to ensure the current generation were entertained and informed by such programmes: \u201cThe reality is that my audience isn\u2019t reading your paper. I wouldn\u2019t be doing my job if I let it become something in aspic in a museum. My job is to keep it amazing.\u201d",

A Jubilee Debt Campaign report said some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable nations were being hit by a double whammy of increasing debt interest bills and the tumbling price of oil and other raw materials. While central banks in the developed world have been slashing interest rates to soften the economic blow of the coronavirus, the campaign said that borrowing costs were rising sharply for poor countries. It said interest rates had spiked on average by 3.5 percentage points for low- and middle-income countries since the mid-February and that costs for new borrowing stood at 10%. At the same time, commodity prices have plunged, with the price of copper down by 21% since the start of 2020, oil 61% lower, and coffee falling by 15%. The Bloomberg commodity price index \u2013 which measures a basket of oil, metals and food prices \u2013 has dropped 27% since the start of the year and is now at its lowest level since 1986. Countries were also being hurt by a falling number of overseas visitors, with small island states being particularly badly hit because of their size and economic reliance on tourism. Tim Jones, policy head at Jubilee Debt Campaign said: \u201cUrgent action is needed to support poorer countries being hit by the economic impacts of coronavirus, including a complete moratorium on debt payments for those most affected. \u201cWhere economic shocks have pushed countries into debt crisis, the IMF needs to help restructure debt with previous lenders. Otherwise, its loans will just be used to pay off reckless lenders and maintain the debt crises. And the IMF itself needs to cancel debts owed to it by countries suffering the impact of the pandemic.\u201d The IMF had been flagging up how debt problems were affecting a greater number of low-income countries well before the Covid-19 pandemic broke out. In his budget earlier this month, Rishi Sunak said the UK would contributing \u00a3150m to the IMF\u2019s fund for cancelling debt payments for poor countries in response to pandemics. The IMF has not yet announced that any country will qualify for debt cancellation, but the JDC said there were examples of countries \u2013 such as copper-rich Zambia and oil-exporting Chad \u2013 facing severe problems. The leading ratings agencies have started to flag up the problems that Covid-19 will pose to Africa. Standard &amp; Poor said around half the 54 countries in the world\u2019s poorest continent had confirmed cases of the coronavirus and warned that Africa could find itself among the regions hardest hit. An S&amp;P report said African economies and the banking sector were particularly vulnerable to the spread of Covid-19 because of the region\u2019s weak public health systems and reliance on commodity exports, tourism, and remittances sent home from abroad. It also highlighted high levels of foreign debt and the low creditworthiness of most African countries. \u201cThe pronounced deterioration of financing conditions could hurt African countries with a high current account deficit and dependence on external capital flows for financing,\u201d said S&amp;P global ratings credit analyst Mohamed Damak.",

And it will,\u201d the resident of Sarasota, Florida, told NBC News. \u201cBut at what cost, at what expense?\u201d Newman urged people to lean on each other for support. \u201cYou have to be my crutch. I have to be yours. It\u2019s been that way through every crisis we\u2019ve had,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then we find, when we do look back, that is what got us through it.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Factory and high street store closures after the coronavirus outbreak will push the UK into a deep recession this year, a study of the economy has concluded. KPMG\u2019s latest quarterly economic outlook found the UK\u2019s national income (GDP) has already stalled as businesses shut their doors and consumers restrict their spending to food and other essential items. Looking ahead, the business consultancy said the economy will contract by 2.6% in 2020 if the government gets on top of the crisis over the coming weeks and slump by 5.4% if the pandemic persists through the summer. Yael Selfin, KPMG UK\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cThe Covid-19 pandemic is first and foremost a human crisis. But there will also be a very substantial negative impact on the global economy and the UK\u2019s economic performance this year and potentially next. Until we know how and when the Covid-19 outbreak will end, the scale of the negative economic impact will be difficult to quantify. \u201cHowever, it is now almost certain that the UK is slipping into its first significant downturn in over a decade,\u201d she said. On Friday, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said a new Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme would allow employers to apply to HMRC to cover 80% of the wages of staff they keep on up to a maximum \u00a32,500 a month. Economists said the bill to taxpayers for the government\u2019s unprecedented scheme could run to billions of pounds a month. The Resolution Foundation estimated claims made to cover 1 million employees would cost about \u00a34.2bn over the initial three-month period. Last week, the Bank of England stepped in to reduce business and consumer borrowing costs after a cut in Threadneedle Street\u2019s base rate of interest to a record-low 0.1%. In Scotland, a \u00a3350m support fund was announced to help those left struggling in the wake of the outbreak as part of Scottish government measures worth about \u00a31.9bn. Catherine Burnet, a senior partner at KPMG UK in Scotland, said: \u201cThe latest economic outlook data highlights the scale of the challenge facing businesses across Scotland. \u201cFiscal measures and immediate relief action from the Scottish and UK governments have gone some way to help mitigate some of the damage, but there\u2019s widespread acknowledgement that more action will be needed in the coming months to keep the economy moving.\u201d Over the weekend, pubs, clubs and restaurants were told to close by Boris Johnson unless they were selling takeaway food for home delivery. Shops, including Topshop, Urban Outfitters and Harrods, have closed, car factories have cancelled shifts or shut down completely, while airports are expected to be at a standstill this week. Selfin said the UK economy is expected to regain its previous level of output by the second half of 2021, assuming the public health measures put in place stem the rise in the number of cases. She added: \u201cWhile both governments and central banks have moved quickly to offer fiscal and monetary policy support to the global economy, more will be needed to shore up the economy in the short term, including measures to help the most vulnerable businesses and households, and prevent a deeper economic slump. \u201cThe impact of the pandemic will be far reaching. It is likely Covid-19 will result in a massive expansion in government debt and this could threaten to dislodge the government\u2019s original vision to \u2018level up\u2019 the UK economy, long after the pandemic is past \u2013 leaving the chancellor with a big challenge on his hands.\u201d",

It is not yet clear how Razafindranazy became infected with the virus, but Le Parisien reported that he had seen patients at a very beginning of the outbreak when precautions were not as strict. The Compi\u00e8gne hospital had to place several of its staff in quarantine after patients were not treated with proper precautions. Despite a controversy about a lack of protective masks for medical staff, V\u00e9ran said most who contracted the virus would be infected outside of their work. Protection for frontline staff was \u201cabsolutely indispensable\u201d, he said, but there had been several cases of doctors and nurses falling ill while equipped with masks. Razafindranazy\u2019s son said his father had returned from a holiday abroad \u201con top form\u201d at the end of February and fell ill at the beginning of March. \u201cHe came back from a shift exhausted and became ill very quickly,\u201d the son said. A colleague on the Compi\u00e8gne emergency ward said staff were upset but remained determined. \u201cThis is a really serious situation,\u201d the colleague told local media. \u201cWe did not ask to die. We accept our responsibilities, of course, but the public does not yet realise how serious the situation is.\u201d As the worst-affected French regions struggle to cope with a continuing rise in the number of coronavirus patients, hospitals in Germany and Switzerland this weekend began treating some of the most critically ill. Four teaching hospitals and an army hospital in the south-western German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg were taking 10 French patients requiring ventilation, and the state was checking with others for more spare beds in intensive care units, authorities said. The German regional states of Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland, as well as three Swiss cantons, also joined in the effort to care for French patients. Doctors in the eastern French cities of Mulhouse and Colmar have already said the healthcare system is at breaking point, prompting the French army to transfer six patients in critical condition to a military facility on Wednesday.",

I\u2019ve had many years to refine my lifestyle as a freelancer but other parents may now find themselves thrown into the same situation, without preparation or choice.</p> <p>If childcare centres close because of coronavirus, parents will have long, tiring days at home with their children. Playgroups and other social activities will be limited or non-existent, and parents may need to work from home.</p> <p>This is already a reality for some people, who have chosen to stop sending their children to daycare, or to limit their reliance on vulnerable grandparents for babysitting.</p> <p>So how can families adapt?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/the-family-lockdown-guide-how-to-emotionally-prepare-for-coronavirus-quarantine\">The family lockdown guide: how to emotionally prepare for coronavirus quarantine</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Amanda Abel, a paediatric psychologist in Melbourne, reminds parents: \u201cThis is not forever. While it is a very trying time, and the uncertainty around timeframes is proving unbearable for some, it can be really helpful to increase our sense of control as this is often how we manage our anxiety.\u201d</p> <h2>Solid blocks of time are precious</h2> <p>Abel\u2019s strategies for taking control include speaking to employers about expected working hours. An evening shift could be an option, or working in bursts so there is time to give children undivided attention.</p> <p>As a parent working from home, I am grateful my daughter still naps. Solid blocks of time are precious and should be used for work that requires deep focus. Not distractions like social media or television, and not housework. My daughter loves to fold laundry and cook dinner so we do these things together when she\u2019s awake.</p> <h2>\u201cChildren learn through play\u201d</h2> <p>My previous career as an early childhood teacher taught me that opportunities for play and learning are everywhere. Parents don\u2019t need expensive toys and structured activities to replicate an early learning program. In childcare centres, educators encourage children to discover what is interesting to them.</p> <p>I know about six different recipes for playdough but I haven\u2019t made any in months. My daughter prefers playing in my shoe cupboard. She made a \u201cdog\u201d by threading wooden beads on leftover Christmas ribbon. This is an activity she created herself that develops imagination and fine-motor skills.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/shortcuts/2020/mar/16/the-lockdown-larder-an-expert-guide-to-a-healthy-sustainable-store-cupboard\">The lockdown larder: an expert guide to a healthy, sustainable store cupboard</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Michelle Walsh, an early childhood trainer and consultant, says: \u201cChildren learn through play \u2026 whether it\u2019s playing with Barbie dolls or toy cars, playing imaginary games, dressing up or being a dog. It doesn\u2019t matter what they\u2019re playing. They are learning.\u201d</p> <p>Walsh suggests parents prepare their homes for play first thing in the morning. \u201cIt could just mean putting puzzles on the floor or setting up some playing cards or a clipboard for drawing. Then let the day flow.\u201d</p> <h2>Show children the passing of time</h2> <p>To guide behaviour positively, distraction is an excellent technique for babies and toddlers. Abel says: \u201cSet up some boxes with activities or materials in them that are relatively novel for the children \u2026 bring these out during important meeting times or for when you need to knuckle down and get some work done.\u201d</p> <p>Children closer to school age will have improved self-control and an understanding of boundaries and time. Abel suggests using a timer to show children the passing of time while you\u2019re working, or creating a visual schedule for the day. \u201cSet up some house rules with the kids so they know what the behavioural expectations are during this time.\u201d</p> <h2>Give them information they can process</h2> <p>After overhearing an adult conversation, my daughter said she was \u201csad because so many people were sick\u201d. Talking to young children about Covid-19 isn\u2019t easy but it cannot be avoided. Children are impacted by other people\u2019s fears and dramatic changes to their normal routines.</p> <p>Abel\u2019s primary message to parents is to ensure \u201ckids aren\u2019t getting information that is developmentally inappropriate for them. Only give them the type and amount of information that they can process at their age.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/18/is-there-a-more-emmy-worthy-childrens-show-than-bluey\">Is there a more Emmy-worthy children's show than Bluey?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cMost kids should really only know that there\u2019s a virus going around which is like the flu, and for most of us it won\u2019t be a big deal, but the community is working really hard to make sure that it doesn\u2019t spread too much.\u201d</p> <p>I try not to let external stresses stop me from being patient with my daughter but it isn\u2019t easy. I am much more tolerant of thrown toys and emotional meltdowns when there is toilet paper in my house. And now, more than ever, children need patience and support from the people they love.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the most helpful things parents can do is contain their own anxieties around the situation \u2026 because as parents, our anxiety gets transferred to our kids,\u201d Abel says.</p> <h2>When in doubt, turn to Bluey</h2> <p>One of the best things for my mental health is sitting on the floor, playing with my daughter. I prefer to do other things in my downtime and I don\u2019t always feel like it, trust me \u2013 but I know it benefits us both.</p> <p>\u201cI encourage eight minutes of play a day with your children,\u201d Walsh says. \u201cIt\u2019s just like a Bluey episode. For anyone who hasn\u2019t seen a Bluey episode, I encourage you to watch one and then choose to play with your children for eight minutes a day. It\u2019s not very long but it really enhances their learning.\u201d<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "On ordinary days, when people aren\u2019t talking about pandemics, I work from home while caring for my three-year-old daughter. I\u2019ve had many years to refine my lifestyle as a freelancer but other parents may now find themselves thrown into the same situation, without preparation or choice. If childcare centres close because of coronavirus, parents will have long, tiring days at home with their children. Playgroups and other social activities will be limited or non-existent, and parents may need to work from home. This is already a reality for some people, who have chosen to stop sending their children to daycare, or to limit their reliance on vulnerable grandparents for babysitting. So how can families adapt? Amanda Abel, a paediatric psychologist in Melbourne, reminds parents: \u201cThis is not forever. While it is a very trying time, and the uncertainty around timeframes is proving unbearable for some, it can be really helpful to increase our sense of control as this is often how we manage our anxiety.\u201d Solid blocks of time are precious Abel\u2019s strategies for taking control include speaking to employers about expected working hours. An evening shift could be an option, or working in bursts so there is time to give children undivided attention. As a parent working from home, I am grateful my daughter still naps. Solid blocks of time are precious and should be used for work that requires deep focus. Not distractions like social media or television, and not housework. My daughter loves to fold laundry and cook dinner so we do these things together when she\u2019s awake. \u201cChildren learn through play\u201d My previous career as an early childhood teacher taught me that opportunities for play and learning are everywhere. Parents don\u2019t need expensive toys and structured activities to replicate an early learning program. In childcare centres, educators encourage children to discover what is interesting to them. I know about six different recipes for playdough but I haven\u2019t made any in months. My daughter prefers playing in my shoe cupboard. She made a \u201cdog\u201d by threading wooden beads on leftover Christmas ribbon. This is an activity she created herself that develops imagination and fine-motor skills. Michelle Walsh, an early childhood trainer and consultant, says: \u201cChildren learn through play \u2026 whether it\u2019s playing with Barbie dolls or toy cars, playing imaginary games, dressing up or being a dog. It doesn\u2019t matter what they\u2019re playing. They are learning.\u201d Walsh suggests parents prepare their homes for play first thing in the morning. \u201cIt could just mean putting puzzles on the floor or setting up some playing cards or a clipboard for drawing. Then let the day flow.\u201d Show children the passing of time To guide behaviour positively, distraction is an excellent technique for babies and toddlers. Abel says: \u201cSet up some boxes with activities or materials in them that are relatively novel for the children \u2026 bring these out during important meeting times or for when you need to knuckle down and get some work done.\u201d Children closer to school age will have improved self-control and an understanding of boundaries and time. Abel suggests using a timer to show children the passing of time while you\u2019re working, or creating a visual schedule for the day. \u201cSet up some house rules with the kids so they know what the behavioural expectations are during this time.\u201d Give them information they can process After overhearing an adult conversation, my daughter said she was \u201csad because so many people were sick\u201d. Talking to young children about Covid-19 isn\u2019t easy but it cannot be avoided. Children are impacted by other people\u2019s fears and dramatic changes to their normal routines. Abel\u2019s primary message to parents is to ensure \u201ckids aren\u2019t getting information that is developmentally inappropriate for them. Only give them the type and amount of information that they can process at their age. \u201cMost kids should really only know that there\u2019s a virus going around which is like the flu, and for most of us it won\u2019t be a big deal, but the community is working really hard to make sure that it doesn\u2019t spread too much.\u201d I try not to let external stresses stop me from being patient with my daughter but it isn\u2019t easy. I am much more tolerant of thrown toys and emotional meltdowns when there is toilet paper in my house. And now, more than ever, children need patience and support from the people they love. \u201cOne of the most helpful things parents can do is contain their own anxieties around the situation \u2026 because as parents, our anxiety gets transferred to our kids,\u201d Abel says. When in doubt, turn to Bluey One of the best things for my mental health is sitting on the floor, playing with my daughter. I prefer to do other things in my downtime and I don\u2019t always feel like it, trust me \u2013 but I know it benefits us both. \u201cI encourage eight minutes of play a day with your children,\u201d Walsh says. \u201cIt\u2019s just like a Bluey episode. For anyone who hasn\u2019t seen a Bluey episode, I encourage you to watch one and then choose to play with your children for eight minutes a day. It\u2019s not very long but it really enhances their learning.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>In hindsight, music has always been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/donald-glover\">Donald Glover</a>\u2019s true calling. Before the sitcoms, the Star Wars movie, the Saturday Night Live hosting gigs, and the well-worn gifs of the performer walking horrified into a burning room with a stack of pizza boxes, you could find him on YouTube as a member of Derrick Comedy. The group\u2019s greatest sketch,<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY4kFSuMvKM\"> B-Boy Stance</a>, saw Glover play an ageing hip-hop pioneer who had his arms surgically attached to his back, ensuring he was forever pulling the iconic pose \u2013 it riffs on the distance between the New York acolytes who witnessed the birth of hip-hop and those who came to the music after it was commodified. Glover\u2019s understanding of American culture shines with diamond clarity; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/23/donald-glover-atlanta-robbin-season\">Atlanta, his comedy-drama</a> that goes deep into the city\u2019s rap scene, is the evolution of those ideas.</p> <p>Glover\u2019s early forays into rap were corny and forgettable. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/childish-gambino\">Childish Gambino</a> project felt like the side hustle of a talented kid eager to test every limit of his creativity \u2013 that the moniker was taken from an online Wu-Tang Clan name generator seemed to reflect how low it fell on his list of priorities. In 2016, the funk record <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/dec/01/childish-gambino-awaken-my-love-album-review-funk-donald-glover\">Awaken, My Love!</a> was an artistic breakthrough. Then came 2017\u2019s vicious This Is America and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/07/this-is-america-theories-donald-glover-satirical-video-childish-gambino\">a video that encapsulates the racial prejudice, police brutality and vicious gun lust</a> freezing the soul of the self-proclaimed greatest country in the world. The clip became a pop cultural juggernaut, anointing Glover as spokesman for the Black Lives Matter generation.</p> <p>3.15.20 is the glorious payoff of this musical evolution. Melding elements of industrial hip-hop, hard-edged funk and pulsing electronica, with occasional experimental breakdowns a la Pink Floyd, it is an ambitious album that can turn from hedonism to hope on a dime. And with its genre-hopping ethos, bold orchestral choices and pleasing tunefulness, it is the first truly boundary-pushing record of the 2020s, cementing its creator as a daring virtuoso. (The roll out of the record wasn\u2019t quite as well executed: songs temporarily began streaming on a continuous loop last Sunday via <a href=\"http://donaldgloverpresents.com/\">donaldgloverpresents.com</a> \u2013 and are once again \u2013 leaving fans to ponder whether it was a leak or part of an elaborate release strategy.)</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gezFLhUznSk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gezFLhUznSk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Donald Glover Presents: 3.15.20 \u2013 stream</figcaption> </figure>   <p>No song is quite as blunt as the societal sledgehammer that was This Is America because they don\u2019t have to be \u2013 Glover\u2019s sharp pen and outlandish concepts see him smartly examine topics such as freedom in the digital age, the nature of reality and the malignancy in the soul of his home nation.</p> <p>Take Algorhythm, which warns of the erosion of personal liberties as the algorithms that serve our information alter our minds. The corrosive psychological effect of phones has become catnip for songwriters in recent years but Glover brings his own perspective, using vocal effects to slide into the role of artificial intelligence while dropping biblical references.

      "bodyText": "In hindsight, music has always been Donald Glover\u2019s true calling. Before the sitcoms, the Star Wars movie, the Saturday Night Live hosting gigs, and the well-worn gifs of the performer walking horrified into a burning room with a stack of pizza boxes, you could find him on YouTube as a member of Derrick Comedy. The group\u2019s greatest sketch, B-Boy Stance, saw Glover play an ageing hip-hop pioneer who had his arms surgically attached to his back, ensuring he was forever pulling the iconic pose \u2013 it riffs on the distance between the New York acolytes who witnessed the birth of hip-hop and those who came to the music after it was commodified. Glover\u2019s understanding of American culture shines with diamond clarity; Atlanta, his comedy-drama that goes deep into the city\u2019s rap scene, is the evolution of those ideas. Glover\u2019s early forays into rap were corny and forgettable. The Childish Gambino project felt like the side hustle of a talented kid eager to test every limit of his creativity \u2013 that the moniker was taken from an online Wu-Tang Clan name generator seemed to reflect how low it fell on his list of priorities. In 2016, the funk record Awaken, My Love! was an artistic breakthrough. Then came 2017\u2019s vicious This Is America and a video that encapsulates the racial prejudice, police brutality and vicious gun lust freezing the soul of the self-proclaimed greatest country in the world. The clip became a pop cultural juggernaut, anointing Glover as spokesman for the Black Lives Matter generation. 3.15.20 is the glorious payoff of this musical evolution. Melding elements of industrial hip-hop, hard-edged funk and pulsing electronica, with occasional experimental breakdowns a la Pink Floyd, it is an ambitious album that can turn from hedonism to hope on a dime. And with its genre-hopping ethos, bold orchestral choices and pleasing tunefulness, it is the first truly boundary-pushing record of the 2020s, cementing its creator as a daring virtuoso. (The roll out of the record wasn\u2019t quite as well executed: songs temporarily began streaming on a continuous loop last Sunday via donaldgloverpresents.com \u2013 and are once again \u2013 leaving fans to ponder whether it was a leak or part of an elaborate release strategy.) No song is quite as blunt as the societal sledgehammer that was This Is America because they don\u2019t have to be \u2013 Glover\u2019s sharp pen and outlandish concepts see him smartly examine topics such as freedom in the digital age, the nature of reality and the malignancy in the soul of his home nation. Take Algorhythm, which warns of the erosion of personal liberties as the algorithms that serve our information alter our minds. The corrosive psychological effect of phones has become catnip for songwriters in recent years but Glover brings his own perspective, using vocal effects to slide into the role of artificial intelligence while dropping biblical references. Elsewhere, he buries his voice so deep in effects at moments that it is near-impossible to make out his words \u2013 see 32.22, a bruising rap song that shares DNA with Kanye West\u2019s Black Skinhead. The effect alludes to the disappearance of his soul into a digital vortex, inviting listeners to determine what is and is not real. The most direct probing comes on the Ariana Grande-assisted Time, as Glover \u2013 sounding half flower child, half crystal gazer \u2013 questions whether the world is \u201cexactly what it seems\u201d. With a melody reminiscent of forgotten single Cry, there\u2019s even a touch of Michael Jackson to the sweeping anthem. It\u2019s not difficult to picture MJ, arms stretched out in a Christ-like stance, singing lines such as: \u201cSeven billion people trying to free themselves / Said a billion prayers trying to save myself.\u201d Not that you ever would have caught Jackson over these psych-tinted guitar strums and eccentric, retro-futuristic drum machines. The gentle funk of 47.48 evokes memories of Stevie Wonder as Glover explores the devastating effect violence has on childhood innocence. There are moments of levity, though.

As they became immersed in email and the nascent worldwide web, it was rumoured that the most modern people were increasingly removed from even their friends and families \u2013 something crystallised in Douglas Coupland\u2019s 1995 novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1995/nov/10/fiction.douglascoupland\">Microserfs</a>, which moves from Microsoft\u2019s HQ near Seattle to Silicon Valley.</p> <p>Midway through the book comes an angst-ridden email written by one of the key characters. \u201cSo many people no longer have lives that you raeally [sic] have to wonder if some new mode of existence is being created which is going to become so huge that it is no longer on the moral scale \u2013 simply the way people ARE,\u201d he says. \u201cI only need 2 hours of people a day.

There is grim symbolism in the fact that \u201cFaceTime\u201d eventually lost its original meaning, and became the name of the video-phoning app launched by Apple in 2010 \u2013 ironically enough, a mere approximation of face time in its original sense.

But life is never without contradictions and ambivalences, and we all know the positive things Facebook can facilitate, arguably as never before. The Covid-19 moment demands a means of bringing people together while they largely stay in their homes, and ensuring that whatever limited time they can spend in the real world is used as constructively as possible. Given that 2.5 billion human beings have Facebook accounts, the solution has arrived as a matter of inevitability.</p> <p>Facebook\u2019s PR people are keen to big up its new <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/facebook-coronavirus-information-center-zuckerberg/\">\u201cinformation centre\u201d</a> that puts reliable material about the virus at the top of people\u2019s news feeds.

It was founded in 2014, with the intention of bringing together a small university city, and \u201cbridging the gap between the student population and the resident population \u2013 getting over this kind of clash of worlds\u201d. The group now has 37,000 members. \u201cIt\u2019s had a massive impact on the whole way the city learns and communicates about news, and what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The group has now spawned a Facebook offshoot called Canterbury Coronavirus Assistance, which has gained more than 1,000 members in a week. In the immediate moment, Withers told me, lots of people were volunteering to run errands and check in on others. \u201cBut there will still be people who are self-isolating in six months\u2019 time. Things might calm down, but there will still be really vulnerable people feeling the effects of all this.\u201d He emphasised how important it is that these assistance networks operate safely: \u201cIt\u2019s not about going in gung-ho and introducing stranger A to vulnerable person B.\u201d With that in mind, he and his colleagues are linking people to already-existing local charities and community organisations.

It is one of the most remarkable sociological aspects of this crisis that as so many of life\u2019s fundamentals fall away, this is the one kind of human interaction that will be strengthened. And yes, there is a cruelty in the fact that as so many large and small businesses hit the wall, Facebook and the other titans of big tech will probably emerge from this crisis even more powerful. This issue was pre-emptively answered by Facebook\u2019s decision <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-investing-100-million-in-small-businesses-hit-by-coronavirus/\">to use a $100m fund to help small business in 30 different countries</a>; but the problem will still likely flare up again as the economic crisis triggered by the virus deepens.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/16/community-aid-groups-set-up-across-uk-amid-coronavirus-crisis\">Community aid groups set up across UK amid coronavirus crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In early 2017, amid the first stirrings of a conversation about Facebook\u2019s mismatch of power and responsibility that would go nuclear later that year, Mark Zuckerberg began to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/building-global-community/10103508221158471/\">zero in on the theme of community</a>.

      "bodyText": "How clever of Hilary Mantel to write a 900-page novel to help us through the end times. How stupid of me to fall asleep in the bath while reading it. Maybe you\u2019re in the same predicament. While we wait for our copies to dry in the proverbial airing cupboard, here are some other ideas to stop you becoming, during this testing period, what the Russians call ni kulturni (uncultured yahoos). An opera epic New York\u2019s Metropolitan Opera is streaming, free, an opera a night until they run out of material or humanity is reduced to feasting on its own brains, whichever happens first. From Monday until Sunday 29 March, it\u2019s Wagner week \u2013 incluing, from Tuesday to Friday, the whole Der Ring Des Nibelungen tetralogy from the Met\u2019s 2010 to 2012 productions, starring Wendy Bryn Harmer, Deborah Voigt, Eva-Maria Westbroek, Stephanie Blythe, Jonas Kaufmann, Bryn Terfel and Hans-Peter K\u00f6nig. At home with Neil Young If, like me, you yearn to know how self-isolating star Neil Young is holding up at this difficult time, you won\u2019t have to wait too long. On his elegant website, the NYA Times-Contrarian, Young promises that soon he will be streaming from his fireside. It will be \u201ca down-home production, a few songs, a little time together\u201d. He will be flanked by sleeping dogs and filmed by his wife, Daryl Hannah, as he tears into Cortez the Killer. Kusama from your sofa Art Basel just opened its Online Viewing Rooms offering publicly accessible, timed, online exhibitions from 233 participating galleries. Works you can experience, albeit virtually, include a Yayoi Kusama infinity mirrored room, Life Shines On (2019), and Philippe Parreno\u2019s My Room Is Another Fish Bowl (2016), an installation of 150 fish-shaped Mylar balloons that float gently through a glass-enclosed pavilion in response to human interaction and atmospheric changes. A Game of Thrones star treads the boards While we\u2019re self-isolating, Hampstead theatre is very astutely streaming on Instagram its 2018 production of I and You, whose protagonist, Caroline, is housebound through illness and reliant on social media and the internet. Played by Game of Thrones\u2019 sword-wielding star Maisie Williams, Caroline\u2019s story speaks to me and perhaps you: she\u2019s mad at the world and loves only her cat, ice-cream and glitter. Her solitude is rudely interrupted by classmate Anthony (Zach Wyatt) who invites himself in and, as Michael Billington put it in his review, \u201cbreaks through her defences with the aid of Whitman\u2019s Leaves of Grass\u201d. Which never worked for me. Online laughs Sophie Duker is not only host of the Wacky Racists comedy club but also a black pansexual living in post-Brexit Britain, a comic whose managers reckon she tells jokes \u201cwith the confidence of a cis straight middle-class white man\u201d. Sadly, her live shows this spring have been nixed. So, instead, we must bask in her wonderfulness online. Try some of her best bits, such as The Funny Thing About Privilege or I Accidentally Put Chilli in My Vagina. Crowdsourced improv After their sell-out run of Showstoper! at the Lyric theatre in London\u2019s West End was cancelled last week, the Olivier Award-winning improv group the Showstoppers decided to stream a show on Facebook Live. Facebook, Twitter and Instagram users suggested possible settings and plot twists. The result was \u2013 for one night only \u2013 a 45-minute Scottish musical called Haggis! (their exclamation mark) performed in an empty theatre. Watch it online now. It\u2019s very silly and will cheer you up. Titian does social distancing In one of art\u2019s earliest depictions of social distancing, Titian\u2019s Noli Me Tangere (1514), the resurrected Jesus swerves the outstretched hands of Mary Magdalen even though, quite possibly, she has just washed them for 20 seconds. Paralleling Jesus, who did not want his followers to cling to his physical presence, the closed National Gallery in London has ascended into cyberspace by means of a Google virtual tour. Many of its masterpieces \u2013 including works by Titian, Veronese and Holbein \u2013 can now be enjoyed in perfect self-isolation. Yungblud\u2019s culinary concert Yungblud, the 22-year-old Doncaster rock star (real name Dominic Richard Harrison), has been forced to cancel live gigs because of the coronavirus pandemic, but that won\u2019t stop him getting his music to his fans. \u201cGet on your bed, your kitchen table, your couch \u2013 and jump!,\u201d he shouts from an eerily empty theatre during his new online gig before his band kick into another raucous ditty. Welcome to The Yungblud Show, a live-streamed gig that also features likable oddball rock\u2019n\u2019roll approximations of Saturday Morning Kitchen such as Yungblud swigging vodka from the bottle before testing a Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheetos pancake. \u201cLet me see your hands in the air! In your bedroom!,\u201d he exhorts his virtual followers. How does he see those hands? I\u2019ve no idea. It\u2019s rock\u2019n\u2019roll, just not as we knew it. Matthew Kelly takes on Alan Bennett Eastbourne\u2019s loss is the world\u2019s gain. The Original Theatre Company\u2019s production of Alan Bennett\u2019s The Habit of Art, starring Matthew Kelly as WH Auden and David Yelland as Benjamin Britten, was due to start a tour at the Devonshire Park theatre last week. After the theatre was closed, the cast filmed a performance that will soon be available online. The production was given fives stars by the Observer in 2017, with critic Clare Brennan arguing: \u201cThe result is a take on life, sexuality, death and everything, that is witty, moving, laugh-aloud funny and understatedly profound.\u201d Which is more than you can say for The Grand Tour. Celestial sounds The superb Celeste\u2019s British tour has been cancelled because of the pandemic. But there are compensations. She has created a live-streamed gig from what looks like her bedroom. Celeste (full name Celeste Epiphany Waite) is the BBC\u2019s Sound of 2020 winner and the soul singer behind such quietly devastating songs as Strange, Father\u2019s Son and Coco Blood. The impromptu gig on Instagram is part of the World Health Organisation\u2019s Together, At Home virtual concert series that also features John Legend, One Direction\u2019s Niall Horan and Coldplay\u2019s Chris Martin. Mark Thomas\u2019s fundraising comedy Is laughter the best medicine right now? No, medicine is the best medicine. But comedy can help. Comedian Mark Thomas is offering online access to a live virtual gig to fundraise for food banks. To see his show, called Check Up: Our NHS at 70, you make a donation to the the Trussell Trust \u2013 a charity that runs a network of 12 food banks. Once you\u2019ve done so, you will be able to download the final performance of the show, which Thomas performed in Wakefield, along with interviews he did with NHS workers. The premise was that the approximate UK national average life expectancy is 84. So, if Thomas makes it to 84, the NHS will be 100 \u2013 but which will be in the better shape? The question prompted Thomas to go on a journey through the NHS, witnessing stomach surgery and visiting renal units and dementia care before reflecting on his own and socialised medicine\u2019s mortality. But, you know, with laughs. New films from your sofa As long as you\u2019re prepared to pay \u00a315.99 to Amazon for the privilege for each film, you can now watch a few recent cinema releases at home. Jeff Bezos\u2019s drones call this service their \u201cearly access\u201d facility. Movies available include the latest big-screen adaptation of Jane Austen\u2019s Emma, and Hilary Swank in The Hunt, which the Observer\u2019s critic Simran Hans found to be a silly satire sending up \u201csmug, bourgeois liberals complaining about climate change, all the while humanising their gun-toting conservative counterparts\u201d. Most promising of these releases is The Invisible Man in which Cecilia (Elisabeth Moss) is pursued by her invisible, abusive ex. As Hans pus it in her four-star review, this take on HG Wells\u2019s story has a Hitchockian twist and reveals \u201cthe way women\u2019s concerns are so often rendered invisible\u201d. The Beeb\u2019s quarantine culture The BBC is launching a service called Culture in Quarantine, by means of which shows including Emma Rice\u2019s Wise Children, which was first shown at the Old Vic, and Mike Bartlett\u2019s Albion \u2013 filmed at the Almeida \u2013 will be broadcast. The idea is that, while theatres are closed, \u201cnew theatre and dance performances will join with modern classics to create a repertory theatre of broadcast\u201d, according to BBC arts director Jonty Claypole. The launch date for this service is yet to be disclosed. Have the Sistine Chapel ceiling to yourself One of the great pleasures of virtual art tours is that not only do you save on air fare, entrance fees and queuing time, but you can explore empty galleries in your own time without getting elbowed or having your backpack checked by security. One of the best such tours is the Vatican Museums\u2019. Swivel upwards in the Sistine Chapel to see Michelangelo\u2019s Adam and Eve being shown out of the Garden of Eden in shame. Then head over to the Raphael Rooms. Not another soul in sight. Bliss. Coronavirus theatre club The Coronavirus Theatre Club goes live on 29 March. It comprises Samantha Neale, Brian Lonsdale and Michael Blair, a group of actors from north-east England who are trying to create work during the epidemic by linking up actors with writers to live-stream monologues and short scenes. Fingers crossed, the results will be terrific. Learn ballet with Tamara Rojo Roll up the rug, kick off your shoes, push the furniture against the wall and try not to pirouette into the dog or smack your dance partner in the face with a flailing arm. The fabulous Tamara Rojo, artistic director of the English National Ballet, as well as a lead principal dancer. is offering streamed ballet classes on Facebook. The safe money says she\u2019ll not only be getting quarantined Brits en pointe and fitter than ever, but also making her Dennis the Menace-style red-and-black-striped legwarmers must-haves this season. Biss v Beethoven Jonathan Biss plays Beethoven\u2019s last three piano sonatas from the empty concert hall of the 92nd Street Y in New York on 26 March. I\u2019m looking forward to Op 111 as a whole, but especially the boogie woogie moments that pre-dated Jools Holland by the best part of two centuries. Phillipson\u2019s cherry on top Heather Phillipson has spent the past couple of years working on her sculpture for the fourth plinth in London\u2019s Trafalgar Square, only to have this month\u2019s unveiling postponed. Bask in her multimedia work in another way, starting with Almost Gone on BBC Sounds, billed as a \u201ca deranged sonic landscape, addressing the Earth as an eruption, on the verge of termination\u201d. It\u2019s the perfect soundtrack to our times. Then try her poetry, say, Relational Epistemology and virtually tour her recent Age of Love installation at the Baltic in Gateshead. By the time you\u2019ve got through that lot, it\u2019ll probably be time to come out of our bunkers, wander down to Trafalgar Square and see what she has in store for us on the fourth plinth. Appropriately, it\u2019s called The End.",

An industry source said that confirmed assistance, such as deferral of some charges, were \u201cpeanuts rather than the big bazooka\u201d.</p> <p>The pilots union Balpa warned that more airline staff would also be made redundant before special measures could be implemented, and accused the government of \u201cstill sitting on its hands while airlines are shutting down\u201d.</p> <p>General secretary Brian Strutton said: \u201cAirlines can\u2019t survive with no revenue coming in and are already cutting wages and jobs. State investment in UK airlines, as other countries are doing, is essential as a matter of urgency before it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p> <p>It is understood measures being considered by the Treasury include the government taking a direct stake in carriers, but discussions, which have been ongoing since last Tuesday, are not expected to reach a conclusion until at least the middle of this week.</p> <p>While airports have presented a united front in calls for assistance, government intervention in airlines is more complicated. Although British Airways has warned its staff that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/13/ba-says-jobs-will-go-as-airline-industry-faces-crisis-worse-than-9-11-coronavirus\">its survival is at risk</a>, its owner IAG has distanced itself from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/uk-airlines-call-for-multibillion-bailout-to-survive-covid-19-crisis\">calls for state assistance</a> led last week by its smaller rival, Sir Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Atlantic. IAG\u2019s chief executive Willie Walsh has long argued that the European industry needs to consolidate, even in far rosier economic times.</p> <p>Potential government aid announced in January to help Flybe, before the coronavirus outbreak pushed the partly Virgin-owned regional airline into bankruptcy, was swiftly challenged by IAG and Ryanair.</p> <p>EasyJet, which was until now the biggest carrier by passenger numbers in the UK, said: \u201cWe fully support and welcome the government\u2019s commitment to support airlines during these unprecedented times. Our focus is on measures to help with short term liquidity and protect jobs, but we can\u2019t comment on the finances of other airlines or what action they might require.\u201d</p> <p>Although EasyJet has insisted it only seeks a loan on commercial terms, the airline is going ahead with a dividend payout which will hand around \u00a360m to its largest shareholder, Stelios Haji-Ioannaou, alone.

      "bodyText": "Airlines and airports have warned that time is running out for the government to enact promised measures to help the aviation industry, with EasyJet and Ryanair set to stop flying after Monday and less than 5% of normal passenger numbers expected at major airports. Further talks are expected between ministers and the industry on Monday as the government wrestles with how to keep critical infrastructure functioning. Although work is understood to have continued over the weekend, there is frustration in the industry at the time elapsed without any concrete detail, even after the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, made a second major intervention in three days on Friday evening. Karen Dee, chief executive of the Airport Operators Association, said measures to support employers through the pandemic were welcome, but the industry had been holding off taking drastic steps pending promised special state support. She said: \u201cWhile government has been receptive, it has not led to clear next steps and airports will now face making extremely difficult decisions.\u201d The process of laying off hundreds of staff has now started at airports, including Edinburgh. An industry source said that confirmed assistance, such as deferral of some charges, were \u201cpeanuts rather than the big bazooka\u201d. The pilots union Balpa warned that more airline staff would also be made redundant before special measures could be implemented, and accused the government of \u201cstill sitting on its hands while airlines are shutting down\u201d. General secretary Brian Strutton said: \u201cAirlines can\u2019t survive with no revenue coming in and are already cutting wages and jobs. State investment in UK airlines, as other countries are doing, is essential as a matter of urgency before it\u2019s too late.\u201d It is understood measures being considered by the Treasury include the government taking a direct stake in carriers, but discussions, which have been ongoing since last Tuesday, are not expected to reach a conclusion until at least the middle of this week. While airports have presented a united front in calls for assistance, government intervention in airlines is more complicated. Although British Airways has warned its staff that its survival is at risk, its owner IAG has distanced itself from calls for state assistance led last week by its smaller rival, Sir Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Atlantic. IAG\u2019s chief executive Willie Walsh has long argued that the European industry needs to consolidate, even in far rosier economic times. Potential government aid announced in January to help Flybe, before the coronavirus outbreak pushed the partly Virgin-owned regional airline into bankruptcy, was swiftly challenged by IAG and Ryanair. EasyJet, which was until now the biggest carrier by passenger numbers in the UK, said: \u201cWe fully support and welcome the government\u2019s commitment to support airlines during these unprecedented times. Our focus is on measures to help with short term liquidity and protect jobs, but we can\u2019t comment on the finances of other airlines or what action they might require.\u201d Although EasyJet has insisted it only seeks a loan on commercial terms, the airline is going ahead with a dividend payout which will hand around \u00a360m to its largest shareholder, Stelios Haji-Ioannaou, alone. The airline said it was legally obliged to make the payout. The Department for Transport said: \u201cA number of measures to support the aviation sector have already been announced, including Time to Pay, financial support for employees and the Bank of England\u2019s Covid corporate financing facility . The government is working urgently to develop further measures, as necessary.\u201d The chancellor\u2019s emergency package of support announced on Friday evening, which contained the extraordinary pledge to pay up to 80% of workers\u2019 salary during the crisis, has also yet to address if and how Britain\u2019s 5.2 million self-employed will be supported. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said sole traders had felt little reassurance from the measures that helped larger firms. BCC director general Dr Adam Marshall said: \u201cWhile we understand the complexity involved, there are 5 million self-employed people who need help similar in scale and scope to that put in place for larger firms in recent days.\u201d Unions also urged the government to ensure its wage support scheme did not omit around 1 million building workers considered to be trapped in \u201cbogus self-employment\u201d. Unite said the workers are taxed at source and then claim expenses as self-employed workers, under construction industry payroll schemes that largely benefit the actual employers.",

Foulis, a hairdresser from Dunfermline, recreated a scene from her favourite film, Love Actually, as she surprised her 83-year-old mother in Edinburgh on Sunday. To the tune of Wet Wet Wet\u2019s Love Is All Around, Foulis spelled out a moving message to her mother, Helen Murphy, by holding up a series of cards at the end of her driveway. \u201cWe all wish we could give you a hug and a kiss \u2026 But due to the virus, we will just give that a miss,\u201d the message read. \u201cSorry we aren\u2019t out eating, drinking and having fun \u2026 but hopefully by next year this will all be over and done.\u201d A video taken by Foulis\u2019s daughter Lily had been viewed thousands of times within a couple of hours of being posted on Sunday afternoon. Foulis said she had wanted to do something special for her parents who are self-isolating and worried about the coronavirus. She said of her mother: \u201cShe was very emotional. I usually see her every week but obviously I\u2019ve not seen her for about a fortnight now [because of the virus]. She wasn\u2019t expecting us at all. \u201cI was trying not to cry because I knew it was being videoed and I thought if I start I\u2019ll set my mum off. She was getting emotional anyway. I was biting my cheeks. \u201cI just feel for my mum and dad. They\u2019re getting older now and with all this stuff that\u2019s going on \u2013 my mum\u2019s really worried about everything anyway, so I just thought it would cheer her up a little bit. I don\u2019t know if it did or whether it made her worse.\u201d Foulis said she had been told on Saturday that the barbers where she works was closing due to the virus, and when she spoke to the Guardian she was on her way to submit her CV to supermarkets for a part-time job. As the UK faced its first weekend behind closed doors, many turned to video-calling apps such as FaceTime, Houseparty and Zoom to mark Mother\u2019s Day or to share a Saturday night in. The celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay shared a video message to his mother as part of ITV\u2019s Britain Get Talking mental health campaign, which has relaunched in response to the outbreak. He said: \u201cI know it has been a dramatic week for everyone in the country but social distance, yes, is important, but even more important is social communication \u2013 talking. \u201cI promise you we are going to get through this and come out the other side even stronger. Please don\u2019t overcook that beef. I love you. Take care.\u201d",

Brazil has recorded 1,128 coronavirus cases and 18 deaths, with the country\u2019s health minister last week saying the public health system was likely to collapse by the end of April. But Bolsonaro has continued to downplay the pandemic, despite more than 20 members of a delegation he recently led to the US becoming infected with Covid-19. In an interview on Saturday, he criticised efforts to contain the virus through large-scale quarantines or shutdowns and described the governors of states including Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo as \u201cirresponsible\u201d, saying they were creating a \u201cclimate of terror\u201d by doing so. \u201cIt\u2019s an excessive dose of medicine \u2013 and too much medicine becomes poison,\u201d Bolsonaro said, rejecting criticism of his administration\u2019s response. \u201cI\u2019m the manager of the team and the team is playing very well, thank God.\u201d A growing number of Brazil\u2019s 209 million citizens appear to disagree. Since last Tuesday, cities across the country have witnessed nightly panela\u00e7o (pan-banging) protests where dissenters express their dissatisfaction with Bolsonaro by pummelling saucepans from windows and balconies. Much of the fury has focused on Bolsonaro\u2019s decision to pose for triumphant photographs and mingle with supporters outside the presidential palace last Sunday despite receiving medical advice to self-quarantine because of his possible exposure to the virus during a trip to meet Donald Trump in the US. Since then, Bolsonaro has come under heavy fire from Brazilian media and political opponents for what they call his reckless and inept behaviour. On Friday, the conservative Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper said: \u201cScientists around the world are fighting to find a treatment for Covid-19.

Bolsonaro swept to power in 2018, casting himself as a Trump-style outsider who could rescue Brazil from what he called \u201cyears of leftist villainy\u201d. Opinion polls showed Bolsonaro\u2019s support slumping throughout 2019, his first year in office, thanks to a lifeless economy and a series of bizarre and offensive gaffes including sharing a pornographic video with millions of Twitter followers and mocking Brigitte Macron, France\u2019s first lady. But many observers believe his recent moves \u2013 which include dismissing coronavirus as media \u201chysteria\u201d and failing to prevent his politician son from picking a diplomatic fight with China \u2013 will inflict profound damage. \u201cI find it very hard to imagine how Bolsonaro could recover from this,\u201d said Oliver Stuenkel, an international relations professor at the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Get\u00falio Vargas in S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cBolsonaro is very fragile already and I feel like the pandemic has just made it clear to many people that he will not be able to lead Brazil through this in any satisfactory way. \u201cEven if he suddenly says: \u2018OK guys \u2013 I get it,\u2019 it will be very hard for people not to blame him directly for what will happen \u2013 and I think it\u2019s very hard to imagine that this will not be terrible for Brazil.\u201d Bruno Boghossian, a columnist for the Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper in the capital, Bras\u00edlia, said this week\u2019s pot-banging protests had been highly symbolic rather than huge in scale.

Madrid had been dreadful domestically and, when Sanz called the coach Juup Heynckes to ask how he was shortly before the final, the German replied: \u201cSunk.\u201d One player recalls them \u201ccrapping themselves\u201d.</p> <p>Yet Sanz\u2019s son Fernando woke in the middle of the night before, convinced that his friend Pedja Mijatovic really was going to score the winner against Juventus, as he had been telling him for days. Mijatovic was injured and shouldn\u2019t have played, but so it proved. There has probably never been a bigger single goal in the club\u2019s history than the one he scored against the Italians.</p> <p>Some estimates put the numbers out on the streets of Madrid at a million. \u201cWe had never seen so many people,\u201d Fernando Sanz recalled. \u201cAt the celebration we became conscious of what we had done: it was absolutely immense.\u201d</p> <p>Lorenzo Sanz promised the <em>octava</em>, the eighth, and in 2000 that arrived too. Yet if the players joyously threw him in the bath, voters threw him out within two months, defeated in presidential elections. Two European Cups and a league in five years were not enough.</p> <p>Born in Chamber\u00ed, Madrid, in 1943, Sanz was the son of a champion amateur boxer and the eldest of 10 children who grew up in the working-class district of Carabanchel. Sport and Madrid occupied his life and that of his family, always proud to have attended the second European Cup final with his dad. He had started going to the Bernab\u00e9u aged 10 with his grandmother, who sold water to fans, and he had been a member for almost 50 years. After losing the presidency in 2000, he twice tried to return.</p> <p>Sanz briefly played in goal for a local <em>tercera divisi\u00f3n</em> side and his sons were all linked to Madrid as sportsmen: Lorenzo won the basketball league with them. Paco began in the youth system and briefly played for Oviedo. Fernando often stood accused because he was the president\u2019s son \u2013 Fabio Capello admitted he was \u201cencouraged\u201d to put him in the team \u2013 but made 35 league appearances and built an impressive career at M\u00e1laga.

He had started as an errand boy at a barbers\u2019, built a business in printing then real estate and construction, joining Madrid\u2019s board under president Ram\u00f3n Mendoza, whom he met at the hippodrome. Defeat against Barcelona precipitated Mendoza\u2019s departure in November 1995, bringing Sanz to power.</p> <p>Sanz was of his time, a generation of presidents as big, loud personalities \u2013 fans in the directors\u2019 box. Then Barcelona president Joan Gaspart, another of that ilk, complained of the behaviour at the Bernab\u00e9u, saying only the cleaning lady had any decorum. The pair fought but they were friends and Gaspart was devastated at his death.</p> <p>An imposing but accessible man with a taste for Cuban cigars and card games that ran into the night, money laid down, Sanz had big ideas. \u201cHe had a vision to close the gap with Barcelona,\u201d Capello said. \u201cA president with a strong character, a good president. He knew football and the team we built was very, very good.\u201d</p> <p>Madrid had not even qualified for Europe in 1995-96, so Sanz brought in Capello and signed Mijatovic, Davor Suker, Seedorf and Roberto Carlos to join Ra\u00fal, Fernando Redondo and Fernando Hierro. Next, he won a public transfer battle with Barcelona to land Christian Karembeu. Madrid won the league in 1996-97 and, although Capello had not always got on well with the president and was enticed to Milan by Silvio Berlusconi, the European Cup followed in 1997-98. In 2000, they won it again.</p> <p>Look at the staring XIs, though, and only Ra\u00fal, Redondo and Roberto Carlos appear in both, which told a story. As did the fact that Capello\u2019s replacement, Heynckes, was sacked within a week of winning the <em>s\u00e9ptima</em>. That team, nicknamed the Ferrari Squad, were notoriously difficult to handle and Heynckes had given up, \u201ceaten alive\u201d as Sanz later put it.</p> <p>Despite European success, domestically Madrid struggled \u2013 they were fourth, second and fifth in 98, 99 and 2000 respectively \u2013 and these were unstable times. Jorge Valdano, Arsenio Iglesias, Capello, Heynckes, Jos\u00e9 Antonio , Guus Hiddink, John Toshack and Vicente del Bosque: Sanz went through eight coaches in five years and even more players. Steve McManaman was hugely successful; others weren\u2019t.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for today\u2019s UK live blog. We will be following more reactions to Johnson\u2019s press conference and global developments here. Here\u2019s a summary of the latest coronavirus developments in the UK, including the announcements from Boris Johnson\u2019s daily press conference this afternoon. Boris Johnson warned that if people continue to ignore social distancing in public spaces he would have to introduce tougher measures to enforce it. The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said the police could be used to enforce these measures, while in Scotland the police were used to close pubs which refused to shut. About 1.5 million people who are particularly vulnerable to coronavirus are being contacted by the NHS and advised to stay at home for 12 weeks. The government is setting up a network of local hubs to ensure these people still receive medicines, groceries and other essential items without leaving the house. Johnson also said the country was going to need \u201cfar, far more ventilators\u201d as the virus continues to spread. Meanwhile, shops are coming under increasing pressure to close their doors, with Waterstones announcing a U-turn on its decision to stay open after staff expressed fears over the health risks. The first coronavirus case in an immigration detention centre was reported. Rish Sunak was criticised for failing to offer support to the self-employed in his coronavirus bailout package. Boris Johnson finishes up today\u2019s press conference by once again pleading with the public to observe social distancing to stop the spread of coronavirus. The best thing that everybody can do, if you\u2019re going outside, is observe social distancing, Stay two metres apart - it\u2019s not such a difficult thing, do it. Stay at home - that is the best way to help the NHS, and the best way to save potentially many, many thousands of lives. Johnson thanks the public for their efforts and underlines the importance of staying two metres apart when outside, as well as staying at home. He says that the faster we do this, the faster we will beat the epidemic. Jenrick says parcels will be free initially. Says if over time we can tailor it to individuals\u2019 needs, this may change. Dr Harries says small gatherings are perhaps riskier if people are close together. She says: \u201cAt the end of the day it relies on the public to make it work.\u201d When asked by a reporter when the government would consider using the police to enforce social distancing, Boris Johnson seemed quite incredulous. \u201cBring in the police!?\u201d he responded. However, he reiterated that if people continue to ignore advice on staying apart, tougher measures would have be introduced \u2013 but still gave detail on what these tougher measures could be. Dr Harries says over-70s identified by the initiative should not go out. Others should try to stay at home and follow social distancing. He stresses that we don\u2019t want to increase mental health problems by \u201csuch a strict imposition\u201d and says the outdoor environment is safer than an indoor one (because the virus doesn\u2019t last as long). Jenrick says if people have been missed, they can contact their hub or GP. Answering a question about curfews and the police, Johnson reiterates importance of responsibly going out while observing social distancing. \u201cIf people won\u2019t do it, we\u2019ll bring in tougher measures.\u201d Dr Harries says the the 1.5 million have been identified through four routes: through a digital route, clinical referencing groups, trust and medical royal colleges, and adds that if you have not had contact you can raise it with your GP. Dr Harries says letter will direct people to NHS mental wellbeing site as well as to hubs. She says that local authorities know their communities well and will be able to support individuals. \u201cThe answer is always to be guided by the science,\u201d says Johnson, stressing the importance of timing for a lockdown. \u201cYou have to wait until the right moment to do it.\u201d The PM says shielding has been brought in at the moment of maximum exposure. Boris Johnson said that, although there is a good supply at the moment, the country is going to need far, far more ventilators and a huge effort is under way to get these. Harries said places such as London were starting to see \u201cvery significant\u201d rises in cases. In England, only 12% of adult critical care beds are occupied by Covid-19 patients at the moment, but that will change drastically throughout the epidemic, Harries added. Answering a question on when a lockdown will come into place, the PM says we are trying to \u201cpush down on the growth curve\u201d and get our NHS ready. He says we don\u2019t yet know the effects of the measures already in place. Dr Harries says \u201cflexing of the system is designed to handle bumps\u201d of cases, and that only 12% of adult critical care beds are taken by Covid-19 patients. He says all hospitals are stepping up their training, and that there is currently sufficient ventilator capacity. Johnson says \u201cwe have a good supply of ventilators at the moment\u201d but that we need far more testing kits and ventilators. The UK\u2019s case fatality rise changes as we move through the epidemic. \u201cWe will look back in due course and see the actual number of people who have died of coronavirus,\u201d Dr Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer for England says, but warns against comparing to other countries\u2019 rates. The prime minister is asked why social distancing measures aren\u2019t being enforced more strictly considering evidence suggests they are not being followed. \u201cWe\u2019ve already taken some very draconian steps, we\u2019ve closed the schools and a huge swathe of the UK economy ... a huge quantity of our normal daily life has been transformed. \u201cIt is very important for people\u2019s mental and psychical wellbeing that they should be able to get out and exercise. That\u2019s why parks and open spaces are absolutely crucial. \u201cIf people don\u2019t exercise responsibly in the parks and green spaces, there is going to be no doubt we are going to bring forward further measures and we are keeping that under constant review.\u201d Johnson adds that if people do not observe social distances, stricter measures will be enforced. Stresses: \u201cStay home, protect our NHS and save lives.\u201d Johnson says \u201chealth benefits of keeping parks open outweigh epidemiological value of closing them\u201d. Jenrick says NHS letters will provide details for people to contact if they don\u2019t have a support network \u201cas a government and a society\u201d. He stresses the scale of the challenge and says food parcels will take into account medical and dietary requirements. Robert Jenrick, secretary for housing, communities and local government, outlined the steps being introduced to protect the vulnerable. He said: \u201cThe NHS has identified up to 1.5 million people in England who face the highest risk of being hospitalised by the virus\u201d. They will be contacted by the NHS in the coming days urging them to stay at home and avoid face-to-face contact for at least 12 weeks. This includes people living with severe respiratory conditions, specific cancers, and some people with immunosuppressant conditions. \u201cI don\u2019t underestimate what we\u2019re asking of people. It will be tough,\u201d Jenrick added. Those living in the same household will not be required to take the same measures themselves, and carers can continue to visit. For those who don\u2019t have a network of family and friends close by, there will be a network of local hubs covering the whole country in \u201ca major national effort\u201d. Medicines will be delivered by community pharmacies, while groceries and essential items will be delivered by local councils and food distributors working with supermarkets. These will be left on doorsteps. There will be opportunities for people to volunteer in this effort. Answering a question on when stricter measures will come into force, Johnson says we\u2019ve taken some \u201cdraconian\u201d steps in transforming daily lives, and that it\u2019s important for people to still be able to get out and exercise. He adds that if people don\u2019t act responsibly, stricter measures will be enforced. The communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, has announced new shielding measures, which will involve up to 1.5 million people who are most at risk. The NHS will contact those at higher risk \u2013 asking people to not leave home for 12 weeks. Others in the household will not be required to follow the same measures \u2013 just social distancing measures. Carers can still visit. For those without a network, government will be setting up a network of local \u201chubs\u201d \u2013 medicine and food to be distributed by local authorities. Parcels will be left on doorsteps \u2013 emergency services and armed forces will support this effort. The government is now taking special steps to protect the particularly vulnerable \u2013 1.5 million people in all. \u201cThis shielding will do more than any other single measure or save lives.\u201d He also reiterated that schools are closed tomorrow \u2013 except for the children of key workers \u2013 and that people should take social distancing seriously. \u201cDon\u2019t think that fresh air in its self automatically provides some sort of immunity.\u201d He said people should still stay two metres apart and follow social distancing advice. More measures will be implemented if necessary. The prime ministers starts his daily press by thanking NHS staff, social care workers and the general public for their cooperation. \u201cI want to thank everyone who is being forced to do something different today. Everyone who didn\u2019t visit their mum for Mother\u2019s Day, but FaceTimed or rang or Skyped their mother today, thank you for your restraint and for what you did. \u201cEveryone who closed a restaurant or pub or bar, who would have done fantastic business on a day like today, thank you for your sacrifice, I know how tough that must be. Johnson is stressing the importance of following social distancing advice \u2013 even to those who think they are \u201cinvulnerable\u201d and are putting others at risk. It\u2019s Clea Skopeliti here, taking over from Jessica as the latest rise in UK coronavirus figures are announced. There have been 281 deaths in the UK - an increase of 47. The UK total number of confirmed cases is now at 5,700. The coronavirus death toll in the UK has reached 281, the government said \u2013 an increase of 48. There are now 5,683 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the UK. This is a rise of 665 on Saturday. A paramedic has described being evicted from his home because his landlady was concerned that he could spread Covid-19 at the property. Joseph Hoar, a paramedic for South Western ambulance service, tweeted on Saturday night that he had been asked to leave his home within 24 hours because the owner was \u201csuper nervous about having someone from the NHS here\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time before you are in contact with the virus,\u201d a screenshot of the WhatsApp message said. \u201cCan you organise an Airbnb and collect your stuff tomorrow. Sorry I normally would never do this but it\u2019s not worth the risk.\u201d Sarah-Jane Marsh, the CEO of Birmingham women\u2019s and children\u2019s NHS foundation trust, said that \u201cnurses have been evicted from shared accommodation because people don\u2019t want to live with them right now. The homeless charity Shelter also said it had received calls for help from tenants threatened with eviction because of the coronavirus crisis, including from an NHS worker. The Waterstones chief executive, James Daunt, has said all stores will close from Monday evening after staff raised concerns about the risk to their health by coming into contact with customers with no protection. In an internal email, seen by the Guardian, Daunt said: We take this decision with great regret. As I wrote previously, we believe books are needed more than ever at this terrible time, and that we provide important support to individuals and families as they confront extended periods in isolation. Daunt added that staff had been told only to continue to work if they were willing to, but \u201cwe must be sure that everyone is truly willing ... it is only by closing we can be absolutely sure of this.\u201d The majority of staff will be placed on furlough, but a skeleton staff will be retained to manage deliveries, while the company will now shift to bolstering its online service. Earlier, one Waterstones employee said: \u201cWe all feel at risk. Most of us have someone in our homes that is at high risk but on our pay we cannot afford to leave. \u201cThere have been times where we\u2019ve had to go off the shop floor to have a panic attack.\u201d From next week, those who are especially vulnerable to coronavirus will be able to register for government support. People who have a health condition which makes them extremely vulnerable will be able to receive help, for instance in getting essential supplies. The service is due to go live next week, and people will be able to register online. NHS England is sending out letters to vulnerable people with certain health conditions next week to advise them on measures to protect themselves, including avoiding face-to-face contact for 12 weeks. Police in Scotland have used emergency powers to close a number of pubs after they \u201crecklessly\u201d flouted the ban on bars and clubs from remaining open, and warned they could now lose their licence Malcolm Graham, a deputy chief constable, said police were visiting those bars today to enforce the closure order announced on Friday night after pubs in Glasgow, Greenock and Kilmarnock were among those reportedly staying open over the weekend. One publican in Greenock was quoted saying he would continue serving until forced to stop. Graham said the police would impose emergency closure orders, which last 24 hours per order but can be extended, and report those who ignored the orders to local licensing boards. The force was also poised to use new emergency powers being introduced next week, as soon as they could \u201cI am aware that a small number of public houses are intent on defying this instruction and have indicated that they will remain open until legally ordered to close,\u201d Graham said. This is absolutely reckless and endangers not only the lives of customers, but wider communities, in an extremely fast moving and unprecedented situation where both the health and safety of the nation is at stake. Therefore, I have obtained further legal advice today and Police Scotland will now instruct officers to serve emergency closure orders on any licensed premises which refuses to comply on the grounds of the threat posed to public safety. As many people continue to go on pre-planned holidays, tourist boards across the UK have urged people to respect government advice on social distancing and unnecessary travel. With schools closed and Easter holidays approaching, families are choosing to ignore calls to stay at home and limit social interactions. Visit Cornwall asked holidaymakers online to \u201cplease stay away\u201d to help reduce the speed that the virus was spread and avoid \u201cneedless lives being lost\u201d. Cherilyn Mackrory, Conservative MP for Truro and Falmouth said the message to tourists was simple: The coronavirus pandemic is an unprecedented situation and as a nation we must take the strongest measures to slow its spread and support our NHS. The government\u2019s advice on movement during this time is very clear: do not travel unnecessarily. Coming on holiday during this time to Cornwall or anywhere else is not necessary travel. My message to anyone considering travelling to Cornwall for a holiday at this time is simple: do not come. The calls come as the Department of Transport and Network Rail announced significant transport reductions to provide more reliable services for key workers as well as the shipping of essential items such as food and fuel. Similar measures on service reduction have been agreed by the Welsh and Scottish governments, which will be implemented from Monday. On Sunday, north Wales-based Pario Leisure Group handed over two holiday parks and more than 250 beds to the NHS after its parks were forced to close to holiday guests and caravan owners. Park owner Wyn Williams said it was important for people to help one another and \u201censure spirits are kept high\u201d. Schools in Scotland have been ordered to cancel plans to allow 15- to 18-year-olds into classes tomorrow to complete exam coursework, Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, has announced. Numerous secondary schools, including all those in areas such as Perth and Kinross, and others in Falkirk, Bishopbriggs and North Ayrshire, had told pupils in S4, 5 and 6 on Friday and Saturday they were expected to attend school on Monday to finish essential coursework. Private schools are also asking pupils to resit their preliminary exams, similar to mocks in England. Sturgeon added that after a surge in the number of non-residents fleeing to Scottish islands to holiday homes or caravan parks, a clampdown on ferry travel to the islands had also been tightened further. CalMac, the country\u2019s main ferry firm, announced last week it would take no new bookings until July. Sturgeon said that from now on, Scotland\u2019s ferry companies would only take bookings for essential travel. She also asked the countries hotels and B&amp;Bs to stop taking bookings. Sturgeon said since Friday she had spoken to the Scottish Qualifications Authority, which runs the country\u2019s exams system, and had agreed this weekend to immediately cancel all course work classes. She said schools still had an essential role to play to look after the most vulnerable children or those whose parents were key workers. A list of occupations who would get priority was being circulated soon, but intensive care unit nursing staff and critical care specialists were at the top of it. She said the expert advice had not changed but they had realised over the weekend the virus was spreading through the community far faster than thought. \u201cTherefore we need to do more to reduce the risks,\u201d she said. \u201cEverybody should consider every time that they\u2019re planning to come into contact with people whether that contact is necessary, and if it\u2019s not necessary, don\u2019t do it,\u201d she said. Catherine Calderwood, Scotland\u2019s chief medical officer, said epidemiologists now estimated that any infected person could infect between four to six people. They had originally calculated it was two to three other people. That could lead to \u201can explosion of cases\u201d, she said. Primark is to close all 189 of its UK stores on Sunday and cancel all orders from suppliers as demand shrinks due to social distancing amid coronavirus crisis. Primark boss Paul Marchant said: We have large quantities of existing stock in our stores, our depots and in transit, that is paid for and if we do not take this action now we will be taking delivery of stock that we simply can\u2019t sell. This is unprecedented action for unprecedented and frankly unimaginable times. Other high street retailers, such as John Lewis, TK Maxx, River Island and Timpson, have also announced closures amid the pandemic. Doctors have said they feel like \u201clambs to the slaughter\u201d due to the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) on the front line of the fight against coronavirus, according to the chair of the Doctors\u2019 Association UK, Rinish Parmar. Parmar is one of 5,000 health workers who have signed a letter to the prime minister calling for more PPE to protect NHS staff, their patients and also their families at home. Speaking on the Andrew Marr Show today, Parmar said: We\u2019ve had doctors tell us they feel like lambs to the slaughter, that they feel like cannon fodder, GPs tell us that they feel absolutely abandoned, and we must really stress to the prime minister that we we need to protect the front line here. Waitrose and John Lewis have outlined measures that will be in place from tomorrow to support NHS workers: All Waitrose shops will protect a proportion of deliveries of \u201chard to find\u201d and essential stock exclusively for NHS workers to ensure they have better opportunity to access basic shopping items at all times of the day. NHS staff will receive priority checkout treatment in all Waitrose supermarkets either through a dedicated till or moved to the front of the queue. John Lewis is donating comfort items and Easter gift food to local hospitals, to support workers. Berangere Michel, executive director for customer service at the John Lewis Partnership, said: Through these steps we want to recognise the tireless work of NHS staff, supporting us all through these unprecedented circumstances. We hope these measures make their life a little easier; our Partners are keen to do something to help, and we are offering this with sincere thanks from us all. Earlier this week the John Lewis Partnership launched a \u00a31m Community Support Fund, along with a protected shopping hour for the elderly and vulnerable. An elderly patient with an underlying medical condition has become the second person to die in Northern Ireland after testing positive for coronavirus, the country\u2019s Department of Health said. As of 2pm on Sunday, testing has resulted in 20 new positive cases in Northern Ireland, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 128. The total number of tests completed in Northern Ireland is 2,484. A total of 44 were aged 44 or under, another 44 aged 45-69 and 40 were aged 70 or over. Males made up 73 cases and females 55. The health minister, Robin Swann, said: This heartbreaking news should bring it home to every one of us that coronavirus is a real and present danger across our community. Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Sunday Politics programme this morning, First Minister Arlene Foster said enforcement of social distancing was needed in some cases to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Production on Coronation Street and Emmerdale will stop from Monday due to coronavirus concerns, ITV has said. In a statement it announced: ITV has sadly taken the decision to suspend production of the soaps Coronation Street and Emmerdale with effect from Monday March 23. We\u2019ve been doing our best to carry on filming, whilst adhering to the government\u2019s latest health guidelines, to ensure we\u2019ve episodes of both soaps airing on ITV until at least the early summer. However, the health and well-being of the production teams, actors, crew and their families is of paramount importance to us and we now feel that the time has come to stop filming. We\u2019d like to thank our viewers for their support and hope they continue to enjoy both soaps in the coming months. Eastenders confirmed it has suspended filming earlier this week, while Home and Away, Australia\u2019s popular soap, has also stopped production to protect to protect staff from the virus. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is facing mounting pressure to extend the coronavirus bailout to include the UK\u2019s five million self-employed workers, as a survey reveals half would keep working if they had symptoms. On Friday, Sunak said self-employed workers could access \u00a394.25 a week in universal credit but he gave a far more generous deal to employees, who will receive 80% of their wages, up to \u00a32,500 a month. He is being lobbied to go further in the coming days or risk public health by incentivising self-employed taxi drivers, couriers and other gig economy workers and zero-hours contractors to keep working while ill. According to a survey carried out on Wednesday and Thursday, 47% of the self-employed and 51% in \u201catypical\u201d work such as those on zero-hours contracts would feel obliged to work even if they had the virus. To help combat misinformation about coronavirus on social media, the NHS has been working with Twitter to ensure local NHS organisations have blue-tick verification. The NHS is has been working with Twitter, Instagram and Facebook to verify or \u2018blue tick\u2019 over 800 accounts belonging to NHS organisations including hospital trusts and local commissioning groups. It has also worked with Twitter to suspend a false account posing as a hospital and putting out inaccurate information about the number of coronavirus cases, as well as publicly condemning homeopaths promoting false treatments. Both Twitter and Facebook are now directing users to the NHS website if they search for coronavirus. A man has appeared in court accused of making fake coronavirus test kits and attempting to send them across the world, police said. Frank Ludlow, 59, of West Sussex, was arrested at a Post Office near his home on Friday after 60 Covid-19 treatment kits were seized by police in the US. The kits, which were intercepted by Customs and Border Protection Agency officers in Los Angles on Wednesday, were labelled as \u201cAnti-Pathogenic treatment\u201d and had been sent from the UK, City of London Police said. They allegedly contained chemicals which are \u201cextremely harmful\u201d when the user is instructed to wash and rinse their mouth with them, police said. Police believe some of the kits could still be in circulation and urged people not to use them. Tariq Sarwar, head of operations for enforcement at the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, said: We are encouraging people with health concerns to seek advice from a registered healthcare professional and only purchase medicines they need from an authorised seller. You should ensure you are buying your medicines and medical devices from a registered pharmacy or website only. Detective chief superintendent Clinton Blackburn, from the City of London of Police, said: \u201cIf you have purchased one of these kits, it\u2019s important you do not use it. Instead, report it to Action Fraud via their website or by calling 0300 123 2040 and quoting \u2018Trinity CV19 treatment kits\u2019.\u201d The number of people who have died after testing positive for coronavirus in Scotland has risen to 10, the Scottish Government said. The death toll stood at seven this morning, and the country has 373 confirmed cases The first case of Covid-19 in an immigration detention centre has just been confirmed by the Home Office. The case is at Yarls Wood immigration removal centre in Bedfordshire, which houses women and some family groups. A female detainee has tested positive for the virus. Home Office officials say no one else, either staff or detainees, have tested positive. Women at the centre are on lockdown and all are panicking. One woman told the Guardian: We\u2019ve been given a mask and a pair of gloves but they\u2019re not very good. A bottle of hand sanitiser has been put on the landing but everyone has to touch the same bottle to open and close it. A second woman said: We are afraid of everything and everyone including each other. There are women from all different parts of the world locked up here. Some have asthma and they are particularly frightened. The first confirmed case in an immigration detention centre comes in the middle of a legal action calling for the release of hundreds of detainees because of the risk of them contracting the virus within the confined and sometimes overcrowded spaces in detention centres. Antonia Bright, chair of the organisation Movement For Justice which is providing telephone support to the detainees inside Yarls Wood, said: \u201cThere is no way that detention centres can manage the health needs of detainees in a pandemic. Our experience is that they are overstretched with regular health emergencies let alone the kind of devastation that Covid-19 could cause in these centres. These centres must be emptied and shut down as a matter of urgency. Every delay puts the lives of detainees and staff in danger. A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cA woman at Yarl\u2019s Wood IRC tested positive for coronavirus and following guidance from Public Health England, was placed in isolation after displaying symptoms. No other staff or detainees have tested positive for coronavirus. \u201cImmigration Enforcement is responding to the unique circumstances of the coronavirus outbreak and decisions to detain are made on a case-by-case basis, following the guidance from Public Health England. \u201cOur priority is to maintain the lawful detention of the most high-harm individuals, including foreign national offenders.\u201d The wide range of key workers whose children can still access schools when they close next week has led to an \u201coverwhelming\u201d demand for places, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers has said. In a video message, Paul Whiteman said: The key workers list is very wide and may prove impossible for schools to support unless the parents of these children take very good decisions. If you can find care for children elsewhere, please make sure they are cared for away from school. We are getting reports of an overwhelming demand for places. This was not the plan. The plan was always to care for the very few who have nowhere else to go to help halt the spread of the virus. While schools are closed to the majority of children next week, vulnerable children and the children of key workers including health, transport, local and national government workers, can still send their children in. He added: \u201cPlease approach your school not with a sense of entitlement, but with a sense of cooperation and mutual support within your community. We need to look after one another right now.\u201d More than 5,000 former nurses have registered to offer their services in the fight against coronavirus, the Nursing and Midwifery Council has confirmed. The temporary Covid-19 register will only come into force if emergency coronavirus legislation is passed by parliament and the health secretary declares a state of emergency. The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, issued a stark warning to those in the capital today, saying that unless people stop interacting with each other, more people will die and police may have to enforce social distancing rules. Speaking on the BBC\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show, Khan said: I\u2019m quite clear that unless people stay at home, unless people stop using public transport, unless it\u2019s essential, unless people stop interacting with each other, more people will die. Please, please, please stop mixing, stay at home. He added that while \u201cit\u2019s really important that the police are focused on the priorities they\u2019ve got\u201d, if people continued to ignore social distancing advice, they could be drafted in to enforce the measures. More national parks and gardens across the country are closing as, despite government advice on social distancing, good weather and Mother\u2019s Day celebrations continue to draw crowds to attractions. Organisations such as Chatsworth House, the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) and the National Trust made the decision in order to \u201crestrict the spread of the coronavirus\u201d, after visitor numbers remained high on Saturday. Chatsworth chief executive, Stephen Vickers, said the decision had \u201cnot been taken lightly\u201d. He said: The situation is enormously complex and fast-moving, and we believe that taking decisive action to help implement effective social distancing is in the best interests of all of our visitors and staff, and is part of the collective national effort to help contain the coronavirus. An RHS spokesman said its gardens had remained \u201cvery busy\u201d on Saturday and that it could no longer \u201cguarantee the Government\u2019s requirement for social distancing\u201d. Meanwhile, the National Trust director general, Hilary McGrady, said the organisation would be taking measures to ensure that people do not lose their connection with nature, and that sites of natural beauty remain open \u201cvirtually\u201d. She said: We know that people are likely to need space and fresh air in the coming weeks and months and we will do all we can to provide access wherever possible. Over the coming weeks, our digital platforms \u2013 our website, social media feeds, podcasts and video \u2013 will become even more important, ensuring the places of nature, beauty and history that we care for on behalf of the nation can remain open for business virtually while we are temporarily closed. A spokesman for the Royal Parks said their venues would remain open for the time being, though cafes and kiosks have been closed. They added: \u201cIf people do not follow social distancing guidelines, we will have no choice but to close the parks.\u201d People with underlying health conditions including severe asthma and specific cancers are being urged to stay at home \u201cat all times\u201d to protect themselves against coronavirus. People who fall into the high-risk categories should avoid any face-to-face contact for at least 12 weeks, the government said. Those at risk will receive a letter from NHS England and should implement the measures from the day they receive it, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said. People who are most at risk include: Cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy or radical radiotherapy for lung cancer, as well as those with cancers of the blood or bone marrow who are at any stage of their treatment. People having immunotherapy or other continuing antibody treatments for cancer. Those undergoing targeted cancer treatments which can affect the immune system, such as protein kinase inhibitors. People who have had bone marrow or stem cell transplants in the past six months or who are still taking immunosuppression drugs. Those with respiratory conditions including severe asthma, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis. Pregnant women who have significant heart disease. The DHSC said people with rare diseases and inborn errors of metabolism that significantly increase infection are also classed as high-risk. Those with serious health conditions face the highest risk of needing hospital treatment for Covid-19 according to the DHSC. The measures advise people not to leave their home, attend any gatherings, or go out for shopping, while deliveries should be left at the door to minimise contact, the DHSC said. People living with others in the same house are advised to keep two metres away from each other, use separate bathrooms where possible, and separate towels. There are currently 5,018 confirmed cases of people with Covid-19 coronavirus in the UK. As 53 more people who had tested positive for the virus died in England, the UK death toll rose to more than 200 this morning. NHS England said all 53 patients had underlying health conditions and the eldest was 94. In Wales the death toll has risen to 12 as seven more patients died, while Scotland\u2019s stands at seven and Northern Ireland\u2019s remains at one. Boris Johnson has tweeted to say that everyone should stay at home this Mother\u2019s Day in order to stop the spread of the coronavirus. He advised people to keep in touch my calling, texting or using social media instead. Earlier in the week Johnson was criticised for saying during a press conference that he hoped to be able to see his mother on Sunday, contradicting official social distancing advice. Aides clarified afterwards that the prime minister was referring to seeing his mother, Charlotte, via Skype. Welcome to today\u2019s coverage of the coronavirus crisis in the UK. This is Jessica Murray and I\u2019ll be taking you through the latest developments and stories for the afternoon. Wales has said a further seven people have died after contracting coronavirus - taking the total number of deaths during the pandemic to 12. All those who died were over 70 and had underlying medical conditions. Meanwhile, police could use emergency powers to enforce rules on social distancing and reduce the further spread of coronavirus, the London mayor has said, amid concerns about mixed messages from central government on the issue. Shops are coming under continued pressure to close their doors in order to stop the close contact of customers, which goes against social distancing guidelines. Timpson is the latest retailer to announce it is closing, with all 2,150 outlets shutting their doors by 23 March. Chief Executive James Timpson said the business is going into hibernation but all staff will remain on full pay. Meanwhile, Waterstones is trending on Twitter following a backlash over the company\u2019s decision to remain open. Staff said they have not been provided with any personal protective equipment and are being put at risk by close contact with customers. Last week James Daunt, the managing director of Waterstones, said the virus had led to \u201cunprecedented demand\u201d for books and a 17% increase in sales, calling for all bookshops to be kept open because they serve an essential purpose.",

Faced with the stresses and difficulties of the coronavirus outbreak, it should come as no surprise that so many people have found a response to the pandemic in music. Our bodies may be doing the right and responsible thing by remaining at home, but our minds are not so easily locked down. Things eternal still need to burst forth somehow, and in the face of the Covid-19 virus, music has become one of humankind\u2019s most defiant public assertions that life must continue in harmony.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/16/classical-music-opera-livestream-at-home-coronavirus\">'Quarantine soirees': classical music and opera to stream at home</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Nowhere has this musical expression of the will to survive been more inspiring than in Italy. A week ago, a few Italians began to open their windows in the evening and venture out on their balconies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/solidarity-balcony-singing-spreads-across-italy-during-lockdown\" title=\"\">to sing</a>. Neighbours opened their shutters and joined in. The music went viral and caught on. They sang Italy\u2019s national anthem, local folk songs and popular melodies. Musicians joined in with their instruments. The non-musical banged pans. In towns lucky enough to be home to an opera singer, live renderings of Verdi and Puccini arias have echoed through the empty streets.</p> \n<p>Not every country in Europe is as musical as Italy. Not every country has narrow streets lined by houses with balconies either. But Italy is not alone in turning to music in its time of trouble. Singing and live music has been reported across Europe from Spain to Sweden. In Ireland, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/18/bono-coronavirus-song-italy-let-your-love-be-known\" title=\"\">Bono</a> responded on social media with his first new song since 2017. With concerts mostly abandoned everywhere, livestreaming of all forms of music has snowballed in every country and across Europe\u2019s closed borders. It is almost as though music has suddenly become the expression of the way we wish the world was, even while the lockdowns are the embodiment of the world as, for the present, it actually is.</p> \n<p>When people look back on the pandemic of 2020, they will remember many things. One of them ought to be the speed with which human beings, their freedom to associate constrained, turned towards music in what may almost be described as a global prisoners\u2019 chorus. In music, supply has been quick to respond to demand. The Berlin-based concert pianist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/igorpianist?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">Igor Levit</a> plays a sonata live on Twitter each evening from his living room.

      "bodyText": "Music, said Saint Thomas Aquinas, can be defined as \u201cthe exaltation of the mind derived from things eternal bursting forth in sound\u201d. Faced with the stresses and difficulties of the coronavirus outbreak, it should come as no surprise that so many people have found a response to the pandemic in music. Our bodies may be doing the right and responsible thing by remaining at home, but our minds are not so easily locked down. Things eternal still need to burst forth somehow, and in the face of the Covid-19 virus, music has become one of humankind\u2019s most defiant public assertions that life must continue in harmony. Nowhere has this musical expression of the will to survive been more inspiring than in Italy. A week ago, a few Italians began to open their windows in the evening and venture out on their balconies to sing. Neighbours opened their shutters and joined in. The music went viral and caught on. They sang Italy\u2019s national anthem, local folk songs and popular melodies. Musicians joined in with their instruments. The non-musical banged pans. In towns lucky enough to be home to an opera singer, live renderings of Verdi and Puccini arias have echoed through the empty streets. Not every country in Europe is as musical as Italy. Not every country has narrow streets lined by houses with balconies either. But Italy is not alone in turning to music in its time of trouble. Singing and live music has been reported across Europe from Spain to Sweden. In Ireland, Bono responded on social media with his first new song since 2017. With concerts mostly abandoned everywhere, livestreaming of all forms of music has snowballed in every country and across Europe\u2019s closed borders. It is almost as though music has suddenly become the expression of the way we wish the world was, even while the lockdowns are the embodiment of the world as, for the present, it actually is. When people look back on the pandemic of 2020, they will remember many things. One of them ought to be the speed with which human beings, their freedom to associate constrained, turned towards music in what may almost be described as a global prisoners\u2019 chorus. In music, supply has been quick to respond to demand. The Berlin-based concert pianist Igor Levit plays a sonata live on Twitter each evening from his living room. Singers including Pink and Miley Cyrus have done the same on Instagram. Meanwhile many opera houses and orchestras have responded to shutdowns by putting their performance archives online for free. Simon Rattle, who conducted a livestreamed concert from an empty hall in Berlin last weekend, put it well when he said beforehand: \u201cWe hope that simply playing sends a signal.\u201d It absolutely does. It also sends a memo to the future. Music education should be a core task in schools, when they reopen. We need music more than ever at present. But our need for things eternal to burst forth in sound will never die.",

      "bodyText": "Funeral directors are being told to create makeshift face masks out of \u201ctowels, bin liners and incontinence pads\u201d, as they remove the bodies of coronavirus victims, because of a severe shortage of protective equipment in the UK. Faced with the unprecedented task of retrieving and arranging the burial and cremation of growing numbers who have died of Covid-19, funeral staff say they are increasingly concerned at the risk because of the lack of masks and protective gowns. With the death toll from the virus mounting, they are calling for a minister to take charge of burials and cremations, and warning of a backlog of bodies. The Lancashire coroner has advised funeral directors to treat all sudden deaths in the community from now on as a suspected coronavirus fatality because people with symptoms have been told to self-isolate and may be undiagnosed victims. In a document sent to funeral directors, the coroner said: \u201cPolice and removals undertakers attending a sudden death where Covid-19 is suspected should before moving the body ensure that the deceased\u2019s mouth and nose are covered. \u201cThis could be as simple as using a towel, bin liner or something like an incontinence pad cut to fit over the mouth and nose.\u201d Louise Winter, a funeral director who runs Poetic Endings in London, said: \u201cIf someone has died with an infectious disease, we are supposed to put a mask over their mouth and nose, as well as use one ourselves, because of the infection risk from their mouth and nose. \u201cBut we are short of masks and protective equipment, and they are trying to find a solution. If the advice is to go into a nursing home or a house and use a bit of towel or an incontinence pad, that is not OK. People in the profession are getting very worried.\u201d Funeral directors said there are also a shortage of body bags, which are required when dealing with infectious disease deaths. Dr James Adeley, the senior coroner for Lancashire, Blackburn and Darwen, who sent the advice on makeshift masks, said he had great sympathy for the concerns of undertakers. He said he had sourced some plastic aprons and paper masks to try to provide protection but the recommendation from Public Health England (PHE) of a full suit, gloves, visor and mask was not available. \u201cWhat we were doing was simply trying to take those measures that we could to protect the health of those that are going to be dealing with deceased people who are very possibly highly infective,\u201d said Adeley. David Holmes, who has been in the profession for more than 40 years, said: \u201cFirst they told us we needed to wear full PPE [personal protective equipment], that\u2019s a full white forensic suit, mask and goggles. \u201cThen last week they told us none of that was necessary \u2013 what happened was they discovered that no one had adequate supplies of equipment. It clearly puts funeral directors at greater risk and our staff are not happy.\u201d Crematoria and burial services normally deal with about 600,000 deaths a year. Holmes said there was a lack of coordinated planning for the scale of deaths to come, which would put the whole system under intense pressure.

If you\u2019re not sure what\u2019s open and what\u2019s closed \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/australia-coronavirus-shutdown-what-is-open-closed-places-scott-morrison\">here\u2019s a full list</a>. Sunday saw a record rise in confirmed cases, with backpacker parties in Bondi and disembarking cruise ship passengers blamed for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/coronavirus-australia-ruby-princess-cruise-ship-largest-daily-rise-cases\">steep uptick in numbers</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>A second financial stimulus package worth $66bn offers the unemployed an extra $550 a fortnight</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/22/what-australias-189bn-coronavirus-economic-rescue-package-means-for-you\">effectively doubling the rate of Newstart</a>, and increases the wage subsidy to struggling small businesses to $100,000. Economist Stephen Koukoulas argues that although the new package is a step in the right direction, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/australias-economic-rescue-package-is-a-step-in-the-right-direction-but-we-needed-a-leap\">much more will need to be done in the coming months</a>. The question now, writes political editor Katharine Murphy, is whether the Australian health system can cope <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/as-australia-goes-off-the-coronavirus-cliff-the-question-is-how-hard-will-it-land\">as cases start to rise significantly</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>In Europe, Spain has now extended its state of emergency to 15 April after 394 deaths recorded on Saturday.</strong> Residents are barred from leaving home <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/22/coronavirus-news-coronavirus-live-updates-deaths-uk-italy-lockdown-spain-us-new-york-south-america?page=with:block-5e778d8c8f08dcc95cc210c7#block-5e778d8c8f08dcc95cc210c7\">except for essential outings like buying food or seeking medical care.</a> In Italy, the government shut all non-essential businesses after 793 people died in a single day, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/italian-pm-warns-of-worst-crisis-since-ww2-as-coronavirus-deaths-leap-by-almost-800\">the largest number of people to die in one country in a 24-hour period from Covid-19</a>.

Germany has more than 22,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19, but so far only 84 deaths. The stark comparison with Italy, a country with similar numbers of people over the age of 65, continues to intrigue experts. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/germany-low-coronavirus-mortality-rate-puzzles-experts\">Germany has the lowest mortality rate of any of the countries severely hit by the epidemic; 0.3% compared with 9% in Italy and 4.6% in the UK.</a> A more widespread testing regime and a health service that has not been overrun by new cases are cited as possible reasons why. Meanwhile in the UK, prime minister Boris Johnson has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/22/uk-coronavirus-live-police-could-enforce-london-lockdown-says-khan-seven-people-die-in-wales?page=with:block-5e779c7a8f08dcc95cc21166#block-5e779c7a8f08dcc95cc21166\">decided to hold a daily press briefing</a> now the country has 5,700 positive cases. The PM\u2019s closest adviser, Dominic Cummings, has come under fire after it was reported he defended the controversial \u201cherd immunity\u201d policy by saying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/22/no-10-denies-claim-dominic-cummings-argued-to-let-old-people-die\">\u201cprotect the economy, and if that means some pensioners die, too bad\u201d</a>. Downing Street has called the allegation a \u201chighly defamatory fabrication\u201d. In France, tributes have poured in for the country\u2019s first doctor to die from the virus. Jean-Jacques Razafindranazy was a retired 68-year-old A&amp;E doctor who kept coming into work in order to help his colleagues. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/he-sacrificed-himself-tributes-to-first-french-doctor-to-die-from-coronavirus\">\u201cHe sacrificed himself,\u201d his unnamed son said.</a> \u201cHe wanted to help.

Sunday saw a record rise in confirmed cases, with backpacker parties in Bondi and disembarking cruise ship passengers blamed for the steep uptick in numbers. A second financial stimulus package worth $66bn offers the unemployed an extra $550 a fortnight, effectively doubling the rate of Newstart, and increases the wage subsidy to struggling small businesses to $100,000. Economist Stephen Koukoulas argues that although the new package is a step in the right direction, much more will need to be done in the coming months. The question now, writes political editor Katharine Murphy, is whether the Australian health system can cope as cases start to rise significantly. In Europe, Spain has now extended its state of emergency to 15 April after 394 deaths recorded on Saturday. Residents are barred from leaving home except for essential outings like buying food or seeking medical care. In Italy, the government shut all non-essential businesses after 793 people died in a single day, the largest number of people to die in one country in a 24-hour period from Covid-19. German chancellor Angela Merkel is now in quarantine after coming into contact with a doctor who tested positive. Germany has more than 22,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19, but so far only 84 deaths. The stark comparison with Italy, a country with similar numbers of people over the age of 65, continues to intrigue experts. Germany has the lowest mortality rate of any of the countries severely hit by the epidemic; 0.3% compared with 9% in Italy and 4.6% in the UK. A more widespread testing regime and a health service that has not been overrun by new cases are cited as possible reasons why. Meanwhile in the UK, prime minister Boris Johnson has decided to hold a daily press briefing now the country has 5,700 positive cases. The PM\u2019s closest adviser, Dominic Cummings, has come under fire after it was reported he defended the controversial \u201cherd immunity\u201d policy by saying \u201cprotect the economy, and if that means some pensioners die, too bad\u201d. Downing Street has called the allegation a \u201chighly defamatory fabrication\u201d. In France, tributes have poured in for the country\u2019s first doctor to die from the virus. Jean-Jacques Razafindranazy was a retired 68-year-old A&amp;E doctor who kept coming into work in order to help his colleagues. \u201cHe sacrificed himself,\u201d his unnamed son said. \u201cHe wanted to help. He kept working because he loved it, it was his life. It\u2019s not fair. We are sad and angry.\u201d In the United States there are now more than 26,000 cases and 340 reported deaths. New York state appears to be the centre of Covid-19 in the country, with 76 of the reported deaths coming from there alone. New York City mayor Bill De Blasio has blasted Donald Trump for his administration\u2019s handling of the crisis. \u201cWe\u2019re about 10 days away now from seeing widespread shortages of ventilators, surgical masks, the things necessary to keep a hospital system running,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cWe have seen next to nothing from the federal government at this point.\u201d The IOC is considering a delay to the Tokyo Olympics. The news emerged as thousands defied Covid-19 to see the Olympic torch in northern Japan. The first two cases have been recorded in Gaza, raising fears about how the besieged territory\u2019s overstretched health system will cope if the virus spreads through its population of 2 million. The usually hectic streets of India\u2019s major cities were left deserted as the government there brought in a daytime curfew to try and curb the spread of coronavirus. Australia The Victorian government is being asked to bring forward its logging phase-out, scheduled for 2030. The calls come as new photos show 90% of protected east Gippsland forests have been destroyed. The full impact of coral bleaching across the Great Barrier Reef will become clearer this week as aerial surveys of hundreds of reefs are completed in the bottom two thirds of the world\u2019s biggest reef system. From Monday, the spotter plane will head south over reefs where satellite observations and temperature readings have led scientists to fear the reef may have been badly bleached. The world Croatia\u2019s capital Zagreb has been hit with an earthquake while under a coronavirus lockdown. A 15-year-old was in a critical condition and 16 others were injured as a result of the quake, Croatian authorities said on Sunday afternoon. Trump\u2019s border wall with Mexico proceeds despite the coronavirus outbreak. The president is accused of \u201cthrowing billions at a monument out in the desert\u201d when Covdi-19 is likely to cost the country trillions. The forced disappearance of young black men in Brazil is on the rise in a trend aided by Bolsonaro\u2019s rhetoric, according to human rights activists. Cases of poor young black men who are stopped by police and then show up dead or disappear completely are common in Brazil. Recommended reads \u201cThis is not forever.\u201d A mantra for surviving quarantine with a toddler, suggests Amanda Abel, a paediatric psychologist in Melbourne. If lockdown means Netflix on the couch for some people, parents of young children have a job on their hands over the coming period as childcare facilities shut down and the options for entertaining toddlers narrow. Keeta Williams is here to help with a guide to caring for small children until the coronavirus crisis ends. Kindness is also spreading rampantly across the globe as people rally together to help vulnerable friends, family and neighbours. Psychology professor Lea Waters lists the things you can do to add to the phenomenon. And Kathryn Heyman writes about international travel in the Covid-19 age, describing \u201cthe quiet courtesy of travellers in these trying times\u201d. \u201cBe careful\u201d: the words of Spain\u2019s last survivor of the Spanish Flu in 1918. The centenarian makes his warning as cases of Covid-19 around the world now exceed 318,000, with more than 13,500 deaths. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see the same thing repeated. It claimed so many lives,\u201d says Jos\u00e9 Ameal Pe\u00f1a who was four years old when the 1918 flu tore through his small fishing town in northern Spain. Jack Banister visits the Torres Strait to meet the keepers of the sleeping Kulkalgau Ya language, and talks with Phillemon Mosby, one of the language\u2019s most determined defenders. \u201cMy grandmother wanted us to learn English and to learn the white way, but she never stopped talking language to us,\u201d says Mosby. Language is now a part of the curriculum for schoolchildren on Poruma. \u201cLanguage is what carries our custom, it\u2019s what carries our practices, language is what teaches us what to say, who to say it to and when to say it,\u201d he says. Listen Today\u2019s Full Story podcast looks at kindness during the coronavirus epidemic. With our lives changing so dramatically over such a short period, the Full Story team search for stories of hope and community among the uncertainty the coronavirus has brought the world. Sport The AFL faces the biggest financial crisis in its history after coronavirus forced the suspension of the 2020 season until at least 31 May. \u201cTo say this is the most serious threat to our game in 100 years is an understatement,\u201d AFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan said on Sunday. Media roundup The Sydney Morning Herald leads on news that the IOC may delay the Tokyo Olympic Games as it ramps up scenario planning. The Age has a feature on the fate of Melbourne\u2019s pubs, now closed due to the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cI\u2019ve been in this industry for 15 years, and I\u2019d never really thought about this happening,\u201d says Peter Sherwood, general manager at the Empress Hotel in North Fitzroy. \u201cI used to joke we were the only ones who were recession-proof.\u201d The Australian reports that the Ruby Princess cruise ship was deemed medium-risk 11 days before it docked in Sydney with a low-risk status. Critics have said health authorities did not conduct enough tests on the ship\u2019s passengers, according to the newspaper.

      "bodyText": "The public must stop congregating in public or face new coronavirus enforcement measures within 24 hours, Boris Johnson has said, amid growing concern that his previous attempts to encourage social distancing were being ignored. After a weekend of public alarm at pictures of groups spending time in parks, on beaches and at markets, the prime minister responded to mounting criticism of a mixed message from No 10 on Sunday with his most explicit warning yet that the UK could face an Italy-style lockdown. But amid growing unease among his own supporters over Downing Street\u2019s communications with the public, he again stopped short of taking tougher action, saying: \u201cWe will think about this very actively in the next 24 hours. If people can\u2019t make use of parks and playgrounds responsibly, in a way that observes the 2-metre rule, then of course we\u2019re going to have to look at further measures.\u201d In what appeared to be a warning that the draconian steps taken in Italy could be seen in the UK, he said: \u201cWe need to think about the kinds of measures that we\u2019ve seen elsewhere, other countries that have been forced to bring in restrictions on people\u2019s movements altogether.\u201d The prime minister\u2019s press conference came only after some councils and organisations had moved independently to close public spaces in response to widespread concern over the number of people out in public over the sunny weekend. It followed appeals for stronger steps from across the political spectrum, with London mayor Sadiq Khan and northern Ireland\u2019s first minister Arlene Foster both endorsing stricter enforcement of the guidelines, and former northern Ireland secretary Julian Smith saying he would support any measure that would force people to follow the guidelines. The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said too many Britons were \u201ceither confused by the government\u2019s social distancing measures or choose to ignore them\u201d. Pressed on the issue during a daily briefing at which he announced no new measures, Johnson stressed that parks and other green spaces were vital for people\u2019s mental and physical wellbeing, but also said the public should stay indoors wherever possible. As the official number of people in the UK to die after testing positive for the Covid-19 virus rose by 48 to reach 281: \u2022 Chains including McDonald\u2019s, Waterstones, Primark and Patisserie Valerie said they would be closing their shops from Monday. \u2022 School leaders urged parents to \u201conly leave your child at school if you have no choice\u201d before the first day of attendance being limited to key workers\u2019 families. \u2022 Doctors\u2019 groups said hospitals were coming under such severe pressure that clinicians would soon be forced to decide which patients to treat. \u2022 ITV said it would stop filming Coronation Street and Emmerdale as broadcasters continued to adjust to the crisis. \u2022 An 18-year-old with an underlying condition became the youngest victim in the UK so far. Johnson addressed the media alongside Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, who outlined the plans for 1.5 million people in England with underlying medical conditions to be advised via letter to self-isolate for 12 weeks, with provision made for them to be supplied with food and medicines as needed. Jenrick said community hubs would help organise care parcels, paid for by public funds, and that supermarkets might become involved. He said: \u201cTo begin with it\u2019s going to be free to ensure that the people who really need it get the supplies as soon as possible.\u201d Also speaking at Downing Street the deputy chief medical officer, Jenny Harries, warned against directly comparing the UK\u2019s figures with those of Italy a fortnight ago. \u201cWe will look back in due course, sadly, and see the true number of people who have died from coronavirus,\u201d she said. \u201cBut a direct comparison with another country and against individual numbers is something we should be very cautious of.\u201d While some councils have announced the closure of playgrounds and even parks, Johnson said they should remain open for now, saying this was based on scientific advice. \u201cWhat they\u2019ve always said so far is that the health benefits for the whole of society of keeping the parks and the playgrounds open if we possibly can outweigh the epidemiological value of closing them,\u201d he said. The prime minister said the situation would be \u201cunder constant, constant review,\u201d but when asked whether police could be part of any response, he replied: \u201cPolice?\u201d in apparent surprise. In a series of tweets, Ashworth said the messaging on social distancing was confusing, saying: \u201cThis cannot continue in a public health emergency.\u201d He said: \u201cWe have called for and welcomed measures including banning mass gatherings and pub closures. But if social distancing measures are not working the government must take stronger action.\u201d In the interim, devolved governments and councils have taken their own actions, in part to halt the flow of people to open spaces, but also to try to prevent urban dwellers from fleeing to more remote areas, potentially overwhelming local health services. Nicola Sturgeon announced that ferry companies to Scottish islands had been instructed not to carry tourists and other non-essential travellers. The Scottish first minister said hotels and holiday cottages should not take bookings for now. She said: \u201cIt may well be an understandable human instinct to think we can outrun a virus, but the fact is we can\u2019t. What we do is we risk taking it to the places we go.\u201d Visit Cornwall asked holidaymakers online to \u201cplease stay away\u201d to help reduce the speed the virus was spreading and avoid \u201cneedless lives being lost\u201d, while authorities in Wales made a similar plea.

In London, Hammersmith and Fulham council said it was closing all its parks as they had been \u201cfull of people this weekend with a significant proportion ignoring government guidelines on social distancing\u201d. The call for greater action came as the spring weather brought a slew of social media posts showing crowds of people gathered close together in many places, including food markets and at park kiosks. One green space features often in such photos, Victoria Park in east London, announced late on Sunday it was closing its playgrounds, skate park and cafes until further notice due to \u201cunprecedented numbers\u201d of visitors. With London seen as several weeks ahead of the rest of the UK in terms of infection rates, bishops in London said churches in the capital were to close altogether for now.",

As concerns mount about the impact of the outbreak on the world\u2019s number one economy, congressional leaders and White House officials were in talks about launching a $1tn stimulus package. The Australian government ordered the closure of restaurants, cinemas and pubs \u2013 the latter sparking a run on liquor stores \u2013 but said schools would remain open for now. Some states, however, have already ordered students not to go to class. South Australia and Western Australia said they would close their borders to other states this week.

It was genuinely a great European night, at a ground and club whose very essence is celebrating great European nights, stretching back decades to Bill Shankly\u2019s great rebuilding. That night, before Boris Johnson\u2019s government finally decided \u201cmass gatherings\u201d were no longer so safe in the Covid-19 pandemic, dazzled visitors were as ever taking selfies by the statue of Shankly, with its winning inscription: \u201cHe made the people happy.\u201d</p> <p>Whether it was quite such a privilege to be there in health terms is a question a growing number of Liverpool supporters have been asking.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s us done for the day, thank you for reading. Here\u2019s a summary of events: The number of Covid-19 cases in the US has now gone past 33,000, with 417 deaths. New York is a hotspot for the virus, accounting for 5% of cases worldwide. Rand Paul has become the first US senator to test positive for Covid-19. The national guard have been deployed to New York, Washington and California to help with the outbreak in those states. Democrats have blocked an economic stimulus package, claiming it favored big business over the rights of workers. Trump signs off by saying he will be back for another briefing tomorrow. He also says his initial instinct is to cut foreign aid during the coronavirus outbreak but he may reconsider. \u201cBy the time they walk those list into my office, I say, we have to keep doing that. That\u2019s humanity,\u201d he says. Trump is asked if he sold stock in the run up to the outbreak. He describes it as a \u201cnasty\u201d question. He goes into a rambling answer even by his own standards. \u201cIt cost me billions of dollars to be president,\u201d he says before praising Melania as a great first lady and a then segues into a riff about the fact that George Washington had two desks, presumably a reference to the fact that he was the president and a businessman. Trump then adds he is now a \u201cwartime\u201d president. \u201cI\u2019m glad that this team and me are here for this horrible thing,\u201d he says. Trump is upbeat about medicine\u2019s fight against Covid-19, despite the fact that a vaccine is in all likelihood at least a year away. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get anybody overly excited, but I\u2019m very excited by the prospect of it,\u201d says the president. \u201cThen in addition to that, NIH is working on vaccines and they\u2019re making great progress. But the vaccine does have to be tested for a long period of time because you can\u2019t give thousands and millions a vaccine and it turns out to be dangerous, so that does have to be tested. But this one\u2019s been taken for a long time, so we know pretty much one result.\u201d Trump is asked if undocumented people are welcome to be tested without fear of being reported to authorities. He defers to the surgeon general, Jerome Adams, who says that undocumented workers should be allowed to be tested. Mike Pence adds that border protection are not targeting emergency rooms to look for undocumented people. More from the Associated Press on the delay in the $1tn economic stimulus package today: Democrats in the U.S. Senate on Sunday blocked legislation that would pump well over $1 trillion into the American economy on programs to help companies losing business during the coronavirus outbreak and unemployed workers. The measure faltered after it failed to get the necessary 60 votes in the 100-member chamber to clear a procedural hurdle after days of negotiations. The bill is Congress\u2019 third effort to blunt the economic toll of a disease that has killed at least 400 people in the United States and sickened more than 33,000, leading governors to order nearly a third of the nation\u2019s population to stay at home and putting much business activity on hold. The measure envisages financial aid for regular Americans, small businesses and critically affected industries, including airlines. Democrats had raised objections to the Senate bill throughout the day, with the Senate\u2019s top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, saying it had \u201cmany, many problems\u201d and would benefit corporate interests at the expense of hospitals, healthcare workers, cities and states. The failure of the measure to move forward sends Democrats and Republicans back to the negotiating table. The speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, said earlier on Sunday that Democrats in that chamber will begin crafting an alternative to the Senate bill. Trump says no one said \u201cthank you\u201d after he gave away his salary as the US president. \u201cI get excoriated all the time,\u201d he says. What this has to do with a global pandemic is unclear. Trump is asked about help for New York City, with the mayor, Bill de Blasio, saying the city needs urgent help and supplies. Trump says de Blasio is \u201ctrying very hard\u201d because no one has \u201cever seen this scale\u201d of a disaster. Trump then talks about sterilizing facemasks so they don\u2019t need to be thrown away and how alcohol companies are manufacturing hand sanitizer. As news breaks that the Senate has failed to advance the coronavirus bill, Trump says the economic stimulus package is important so US companies \u2013 large and small \u2013 can be helped. He is then asked if he will reach out to former presidents for advice. He says he has an \u201cincredible\u201d team already and he \u201cdoesn\u2019t see\u201d a situation where he would reach out to George W Bush or Barack Obama. Trump resumes his criticism of China. He says he wished China \u201chad told us three months sooner\u201d about coronavirus. He adds that \u201cwe could have saved a lot of lives.\u201d Trump is asked if he will free elderly, non-violent criminals from federal prisons to alleviate the outbreak in the penal system: \u201cWe are actually looking at it, yes\u201d he says. The president is asked when the last time he had contact with Rand Paul, who has tested positive for Covid-19, was. Trump says it was not recently. He is told four senators are now in isolation after coming into contact with Paul. When he finds out that one is Mitt Romney he says, with a hint of a smile: \u201cGee that\u2019s too bad.\u201d He is asked if he is being sarcastic. \u201cNo,\u201d he replies. He is asked if senators in isolation could be allowed to vote remotely on an economic stimulation package. Trump says that he would be in favor of doing so. Donald Trump is back at the podium to take questions from the press. He repeats Mike Pence\u2019s hopes that a new test will soon be available that will give patients their results much more quickly than under the present system. He repeats accusations that he has made in the past that any problems are not down to him but rather than the \u201cbroken\u201d system he inherited. Pence says America is in a better state than many countries in Europe and Asia because Donald Trump banned travel from China and Europe early on. While countries like Italy are experiencing huge death tolls, many countries in Europe and Asia have - at this stage - much lower deathrates than America and appear to be better prepared. The vice-president, Mike Pence, is speaking now. He says there is a \u201cbipartisan\u201d spirit to the fight against Covid-19 and it is a great credit to America. He says testing is becoming more widely available every day. Peter Gaynor, the Fema administrator, speaks and emphasizes that the deployment of the National Guard does not mean martial law has been imposed in the three states where they will serve. Trump ends by addressing Americans about the fight against what he says is an \u201cinvisible enemy\u201d: \u201cIt is a challenging time, a great national trial. We will prove that we meet the moment, we are at war in a real sense.\u201d To those who may feel isolated he says: \u201cWe are all joined together as one people ... no American is alone as long as we are united. We are very united. You will have a leader who will always fight for you, this is going to be a great victory.\u201d He says he thinks the fight against Covid-19 can be won in good time: \u201cThis will be a great victory. This is going to be a victory. And it\u2019s going to be a victory that in my opinion will happen much sooner than originally expected. It\u2019s now attacking. The enemy is attacking, 144 countries at this moment. One hundred and forty-four. That\u2019s unthinkable. There\u2019s never been anything like this. And it\u2019s vicious. It is vicious. Some people recover well, some people have a hard time. We all know that.\u201d He ends by saying that he thinks the economy will bounce back once the outbreak ends: \u201cWe will then get our economy up to a level that it was and in my opinion beyond, because there will be a pent-up demand. There is a pent-up demand. And a lot of great things will happen.\u201d Not everyone agrees. Trump has moved away from figures to tell the country that he has very high poll ratings among military veterans. The President appears to be less freewheeling than usual, and is unrolling a long list of figures of the relief effort. He goes on to add that he wants to make sure that military veterans are protected during the coronavirus outbreak. Donald Trump says the US economy will \u201cskyrocket\u201d once the \u201cwar\u201d against Covid-19 is won. He says the national guard has been ordered to help with the fight against the virus in New York, California and Washington, where the outbreak has hit hard. He says he spoke to the governors of all three states and they will have control of the national guard in their respective states. He says additional supplies will go the three states, including extra beds and facemasks. He says the supplies will be delivered in the next 48 hours. He also says Major Disaster Declarations have been approved for New York and Washington with approval for California to come. The Coronavirus Task Force\u2019s press briefing at the White House is about to start, nearly 90 minutes late but better late than never. Donald Trump starts the conference by saying the country is trying to repatriate two groups of young Americans in Peru and Honduras. Trump once again pretty much goes against the language of everyone else in the country by calling Covid-19 \u201cthe China virus\u201d. The president reminds Anericans to wash their hands and practice social distancing. He also confirms Senator Rand Paul has Coronavirus. The US ambassador to the West African country of Burkina Faso, Andrew Young, has tested positive for Covid-19. Italy\u2019s ambassador to the country, along with several of the nation\u2019s government ministers, have also tested positive for the virus. The announcement of a statewide shelter-in-place order by the Louisiana governor, John Bel Edwards, is a marker of the growing concern that the state, and specifically the New Orleans metro area, could become a major Covid-19 hotspot. There are now 837 confirmed coronavirus cases in Louisiana, compared with 15,168 in the state of New York and 1,536 in California \u2013 both states with millions more residents. The state, in the deep south of the America, now ranks third in per capita confirmed test results, in states across the US, behind New York and Washington. The confirmed cases are partially a result of Louisiana rolling out more testing in recent days \u2013 the city of New Orleans began drive-through testing over the weekend and also lowered the threshold for individuals displaying symptoms to receive a test. But the testing also indicates that the virus has spread throughout the state, with more than half of Louisiana\u2019s parishes (local jurisdictions that are the same as counties in other states) confirming at least one case. Furthermore, there are now 20 confirmed deaths in Louisiana caused by Covid-19, compared with 28 in California and 76 in New York \u2013 again both states with vastly larger populations. Fifteen of these deaths occurred in the New Orleans metro area, with six at a single nursing home in New Orleans. Mitt Romney has said he will self-quarantine after his fellow Republican senator, Rand Paul, tested positive for Covid-19. Romney said he had sat next to Paul for \u201cextended periods\u201d in recent days. The Coronavirus Task Force\u2019s briefing from the White House, which was due to start at 4.30pm then 5pm ET, is now scheduled for 5.30pm. It\u2019s perhaps not encouraging that the people charged with protecting the US from a pandemic can\u2019t get a press conference started on time. It\u2019s fair to say Arizona\u2019s Kyrsten Sinema is not pleased about unconfirmed reports her fellow senator Rand Paul went to the gym while waiting for the results of his (positive) coronavirus test: On Sunday police in Washington DC shut down streets in the nation\u2019s capital that are popular with sightseers out to look at the capital\u2019s cherry blossoms. There were fears that the crowds would help spread Covid-19. Perhaps no surprise Louisiana has decided to issue a stay at home order \u2013 the virus is spreading incredibly fast in the state. Faster than anywhere in the world according to one source: Reports are emerging that Utah senator Mike Lee is in self-quarantine under advice from medical staff, although there has been no confirmation that he has Covid-19. Still, with the news that his fellow senator Rand Paul has the virus it\u2019s not encouraging news for some of the most powerful people in the US that the Senate gym is still open. It should also be noted that Kansas senator Jerry Moran said he saw Paul in the swimming pool this morning, which would be an odd choice seeing as Paul had earlier been tested for the virus. He is also a qualified ophthalmologist, so it\u2019s not like he is unaware of the basics of medicine. Further afield , it appears likely that the 2020 Olympics will be postponed (making them possibly the 2021 Olympics). The IOC has dithered on the matter while sports leagues around the world have postponed or suspended seasons. Here\u2019s our story: The International Olympic Committee has paved the way for the Tokyo Games to be postponed after giving itself a four-week deadline to consider its options. While the IOC has emphatically ruled out cancelling the Olympics, it will consider a scaled down Games as well as delaying them for a few months or, more likely, a year. Only last week the IOC president, Thomas Bach, insisted that there was \u201cNo Plan B\u201d, but it has since softened its stance amid mounting criticism by athletes amid the coronavirus crisis. The IOC will now examine several scenarios over the next month, but it is thought that deferring to the summer of 2021 is the most likely option. In a statement released after its executive board met on Sunday the IOC confirmed it would look at \u201cmodifying existing operational plans for the Games to go ahead on 24 July 2020, and also for changes to the start date of the Games.\u201d Donald Trump is scheduled to speak at 5pm ET but it looks like the $1tn package to help the battered US economy is in trouble. The Republican-majority Senate is looking to vote despite disagreement from Democrats in Congress. Speaker Nancy Pelosi even said on Sunday that House Democrats may look to pursue their own legislation. \u201cIt\u2019s on the Senate side now because that\u2019s their deadline for a vote,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll be introducing our own bill and hopefully, it will be compatible with what they discussed in the Senate.\u201d Utah has reported its first death from Covid-19. Health officials said the man had been at Lakeview Hospital in Bountiful for two days and tested positive for the virus on Saturday. He has not been named but was over 60 and had existing health problems. Ohio and Louisiana have now joined states such as Illinois, New York and California in telling residents to stay at home. The orders will come into effect in both states from Monday evening. All non-essential businesses will close but residents will be allowed to leave their homes for activities such as exercise, grocery shopping and medical emergencies. \u201cThe bottom line is we are in a race against time when it comes to this coronavirus and its rapid spread in Louisiana,\u201d the state\u2019s governor, John Bel Edwards said on Sunday. The Washington Post reports that New York-Presbyterian hospitals have banned visitors - including partners -for women giving birth, due to fears they could help spread Covid-19 among patients and medical staff. \u201cFor the time being, we really do need to exclude all visitors, including partners for women admitted in labor. This is intended to protect all of us,\u201d Dena Goffman, the quality and patient-safety leader for obstetrics across the New York-Presbyterian Weill Cornell enterprise, told the Post. It was hoped drive-thru sites would increase the number of Americans getting access to tests for Covid-19. But the system as a whole appears to be struggling with long delays reported at many sites - for tests and the results of those tests. As of Saturday, around 195,000 people in the US had been tested, although that number does not include private facilities. \u201cWe need to be testing more broadly to fully understand the scope of the public health situation we are facing,\u201d said Joseph Wendelken, a spokesman for the Rhode Island Department of Health. Hopes of a package being agreed today to stimulate the embattled US economy are fading. Here\u2019s the latest from the Associated Press: Top-level negotiations between Congress and the White House teetered Sunday on a ballooning nearly $1.4tn economic rescue package, as the coronavirus crisis deepened and Donald Trump called for a deal to steady a shuttered nation. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin indicated an agreement is within reach, but congressional Republican and Democratic leaders said there was no deal yet after an hour-long meeting at the otherwise empty US Capitol. With a population on edge, societal norms rewritten and financial markets shell shocked, all sides were hoping for an agreement that would provide some relief against the pandemic\u2019s twin health and economic crises, now believed likely to stretch for several months. \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to talk,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Democrats would be putting forward their own draft bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed the Senate would press ahead Sunday with a planned procedural vote as negotiations continue. \u201cAt some point here, we\u2019ll have to stop,\u201d he warned. He wants passage of the package by Monday. Just a reminder, you can follow the wider effect of Covid-19 on our global liveblog, including the news that German Chancellor Angela Merkel is in quarantine after a doctor who gave her a vaccine tested positive for coronavirus. You can follow the full story here: New York governor Andrew Cuomo is on CNN and says he thinks 40-80% of people in his state, which has a population of just under 20 million, will get Covid-19. He wants to \u201cslow that rate so it doesn\u2019t overwhelm the hospital system\u201d. He says slowing the rate of infection is crucial to prevent spikes from putting too much strain on hospitals. New York now has 15,168 confirmed cases - or 5% of cases worldwide. That\u2019s a rise of 4,812 since Saturday, although some of that number is due to more widespread testing. 114 people in the state have died from Covid-19. On a wider level, he thinks the federal government should nationalize the medical supply system as states are competing against each other to buy equipment like facemasks, which drives up prices for everyone. Peter T Gaynor, of Fema, said earlier in the day that the scramble for equipment would mean some states would have to wait in line. \u201cThere\u2019s hundreds of requests \u2013 virtually every state in the union looking for the same thing, and it\u2019s not just the demand nationally, it\u2019s a demand globally for these items,\u201d said Gaynor. Rand Paul of Kentucky has become the first US senator to test positive for Covid-19. A statement on his Twitter account said the 57-year-old is asymptomatic - that may raise questions why he was tested in the first place, although the statement said he was tested due out of \u201can abundance of caution due to his extensive travel and events\u201d. The statement said Paul was not aware of any direct contact with an infected person. He expects to be back in the Senate once his quarantine ends. Paul was a candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2016 presidential election. It\u2019s been a morning of back-and-forth jabs between the President of the United States and some of the country\u2019s 50 governors. Check out the highlights: New York governor Andrew Cuomo called on Donald Trump to invoke the Defense Production Act Cuomo\u2019s pressers have garnered praise, especially compared to Trump\u2019s chaotic White House briefings New York City mayor Bill de Blasio added to the fire, blasting Trump for the chaos and the federal government\u2019s delayed coronavirus response. Not to be outdone, Trump angry tweeted attacks on critics in response to the criticism Stay tuned for more highlights and updates throughout the day. Fauci: \u2018No disagreement\u2019 with POTUS on COVID-19 drug Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CBS\u2019 Face the Nation on Sunday that he has no disagreement with President Donald Trump over whether a drug used to treat COVID-19 is actually on the way. The government\u2019s top infectious disease expert insisted Trump was expressing hope based on anecdotal reports he heard that a malaria drug could be used for the coronavirus. Last week, Trump asserted that tests had provided evidence the drug is useful for COVID-19, a statement Fauci contradicted during televised White House briefings. Trump also falsely suggested that the FDA had just cleared the drug specifically for the viral pandemic, forcing the entity to release a statement denying the drug\u2019s approval. It is awaiting clinical trials. Fauci explained that Trump was merely \u201ctrying to bring hope to the people\u201d by relaying new drug information, but added his own job is to \u201cprove definitively from a scientific job that [those drugs] do work.\u201d President Donald Trump responded to critics of the White House\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic, tweeting Sunday that they should not be \u201cblaming the federal government for their own shortcomings.\u201d Earlier in the day, Democratic lawmakers, including Illinois\u2019 governor JB Pritzker and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, went on Sunday morning political TV shows claiming they to fight with states over medical resources. The lawmakers questioned why Trump hasn\u2019t yet made military resources available despite triggering the Defense Production Act late last week. Trump, in response, insisted his administration is not to blame for a delayed response to the initial outbreak and lack of resources for medical teams. Noticeably absent from Trump\u2019s attacks on specific lawmakers is New York governor Andrew Cuomo, who continues to draw praise from his assertive and informative updates on the coronavirus outbreak in his state, in direct contrast to the president. Still, the president claims rumors (or the quoted words of lawmakers themselves) about a lack of federal cooperation are fake news. As the US braces for the looming impact of the coronavirus pandemic, Americans are looking for an authoritative voice to reassure the nation it\u2019s prepared. They\u2019re finding that voice in New York governor Andrew Cuomo. Following his Sunday morning presser in which the governor implored the federal government to step up response efforts and finger-wagged \u201cirresponsible\u201d young people still not social distancing, Cuomo was inundated with responses online from Americans across the country expressing gratitude for his leadership. The New York governor\u2019s daily briefings are increasingly drawing comparisons to the often hostile and confusing pressers offered by the White House and President Donald Trump. In contrast, Trump has downplayed the virus or provided inaccurate information, forcing the CDC and FDA to issue corrections. Despite the criticism, the president has remained mostly combative with reporters who\u2019ve questioned the appropriateness of his tone and actions amid a growing pandemic. While actor and producer Mark Ruffalo noted \u201cNew Yorkers are lucky to have a leader\u201d like Cuomo, the praise extended beyond state borders.

US State Department hits France over prisoner swap with Iran The Trump administration lashed out at France on Sunday for releasing an Iranian man wanted for prosecution. Jalal Rohollahnejad was the subject of a extradition request on charges of violating American sanctions on Iran. He was released from French custody on Friday in an apparent swap instead. In exchange Iran released French researcher Roland Marchal, who had been detained for more than 8 months on charges of violating state security laws. US State department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement: The United States and France have a shared interest in bringing those accused of serious crimes to justice, particularly in cases with national security implications. It is regrettable in this instance that France failed to uphold its treaty obligations and prevented justice from being pursued.\u201d Iranian state TV reported late Friday that Marchal had been freed, just hours after French authorities released Ruhollahnejad. Sen. Elizabeth Warren calls for nationwide closure of immigration courts Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren urged US Attorney General Bill Barr to close US immigration courts nationwide as the country grapples with the coronavirus outbreak. In a letter to sent to the US Justice department, Senator Warren called Barr\u2019s handling of immigration and CDC cooperation \u201cirresponsible,\u201d claiming the department is \u201cputting people\u2019s health at risk.\u201d \u201cCourtrooms and waiting areas remain full of people,\u201d Senator Warren said. \u201cLimited availability of testing means that we do not know who is sick and transmitting the virus.\u201d NY Governor to young people: \u2018You are not immune to this\u2019 According to the New York governor Andrew Cuomo, \u201c18-49 year-olds represent 53%\u201d of the total number of confirmed coronaviruses cases statewide. \u201cToo many young people are not taking things serious &amp; this why this is going to get much worse,\u201d Governor Cuomo said. \u201cI say to the young people of America, you are not immune to this. It\u2019s a very nasty sickness.\u201d As part of his now-daily briefings on the state\u2019s crisis response, Cuomo laid into young people for continuing to party and congregate in many of the state\u2019s public parks: \u201cIt\u2019s insensitive, it\u2019s arrogant, it\u2019s self destructive. It\u2019s disrespectful to other people and it has to stop and it has to stop now. This is not a joke and I am not kidding. Bill De Blasio, the mayor of New York City, warned on Sunday that essential hospital supplies would be exhausted in barely more than a week, leading to the deaths of many more people. In comments sharply critical of what he sees as a botched federal response to the escalating Coronavirus crisis, De Blasio said: \u201cIt feels like we\u2019re on our own.\u201d Speaking on CNN, the mayor said: \u201cWe\u2019re about 10 days away now from seeing widespread shortages of ventilators, surgical masks, the things necessary to keep a hospital system running. \u201cWe have seen next to nothing from the federal government at this point. We\u2019ve made this plea publicly, privately, letters, phone calls, very little has arrived. \u201cThe military has not been mobilized. The Defense Production Act has not been utilized in any way I can see. Not just for New York City, New York state, for a lot of the country, it feels like we\u2019re on our own at this point. We\u2019re not seeing action from the federal government.\u201d He added bluntly: \u201cIf we don\u2019t get more ventilators in the next 10 days, people will die.\u201d New York\u2019s hospitals are dealing with a \u201cdeluge\u201d of Coronavirus cases, the New York Times reported, with critical shortages of equipment in several boroughs including Bronx and Brooklyn. By Saturday night, hospitals statewide were already handling more than 10,000 cases. Speaking later Sunday on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, De Blasio said: \u201cApril is going to be a lot worse than March and I fear May will be worse than April. \u201cIf the president does not act, people will die who could have lived otherwise.\u201d New York governor Andrew Cuomo called on US President Donald Trump and the federal government to increase its response to the coronavirus pandemic spreading throughout the US. At his daily press conference Sunday, Governor Cuomo implored the president to enact the Defense Production Act, which would mandate firms to make essential medical supplies such as masks. \u201cWe are ready to go as soon as the federal government is ready to go,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the federal government did it then they can do it in a very orderly way. They can distribute these goods by need rather than have these states competing with each other.\u201d In the press conference Cuomo offered a scathing indictment of the federal government\u2019s continued delays and missteps, specifically calling on the president to \u201ccut the red tape, cut the bureaucracy\u201d. \u201cTime matters, minutes count and this is literally a matter of life and death,\u201d Cuomo said. The Defense Production Act, passed in the 1950s, allows the president to \u201cprioritize and accept government contracts\u201d with private sector companies to produce needed materials during war or national emergency. Despite growing calls, so far, the Trump administration has been inconsistent. Trump first issued an executive order invoking the act this week, but has resisted using it to mobilize private industry. From The New York Times: Mr. Trump has given mixed signals about whether his administration has actually used the law at all to spur the production of scarce and necessary items like ventilators; testing kits; and protective masks, gloves, and gowns.
