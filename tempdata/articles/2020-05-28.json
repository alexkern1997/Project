According to their tally of official figures at least 5,682,389 people are known to have contracted the virus since the pandemic began, while at least 354,944 people are known to have died.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>US deaths pass 100,000. </strong>Data from Johns Hopkins University shows that the United States has recorded more than 100,000 deaths from Covid-19, moving past a sombre milestone even as many states relax mitigation measures to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. The US has recorded more deaths from the disease than any other country in the pandemic, and almost three times as many as the second-ranking country, Britain, which has recorded more than 37,000 Covid-19 deaths. The latest count of fatalities is 100,047. Earlier this month, president Donald Trump said 100,000 deaths would be \u201chorrible\u201d, but he claimed that actions by his administration had prevented a much higher toll.</li> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/27/tory-anger-at-dominic-cummings-grows-as-dozens-of-mps-defy-boris-johnson\">61 Conservative MPs continued to defy British PM Boris Johnson\u2019s calls to \u201cmove on\u201d</a></strong> from the Dominic Cummings crisis as a senior minister broke ranks to accuse the special adviser of inconsistencies in his account of his behaviour during lockdown.The intervention of Penny Mordaunt deepened the turmoil within government following revelations by the Guardian and Daily Mirror that Cummings had travelled 260 miles to his family estate in Durham with his wife suffering coronavirus symptoms.The former chancellor Sajid Javid also said the journey was not \u201cnecessary or justified\u201d as the number of backbenchers calling for Cummings to resign or be sacked grew to 44, with a total of 60 Tory MPs weighing in to criticise him.Two of those condemning Cummings are government whips.</li> \n   <li><strong> </strong><strong>A medical study in France suggests even mild cases of Covid-19 produce antibodies in almost all patients</strong>. The research raises hopes that everyone who has had the disease could acquire some degree of immunity, although it is not clear for how long or to what degree.</li> \n   <li><strong>The European commission proposed a \u20ac750bn coronavirus recovery fund</strong>, as part of a \u20ac1.85tn budget to help member states whose economies have suffered as a result of the pandemic. The principal beneficiaries will reportedly be Italy and Spain, the hardest-hit EU member states.</li> \n   <li><strong>Greece is preparing to send riot police to its border with Turkey</strong>. Greece\u2019s citizens protection minister, Michalis Chrisochoidis, visited the region ahead of the redeployment of some 400 officers, in anticipation of a resumption of people trying to cross. Turkey is home to nearly 4 million Syrian refugees.</li> \n   <li><strong>Restrictions on movement in Moscow are to be eased from 1 June</strong>after the rate of new infections began to slow in the city, its mayor said. Sergei Sobyanin also announced plans to reopen non-food stores and services such as laundries, dry cleaners, and repair shops.</li> \n   <li><strong>Qatar\u2019s contact tracing app put the sensitive personal details of more than 1 million people at risk</strong>, according to an investigation by Amnesty International. The app, which is mandatory for Qatari residents to install, was configured in a way that would have allowed hackers \u201cto access \u2026 the name, national ID, health status and location data\u201d of users, Amnesty said.</li> \n   <li><strong>Kenya recorded its highest one day rise in cases on Wednesday</strong>, hitting a triple-digit figure for new infections for the first time since the outbreak began. The health minister, Mutahi Kagwe, says it is \u201csombre news\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ecef2e68f084e882655a03e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-27T23:08:47.728Z\">12.08am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Hi, Helen Sullivan with you now.

Thank you to all of those who got in touch with tips, comments and more. My colleague Nick Ames will be picking up the baton now. </p> \n  <p>Here are the top developments from the last few hours: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Known global deaths pass 350,000. </strong>More than 350,000 people have now lost their lives in the coronavirus pandemic worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The current toll stands at 350,456. The number of confirmed cases is 5,589,932, after the number of declared cases doubled in a month, with more than one million new cases registered in the last 11 days. There were 500,000 cases registered in just 48 hours, between Sunday, when cases passed 5 million, and Tuesday, when cases passed 5.5 million. True death tolls and cases are likely to be significantly higher due to differing definitions and testing rates, delays and suspected underreporting. The US alone accounts for less than a third of the global toll, with 98,916 deaths.</li> \n   <li><strong>Tory unrest increases pressure on PM to sack Dominic Cummings. </strong>There is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/26/tory-unrest-increases-pressure-pm-sack-dominic-cummings\">growing revolt within Boris Johnson\u2019s party</a> over his refusal to fire Dominic Cummings, his chief adviser, over his lockdown breach. A<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/26/junior-minister-resigns-over-dominic-cummings-lockdown-trip-douglas-ross\"> junior minister has resigned</a>, and 30 other Conservative MPs have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/26/public-anger-swells-ranks-tory-mps-turning-on-dominic-cummings\">called for Cummings to go</a>. Eight more Tory MPs were publicly critical of Cummings\u2019 actions and three said privately that he should be forced out, according to the Guardian\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/heatherstewart\">Heather Stewart</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rowena-mason\">Rowena Mason</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kate-proctor\">Kate Proctor</a>.</li> \n   <li><strong>The WHO says the Americas are the new epicentre of the disease. </strong>The World Health Organization\u2019s regional director Dr Carissa Etienne said outbreaks were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/global-report-who-says-the-americas-are-centre-of-pandemic-as-cases-surge\">accelerating in countries such as Brazil</a>, where the number of deaths reported in the last week was the highest in the world for a seven-day period since the coronavirus pandemic began. The number of coronavirus infections to accelerate in Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua, she said.</li> \n   <li><strong>New Zealand expects plan for safe travel with Australia in June. </strong>Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Wednesday that a draft blueprint on safely starting travel between New Zealand and Australia will be presented to both governments in early June, Reuters reports. The neighbours have been discussing the possibility of a travel bubble between them as both have slowed the spread of the novel coronavirus to levels well below those in United States, Britain and some other European countries. New Zealand has also reported a fifth consecutive day of no new cases of Covid-19.</li> \n   <li><strong>South Korea reports biggest daily jump in almost 50 days. </strong>South Korea South Korea has reported 40 new coronavirus cases for its biggest daily jump in nearly 50 days, causing alarm in a country where millions of children are returning to school. All but four of the new cases came from the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, where officials have been scrambling to stem transmissions linked to nightclubs, karaoke rooms and an e-commerce warehouse. Three cases were linked to international arrivals. South Korea has also jailed a man for four months for breaking quarantine rules, in the country\u2019s first such prison sentence.</li> \n   <li><strong>Vietnam to readmit foreigners. </strong>Vietnam will resume issuing e-visas to citizens from 80 countries from 1 July, the government said, though it was unclear whether quarantine measures would be lifted. The country imposed a blanket ban on foreigners entering the country in March as part of its aggressive response to the pandemic, which has also involved mass quarantines and expansive contact tracing.So far, Vietnam has not reported any coronavirus deaths.</li> \n   <li><strong>Macron unveils \u20ac8bn French auto rescue, champions electric cars. </strong>President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday announced an \u20ac8bn (US$8.8bn) plan to revive France\u2019s auto industry by making it the European leader in electric cars, boosting a sector brought to its knees by the coronavirus. Macron said the package would include one billion euros in subsidies to encourage purchases of electric and hybrid cars and set a target of France producing a million green cars annually by 2025.The \u201chistoric\u201d intervention will aim to turn France\u2019s rechargeable car industry into Europe\u2019s biggest, the president said.</li> \n   <li><strong>Germany extends distancing rules to end of June. </strong>Germany has extended social distancing rules aimed at containing the spread of the coronavirus epidemic to 29 June, Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s government said on Tuesday. Merkel\u2019s government had been embroiled in disagreements with the least-affected states, some of which wanted to ditch the measures and open up entirely. Germany\u2019s virus caseload now tops 181,200 with just over 8,372 deaths - much lower than European counterparts such as Britain, France, Spain and Italy.</li> \n   <li><strong>India backs hydroxychloroquine for virus prevention. </strong>India\u2019s top biomedical research body has backed the use of the anti-malarial hydroxychloroquine as a preventive against coronavirus, after the WHO suspended clinical trials of the drug over safety concerns. The endorsement from the Indian Council of Medical Research came a week after US President Donald Trump said he was taking the drug as a preventative measure. India - which accounts for 70% of global production of hydroxychloroquine - on Tuesday reported 145,380 cases of the virus including 4,167 deaths.</li> \n   <li><strong>Spain begins 10 days of mourning. </strong>Starting on Wednesday, the country will mourn for the nearly 27,000 people who have died from coronavirus in the country. Flags will be hoisted to half-staff in more than 14,000 public buildings across the country and on Spanish naval vessels until 5 June. It marks the longest official mourning period in Spain\u2019s four-decade-old democracy.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/coronavirus-latest-at-a-glance\">Coronavirus latest: at a glance</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ece002d8f0852d729950738\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-27T05:54:40.169Z\">6.54am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Sabrina Toppa reports for the Guardian from Lahore: </em></p> \n  <p><strong>Pakistan\u2019s garment workers fight for rights amid Covid-19 crisis</strong></p> \n  <p>Police in Karachi last week allegedly shot at hundreds of unarmed garment workers protesting outside a factory supplying denim for global fashion brands.</p> \n  <p>Garment workers claimed to have been charged by police with batons outside a factory which is reported to have fired more than 15,000 workers since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, according to Nasir Mansoor from the National Trade Union Federation.

Around 2.5 million UK residents, hundreds of thousands of whom are in employment, have been identified by the government as being \u201cextremely clinically vulnerable\u201d. They were ordered to shield at home until the end of June, although their employers did not have to furlough them. Research by Citizens Advice found that of the 2,000 people contacting them for help who were either shielding or at higher risk from coronavirus, over 70% had not been furloughed. The research also found that more than one in 10 of the shielded group were working outside the home, including people who had undergone organ transplants or who had serious lung conditions. Here are the latest developments from the last few hours: Known global cases near 5.7m, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. According to their tally of official figures at least 5,682,389 people are known to have contracted the virus since the pandemic began, while at least 354,944 people are known to have died. US deaths pass 100,000. Data from Johns Hopkins University shows that the United States has recorded more than 100,000 deaths from Covid-19, moving past a sombre milestone even as many states relax mitigation measures to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. The US has recorded more deaths from the disease than any other country in the pandemic, and almost three times as many as the second-ranking country, Britain, which has recorded more than 37,000 Covid-19 deaths. The latest count of fatalities is 100,047. Earlier this month, president Donald Trump said 100,000 deaths would be \u201chorrible\u201d, but he claimed that actions by his administration had prevented a much higher toll. 61 Conservative MPs continued to defy British PM Boris Johnson\u2019s calls to \u201cmove on\u201d from the Dominic Cummings crisis as a senior minister broke ranks to accuse the special adviser of inconsistencies in his account of his behaviour during lockdown.The intervention of Penny Mordaunt deepened the turmoil within government following revelations by the Guardian and Daily Mirror that Cummings had travelled 260 miles to his family estate in Durham with his wife suffering coronavirus symptoms.The former chancellor Sajid Javid also said the journey was not \u201cnecessary or justified\u201d as the number of backbenchers calling for Cummings to resign or be sacked grew to 44, with a total of 60 Tory MPs weighing in to criticise him.Two of those condemning Cummings are government whips. A medical study in France suggests even mild cases of Covid-19 produce antibodies in almost all patients. The research raises hopes that everyone who has had the disease could acquire some degree of immunity, although it is not clear for how long or to what degree. The European commission proposed a \u20ac750bn coronavirus recovery fund, as part of a \u20ac1.85tn budget to help member states whose economies have suffered as a result of the pandemic. The principal beneficiaries will reportedly be Italy and Spain, the hardest-hit EU member states. Greece is preparing to send riot police to its border with Turkey. Greece\u2019s citizens protection minister, Michalis Chrisochoidis, visited the region ahead of the redeployment of some 400 officers, in anticipation of a resumption of people trying to cross. Turkey is home to nearly 4 million Syrian refugees. Restrictions on movement in Moscow are to be eased from 1 Juneafter the rate of new infections began to slow in the city, its mayor said. Sergei Sobyanin also announced plans to reopen non-food stores and services such as laundries, dry cleaners, and repair shops. Qatar\u2019s contact tracing app put the sensitive personal details of more than 1 million people at risk, according to an investigation by Amnesty International. The app, which is mandatory for Qatari residents to install, was configured in a way that would have allowed hackers \u201cto access \u2026 the name, national ID, health status and location data\u201d of users, Amnesty said. Kenya recorded its highest one day rise in cases on Wednesday, hitting a triple-digit figure for new infections for the first time since the outbreak began. The health minister, Mutahi Kagwe, says it is \u201csombre news\u201d. Hi, Helen Sullivan with you now. I\u2019ll be taking you through the latest updates for the next few hours. As always, please do get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan or via email: helen.sullivan[at]theguardian.com. Comments, tips, news from your part of the world are all much appreciated. Tom McCarthy writes that one of the key problems facing American efforts to emerge from the Covid-19 crisis is the population\u2019s aversion to vaccines. Only about half of Americans say they would get a Covid-19 vaccine if available, according to a poll, as a top US government scientist tempered claims by Donald Trump that the United States would be able to invent, manufacture and administer hundreds of millions of vaccine doses by the end of the year. Trump has routinely touted the speedy development of a vaccine as America\u2019s path out of the coronavirus pandemic, which has now taken 100,000 lives in the US. As part of an effort branded \u201cOperation Warp Speed\u201d, Trump has set a goal of a 300m-dose stockpile by January. Vaccine developers say that time frame is \u201caspirational\u201d. But polling published on Wednesday indicates that the country could run up against another obstacle in its fight against the virus: vaccine refusal. Read the full story here Further to our story at 20.29, data from Johns Hopkins University shows that the United States has recorded more than 100,000 deaths from Covid-19, moving past a grim milestone even as many states relax mitigation measures to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. The US has recorded more deaths from the disease than any other country in the pandemic, and almost three times as many as the second-ranking country, Britain, which has recorded more than 37,000 Covid-19 deaths. The latest count of fatalities is 100,047.

Read the full story here Chechnya\u2019s autocratic leader Ramzan Kadyrov has reappeared in public for the first time in nearly a fortnight, Andrew Roth writes, after unconfirmed reports that he had flown to Moscow for treatment for coronavirus. Kadyrov was filmed on Tuesday in Grozny, Chechnya\u2019s capital, holding a government meeting on the region\u2019s response to the pandemic and delivering 10 ambulances to local hospitals. Russian journalists noted what appeared to be a cannula on his right arm. In remarks on Instagram on Wednesday, Kadyrov did not confirm that he had contracted coronavirus but offered a vigorous defence of his right to fall ill. Read the full story here Hollywood studios are planning on recruiting COVID-19 consultants to keep sets safe, according to a report by Reuters. The coronavirus pandemic has prompted producers, movie studios and workers\u2019 unions to seek expert advice on how to safely reopen film and TV sets, which shut down worldwide in mid-March. In demand are epidemiologists and other public health specialists to provide detailed strategies for dealing with large crews who work in cramped spaces, makeup artists who get face-to-face with stars, and actors who kiss, hug and fight on set. The shutdown has taken a severe financial toll across the industry, as well as on cities such as Los Angeles that benefit economically from production.Restarting is important to companies, including Netflix Inc, Walt Disney Co and others, which need fresh programming to engage audiences. While sets remain empty in the United States, productions are ramping back up in South Korea, Australia, Sweden, as well as New Zealand, where James Cameron\u2019s Avatar 2 is restarting this week. People who work in the industry expect to see smaller crews, regular testing, hand sanitiser everywhere and the use of computer-generated imagery to create big crowds on screen when work resumes. Our current splash by Rowena Mason reports that 60 Conservative MPs continued to defy British PM Boris Johnson\u2019s calls to \u201cmove on\u201d from the Dominic Cummings crisis as a senior minister broke ranks to accuse the special adviser of inconsistencies in his account of his behaviour during lockdown. The intervention of Penny Mordaunt deepened the turmoil within government following revelations by the Guardian and Daily Mirror that Cummings had travelled 260 miles to his family estate in Durham with his wife suffering coronavirus symptoms. The former chancellor Sajid Javid also said the journey was not \u201cnecessary or justified\u201d as the number of backbenchers calling for Cummings to resign or be sacked grew to 44, with a total of 60 Tory MPs weighing in to criticise him. Two of those condemning Cummings are government whips. Read the full story here Reuters reports that New York governor Andrew Cuomo called on Congress to \u201cstop abusing\u201d New York and other Democratic-controlled states and release more federal funds to help them combat the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Speaking after meeting Donald Trump at the White House, Cuomo said funding for states and local governments was essential to fostering a national recovery from the outbreak, which has killed almost 100,000 Americans and ravaged the economy. \u201cStates that bore the brunt of the pandemic account for one-third of the national GDP,\u201d said Cuomo, a Democrat whose state has been hit hardest by the outbreak. \u201cHow can you tell one-third of the country to go to heck?\u201d \u201cSo my point to our friends in the Congress - stop abusing New York, stop abusing New Jersey, stop abusing Massachusetts and Illinois and Michigan and Pennsylvania - stop abusing the states who bore the brunt of the COVID virus through no fault of their own,\u201d Cuomo said. Massachusetts has a Republican governor, but the other five states\u2019 governors are Democrats. States have sought more help from the federal government to get through the crisis. Democrats who control the House of Representatives passed legislation on 15 May that would provide nearly $1 trillion for state and local governments, but the bill was rejected by Trump and the Republican-led Senate\u2019s leaders. Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell last month suggested that states whose finances are depleted by the coronavirus pandemic could declare bankruptcy instead of receiving federal aid. The suggestion sparked outrage from some state leaders. Cuomo said his meeting with Trump on Wednesday focused on how to \u201csupercharge\u201d the economy by investing in infrastructure. The NHS tracing system was meant to allow the country to emerge confidently from lockdown. But its development has been characterised by missteps, conflict and frustration behind the scenes, write Dan Sabbagh, Sarah Marsh and Jessica Murray. At the heart of the difficulties have been tensions between central government and local public health officials, or as one insider complained: \u201cThere has been control freakery from start to finish by the NHS and the department of health.\u201d Public health officials say systems and protocols to manage so called \u201ccomplex cases\u201d involving central and local cooperation, such as the outbreak in Weston-super-Mare, have not yet been fully worked out days before schools start reopening on 1 June. Read the full story here Our colleagues running the Guardian US blog write that America\u2019s coronavirus death toll is just hundreds away from reaching 100,000, and at least one database shows the country has already hit that grim milestone. According to NBC News\u2019 numbers, more than 100,000 Americans have already died from coronavirus. However, other databases show slightly different totals because they rely on different sources to calculate the toll. According to widely used data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, which the Guardian has been citing, the US death toll stands at 99,674. The city of Sydney is bracing itself for a rat \u2018plague\u2019 after Covid-19 had forced hungry rodents to turn to cannibalism, Naaman Zhou reports from Australia. Empty offices and restaurants in the city are driving hungry rats into homes and suburbs, and the loosening of restrictions could create \u201ca new rat plague\u201d, according to a leading rat-catcher. As city centres have closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, suburban rat infestations have spiked, according to Geoff Milton, a Sydney rat-catcher with 35 years\u2019 experience. Rats naturally seek out houses during winter, and the sudden drop-off in food and rubbish in our cities is exacerbating the problem. Calls about suburban rats have risen 30% compared with the same time last year, Milton told Guardian Australia. Read the full story here Uki Go\u00f1i in Buenos Aires reports that security forces in Argentina\u2019s capital have cordoned off one of the country\u2019s poorest slums, preventing inhabitants from entering or leaving the neighbourhood after a surge of coronavirus cases. Police officers erected barriers at the entrance to Villa Azul on the outskirts of Buenos Aires on Monday after widespread testing was launched in poorer districts. By Wednesday 174 of 301 tests carried out in Villa Azul had come back positive, and officials expressed concern that if the 4,000 or so inhabitants of the neighbourhood were allowed to move freely, they could spread the virus to other areas nearby. Read the full story here Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: Known global cases exceeded 5.6m, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. According to their tally of official figures at least 5,635,943 people are known to have contracted the virus since the pandemic began, while at least 352,235 people are known to have died. The UK prime minister refused to stage inquiry into his aide\u2019s lockdown breach. Boris Johnson, who has protected Dominic Cummings over his apparent breach, said the country should move on, as a minister and a police watchdog said it was hampering public health efforts. A medical study in France suggests even mild cases of Covid-19 produce antibodies in almost all patients. The research raises hopes that everyone who has had the disease could acquire some degree of immunity, although it is not clear for how long or to what degree.

The health minister, Mutahi Kagwe, says it is \u201csombre news\u201d. As Latin America emerges as the new epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic, Santiago has become one of the region\u2019s most intense battlegrounds, writes John Bartlett in the Chilean capital. The whole of Santiago\u2019s metropolitan area has been placed under quarantine, and health minister Jaime Ma\u00f1alich made a plea for lockdowns to be respected as the health system approaches breaking point. Chile now has 82,289 confirmed coronavirus cases, more than 80% of which are concentrated in the capital where several hospitals have declared that they have reached maximum capacity and 94% of available ventilators are already in use. According to official statistics, 841 people have died in Chile having tested positive for the virus. Ma\u00f1alich announced that 404 new ventilators would soon arrive in Chile, although fears over the health system\u2019s ability to handle the crisis increased on Tuesday as four more patients were flown out of the capital to be treated elsewhere in the country. \u201cThe situation in Santiago is critical, and we are already seeing the first signs of systemic collapse,\u201d explained Jos\u00e9 Miguel Bernucci, the national secretary of Chile\u2019s medical union. \u201cThe worse it gets in the capital, the more we will have to rely on regional health systems which are already disadvantaged in terms of infrastructure and capacity.\u201d Santiago\u2019s metropolitan region has been under quarantine since 15 May and tensions have flared in parts of the city as income and supply chains have been stretched and social security found wanting. Unemployment in the capital has risen to 15.6%, the highest rate in 35 years, and food shortages in the southern suburb of El Bosque saw residents take to the streets in protest last week, with barricades erected across roads and fires lit in parts of the city as unrest simmered. Residents in some districts have since come together to set up makeshift community kitchens to bolster the government\u2019s own emergency food aid programme. The government\u2019s communication strategy has repeatedly come under fire. Three weeks ago, when there were around 16,000 confirmed cases, it had prematurely promoted a \u2018gradual return to normality\u2019 and plans were being made for shopping malls to reopen. Last night\u2019s applause for care workers was more subdued than usual in the centre of Santiago, where it soon tailed off into bursts of pan-bashing from balconies as residents registered their disapproval with the pandemic response. While much of the country has seen cases confirmed, concern remains over the spread of the virus to the coastal cities of Vi\u00f1a del Mar and Valpara\u00edso, the country\u2019s second-largest population centre, which has thus far managed to avoid widespread contagion. Just hours after Mexico recorded its highest rise in infections and deaths of the Covid-19 outbreak so far, its president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, has announced he will resume his travel schedule with a commercial flight to Cancun. The Associated Press reports that L\u00f3pez Obrador has raised concerns throughout his country\u2019s two months of coronavirus restrictions about their potential impact on the economy. Mexico\u2019s social security Institute said in April that the country had lost 550,000 jobs during the epidemic and L\u00f3pez Obrador recently said another 400,000 had been lost in May. His visit to Cancun will be as work gets underway on the Mayan Train railway, one of a number of key infrastructure projects he has refused to halt. He has said the Mayan Train project will be a critical source of employment, expected to generate 80,000 jobs. \u201cI\u2019m going to be careful,\u201d AP quoted him as saying. \u201cIf the airline requires you to use a mask, I\u2019m going to use it.\u201d He said doctors are recommending that he limit his flying and travel more by car, so he planned to drive back to the capital from the Caribbean coast with stops in epidemic hotspots. They will include Veracruz and his home state of Tabasco, where he will visit an oil refinery project. On Tuesday night, the health undersecretary, Hugo Lopez-Gatell, said Mexico was reaching the crest of the epidemic, but said in parts of the country it could drag on into October. For the first time, officials reported more than 500 new confirmed Covid-19 deaths. Mexico has reported more than 74,500 infections and more than 8,100 deaths, both considered to be substantial undercounts because of the country\u2019s extremely low testing rate. The UK has reported another 412 Covid-19 deaths, taking the total official death toll in Europe\u2019s worst affected country to 37,460. So far 267,240 people have tested positive for the coronavirus that causes the disease, with 2,013 more reported in this latest update. Opposition politicians in Tanzania have accused president John Magufuli of covering up a major outbreak of Covid-19 in the southern African country, writes Jason Burke, the Guardian\u2019s Africa correspondent. Magufuli has repeatedly played down the threat from the pandemic and refused to impose a strict lockdown as many other leaders on the continent have. Instead the 60-year-old has encouraged the country\u2019s 56 million inhabitants to keep working and socialising, while a key ally announced a three-day \u2018Corona Party\u2019 in Dar es Salaam, the commercial capital, this weekend to give thanks to God for what he claimed was a reduction in levels of infection. An effective track and trace system to prevent a second coronavirus peak will not only save lives, it could reduce the number of working hours lost to illness by as much as 50%, according to a major global study, writes Philip Inman for the Guardian\u2019s business desk. The International Labour Organisation said the effective testing and tracing of infections was essential if employers wanted staff to return to work and for them to stay healthy. The Geneva-based, United Nations body estimates that working hour losses can be reduced from around 14% in countries that put in place weak tracking and tracing down to 7% in countries with the \u201chighest intensity of tracking and tracing\u201d. With only four days until England introduces a testing and tracing scheme to prevent a second peak of the virus, the ILO said an effective system was needed or employers and workers would miss out on much of the benefit of returning to work. If workers remained wary about the health threats of returning to work, it would leave many vulnerable people excluded and exposed to the threat of redundancy. More than 400 repatriated Malawians, including more than a dozen infected with coronavirus, have fled a stadium and isolation centre where they were being detained. The 441 people, who were bussed back to the country from South Africa on Monday, had been held while they underwent testing for the virus. Sixteen were being kept in an isolation centre after testing positive, while the rest were being were being kept at a football stadium awaiting their test results, a local health official told AFP. \u201cThey have all gone home on their own,\u201d district health officer Gift Kawaladzira told AFP. \u201cBy then, 16 were positive already. Others were waiting for lab results,\u201d he said. \u201cIf most of them have Covid-19, then we are facing very difficult times ahead.\u201d Kawaladzira said his team had mobilised other district offices to track down the escapees. \u201cThe danger is that they will be hiding from authorities... and hence cannot follow the set procedures for COVID-19 prevention,\u201d he said. Malawi has recorded just 101 coronavirus cases so far, including four deaths. South Africa by contrast has the highest number of infections of the continent, with more than 24,000 cases and 524 fatalities to date. Deaths from coronavirus in Italy rose by 117 on Wednesday, up from 78 on Tuesday, bringing the total to 33,072, writes Angela Giuffrida, the Guardian\u2019s Rome correspondent. New infections increased by 584, up from 397, the vast majority in the Lombardy region. There are 50,966 people who are currently suffering from the virus in Italy, down by 1,976 within the last 24 hours. Italy has 231,139 confirmed cases to date, including the deaths and 147, 101 survivors. Kenya recorded its highest one day rise in coronavirus cases on Wednesday, hitting a triple-digit figure for new infections for the first time since the outbreak began. \u201cToday, I come to you with sombre news,\u201d the health minister, Mutahi Kagwe, was quoted as saying by France\u2019s AFP news agency. \u201cOur figures today are staggering. Out of the 3,077 samples tested, we have 123 positive cases. For the first time we have hit a triple digit. \u201cThis is the highest number of positive cases we have ever recorded in a single day since we recorded the first case on March 13.\u201d A total of 1,471 cases of COVID-19 have been recorded in Kenya since the start of the epidemic. Of these, 55 have been fatal. The tally of infections has doubled since mid-May but the country has also tripled its number of daily tests, from less than 1,000 to nearly 3,000, which has helped unearth more cases. Among its anti-coronavirus measures, Kenya has a national 7pm-5am curfew, which is currently in force until 6 June, and a ban on entering or exiting the cities of Nairobi, Mombasa, Kilifi, Kwale and Mandera. A security flaw in Qatar\u2019s coronavirus contact tracing app put the sensitive personal details of more than a million people at risk, according to an investigation by Amnesty International, writes Alex Hern, the Guardian\u2019s UK technology editor. The app, which is mandatory for Qatari residents to install, was configured in a way that would have allowed hackers \u201cto access highly sensitive personal information, including the name, national ID, health status and location data of more than 1 million users\u201d, according to Amnesty International\u2019s security lab. Claudio Guarnieri, the lab\u2019s head, said the flaws, fixed following their discovery, \u201cshould act as a warning to governments around the world rushing out contact tracing apps that are too often poorly designed and lack privacy safeguards\u201d. The Qatari app uses a mixture of GPS and Bluetooth technology to track Covid-19 cases and warn people who may have been exposed to an infectious person. Like the UK\u2019s app, it operates on a centralised model allowing the country\u2019s interior ministry access to the information it gathers. A medical study in France suggests that even mild cases of coronavirus infection, not requiring hospital treatment, produce antibodies in almost all patients, the body\u2019s defences against the virus increasing during the weeks of recovery, writes Peter Beaumont. The research, led by a team from the Pasteur Institute, France, raises hopes that everyone who has had the disease could acquire some degree of immunity, although it is not clear for how long or to what degree. The question of immunity has become one of the most vexed issues concerning coronavirus, in terms of governments\u2019 public health policies \u2013 including the controversial herd immunity route \u2013 and in the understanding of the mechanics of the disease, which divides scientists. Early reports had suggested an absence or limited presence of antibodies in some individuals with mild symptoms. The research, jointly led by Olivier Schwartz, head of the Pasteur Institute\u2019s virus and immunity unit, took samples from more than 160 staff from the CHU hospital, in Strasbourg, who became infected with Covid-19 early in March after a \u201csuper-propagation\u201d event \u2013 linked to a five-day long prayer and fasting gathering of the evangelical Christian Open Door church in Mulhouse, eastern France. Coronavirus restrictions will be eased in Moscow, the Russian capital, from 1 June, after the rate of new infections began to slow in the city, its mayor has said. During a teleconference with the president, Vladimir Putin, on Wednesday, Sergei Sobyanin said people will be allowed to take walks at designated times, and he announced plans to reopen non-food stores and services such as laundries, dry cleaners, and repair shops. Muscovites have been subject to movement restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus since 31 March. With a total of 171,443 confirmed coronavirus cases, the accounts for a little less than half of Russia\u2019s caseload of 370,000, and about 55% of the country\u2019s confirmed death toll from Covid-19. Sobyanin said the number of new infections in the city has been going down in the past two weeks. Brazil\u2019s top diplomat in the US has dismissed suggestions that relations between the countries have been hurt by a travel ban imposed by Washington on Wednesday. Nestor Forster, Brazil\u2019s charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires in Washington, told the Associated Press that the ban on arrivals to the US from Brazil was not a setback, \u201cnot in any shape or form. It\u2019s a public health measure confined to that area.\u201d On the contrary, Forster said, the Bolsonaro administration is grateful that the US gave it advance warning of the measure, as well as for \u201cgifts\u201d to cope with the Covid-19 pandemic, including 1,000 ventilators for the Brazilian Health Ministry and a $7 million to fund health services. \u201cWe are very appreciative of the fact that, you know, there was some consultation beforehand when the president decided to go forward with this measure,\u201d Forster said in a video call from his Washington home on Tuesday. Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil\u2019s president, is an outspoken admirer of the US president, Donald Trump. Brazil is the Latin American country hardest hit by the coronavirus, with more than 24,000 deaths and almost 400,000 confirmed cases. Experts say those figures are significantly underestimated due to insufficient testing. France, Italy and Belgium have begun to halt the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat patients with Covid-19, amid questions about the safety of the generic anti-malaria drug, Reuters reports. The moves by three of the countries hardest hit by coronavirus infections and deaths follow a World Health Organization decision on Monday to pause a large trial of hydroxychloroquine due to safety concerns. British medical journal The Lancet has reported patients taking hydroxychloroquine had increased death rates and irregular heartbeats, adding to several disappointing results for the drug as a Covid-19 treatment. The World Health Organization\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has used his statement at the WHO\u2019S thrice-weekly coronavirus briefing to outline the organisation\u2019s call for a \u201cgreen recovery\u201d to the Covid-19 crisis. As usual, his comments are being live tweeted by the WHO Twitter account. The World Health Organization\u2019s coronavirus briefing is just beginning. You can watch it in the player at the top of the blog. As Greece and Turkey gradually emerge from pandemic-imposed lockdown, fears are mounting of migrants once again gathering at the land border the two countries share, writes Helena Smith, the Guardian\u2019s Athens correspondent. Highlighting those concerns, Greece\u2019s citizens protection minister, Michalis Chrisochoidis, visited the region today ahead of some 400 riot police officers being redeployed to the area. Turkey\u2019s foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglou, is the latest official to have warned that as the country eases restrictions on movement, enforced to stem the spread of the virus, migrants hoping to get to Europe will \u201cwant to leave.\u201d Reinforcements are being rushed by Athens to the frontier tomorrow. Turkey is home to 4 million mostly Syrian refugees. Memories are still fresh of the crisis that erupted when thousands responded to Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s abrupt decision to \u201copen the gates to Europe\u201d for refugees earlier this year. An estimated 30,000 men, women and children - many bussed in by Turkish forces - converged on the frontier with thousands then attempting to illegally cross over into Greece. In recent days bilateral tensions have been on the rise over Athens\u2019 declared intention to build a fence to bolster the border \u2013 reiterated by Chrysohoidis this afternoon. Meanwhile, migrants forced to endure prolonged quarantine in a facility in the Peloponnese also took to the streets in protest today. Greek authorities announced lockdown measures would be extended for another 14 days after three more coronavirus cases were confirmed in the holding centre \u2013 a hotel in the southern town of Kranidi hosting 470 migrants and refugees mostly from sub-Saharan Africa. The hotel has been under quarantine since 21 April when 153 people first tested positive for the virus. Growing disquiet is also being expressed by aid workers over refugee camps having to put up with prolonged lockdowns when the rest of Greece is relaxing restrictions and re-assuming a semblance of normality. \u201cWe have seen a noticeable rise in all sorts of violence, from tent violence to sexual violence because people are forced to spend much more time in camps,\u201d Apostolos Veizis, the medical director of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res in Greece told the Guardian. \u201cThese people are not treated as human but numbers. The situation for them is utterly inhumane.\u201d Jennifer Rankin, the Guardian\u2019s Brussels correspondent, has now written a report on Europe\u2019s Covid-19 bailout plan. She writes: The European Union executive has called for a \u20ac750bn (\u00a3671bn) recovery plan to help the hardest hit countries find a way out of the unprecedented economic downturn caused by the pandemic. The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said the EU faced a defining moment, never seen in its 70-year history. \u201cThe crisis has huge externalities and spillovers across all countries and none of that can be fixed by any single country alone.\u201d Addressing the European parliament, where MEPs wore face masks and sat further apart than usual under mandatory physical-distancing rules, von der Leyen said the sum would be split into \u20ac500bn of grants for EU member states and \u20ac250bn of loans. Under the commission\u2019s blueprint, Italy would get \u20ac82bn in grants, Spain \u20ac77bn, France \u20ac39bn, Poland \u20ac37bn and Germany \u20ac29bn. The money would be raised by the EU borrowing on capital markets on a far bigger scale than ever before, meeting a key demand from France and Germany, but provoking opposition from fiscal hardliners opposed to shared debt. Reuters has more details on the European commission\u2019s proposals to rescue the economies of member states affected most severely by the coronavirus. The European Union\u2019s executive has proposed \u20ac750bn in grants and loans to prop up economies hammered by the coronavirus crisis, the agency reports. Under the proposal the European commission would borrow the funds from the market and then disburse two-thirds in grants and the rest in loans to cushion the unprecedented slump expected this year due to the coronavirus lockdowns. Much of the money will go to Italy and Spain, the EU nations worst affected by the pandemic. The recovery fund package comes in addition to the EU\u2019s long-term budget for 2021-27, which the commission proposed should be set at \u20ac1.100tn ($1.21tn). \u201cIn total, this European recovery plan will put \u20ac1.85tn to help kick-start our economy and ensure Europe bounces forward,\u201d the commission said. At least 15 Syrian refugees living in the same building in east Lebanon have tested positive for coronavirus, the UN said on Wednesday. \u201cThere are 15 confirmed cases of Covid-19 among Syrian refugees in Majdal Anjar,\u201d a town in the Bekaa Valley, said Lisa Abou Khaled of UNHCR, the UN\u2019s refugee agency, according to the AFP news agency. Before the outbreak in Majdal Anjar, only one other Syrian refugee in Lebanon had tested positive for Covid-19, UNHCR says. The patients in Majdal Anjar are now in self-isolation, receiving food and disinfection kits from UNHCR, Abou Khaled said. Lebanon has officially recorded 1,161 coronavirus cases, including 26 deaths. On Wednesday, the country reported 21 new cases. Among Lebanon\u2019s Palestinian refugee population, at least six cases have been detected in a camp in the Bekaa Valley. Although the coronavirus outbreak among Lebanon\u2019s refugee population remains limited, aid groups are concerned that overcrowded settlements could make refugees especially vulnerable to the virus. Abou Khaled said UNHCR and Lebanon\u2019s health ministry have \u201cinitiated a testing campaign in informal settlements and collective shelters, focusing on areas with high concentration of refugees\u201d. \u201cThousands of refugees will be included in the testing campaign... over the next weeks,\u201d she added. A reader has written to me with some clarification of the situation in Poland, after I earlier reported that the government in the country was to lift a requirement that people wear masks in public. That is only part of the story, I\u2019m told. According to the email sent to me earlier: In your coronavirus live news coverage you published information that \u201cPeople in Poland will be allowed to go outside without face masks from 30 May,\u201d That\u2019s not whole truth From 30 May people going outside can not wear masks if they can keep 2m distance, but if that is not possible eg. in the crowded sidewalk we are still obliged to cover our mouth and nose (with masks, scarfs or other things). We are also still obliged to cover our mouth and nose in buses, shops, cinemas and theatres, tattoo salons, churches and offices. Here is a link to the Polish government\u2019s official information on requirements (in Polish). Damien Gayle back on the case now. Remember, if you have any comments, tips or suggestions for coverage you can reach me via email at damien.gayle@theguardian.com, or via Twitter direct message to @damiengayle. Cyprus hopes to regain lost ground in its tourism sector from July and expects to be able to readmit British and Russian visitors by then after weeks of lockdown, Reuters reports. The Mediterranean island moved swiftly to contain the outbreak, ordering a broad lockdown within days of its first registered case on 9 March. It started easing it on 4 May and hotels will reopen on 1 June. Tourism accounts for about 13% of output. With five months of the season lost, Cyprus expects, at best, about 30% of last year\u2019s total of 3.98 million visitors. \u201cThe hit is massive, and we are trying to do our best now and do what we can for the remainder of the season. We have worked extremely hard to keep the virus in check here,\u201d Savvas Perdios, the deputy tourism minister, said. Cyprus has emerged relatively unscathed by the pandemic. It has reported fewer than 950 cases, and 17 deaths. It will open on 9 June to travellers from countries including Germany, Greece and Israel. A group from mainly central Europe will be added on 20 June, though Perdios said the list was being reviewed continuously. \u201cFor our important markets like the UK, Russia and Sweden I expect in early July the situation (there) will allow their travel to Cyprus. I am quite optimistic about that,\u201d Perdios said. Britain and Russia alone represent 55% of arrivals. Hi. This is Caroline Davies taking over the live blog for a while. You can get in touch via caroline.davies@theguardian.com Tourists in Japan could soon be tucking into ramen and sushi, and buying souvenirs in the knowledge that a good portion of the bill will be picked up by the Japanese government, writes Justin McCurry, the Guardian\u2019s Tokyo correspondent. Under an initiative that could come into effect within a couple of months, Japan is to provide subsidies to travellers in an attempt to breathe life into the country\u2019s coronavirus-hit tourist industry. The Go To Travel initiative will subsidise holidays by up to \u00a520,000 [(\u00a3151 GDP] ) a day in the form of steep discounts and vouchers that can be used at local shops and restaurants, the Kyodo news agency said. The scheme, which could begin in late July after coronavirus travel restrictions have eased, applies to tourists who make bookings through Japanese travel agencies or directly with hotels and traditional ryokan inns. The programme does not explicitly exclude foreign visitors, but the Japan Travel Agency said in a tweet on Wednesday that it was intended to \u201cstimulate domestic travel demand within Japan after the Covid-19 pandemic and only cover a portion of domestic travel expenses.\u201d The subsidies do not apply to travel expenses for visitors from overseas. Here is some news from England, but that will no doubt resonate with families all around the world in which parents are remote working from lockdown. Working mothers have been able to do only one hour of uninterrupted paid work for every three hours done by men during lockdown, according to a study that exposes the work imbalance between men and women, writes Guardian senior news reporter Alexandra Topping. A report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the UCL institute of education also says mothers are more likely than fathers to have lost their jobs during lockdown, increasing fears that the coronavirus crisis has exacerbated inequality and could lead to the gender pay gap increasing. The Office for National Statistics said separately that men were doing more than an hour less unpaid labour than women each day, despite increasing their responsibilities during lockdown. The IFS-UCL study interviewed 3,500 families of two opposite-gender parents and found that mothers were doing more childcare and more housework than fathers. The mothers interviewed were looking after children for an average of 10.3 hours a day \u2013 2.3 hours more than fathers \u2013 and doing housework for 1.7 more hours than fathers. In families where the father had stopped work while his partner continued, on average they did the same amount of household work \u2013 while the woman did an average of five hours of paid work a day. The Netherlands has recorded 15 more deaths from Covid-19 since yesterday, and 190 new cases of coronavirus, according to its public health institute. The latest update from the Dutch institute for public health and the environment (RIVM) showed the cumulative number of cases of coronavirus in the country had now reached 45,768, while the death toll was 5,871. Polling data also released on Wednesday showed that the Dutch had become more concerned about their health and the health of their loved ones, RIVM said. The need for information of people has also changed in recent months. Confidence in the information provided by the RIVM national institute for public health and the environment , and the measures taken by the cabinet is high (78-85%). This is evident from the interim results of survey questionnaires conducted by Nivel, the Netherlands institute for healthcare research and RIVM. Ninety-five more people have died from Covid-19 in Sweden, according to the latest update from the public health authority, increasing the total death toll from the country\u2019s coronavirus outbreak to 4,220. The number of confirmed cases in the country, which has eschewed the kind of coronavirus lockdown measures imposed elsewhere in the world, has now passed 35,000, after 648 more people tested positive for the coronavirus. Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: The French government has stopped the country\u2019s hospitals using the controversial drug hydroxychloroquine, the antimalarial drug Donald Trump said he was taking as a precaution, to treat Covid-19 patients after serious concerns about its safety. There have been 118,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus across the 54 countries of Africa, according to the World Health Organization\u2019s regional office for the continent. So far, about 48,000 people in Africa who have tested positive for the virus have recovered, while 3,500 have died. Greece is ready to welcome back tourists and has lifted many of its curbs on the general population \u2013 but movement restrictions for refugees in all island camps and a number of mainland camps have been extended until 7 June. South Korea may need to reimpose social distancing measures eased in April, its top infectious diseases expert has said, as coronavirus transmissions creep up in the Seoul metropolitan area. Officials in Strasbourg have appealed for hundreds of spectators who attended an illegal football match at the weekend to be tested for Covid-19. An estimated 400 people played in or watched the game and authorities have called on them to attend a testing centre for anonymous screening. Russia\u2019s death toll neared 4,000, after authorities confirmed that 161 people with coronavirus died in the past 24 hours, bringing the nationwide death toll to 3,968. Officials have also reported 8,338 new infections, pushing the country\u2019s overall figure of confirmed cases to 370,680. France\u2019s economy could contract by around 20% in the second quarter as lockdown measures meant to slow the spread of the coronavirus slashed activity, the national statistics agency Insee says. Bulgaria will allow restaurants, bars and cafes to reopen at full capacity on Monday, further easing restrictions imposed in mid-March to stop the spread of coronavirus. People in Poland will be allowed to go outside without face masks from 30 May, the government said on Wednesday. The announcement, reported by Reuters, is part of a steady lifting of restrictions imposed to contain the coronavirus. It also included the reopening of cinemas, theatres and gyms on 6 June. In the coming days, public gatherings of up to 150 people will be allowed, and limits in the number of people in churches will also by relaxed. Poland\u2019s health ministry reported one new death from Covid-19 on Wednesday, taking the country\u2019s total death toll from the pandemic to 1,025. According to the latest update, 229 more people had tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the country\u2019s total number of cases to 22,303. The health minister, Lukasz Szumowski, told a news conference: At the moment the number of sick people is falling, also the number of deaths is falling, which is the best measure of control over the epidemic \u2026 80% of hospital beds dedicated to Covid patients are vacant, 90% of respirators are not in use while awaiting patients with Covid. As researchers around the world race to perfect a coronavirus vaccine, new polling suggests that only half of people in the US might actually take it. The results of the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll, released on Wednesday, found 31% weren\u2019t sure if they\u2019d get vaccinated, while one in five said they would refuse. Among Americans who say they wouldn\u2019t get vaccinated, seven in 10 worry about safety. Among those who want a vaccine, the AP-NORC poll found protecting themselves, their family and the community are the top reasons. The coronavirus is most dangerous to older adults and people of any age who have chronic health problems such as diabetes or heart disease. The poll found 67% of people 60 and older say they\u2019d get vaccinated, compared with 40% who are younger. And death counts suggest black and Hispanic Americans are more vulnerable to Covid-19, because of unequal access to healthcare and other factors. Yet the poll found just 25% of African Americans and 37% of Hispanics would get a vaccine compared to 56% of whites. Political divisions seen over how the country reopens the economy are reflected in desire for a vaccine, too. More than half of Democrats call a vaccine necessary for reopening, compared with about a third of Republicans. While 62% of Democrats would get the vaccine, only 43% of Republicans say the same. As prospects of summer holidays abroad increase for some people in Europe, the race is already on to lure tourists for whom personal health and safety will be a high priority when choosing a destination this year, writes Kate Connolly, the Guardian\u2019s Berlin correspondent. Italy\u2019s South Tyrol region is focusing its attention on German holidaymakers who are being warned to not take risks if they travel, particularly as the government has said it will not be making a repeat of its multimillion-euro airlift operation to bring its citizens back from all corners of the globe back in March and April. The leader of the Italian province, Arno Kompatscher, has offered German tourists the chance of a free coronavirus test as soon as they arrive at their destination. \u201cThis is a voluntary service offer,\u201d Kompatsscher told the radio broacaster Rai 1, saying tourists would be able to avail themselves of antibody blood tests (to show if they might have had the illness already) as well as the standard swab tests, to prove that someone has the virus. Kompatscher said the plan was for hotels to automatically offer the service as part of holiday packages. But the move appears to be as much to reassure Italian hosts as to who they are letting in, as it is the holidaymakers that their hosts take the dangers of the virus seriously. If positive,the holidaymakers would face the humiliation and inconvenience of being sent back home. Italy has said it plans to open its borders for EU citizens on 3 June. But Germans will have to wait until next week to find out their government\u2019s decision on whether they can go abroad this summer, and if so, under what conditions (such as quarantines and medical certificates). The European Union\u2019s executive body has proposed a \u20ac1.85tn recovery package for member states whose economies have suffered as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The European commission said in a statement seen by the Reuters news agency: The commission is today proposing a new recovery instrument, called Next Generation EU, within a revamped long-term EU budget. In total, this European recovery plan will put \u20ac1.85tn to help kick-start our economy and ensure Europe bounces forward. Agence-France Presse, the French news agency, has tweeted that the main beneficiaries of the plan will be Italy and Spain, the EU member states that have been hit hardest by the outbreak. I will bring you more on this as it comes in. Twenty years ago Nelson Mandela made an impassioned plea for international cooperation on \u201cone of the greatest threats humankind has faced\u201d, writes Carien du Plessis in Johannesburg. Aids was ravaging lives and overwhelming health systems, at its peak killing up to 1,000 people a day in South Africa. Mandela\u2019s successor as president, Thabo Mbeki, was in obstinate denial. On the sidelines of the conference where Mandela made his appeal, Mbeki\u2019s controversial health minister, Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, scolded scientists for daring to oppose the government\u2019s stance. One of those scientists, Salim Abdool Karim, now leads South Africa\u2019s Covid-19 advisory team, earning this government plaudits from the World Health Organization for its response to the pandemic. Tshabalala-Msimang succumbed to liver problems in 2009 and left a legacy of 300,000 preventable deaths. In early April, two weeks into South Africa\u2019s coronavirus lockdown, Abdool Karim led a live two-hour briefing explaining the reasoning behind the strict measures, which confine people to their homes and prohibit public exercise and the sale of alcohol and tobacco. It is in sharp contrast with the Aids response two decades ago. Fifty-six more people in Iran have died from Covid-19 in the past 24 hours the health ministry has reported, taking the total death toll to 7,564. In his latest update, the health ministry spokesman, Kianoush Jahanpour, said that 2,080 new infected cases had been detected since Tuesday. The cumulative number of cases in Iran now stands at 141,591, of whom 111,176 have survived and recovered and 2,551 remain in a critical condition. A cardboard hospital bed that doubles as a coffin may seem an idea as morbid as it is pragmatic, but as Latin America emerges as the latest coronavirus hotspot, doctors have suggested it may be an innovation whose time has come, writes Joe Parkin Daniels in Bogot\u00e1. With Covid-19 cases surging across the region, a team of Colombian designers came up with the idea as a pragmatic solution for anticipated shortages of hospital beds and funerary caskets. \u201cWe were shut down for a couple of months like everyone else, until we had this idea,\u201d said Rodolfo G\u00f3mez, the founder of ABC Displays, which normally creates cardboard advertising props. \u201cBut when we saw what was happening in Ecuador, where bodies were piling up on the streets, we knew we had to prepare somehow.\u201d Health authorities in Germany reported a further 362 confirmed cases of coronavirus on Wednesday, taking the cumulative total in the country to 179,364. The reported death toll rose by 47 to 8,349, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed. On Tuesday, the chancellor\u2019s office said it was extending social distancing rules until 29 June. Angela Merkel\u2019s government had been embroiled in disagreements with the least-affected states, some of which wanted to ditch the measures and open up entirely. South Korea may need to reimpose social distancing measures eased in April, its top infectious diseases expert said on Wednesday, as coronavirus transmissions crept up in the Seoul metropolitan area. Jeong Eun-kyeong, the director of South Korea\u2019s centres for disease control and prevention, said it was becoming increasingly difficult for health workers to track the spread of the coronavirus, the Associated Press reports. South Korea reported 40 new cases on Wednesday, its biggest daily rise in nearly 50 days, as officials scrambled to trace hundreds of infections linked to nightspots, restaurants and a massive e-commerce warehouse near Seoul. Jeong said: We will do our best to trace contacts and implement preventive measures, but there\u2019s a limit to such efforts. There\u2019s a need to maximise social distancing in areas where the virus is circulating, to force people to avoid public facilities and other crowded spaces. There have now been 118,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus across the 54 nations of Africa, according to the World Health Organization\u2019s regional office for the continent. So far, about 48,000 people in Africa who have tested positive for the virus have recovered, while 3,500 have died, according to the latest update from the WHO African region on Wednesday morning. However, while the Covid-19 pandemic has so far had a soft landing on the continent, restrictions put in place to contain the spread of the coronavirus have brought their own problems. In west Africa, breakdowns in trade are contributing to fears of a spiralling food crisis, AFP reports. The UN says the pandemic could cause the number of west Africans living in food insecurity to double to 43 million in the next six months. Data collected by the Permanent Interstate Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel (CILSS) shows west African traders of perishable produce and livestock have seen losses of 10% to 30% since health restrictions came in, as transport is disrupted and markets close while illegal tax collection at checkpoints has leapt nearly 50%. A separate survey by R\u00e9seau Billital Maroob\u00e9, a collective of west African herders, showed economic activities were at a standstill for 42% of herders in the region as of last week.

Serbia has banned inbound flights by Montenegro\u2019s flag carrier, Montenegro Airlines, after the neighbouring country refused to open its borders to people from Serbia, where coronavirus persists. Serbia\u2019s directorate for civilian aviation said it decided to act as Montenegro\u2019s move affected reciprocity in air transportation, Reuters reports. Montenegro\u2019s prime minister, Du\u0161ko Markovi\u0107, declared his country free of coronavirus on Monday. Markovi\u0107 also said Montenegro would open its borders to travellers from countries reporting no more than 25 cases of infection per 100,000 people. Serbia, where the infection rate is higher, was not on the list. As the coronavirus infection rate dropped, Serbia earlier this month opened borders with most of its neighbours, including Montenegro, Croatia and Hungary. Serbia\u2019s prime minister, Ana Brnabi\u0107, told Serbians, who visit Montenegro in large numbers, \u201cthey should not go where they are undesirable\u201d. So far, Serbia, which has a population of 7.2 million, has reported 11,227 cases of coronavirus infection and 239 deaths. Montenegro, whose population is about 631,000, has reported 324 cases and nine deaths. More nurses are thought to be dying from Covid-19 in Brazil than in any other country. This report from Caio Barretto Briso and Tom Phillips tells some heartbreaking stories. In the capital of Amazonas, Manaus \u2013 where the soaring death toll has forced authorities to dig mass graves \u2013 Deizeane Rom\u00e3o is mourning her husband, a 46-year-old nurse named Nicolares Curico who died on 14 April. \u201cTake care of our daughters. I love them,\u201d he wrote in a message to his wife before being admitted to intensive care a week before his death. Rom\u00e3o said her husband had also loved his profession: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about the money \u2013 his salary was less than 2,000 reais (\u00a3600) per month.\u201d But a lack of PPE and staff, because so many colleagues were falling ill, had left him overworked and exposed. \u201cHe felt unprotected because he didn\u2019t have an N95 mask,\u201d Rom\u00e3o said. \u201cHe was seeing more than 100 patients a day.\u201d You can read the whole piece here: Updated Covid-19 figures continue to come through from south-east Asia. Malaysia is the latest, reporting 15 new cases \u2013 raising the cumulative total to 7,619. The countries health ministry also reported no new deaths, keeping the number of total fatalities at 115. Officials in Strasbourg have appealed for hundreds of spectators who attended an illegal football match at the weekend to be tested for Covid-19, writes Kim Willsher. An estimated 400 people played in or watched the game and the authorities, who fear a second wave of the pandemic, have called on them to attend a testing centre for anonymous screening. The match was played on Sunday between teams from two of the city\u2019s districts \u2013 Neuhof and Hautepierre \u2013 in a local stadium in defiance of rules that limit public gatherings to a maximum of 10 people. \u201cWe must absolutely avoid another virus cluster in Strasbourg and protect those who took part as well as their families,\u201d local prefect Josiane Chevalier said. She described the event as \u201cincomprehensible, irresponsible and very serious\u201d, but said the aim of the massive testing operation was not punishment. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a trap. Our number one priority is health,\u201d Chevalier added. Here is the piece in full: Nearly 200 chefs, including some with Michelin stars, gathered outside the Spanish parliament yesterday. They were demanding greater dialogue between the government and the hard-hit catering sector during the Covid-19 pandemic. The French government has stopped the country\u2019s hospitals using the controversial drug hydroxychloroquine, the malaria drug Donald Trump said he was taking as a precaution, to treat Covid-19 patients after serious concerns about its safety. A decree allowing hospitals to prescribe the drug to those with coronavirus \u2013 outside of clinical trials \u2013 was revoked today after a recommendation by the country\u2019s High Council for Public Health. A study published in the Lancet medical journal last week suggested hydroxychloroquine \u2013 promoted by the controversial Marseille doctor Didier Raoult \u2013 might increase mortality rates. The French decision to stop hospitals prescribing hydroxychloroquine with or without an antibiotic for coronavirus patients came two days after the World Health Organisation \u201ctemporarily\u201d suspended a global trial of the drug as a matter of precaution. Raoult has dismissed the Lancet study as \u201cmessy\u201d and based on \u201cbig data\u201d, not hands-on medical treatment. He continues to insist hydroxychloroquine \u2013 a derivative of the antimalarial chloroquine \u2013 works for coronavirus patients. His theory has been supported by the United States president Trump and the Brazil president Jair Bolsonaro. Indonesia has confirmed 55 new deaths from Covid-19, meaning its death toll stands at 1,473. Additionally it has reported 686 new infections, making a total of 23,851 Covid-19 cases in the south-east Asian country.

The Philippines has confirmed 18 new coronavirus deaths and 380 additional infections, its highest single-day increase in cases for more than seven weeks. The country\u2019s health ministry said the total death tally has reached 904, while confirmed cases have risen to 15,049. It said 94 more patients have recovered, bringing total recoveries to 3,506. Germany\u2019s powerful chemical sector can expect significant blows to activity due to the coronavirus pandemic this year, an industry federation has warned. The VCI chemical makers\u2019 group said it \u201cexpects a significant reduction in production and revenues in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry in Germany,\u201d as it published a report on first-quarter activity. Some 75% of member firms are expecting their European revenues to fall, Reuters reports. In January-March, the sector \u201cdid not feel the full force of the coronavirus pandemic\u201d, as demand for certain pharmaceuticals, \u201cvarious hygiene products\u201d and packaging was high. Revenues increased 0.6% quarter-on-quarter, to \u20ac49.5bn, with rising sales within Germany and a smaller retreat in exports. But as the pandemic spread from Asia to Europe in March, the chemical industry \u2013 upstream from many manufacturing activities \u2013 was also increasingly affected. Now \u201cfalling orders, disrupted supply chains and lacking transport capacity are all posing problems for companies,\u201d the VCI said. With companies ranging from global giants Bayer and BASF to tiny firms, the chemical industry is Germany\u2019s third-largest by revenue after cars and machine tools, employing over 460,000 people and boasting revenues of almost \u20ac200bn euros in 2019. Here is Andrzej Krauze\u2019s latest cartoon, on the fallout from the pandemic. Countries across the Middle East are cautiously eyeing a return to normality following the end of Eid al-Fitr. In Turkey, a four-day nationwide lockdown over the holiday lifted at midnight on Tuesday. Malls and hairdressers, which were allowed to partially reopen earlier this month, were again open for business on Wednesday morning as the country now focuses on the challenge of how to reopen safely for the peak summer tourism season. Turks under the age of 20 and over 65 remain under curfew. Government-held Syria, struggling with a crippling economic crisis, cancelled its night-time curfew from Tuesday, reopening mosques and allowing inter-city travel. Mosques in Saudi Arabia will also reopen for Friday prayer from this week, the country\u2019s religious authority said, and with the exception of the holy city of Mecca a daytime curfew will be lifted from Saturday, allowing both public and private sector workers to return to offices. Major Shia shrines in Iran were allowed to open over the Eid holiday, more than two months after they were closed, as the country reported its lowest deaths from coronavirus since March. Russia has confirmed that 161 people with coronavirus died in the past 24 hours, bringing the nationwide death toll to 3,968. Officials have also reported 8,338 new infections, pushing the country\u2019s overall figure of confirmed cases to 370,680. Greece is ready to welcome back tourists and has lifted many of its curbs on the general population \u2013 but movement restrictions for refugees in all island camps and a number of mainland camps have been extended til 7 June. Katy Fallon has reported for us from Lesbos. The news of the extended lockdown has been met with dismay by some in the camp. \u201cWhy do they keep extending it just for refugees?\u201d one resident says. Hadi, 17, an artist from Afghanistan, is distributing flyers, which underline the importance of hand washing. He gingerly taps on the outside of a tent or makeshift hut to hand over the flyer. \u201cPeople were dancing at the prospect of being able to leave, now they have another two weeks of lockdown,\u201d he says. Here is the piece in full: Singapore\u2019s health ministry has reported 533 new coronavirus cases, taking its confirmed total to 32,876. It is an increase on yesterday\u2019s figure of 383 new cases. To date, there have been 23 deaths attributed to Covid-19 in the country. For many people, it will be months since grabbing a coffee on the go. In South Korea, a socially distanced robot barista is easing customers back in.

Guy Lane has this compilation for you: Our UK coronavirus live blog is now up and running, with Alexandra Topping at the helm. If recent days are much to go by, it will be well worth keeping a close eye on the breaking news there. France\u2019s economy could contract by around 20% in the second quarter as lockdown measures meant to slow the spread of the coronavirus slashed activity, the national statistics agency Insee says. It said the French economy was running \u201cat roughly four-fifths of its pre-crisis level\u201d compared with two-thirds during the lockdown period. Insee also said activity was resuming \u201cprudently\u201d after lockdown measures were eased on 11 May, and that consumer spending was rebounding. Nevertheless, consumer confidence slid a bit further from the sharp drop registered in April when lockdown measures were in force the entire month, AFP reports. Insee\u2019s consumer\u2019s confidence index fell by two points to stand at 93 points in May, after dropping by eight points the previous month. The index is calculated so that 100 is the long-term average. \u201cHouseholds are displaying a marked pessimism concerning France\u2019s economic situation,\u201d said Insee. On the other hand, the business confidence index rose slightly, to 59 points, after having hit a revised 53 points in April, the lowest reading since Insee began to calculate the index in 1980. \u201cIndicators about future activity have stopped plunging, but the declarations about the outlook remain bleak,\u201d said Insee. Bulgaria will allow restaurants, bars and cafes to reopen at full capacity on Monday, further easing restrictions imposed in mid-March to stop the spread of coronavirus. The health minister, Kiril Ananiev, issued a new order on Tuesday night allowing bars and restaurants in the tourism-dependent country to go fully back to business ahead of the summer season, Reuters reports. Ananiev also allowed the resumption of cultural and entertainment events, including theatres, concerts and stage performances. Dance classes could also resume, using up to 30% of their indoor capacity and up to 50% of the outdoor capacity. According to the order, however, discos, piano bars and night bars must stay closed as the country remains under a declared epidemic situation because of Covid-19 until 14 June. Ananiev had already given the green light for restaurants, bars and cafes in the Black Sea state to resume operations in their outdoor sections on 5 May. Bulgaria has 2,460 confirmed coronavirus cases, including 133 deaths, a relatively low number in Europe. The country still requires social distancing in public places. Donald Trump has welcomed staffing cuts made by The Atlantic, one of the oldest and most celebrated magazines in the United States, this month. Unemployment in the US, of which Trump is president, stood at 14.7% last week \u2013 the worst figures since records began. Thanks Helen. And good morning, afternoon or evening to everyone.

There were 500,000 cases registered in just 48 hours, between Sunday, when cases passed 5 million, and Tuesday, when cases passed 5.5 million. True death tolls and cases are likely to be significantly higher due to differing definitions and testing rates, delays and suspected underreporting. The US alone accounts for less than a third of the global toll, with 98,916 deaths. Tory unrest increases pressure on PM to sack Dominic Cummings. There is growing revolt within Boris Johnson\u2019s party over his refusal to fire Dominic Cummings, his chief adviser, over his lockdown breach. A junior minister has resigned, and 30 other Conservative MPs have called for Cummings to go. Eight more Tory MPs were publicly critical of Cummings\u2019 actions and three said privately that he should be forced out, according to the Guardian\u2019s Heather Stewart, Rowena Mason and Kate Proctor. The WHO says the Americas are the new epicentre of the disease. The World Health Organization\u2019s regional director Dr Carissa Etienne said outbreaks were accelerating in countries such as Brazil, where the number of deaths reported in the last week was the highest in the world for a seven-day period since the coronavirus pandemic began. The number of coronavirus infections to accelerate in Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua, she said. New Zealand expects plan for safe travel with Australia in June. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Wednesday that a draft blueprint on safely starting travel between New Zealand and Australia will be presented to both governments in early June, Reuters reports. The neighbours have been discussing the possibility of a travel bubble between them as both have slowed the spread of the novel coronavirus to levels well below those in United States, Britain and some other European countries. New Zealand has also reported a fifth consecutive day of no new cases of Covid-19. South Korea reports biggest daily jump in almost 50 days. South Korea South Korea has reported 40 new coronavirus cases for its biggest daily jump in nearly 50 days, causing alarm in a country where millions of children are returning to school. All but four of the new cases came from the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, where officials have been scrambling to stem transmissions linked to nightclubs, karaoke rooms and an e-commerce warehouse. Three cases were linked to international arrivals. South Korea has also jailed a man for four months for breaking quarantine rules, in the country\u2019s first such prison sentence. Vietnam to readmit foreigners. Vietnam will resume issuing e-visas to citizens from 80 countries from 1 July, the government said, though it was unclear whether quarantine measures would be lifted. The country imposed a blanket ban on foreigners entering the country in March as part of its aggressive response to the pandemic, which has also involved mass quarantines and expansive contact tracing.So far, Vietnam has not reported any coronavirus deaths. Macron unveils \u20ac8bn French auto rescue, champions electric cars. President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday announced an \u20ac8bn (US$8.8bn) plan to revive France\u2019s auto industry by making it the European leader in electric cars, boosting a sector brought to its knees by the coronavirus. Macron said the package would include one billion euros in subsidies to encourage purchases of electric and hybrid cars and set a target of France producing a million green cars annually by 2025.The \u201chistoric\u201d intervention will aim to turn France\u2019s rechargeable car industry into Europe\u2019s biggest, the president said. Germany extends distancing rules to end of June. Germany has extended social distancing rules aimed at containing the spread of the coronavirus epidemic to 29 June, Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s government said on Tuesday. Merkel\u2019s government had been embroiled in disagreements with the least-affected states, some of which wanted to ditch the measures and open up entirely. Germany\u2019s virus caseload now tops 181,200 with just over 8,372 deaths - much lower than European counterparts such as Britain, France, Spain and Italy. India backs hydroxychloroquine for virus prevention. India\u2019s top biomedical research body has backed the use of the anti-malarial hydroxychloroquine as a preventive against coronavirus, after the WHO suspended clinical trials of the drug over safety concerns. The endorsement from the Indian Council of Medical Research came a week after US President Donald Trump said he was taking the drug as a preventative measure. India - which accounts for 70% of global production of hydroxychloroquine - on Tuesday reported 145,380 cases of the virus including 4,167 deaths. Spain begins 10 days of mourning. Starting on Wednesday, the country will mourn for the nearly 27,000 people who have died from coronavirus in the country.

It marks the longest official mourning period in Spain\u2019s four-decade-old democracy. Sabrina Toppa reports for the Guardian from Lahore: Pakistan\u2019s garment workers fight for rights amid Covid-19 crisis Police in Karachi last week allegedly shot at hundreds of unarmed garment workers protesting outside a factory supplying denim for global fashion brands. Garment workers claimed to have been charged by police with batons outside a factory which is reported to have fired more than 15,000 workers since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, according to Nasir Mansoor from the National Trade Union Federation. He said some workers had been terminated without written notice. The workers were chanting slogans demanding better conditions and wages when police arrived. Closures and job losses and the suspension of the normal holiday bonus, which enables rural migrants to travel home before the Eid holiday marking the end of Ramadan, had left many of the demonstrators close to despair. The Americas have emerged as the new centre of the coronavirus pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said, as a US study forecast the number of deaths surging in Brazil and other Latin American countries through August. \u201cNow is not the time for countries to ease restrictions,\u201d Carissa Etienne, WHO director for the Americas and head of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), said via videoconference. The Americas have registered more than 2.4m cases of coronavirus and more than 143,000 deaths from the resulting Covid-19 respiratory disease. Latin America has passed Europe and the US in daily infections, she said. \u201cOur region has become the epicentre of the Covid-19 pandemic,\u201d Etienne said, as other PAHO directors warned there are \u201cvery tough\u201d weeks ahead for the region and Brazil has a long way to go before the end of the pandemic. Also of concern to WHO officials are accelerating outbreaks in Peru, Chile, El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua. A University of Washington study warned that Brazil\u2019s total death toll could rise five-fold \u2013 to 125,000 \u2013 by early August. Global deaths from coronavirus surpassed 350,000 on Wednesday. The number of confirmed cases was more than 5.58m. The US, the worst-hit nation, was approaching 100,000 deaths. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte says students will only go back to school if a coronavirus vaccine is available, AFP reports. Schools were shut in March and children were due to return to classes at the end of August. \u201cUnless I am sure that they are really safe, it\u2019s useless to be talking about opening of classes,\u201d the president said in a speech aired late Monday. Uki Go\u00f1i reports for the Guardian: Uruguay\u2019s capital city of Montevideo turned its Carrasco international airport, closed because of the coronavirus lockdown, into a drive-in-cinema Tuesday evening. Some 100 cars turned up for the opening night, although authorities say the airport could potentially accommodate up to 1500 cars. All entertainment venues, including cinemas, have been closed in Uruguay since its lockdown on 13 March. The movie sound was transmitted on a radio station for good audio quality and even the furthest away cars could see clearly on a giant 20-metre-high screen. \u201cWe hope to have about 80 screenings for some 20 thousand spectators, weather permitting,\u201d said Rodrigo Garc\u00eda of Magnolia, one of the firms behind the initiative. Hundreds of migrant workers blocked roads and staged protests at quarantine centres in India\u2019s poorest state Bihar Tuesday, calling for better food and living conditions, police said. The labourers were among millions of India\u2019s poor who have badly hit by the coronavirus lockdown. Many were left jobless, hungry and stranded in cities far away from home. Migrants said they had found insects in their food and dirty toilets in the quarantine centres. They also said there was not enough water. Protesters dispersed after being told that their concerns would be addressed by authorities, police told AFP. Thailand\u2019s state of emergency laws have been extended for another month until the end of June, despite the kingdom reporting a relatively low virus toll at just over 3,000 cases and 57 deaths, AFP reports. The sweeping laws - which include muzzling the media over coronavirus reporting - are needed as the country starts to gradually reopen businesses, a government spokeswoman said Tuesday. Malls and restaurants reopened on 17 May with social distancing rules in place, and now commuters have started packing into Bangkok\u2019s public sky train during rush hour.

All but four of the new cases came from the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, where officials have been scrambling to stem transmissions linked to nightclubs, karaoke rooms and an e-commerce warehouse. Three cases were linked to international arrivals. A steady rise in cases in the greater capital area over the past few weeks has raised concern as officials proceed with a phased reopening of schools, which began with high school seniors last week. More than 2 million high school juniors, middle school seniors, first and second graders and kindergarten students were expected to return to school on Wednesday. Vietnam will resume issuing e-visas to citizens from 80 countries from 1 July, the government said Tuesday, though it was unclear whether quarantine measures would be lifted.

Dr Farvardin Daliri, an academic and artist, debuted the huge bird this week on the streets of Brisbane, and will soon take it north to the Townsville Cultural Festival. \u201cI started making it during Christmas,\u201d he said. \u201cThen the design was altered and I decided to have it laughing, with movement and stuff. It didn\u2019t get completed. But when the lockdown started I had time to basically make it laugh.\u201d Japan launches remote cheering app to boost atmosphere in empty stadiums When Japan\u2019s coronavirus-hit football league finally resumes in a few weeks\u2019 time, it will be in stadiums devoid of supporters. But a new smartphone app could mean the action won\u2019t unfold in atmosphere-sapping silence. The Remote Cheerer system developed by the Japanese firm Yamaha allows fans following the match on TV, the radio or online to encourage \u2013 or berate \u2013 players via their smartphones, their voices reverberating around the stadium in realtime via loudspeakers. In a recent field test, users in multiple remote locations chose from a range of on-screen options that sent their cheers, applause, chants and boos into the 50,000-seat Shizuoka Stadium Ecopa via 58 speakers set up among the empty seats. The app does not, as yet, allow fans to question the referee\u2019s eyesight, or the eating habits of players who struggled to stay match-fit during the league\u2019s virus-enforced break. A South Korean man was jailed for four months on Tuesday for breaking coronavirus quarantine rules, authorities said, in the country\u2019s first such prison sentence. The man, 27, left home while under 14-day self-isolation and was then moved to a quarantine facility, which he also left without permission. South Korea endured one of the worst early outbreaks of the virus, but appears to have largely brought the spread under control thanks to an extensive \u201ctrace, test and treat\u201d programme, AFP reports. President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday announced an \u20ac8bn (US$8.8bn) plan to revive France\u2019s auto industry by making it the European leader in electric cars, boosting a sector brought to its knees by the coronavirus.

Visiting a car factory in Etaples in northern France, Macron said his government would seek to boost flagging customer demand with a subsidy of 7,000 euros for each individual buying an electric car, 5,000 for each company purchase, and 2,000 per hybrid rechargeable car. Starting 1 June, there would also be an aid of \u20ac3,000 for converting from a petrol-fuelled car to a less-polluting one - and as much as \u20ac5,000 to upgrade to an electric vehicle, the president said. He said that some three quarters of French people would be eligible for the incentives. \u201cIn total, the state will provide a bit more than \u20ac8bn in aid to the sector,\u201d said Macron. India\u2019s top biomedical research body on Tuesday backed the use of the anti-malarial hydroxychloroquine as a preventive against coronavirus, after the WHO suspended clinical trials of the drug over safety concerns. The endorsement from the Indian Council of Medical Research came a week after US President Donald Trump said he was taking the drug as a preventative measure. Observational and case control studies in India showed there were \u201cno major side effects\u201d of taking the drug as a prophylactic, ICMR Director-General Balram Bhargava said. Cases of nausea, vomiting and heart palpitations were noted, he added. On Monday, the WHO said it was halting testing of the drug as a Covid-19 treatment after studies questioned its safety, including one that found it actually increased the risk of death. Under India\u2019s clinical guidelines for coronavirus treatment, hydroxychloroquine can be administered, but only to patients \u201cwith severe disease and requiring ICU management\u201d. India - which accounts for 70% of global production of hydroxychloroquine - on Tuesday reported 145,380 cases of the virus including 4,167 deaths. The country ramped up output of the drug amid increased demand, after Trump pushed for hydroxychloroquine as a potential shield or treatment for the virus.

Surgical masks wash up on Sydney beaches after 40 containers fall off cargo ship Residents of Sydney\u2019s east have woken to beaches covered in face masks, plastic containers and other items after 40 shipping containers fell off a ship on the weekend. The APL England lost the cargo in rough seas on Sunday while en route from China to Melbourne, forcing the ship to turn around and head to Brisbane. The containers lost overboard held a wide range of goods including household appliances, building materials and medical supplies. Australian Maritime Safety Authority officials received reports of face masks \u201cwashing up between Magenta Beach and The Entrance\u201d, north of Sydney. In Australia, Aboriginal people in prisons are going without soap, and children in out-of-home care are being refused contact with their families under \u201cpunitive\u201d restrictions enforced due to Covid-19, a report released on Wednesday has said. Aboriginal people are disproportionately affected by Covid-19 policy responses at a state, territory and commonwealth level, the report by the Change the Record coalition, said. Change the Record is the Aboriginal-led justice coalition including Amnesty International, the Law Council of Australia, the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services (Natsils) and National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations (Naccho), representing hundreds of services across Australia. The report said there have been increased use of lockdowns and isolation within correctional facilities, and a reduced access to education, family and legal visits. More from New Zealand now: New Zealand sheltered its homeless during Covid-19 \u2013 but can it last? Charlotte Graham-McLay reports for the Guardian from Wellington: It was an unexpected outcome of the strict lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19 in New Zealand: after one month rough sleeping appeared to have been all but eliminated in the country. Advocates said it was the closest New Zealand had come in modern times to ensuring everyone had shelter, with only \u201ca handful\u201d of people living on streets in the country. But in a country facing a severe housing shortage and affordability crisis \u2013 where home construction is slow work and the public housing waiting list reaches a new high each quarter \u2013 the social sector has warned of obstacles to cementing progress made during the most stringent weeks of the Covid-19 shutdown. Charlotte Graham-McLay reports for the Guardian from Wellington: The deputy leader of New Zealand\u2019s government has broken ranks with the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, decrying her refusal to drastically loosen the country\u2019s lockdown rules and immediately establish a trans-Tasman travel \u201cbubble\u201d with Australia. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in compulsory lockdown for far too long,\u201d said Winston Peters, who is the deputy prime minister and foreign minister, but is not a member of Ardern\u2019s Labour party. \u201cEverybody who has put their heart into the future, the country\u2019s future, and their family\u2019s future realise there is only one way out of this - to think smart and work harder,\u201d he added, during a radio interview on Tuesday. He had been asked by the interviewer whether he supported Ardern\u2019s suggestion of extra public holidays to bolster the country\u2019s flailing tourism sector. The comments from Peters - who is the leader of New Zealand First, a populist minor party, but holds his ministerial portfolios in power-sharing agreement with Labour - were also widely seen as a form of election-year jockeying for position as he tries to differentiate his own party from Ardern\u2019s ahead of the vote in September. Charlotte Graham-McLay reports for the Guardian from Wellington: New Zealand has reported a fifth consecutive day of no new cases of Covid-19 recorded in the country. There is no longer anyone in hospital with the virus, health officials are telling reporters at a news conference in Wellington, and only 21 cases across the nation are still considered active. Fewer than 1,500 people have been confirmed infected with Covid-19 in New Zealand. 21 people have died of the coronavirus since it arrived in the country, a result widely attributed to a swift, strict national lockdown that began in late March before any deaths had been recorded. These are the ten worst-affected countries in terms of number of confirmed cases, according to Johns Hopkins data: US: 1,680,625 (Deaths: 98,902) Brazil: 391,222 (Deaths: 24,512) Russia: 362,342 (Deaths: 3,807) United Kingdom: 266,599 (Deaths: 37,130) Spain: 236,259 (Deaths: 27,117) Italy: 230,555 (Deaths: 32,955) France: 182,847 (Deaths: 28,533) Germany: 181,200 (Deaths: 8,372) Turkey: 158,762 (Deaths: 4,397) India: 150,793 (Deaths: 4,344) More than 350,000 people have now lost their lives in the coronavirus pandemic worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, which relies on official data. The current toll stands at 350,423. The number of confirmed cases is: 5,588,299. The number of declared cases has doubled in a month and more than one million new cases of Covid-19 have been registered in the last 11 days, according to AFP. There were 500,000 cases registered in just 48 hours, between Sunday, when cases passed 5 million, and Tuesday, when cases passed 5.5 million. True death tolls and cases are likely to be significantly higher due to differing definitions and testing rates, delays and suspected underreporting. The US alone accounts for less than a third of the global toll, with 98,902 deaths. Germany has extended social distancing rules aimed at containing the spread of the coronavirus epidemic to 29 June, Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s government said on Tuesday. Up to 10 people will be allowed to gather in public places but Germans should be in contact with as few people as possible, according to the rules agreed between the federal government and 16 states. Merkel\u2019s government had been embroiled in disagreements with the least-affected states, some of which wanted to ditch the measures and open up entirely. Germany\u2019s virus caseload now tops 181,200 with just over 8,372 deaths - much lower than European counterparts such as Britain, France, Spain and Italy. Officials warned that further restrictions could be imposed if local outbreaks made them necessary. Who is Dominic Cummings, and why has his lockdown car trip convulsed UK politics? The Rose Garden at 10 Downing Street is normally reserved for British prime ministers to make set-piece announcements. But on Monday it was the scene of epic political theatre when Boris Johnson\u2019s Svengali-like aide Dominic Cummings sat down and explained to a frenzied British media pack why he had broken the Covid-19 lockdown rules \u2013 or not. The scene tells us a great deal about the country\u2019s politics in the first two decades of the 21st century. Cummings is the embodiment of the bewildering change that has transformed the country from clubbable member of the globalised world into a reckless, Brexit-voting outlier that is now enduring the biggest failure of statecraft since the 1930s. But how did an unelected adviser get to be the most powerful person in the UK after the prime minister? And what will his uncomfortable moment in the spotlight mean for Britain\u2019s immediate future? Starting with his portrayal by Benedict Cumberbatch in a TV drama about his triumphant leadership of the Brexit campaign, Cummings has seeped slowly into the public consciousness. However, he remained a slightly mysterious figure to most Britons outside political circles until this weekend. Walt Disney Co will present its proposal for a phased reopening of its Orlando, Florida, theme parks to a local task force on Wednesday, the company said in a statement. Disney closed theme parks around the world starting in January to help prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. It began reopening the parks earlier this month by allowing a limited number of guests into Shanghai Disneyland with social distancing and other safeguards. Guests must wear masks and have their temperatures checked, among other measures, Reuters reports. A Disney executive will detail the company\u2019s plans for Walt Disney World in Orlando to the Orange County Economic Recovery Task Force on Wednesday. The county must approve Disney\u2019s plan before sending it to the governor\u2019s office, which also must sign off before the parks can open their gates to the public. Disney operates four theme parks at Walt Disney World that attracted 157.3 million visitors in 2018, according to the Themed Entertainment Association. They rank as the most-visited theme parks in the world. Last week, shops and restaurants at the Disney Springs shopping area outside the Orlando parks reopened to visitors for the first time since March. Sea World Entertainment Inc also will present a reopening plan to the Orange County task force on Wednesday, a statement from the county said. The Church of the Nativity and the ruins of ancient Pompeii reopened to pilgrims and tourists on Tuesday, as countries further eased coronavirus controls and reopened shuttered economies, AFP reports. Many of the hardest-hit nations, including Italy and Spain, are trying to salvage their summer tourism seasons - the latest tentative steps out of lockdown buoying world markets. In Bethlehem, the Church of the Nativity - built on the spot where Christians believe their saviour Jesus was born - reopened its doors after more than two months. The church\u2019s opening \u201cgives hope to the world that this pandemic will end\u201d, said Rula Maaya, Palestinian Tourism Minister. Fear of the virus spreading forced most countries to mothball their tourism industries. Nevertheless, in Italy, the ruins of the Roman city of Pompeii, destroyed by a volcanic eruption in 79 AD but preserved in a layer of ash, welcomed visitors for the first time in weeks. But the site, which attracted four million visitors last year, was largely deserted on Tuesday as foreign visitors are still banned from travel to Italy until next month. \u201cIt\u2019s only us guides, and journalists,\u201d sighed 48-year-old Valentina Raffone, noting a \u201csense of emptiness, of sadness\u201d as if after a disaster on the scale of the city\u2019s end. The Vatican too has relaxed its lockdown, announcing that Pope Francis will address the faithful once more from his window overlooking Saint Peter\u2019s Square on Sunday. Hello and welcome to today\u2019s live global coverage of the coronavirus pandemic with me, Helen Sullivan. As always, please do get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan or via email: helen.sullivan[at]theguardian.com. Comments, tips, news from your part of the world are all much appreciated. The Spanish government declared 10 days of mourning starting on Wednesday for the nearly 27,000 people who have died from coronavirus the country. It will be the longest official mourning period in Spain\u2019s four-decade-old democracy. Flags will be hoisted to half-staff in more than 14,000 public buildings and on Spanish naval vessels until 5 June and King Felipe VI, as Spain\u2019s head of state, will preside over a solemn memorial ceremony. Meanwhile, known deaths worldwide are nearing 350,000, with 349,894 currently confirmed, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The US alone accounts for under a third of these, with 98,852. But the true US death toll will probably have passed the sombre milestone of 100,000 days before the official tallies reflect it. Here are the latest developments from around the world: Known deaths worldwide near 350,000. According to the Johns Hopkins University coronavirus tracker, known infections worldwide number at least 5,584,091. The known death toll stands at 349,894. True death tolls and cases are likely to be significantly higher due to differing definitions and testing rates, delays and suspected underreporting. Tory unrest increases pressure on PM to sack Dominic Cummings. There is growing revolt within Boris Johnson\u2019s party over his refusal to fire Dominic Cummings, his chief adviser, over his lockdown breach. A a junior minister has resigned, and 30 other Conservative MPs have called for Cummings to go. Eight more Tory MPs were publicly critical of Cummings\u2019 actions and three said privately that he should be forced out, according to the Guardian\u2019s Heather Stewart, Rowena Mason and Kate Proctor. Twitter added a fact-check warning to the bottom of a tweet by US President Donald Trump for the first time. Trump tweeted: \u201cThere is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent. Mail boxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged &amp; even illegally printed out &amp; fraudulently signed. The Governor of California is sending Ballots to millions of people, anyone.....\u201d Bellow the tweet there is now a link with the warning text \u201cGet the facts about mail-in ballots\u201d. On Sunday Trump suggested that supporters of mail-in voting were using the coronavirus outbreak to perpetrate a \u201cscam\u201d. Trump said he thought it was \u201cvery unusual\u201d that Joe Biden wore a face mask yesterday while attending a Memorial Day ceremony. The president has resisted wearing a mask in public, even though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that Americans cover their faces while out in public and around other people. The Pentagon\u2019s deputy inspector general resigned. Recently, the president effectively removed Glenn Fine from his role leading a coronavirus relief spending oversight committee, and the defence department official has now become the latest inspector general to step down in recent weeks. The trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange was reopened after two months. Cuomo rang the opening bell to cheers from traders, who will still have to wear masks and stay six feet apart from each other when they\u2019re on the floor. The WHO says the Americas are the new epicentre of the disease. The World Health Organization\u2019s regional director Dr Carissa Etienne said outbreaks were accelerating in countries such as Brazil, where the number of deaths reported in the last week was the highest in the world for a seven-day period since the coronavirus pandemic began. The number of coronavirus infections to accelerate in Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua, she said. The UN refugee agency said Covid-19 had pushed its humanitarian work to near \u201cbreaking point\u201d in Yemen, a country devastated by five years of war. It said a growing number of families were resorting to begging, child labour and marrying of children to survive. A separate UN agency said it had only received around 15% of the funding required for the $3.38bn (\u20ac3bn) aid package for Yemen this year. Spain has declared 10 days of mourning starting on Wednesday for the nearly 27,000 people who have died from coronavirus in the country. Flags will be hoisted to half-staff in more than 14,000 public buildings across the country and on Spanish naval vessels until 5 June. It marks the longest official mourning period in Spain\u2019s four-decade-old democracy. The UK death toll passed 47,000, according to new figures from the country\u2019s Office for National Statistics. This figure is higher than the latest figure given by the UK government \u2013 nearly 37,000 \u2013 because it includes deaths in which Covid-19 is given as a \u201csuspected\u201d cause. The UK government figure only includes deaths of patients who have tested positive for the coronavirus. Russia reports record one-day rise in deaths. Russia has announced that 174 people with coronavirus have died in the past 24 hours, a record one-day amount that has pushed the nationwide death toll to 3,807. Officials reported 8,915 new cases, pushing its overall case tally to 362,342 \u2013 but Vladimir Putin said the country has \u201cpassed the peak\u201d of the virus. Mexico City records thousands more deaths than usual, amid doubt over the official Covid-19 toll. This year, Mexico City has issued 8,072 more death certificates than the average for the same period in the past four years, according to a study that suggests the country\u2019s coronavirus death toll could be significantly higher than the official figure of nearly 7,400. The report\u2019s authors found 37% more death certificates were issued in April 2020 than that month\u2019s average during the previous four years. By the end of May they estimated the number may grow to 120%.",

In the weeks that followed, Newsom expanded the modifications to allow counties that had not been as affected by the virus as others to apply for looser restrictions. As of Tuesday, 47 out of the state\u2019s 58 counties have self-attested, and will be allowed to reopen hair salons, offices, some schools, all with modifications. <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cThe pace at which the state has made these modifications is concerning to me,\u201d said Dr Sara Cody, health director in Santa Clara county, location of what is believed to be the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/coronavirus-killing-americans-weeks-earlier-than-thought\"> first Covid-related death</a> in the country. </p> \n  <p>Cody voiced these concerns at a local board of supervisors meeting on Tuesday, where she called for the county to take a more cautious approach. Since the start of the stay-at-home order, local variance has taken precedence, meaning if a county health officer called for stricter measures than the state order, then the county would comply with the county order. <br></p> \n  <p>Cody continued: \u201cWe can\u2019t see the effect of any of these changes, the effect on Covid, for at least 14 days, an incubation period, and 21 days is even better,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the state modifications are being made without a real understanding of the consequences of what the last move has been and with the possibly serious effects for health and possibly serious risks of an exponential growth in cases and therefore a risk to social and economic well-being.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>In particular, Cody had reservations about Newsom\u2019s decision to authorize county health officers to allow religious, cultural and political gatherings of 100 people, a move she said \u201cposes a very serious risk of the spread of Covid-19, based on probability alone\u201d.<br></p> \n  <p>Cody\u2019s concerns come as California crossed the threshold on Wednesday of more than 100,000 positive cases \u2013 101,229 to be exact.

      "bodyText": "Live political reporting on the coronavirus in the US continues in Thursday\u2019s blog: The US coronavirus death toll surpassed 100,000. The country now has more than 1.6m reported cases and has recorded more deaths from the disease than any other nation. The planned SpaceX launch was scrapped due to bad weather. The president and the vice-president were on hand to witness the launch, but it has been rescheduled for Saturday afternoon. Trump indicated he intends travel back to Florida this weekend. The first-ever House proxy vote was cast. Weeks after the House passed a resolution allowing voting by proxy, congressman Brendan Boyle cast a vote on behalf of fellow Democrat Zoe Lofgren. House Republicans have filed a lawsuit to block the resolution, claiming proxy voting is unconstitutional. The secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, told Congress that Hong Kong is no longer autonomous from China. Pompeo\u2019s pronouncement, which came after China issued a law aimed at bringing Hong Kong more under Beijing\u2019s control, could trigger sanctions or other punitive measures against China. Sam Johnson, a retired Republican congressman from Texas has died. He was 89. Johnson, a Vietnam war veteran who was jailed with John McCain at the POW prison that US troops referred to as the \u201cHanoi Hilton\u201d, was a conservative stalwart during his long stint in Congress. He was a founding member of the Conservative Action Team, a conservative voting bloc in Congress that pushed to defund the National Endowment for the Arts and strengthen the Second Amendment. Greg Abbott, the Texas governor, called Johnson a \u201cgreat Texan\u201d. \u201cSam Johnson was a fearless patriot and an American hero, and we are incredibly proud and fortunate to have called him a fellow Texan,\u201d Abbott said in a statement today. A million respirator masks sold by a former Trump administration official to the Indian Health Services do not meet federal standards for \u201cuse in healthcare settings by health care providers,\u201d according to a report from ProPublica. The masks, which the Indian Health Service purchased to meet a desperate need at Navajo hospitals, are KN95 masks, a Chinese version for N95 masks that do not meet the FDA guidelines, even after the agency relaxed standards during the pandemic. More from ProPublica: ProPublica revealed last week that Zach Fuentes, President Donald Trump\u2019s former deputy chief of staff, formed a company in early April and 11 days later won a $3 million contract with IHS to provide specialized respirator masks to the agency for use in Navajo hospitals. The contract was granted with limited competitive bidding. IHS said its Navajo office \u201chas used every available avenue to purchase more supplies and keep up with the demand.\u201d The masks provided by Fuentes \u201care not approved by the FDA or covered by an Emergency Use Authorization for use in healthcare settings by health care providers,\u201d the agency said... On Wednesday, IHS told ProPublica the masks sold by Fuentes were made by four Chinese manufacturers and are registered in an FDA database, but have not met the regulator\u2019s relaxed pandemic-era standards for Chinese-made masks. Fuentes charged the government $3.24 per mask, which is higher than the pre-pandemic rates for respirator masks and far higher than prices charged for masks that can\u2019t be used in hospital settings. At a virtual fundraiser, Joe Biden said he\u2019d hope to name a running mate at the beginning of August, according to the press pool report. That could mean two more months of speculation if he sticks to that timeline. That said, here is some very well-infomed (and informative) speculation, from The Guardian\u2019s politics team: Joe Biden has addressed the US coronavirus death toll surpassing 100,000. Donald Trump has so far not addressed the US reaching the grim milestone of 100,000 coronavirus deaths. On Twitter, he has vowed to veto the Fisa bill that the House is considering. He has also said that he has personally asked the FBI to expedite an investigation into George Floyd\u2019s killing. After a Minneapolis police officer used his knee to pin down Floyd\u2019s neck, the incident is being investigated for possible civil rights violations. It is unclear what Trump means when he said he \u201casked for this investigation to be expedited\u201d. France is banning the use of hydroxychloroquine to cure Covid-19, according to a decree from the country\u2019s health ministry. The health ministry initially advised against using the drug outside of clinical trials. Shortly afterward, the country also suspended the use of hydroxychloroquine treatment for coronavirus patients in clinical trials as well. The news comes after Donald Trump, who has frequently touted the unproven drug as a cure, said he finished taking a course of the medication as a prophylactic measure. Research so far has found that the antimalarial drug has not been particularly effective in treating coronavirus, though clinical trials are still ongoing. The number of recorded coronavirus deaths has just surpassed 100,000. But the actual death toll probably hit that figure days before. And despite scientists\u2019 best efforts, that date may forever go unmarked. Coronavirus was probably spreading through the US before the Trump administration restricted travel from China, before the US had a reliable supply of diagnostic tests, and before the disease caused by the virus was even named. Models of the Covid-19 outbreak estimate that the virus was making its way through America\u2019s major cities, undetected, weeks before a California woman in early February became the first American known to have died of related causes. Researchers are now doing detective work, revisiting autopsies from early this year and studying how the virus has subtly evolved to try to trace when Covid-19 may have first sickened and killed people in the US. Infectious disease experts caution, however, that finding a \u201cpatient zero\u201d, or even figuring out exactly how many Americans were infected and died before testing was available, will be nearly impossible. The worst pandemic in a century has claimed victims across the US, from a grandmother of seven to a 16-year-old. Here, relatives and friends pay tribute to some of those they have lost: As the nation marked a grim milestone, DNC Chair Tom Perez said today \u201cis a dark day in America\u201d. He continued: 100,000 Americans have lost their lives. 100,000. It didn\u2019t have to be this way. Instead of addressing this crisis, Trump spent his weekend golfing. And just last week, he said the fact that the U.S. has the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the world is a \u2018badge of honor.\u2019 But there is no honor in today\u2019s numbers. They are a badge of shame that Trump will wear for the rest of his dwindling days in the Oval Office. Earlier this month, Donald Trump said 100,000 deaths would be \u201chorrible\u201d, but he claimed that actions by his administration had prevented a much higher toll. The death toll in the United States is still climbing, however, and federal officials warn that the likely actual toll from the coronavirus is higher than the official figure. A tracking project by the Centers of Disease Control (CDC) of \u201cexcess deaths\u201d in each state beyond seasonal averages suggests the official count of Covid-19 deaths could leave out thousands of cases. \u201cThese deaths could represent misclassified Covid-19 deaths, or potentially could be indirectly related to Covid-19 (eg, deaths from other causes occurring in the context of healthcare shortages or overburdened healthcare systems),\u201d the CDC said. More than 100,000 Americans with coronavirus have died, four months after the US reported its first confirmed case. The country now has more than 1.6m reported cases and has recorded more deaths from the disease than any other nation. According to Johns Hopkins University data, 100,047 fatalities recorded. The actual death toll is likely higher the official count, experts say. Up to half the deaths in some states have occured among nursing home residents and workers, studies suggest. Almost three times as many black Americans are dying of the virus as white people. Although the number of cases and deaths appears to be trending down in many states, experts are bracing for a possible uptick as states begin reopening businesses. Donald Trump has indicated he\u2019ll return to Florida on Saturday to watch the SpaceX launch. The mission was postponed just 17 minutes before launch time due to the weather. The California health officer credited with leading the nation\u2019s first regional shelter-in-place order expressed concerns that governor Gavin Newsom may be reopening the state too quickly. The Guardian\u2019s Vivian Ho reports: Earlier this month, Newsom modified the statewide stay-at-home order to allow retailers to offer curbside pickup. In the weeks that followed, Newsom expanded the modifications to allow counties that had not been as affected by the virus as others to apply for looser restrictions. As of Tuesday, 47 out of the state\u2019s 58 counties have self-attested, and will be allowed to reopen hair salons, offices, some schools, all with modifications. \u201cThe pace at which the state has made these modifications is concerning to me,\u201d said Dr Sara Cody, health director in Santa Clara county, location of what is believed to be the first Covid-related death in the country. Cody voiced these concerns at a local board of supervisors meeting on Tuesday, where she called for the county to take a more cautious approach. Since the start of the stay-at-home order, local variance has taken precedence, meaning if a county health officer called for stricter measures than the state order, then the county would comply with the county order. Cody continued: \u201cWe can\u2019t see the effect of any of these changes, the effect on Covid, for at least 14 days, an incubation period, and 21 days is even better,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the state modifications are being made without a real understanding of the consequences of what the last move has been and with the possibly serious effects for health and possibly serious risks of an exponential growth in cases and therefore a risk to social and economic well-being.\u201d In particular, Cody had reservations about Newsom\u2019s decision to authorize county health officers to allow religious, cultural and political gatherings of 100 people, a move she said \u201cposes a very serious risk of the spread of Covid-19, based on probability alone\u201d. Cody\u2019s concerns come as California crossed the threshold on Wednesday of more than 100,000 positive cases \u2013 101,229 to be exact. The state is reporting 3,894 deaths. Santa Clara has had 2,675 cases and 24 deaths. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The planned SpaceX launch was scrapped due to bad weather. The president and the vice president were on hand to witness the launch, but it has been rescheduled for Saturday afternoon. It\u2019s unclear whether Trump will travel back to Florida this weekend. The US coronavirus death toll is inching toward 100,000. According to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, 99,983 Americans have already died from coronavirus. The first ever House proxy vote was cast. Weeks after the House passed a resolution allowing voting by proxy, congressman Brendan Boyle cast a vote on behalf of fellow Democrat Zoe Lofgren. House Republicans have filed a lawsuit to block the resolution, claiming proxy voting is unconstitutional. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo told Congress that Hong Kong is no longer autonomous from China. Pompeo\u2019s pronouncement, which came after China issued a law aimed at bringing Hong Kong more under Beijing\u2019s control, could trigger sanctions or other punitive measures against China. Washington will lift its stay-at-home order Friday. DC mayor Muriel Bowser said the city would also start relaxing some social distancing restrictions this week, even as White House officials voice concern about the rate of positive test results in the Washington metropolitan region. Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. A moment of House history has just come to pass, as congressman Brendan Boyle became the first member to vote on behalf of a colleague. Boyle electronically cast his own vote a procedural motion before stepping to the podium to vote on behalf of fellow Democrat Zoe Lofgren. Boyle said she would vote aye. The House passed a measure earlier this month to temporarily allow proxy voting during the coronavirus pandemic, but House Republicans have filed a lawsuit to block the resolution, claiming proxy voting is unconstitutional. That lawsuit is considered unlikely to be successful, and 75 House members have already designated proxies for this week\u2019s votes. America\u2019s largest professional association of obstetricians and gynecologists has filed a lawsuit against the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to end a ban on prescribing medication abortions via telemedicine. Mifepristone is a medication used to treat women who miscarry early or to induce an abortion. It is the only medication, of the more than 20,000 the FDA regulates, which patients self administer at home but must see a doctor in-person to obtain, the lawsuit said. The American College of Obstetrician and Gynecologists said the ban was \u201cmedically unnecessary\u201d and, during the Covid-19 pandemic, would expose women to unnecessary risk of coronavirus infection by forcing them to seek face-to-face treatment. \u201cAt every other turn during this pandemic, the federal government is trying to make it easier for patients to get the medical care they need without unnecessary health care visits that jeopardize their safety,\u201d said Julia Kaye, staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Reproductive Freedom Project, which is representing ACOG among other plaintiffs. \u201cBut when it comes to patients who need to end an early pregnancy or treat a miscarriage, the administration is forcing them to travel to a hospital, clinic, or medical office just to pick up a pill they are already permitted to swallow later at home. This administration apparently would rather subject patients and clinicians to life-threatening medical risks than lift an unnecessary barrier to abortion care.\u201d The planned SpaceX mission was scrapped due to bad weather with just 16 minutes to go until its scheduled launch. Officials said they would plan for another launch attempt on Saturday afternoon. The mission will be the first manned space launch from American soil since 2011. Follow the Guardian\u2019s live coverage for more updates: The launch of a SpaceX mission, which the president and vice president traveled to Florida to witness, has been scrapped. Officials cited concerns about the weather, specifically nearby lightning strikes, as they said it was not safe enough to launch. The president and vice president are touring the Kennedy Space Center in Florida ahead of Nasa\u2019s first crewed flight in almost a decade, in partnership with Space X. Accompanied by the first and second ladies, Donald Trump and Mike Pence toured the Orion workshop this afternoon ahead of the expected launch at 4.33pm ET today. None of the four wore protective masks, according to the pool report and photographs. Wednesday\u2019s scheduled flight is the first with astronauts from US soil under Nasa\u2019s commercial crew program, an initiative to hand over lower earth orbit spaceflight to private contractors while it concentrates on deeper-space ambitions such as a return to the moon. The weather has threatened to derail the flight, but preparations for launch continue, as Richard Luscombe reports: Trump is taking a tour of the Kennedy Space Center, in advance of today\u2019s scheduled SpaceX launch, which is less than an hour away. The president wished the astronauts on board good luck, saying the mission was a \u201cdangerous business, but they\u2019re the best there is.\u201d House speaker Nancy Pelosi criticized the idea of holding an in-person presidential convention amid the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone who would say at this point that tens of thousands of people should come together for a political event -- no matter how great an ego trip it is for somebody,\u201d Pelosi told reporters on Capitol Hill. The biting comment comes as Trump has demanded a \u201cguarantee\u201d from North Carolina\u2019s Democratic governor that the Republican convention can take place in an arena at full capacity. Realistically, no governor can offer that guarantee right now because it\u2019s still unclear what health precautions will be necessary this summer to limit the spread of coronavirus. Joe Biden has openly acknowledged that the Democratic convention may need to be held virtually due to the pandemic. The House will vote on a bill to reauthorize three expired surveillance programs this afternoon, despite uncertainty about whether Democrats have the votes to pass the bill. Trump tweeted last night that Republicans should vote against the FISA bill, linking it to the surveillance conducted by the Obama administration that led to the resignation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn. The president repeated that sentiment in a tweet this afternoon. House Republican leadership is now whipping members to vote against the bill, and attorney general William Barr has urged Trump to veto the bill if it passes. On top of that, some lawmakers on the right and the left have voiced concerns about legal protections for those targeted by surveillance. So even if House speaker Nancy Pelosi can secure enough support for the bill to get it passed, she likely will not have enough votes to override the president\u2019s likely veto, which would send lawmakers back to the drawing board on getting the programs reauthorized. Some Republicans are expressing openness to providing more election assistance in the next coronavirus relief bill, even as Trump continues to criticize states\u2019 efforts to expand vote by mail. \u201cI think it\u2019s likely and it\u2019s likely necessary,\u201d Republican senator Roy Blunt, chairman of the Senate rules committee, told the Wall Street Journal. The stimulus package approved in late March included $400 million in election assistance, although that was well below what Democrats had been requesting. House Democrats included $3.6 billion for election assistance in their most recent relief bill, but Trump has declared that bill to be \u201cdead on arrival.\u201d Trump has threatened to \u201cstrongly regulate\u201d or close down social media platforms that do not meet his standards for ideological balance, a day after Twitter, for the first time, slapped a warning label on a pair of Trump tweets spreading lies about mail-in voting. \u201cRepublicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices,\u201d Trump tweeted on Wednesday morning. \u201cWe will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen.\u201d Trump in the past has made threats about media censorship that he did not then act on, and any attempt by the White House to shutter a media organization would encounter robust first amendment challenges in the courts. In 2018 a federal judge ruled the president could not block people on Twitter, because it violates their first amendment rights to participate in a \u201cpublic forum\u201d. Trump has previously praised Twitter for allowing him to take his message directly to followers, and despite his claims of being \u201csilenced\u201d, social media platforms have been a boon for Trump. His current campaign has rebuilt a targeted advertising operation on Facebook that was widely credited with helping Trump win in 2016. The US coronavirus death toll is inching toward 100,000, and at least one database shows the country has already hit that grim milestone. According to NBC News\u2019 numbers, more than 100,000 Americans have already died from coronavirus. However, other databases show slightly different totals because they rely on slightly different sources to calculate the country\u2019s death toll. According to widely used data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, which the Guardian has been citing, the US death toll stands at 99,674. Here\u2019s a more thorough breakdown of that figure: White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany defended her use of vote by mail, even though she has criticized states\u2019 efforts to expand vote by mail in light of the coronavirus pandemic. The Tampa Bay Times reported earlier today that McEnany has mailed in her ballot for the past decade, even though she has repeated Trump\u2019s baseless claims that vote by mail is more susceptible to voter fraud, which is actually very rare. McEnany said she opposed Democrats\u2019 efforts to \u201cexpand mass mail-in voting without a reason,\u201d although many public health experts would likely say fear of contracting coronavirus, which has already killed nearly 100,000 Americans, is a valid reason. Seventy-three House members have now designated proxies to vote for them this week, even as Republicans move forward with a lawsuit against the resolution allowing proxy voting. House minority leader Kevin McCarthy has argued that the resolution flies in the face of the Constitution\u2019s idea of congressional proceedings and has asked a federal judge to block the measure. However, the lawsuit seems unlikely to succeed, considering judges have historically been hesitant to interfere with how Congress conducts itself and the measure already passed the House, despite Republican opposition. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The US coronavirus death toll is inching toward 100,000. According to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, 99,264 Americans have already died of coronavirus. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo has told Congress Hong Kong is no longer autonomous from China, after Beijing unveiled a law meant to bring Hong Kong more under its control. Pompeo\u2019s pronouncement could trigger sanctions or other punitive measures against Beijing. Two Republican lawmakers criticized Trump for tweeting about a debunked conspiracy theory involving Joe Scarborough. Senator Mitt Romney and congresswoman Liz Cheney said the president\u2019s tweets were causing additional pain for the family of Lori Klausutis, who died in 2001 while working for Scarborough. Trump has pushed the baseless theory that Scarborough was involved in her death. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Hypocrisy alert: White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, who has criticized efforts to expand vote by mail, has mailed in her ballot for the past decade, according to a new report. The Tampa Bay Times reports: In fact, the Tampa native has voted by mail in every Florida election she has participated in since 2010, according to a Tampa Bay Times review of her voting history. Most recently, she voted by mail in the state\u2019s March 2020 presidential primary, just as Trump did after he made Florida his new permanent home. Last week, McEnany, 32, said vote-by-mail was OK for Trump because \u2018the president is, after all, the president, which means he\u2019s here in Washington. He\u2019s unable to cast his vote down in Florida, his state of residence.\u2019 Meanwhile, McEnany, a graduate of South Tampa\u2019s Academy of the Holy Names and a Davis Islands homeowner, has voted by mail 11 times over the last 10 years. McEnany has defended Trump\u2019s attacks on vote by mail, repeating his baseless claims that mailed-in ballots are particularly susceptible to voter fraud, which is very rare. Last week, McEnany repeatedly dodged questions about Trump\u2019s accusation that Michigan officials had broken the law by sending absentee ballot applications to all registered voters. \u201cIllegality and legality of it, that\u2019s a question for the campaign,\u201d McEnany said. Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney called on Trump to stop tweeting about a debunked conspiracy theory involving MSNBC host Joe Scarborough. \u201cI do think the president should stop tweeting about Joe Scarborough,\u201d Cheney told reporters on the Capitol Hill. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of a pandemic, he\u2019s the commander in chief of this nation, and it\u2019s causing great pain to the family of the young woman who died, so I would urge him to stop it.\u201d Cheney\u2019s comment came hours after Republican senator Mitt Romney said the president\u2019s tweets were causing harm to the widower of Lori Klausutis, who died in 2001 when she was a staffer for Scarborough. Trump has pushed baseless claims that Scarborough was involved in her death. \u201cHis heart is breaking,\u201d Romney wrote. \u201cEnough already.\u201d House minority leader Kevin McCarthy repeatedly dodged questions about the controversy, and Trump has shown no sign of abandoning the debunked theory. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo said he has reported to Congress that Hong Kong is no longer autonomous from China, which could trigger sanctions or other punitive measures against Beijing. The Trump administration has reportedly been considering a range of options to push back against China\u2019s new law meant to bring Hong Kong more fully under its control. Bloomberg News reports: The Treasury Department could impose controls on transactions and freeze assets of Chinese officials and businesses for implementing a new national security law that would curtail the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong citizens. Other measures under consideration include visa restrictions for Chinese Communist Party officials, according to two of the people. Inter-agency discussions are ongoing and no decision has been made on whether or how to employ the sanctions, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the moves are still under consideration. The new law has sparked protests in Hong Kong, where more than 300 people have been arrested as police fire pepper-spray bullets into the crowds. Asked yesterday about potential sanctions against China, Trump said, \u201cYour question is early -- we\u2019re doing it now. We\u2019re doing something now. I think you\u2019ll find it very interesting, but I won\u2019t be talking about it today. I\u2019ll be talking about it over the next couple of days.\u201d DC mayor Muriel Bowser announced her city\u2019s stay-at-home order will expire Friday, and some shutdown restrictions will start to be lifted. The mayor said today that the District had seen 14 days of decreased community spread of coronavirus, the last metric officials said the city needed to reach before starting the reopening process. Restaurants will be allowed to serve customers at outdoor seating, with tables spread six feet apart, and barbershops and salons will open by appointment only. Non-essential retail stores will also be allowed to do curbside pick-up, but customers cannot come inside. There are still many restrictions in place. Nail salons will remain closed, as will playgrounds and recreational centers. Bowser said face masks are still required in grocery stores and on public transit, and she encouraged residents to cover their faces whenever possible. New York governor Andrew Cuomo has arrived at the White House for his meeting with Trump. Cuomo said yesterday that he and Trump would discuss his proposal to ramp up infrastructure projects in order to get more New Yorkers back to work amid the coronavirus crisis. The president has voiced support for a large investment in infrastructure, but Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has been much more hesitant to embrace the idea. Joe Biden opened his livestream today by discussing George Floyd\u2019s death, saying the tragedy was the latest sign of the \u201cengrained, systematic cycle of injustice that still exists in this country\u201d. The death of Floyd, a black man, after a white police officer was filmed kneeled on his neck sparked protests in Minneapolis last night. Appearing alongside Pennsylvania governor Tom Wolf, who endorsed him this morning, Biden said the officers involved in Floyd\u2019s death must be \u201cheld more fully accountable.\u201d \u201cWe have to get to the root of all of this,\u201d Biden said. The sister of George Floyd, the black man killed by police in Minneapolis after an incident captured on video in which an officer knelt on his neck as he lay on the ground, has called for those involved in his death to be charged with murder. Bridget Floyd said on Wednesday morning that the officers, who were fired on Tuesday, \u201cshould be in jail for murder\u201d. George Floyd, 46, died on Monday. The FBI and authorities in Minnesota have launched investigations into his death. The officer who knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck is white. Bridget Floyd struggled to hold back tears as she spoke to NBC Today about the family\u2019s shock and grief. She said: \u201cMe and my family are taking this very, very hard. It\u2019s very heartbreaking, it\u2019s very disturbing.\u201d Huge protests took place in Minneapolis on Tuesday night. Police in riot gear fired teargas and rubber bullets into the crowd. Dr Anthony Fauci said he thought it was too soon to say whether the presidential nominating conventions will be able to safely take place in person this summer. \u201cI think we need to reserve judgment right now because we\u2019re still a few months from there,\u201d Fauci told CNN. The infectious disease expert said the country would have to see a signficant decline in cases in order to safely move forward with the conventions. \u201cHopefully we will see that diminution [of coronavirus cases],\u201d Fauci said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t, then as I\u2019ve said before, I would have significant reservations about that.\u201d In contrast, Trump said Monday he wanted a \u201cguarantee\u201d from North Carolina\u2019s Democratic governor that Republicans could hold their convention at full capacity in August. Realistically, as Fauci\u2019s comments indicate, no governor can actually make that guarantee right now, but that didn\u2019t stop the Republican governors of Georgia and Florida from offering up their states to replace North Carolina as the convention site. Dr Anthony Fauci said he thought there was a \u201cgood chance\u201d that a coronavirus vaccine could be developed by the end of the year. The infectious disease expert underscored that the process to develop a vaccine is arduous, saying, \u201cThere are a lot of landmines and hiccups that occur.\u201d Fauci also emphasized that the rapid development of a vacinne could not come \u201cat the expense of safety nor scientific integrity.\u201d Fauci concluded, \u201cI still think that we have a good chance, if all the things fall in the right place, that we might have a vaccine that would be deployable by the end of the year.\u201d However, even if a vaccine is developed in the coming months, there is the question of how quickly and effectively it can be distributed. A newly released AP/NORC poll showed only half of Americans say they would get a coronavirus vaccine if one is developed, while 31% say they are not sure and another 20% say they would refuse to get vaccinated. Returning to Dr Anthony Fauci\u2019s CNN interview, he said scientific data has clearly shown hydroxychloroquine is not an effective coronavirus treatment. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure that it should be banned, but clearly the scientific data is really quite evident now about the lack of efficacy for it,\u201d Fauci told CNN host Jim Sciutto. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said recent studies had shown that dangerous side effects from hydroxychloroquine \u201cmight be rare, but you\u2019d see it, adverse events, particularly with regard to cardiovascular.\u201d The Food and Drug Administration similarly warned last month that hydroxychloroquine should only be used in a hospital setting due to \u201creports of serious heart rhythm problems\u201d in coronavirus patients who were treated with the anti-malaria drug. But Trump has said he used hydroxychloroquine to prevent coronavirus, sparking serious concerns about the president taking an experimental drug. Republican senator Mitt Romney criticized Trump for attacking Joe Scarborough over a debunked conspiracy theory. In a new tweet, the former presidential candidate said Scarborough was a friend and described the president\u2019s attacks on the MSNBC host as \u201cvile, baseless accusations.\u201d Romney specifically mentioned Timothy Klausutis, who wrote a letter to Twitter\u2019s CEO asking him to take down Trump\u2019s tweets about his late wife\u2019s 2001 death. \u201cHis heart is breaking,\u201d Romney wrote. \u201cEnough already.\u201d Romney has previously criticized Trump for some of his controversial attacks on his enemies, and the Utah senator was the only Republican member of the Senate to vote to convict the president in his impeachment trial. Trump has consistently mocked Romney over Twitter since the trial, and the senator\u2019s latest tweet will likely inspire another such attack. Dr Anthony Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious disease expert who has become one of the most recognizable faces in the US response to coronavirus, said he wears a mask in public partly to set an example for other Americans. In an interview with CNN, Fauci talked about wearing a mask as a matter of respect for those around you. \u201cYou wear a mask; they wear a mask; you protect each other,\u201d Fauci said. When explaining why he specifically wore a mask in public, Fauci said, \u201cI want to protect myself and protect others, and also I want to make it be a symbol for people to see that that\u2019s the kind of thing you should be doing.\u201d Fauci\u2019s comments come as Trump and Joe Biden have sparred over face masks, with the president questioning his Democratic rival for wearing a mask during a Memorial Day ceremony. Biden replied by saying Trump was an \u201cabsolute fool\u201d for turning masks into a political issue. This is Joan Greve, taking over for Joanna Walters. Donald Trump is once again tweeting about a baseless conspiracy theory involving MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, who has become a frequent critic of the president. \u201cPsycho Joe Scarborough is rattled, not only by his bad ratings but all of the things and facts that are coming out on the internet about opening a Cold Case. He knows what is happening!\u201d Trump wrote in a tweet this morning. The \u201cCold Case\u201d refers to the 2001 death of Lori Klausutis, who was a staffer for then-congressman Scarborough when she died of a fall as the result of a previously unknown heart condition. Despite the complete lack of evidence of foul play, Trump continues to suggest Scarborough may be involved in Klausutis\u2019 death. Klausutis\u2019 widower wrote to Twitter\u2019s CEO asking him to take down Trump\u2019s tweets about his late wife, but the company refused, and the president has kept up the baseless attacks. When asked yesterday about the Klausutis family\u2019s stated wishes for him to stop talking about the debunked theory, Trump said, \u201cI\u2019m sure that, ultimately, they want to get to the bottom of it, and it\u2019s a very serious situation.\u201d Good morning, US live blog readers, there\u2019s a very busy day ahead in coronavirus and politics news here so please stay tuned for all the latest updates. Here\u2019s is what\u2019s in store so far today. As the nation continues with reopening the data continues to come in showing that two dozen US states are seeing increases in new coronavirus cases, while the US death toll this morning stands at 98,929 according to Johns Hopkins University, and the inevitable 100,000 grim milestone beckons. A new poll shows that only around half of Americans are certain they will line up for a Covid-19 vaccine if, hopefully when, such an inoculation is discovered and made available. New York governor Andrew Cuomo is back at the White House today, meeting Donald Trump at 11am ET for the latest talks on the coronavirus crisis. The president and first lady Melania Trump will travel later in the afternoon to Cape Canaveral on Florida\u2019s Space Coast, where Nasa, in conjunction with Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX, is scheduled to launch American astronauts into outer space from US soil for the first time since the Space Shuttle program was retired in 2011. They are headed for the international space station and hope to blast off at 4.23pmET.",

      "bodyText": "Homeless people who were sleeping rough in Victoria have been asked to make \u201csignificant co-payments\u201d for the hotels and motels they were placed in during the coronavirus pandemic, while those in New South Wales have not. After Covid-19 was declared a pandemic the Victorian government announced it would double crisis funding to help homelessness agencies to find temporary housing for those sleeping on the streets of Melbourne, some $6m in total. The Council for Homeless Persons, Victoria\u2019s peak body for homelessness care providers, confirmed that some rough sleepers were being asked to co-pay for their rooms, with some paying up to half of the cost of the accommodation, potentially several hundred dollars a week. Some of those who have been placed in motels and hotels said this system felt unfair, given the huge number of returned travellers whose hotel accommodation is being paid for in full by the Victorian government. \u201cAm I allowed to say it sucks?\u201d said Adam Bollingmore, who was sleeping rough in Melbourne before being placed in a motel by service provider Launch Housing. \u201cI\u2019m extremely grateful to have a roof over my head \u2026 But I watched two busloads of people arrive at hotels in the city. On the news, some of them were complaining of the five-star hotel, that there was nothing to do and they couldn\u2019t go anywhere. Yet we are staying at motels and paying for it and we are grateful. \u201cThey have enough money to travel.\u201d Bollingmoore is paying $150 a week out of his jobseeker benefits. Given the additional Covid-19 supplement, this payment is about 26% of his income. This percentage is comparable to contributions usually paid by those in social housing apartments and homes but he only has access to a single room at the 2.5-star motel. It\u2019s understood he is paying less than a number of others. A spokesperson from the Department of Health and Human Services said since 29 March, 12,460 people arriving from overseas had been placed in hotel quarantine. It is understood some 4,500 homeless Victorians have been placed in motels and hotels for a period of about three months. Jenny Smith, the chief executive of the Council for Homeless Persons, defended the co-payment system, saying it was normal for housing providers to ask for a contribution. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a directive from the government that we have to ask for co-payments, they weren\u2019t putting caveats on it. They told us to do more of what we usually do and we did.\u201d \u201cIf they have no resources then we will pay. It\u2019s an individualised response for each person. You have to make that funding last,\u201d she said. The NSW government handed homelessness organisations $14m to help get rough sleepers off the street once the lockdown was introduced. But Katherine McKernan, the Homelessness NSW chief executive, confirmed that the 2,200 people who had been placed in hotels and motels throughout the state had not been asked for money. \u201cNo, they haven\u2019t had to pay at all, which is good,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been able to save money.\u201d A spokesman for the Victorian department of health and human services said co-payments were standard practice. \u201cThe Victorian Government has invested nearly $15m to protect people experiencing homelessness during the coronavirus pandemic, including almost $6m for hotel accommodation and private rental assistance to provide safe accommodation,\u201d he said in a statement. Others in the homeless service providers sector have criticised the Victorian rollout of temporary hotel housing. \u201cThey are asking for co-contributions but these people on benefits, there is not much they can give, especially when their common sources of food are gone,\u201d said Melanie Raymond, Chair of Youth Projects. \u201cThe food vans are not operating in the CBD shutdown.\u201d She also questioned the fairness of co-payments in the context of ongoing state-funded quarantining. She said she was grateful for the emergency funding but now it was time to consider the adequacy of the response. \u201cSome of the hotel rooms had removed the coffee, sugar and tea, so our clients couldn\u2019t even make a cup of tea in their room,\u201d she said. Youth Project provides food and medical and social support to rough sleepers in the city centre and the city\u2019s west. It also helped connect people to housing providers organising hotel stays. \u201cWhat we didn\u2019t know is when the homeless were offered accommodation in hotels and motels, that it didn\u2019t come, necessarily, with food, cooking facilities or laundry facilities \u2026 The \u2018stay in place\u2019 order was difficult for people who were housed with only what they stood in,\u201d Raymond said. Raymond said Youth Projects had to scale up its food relief services while many of its usual donation sources dried up. \u201cWe didn\u2019t realise how much food we would have to provide,\u201d she said. \u201cBasically breakfast, lunch and something to take back to your room for dinner for anyone who\u2019d come down for an appointment.\u201d A department spokesman said government-funded food support had been accommodating of stay-at-home orders and had provided meals to people in hotels and motels. Bollingmore said his living costs had gone up since the lockdown began. \u201cYou are just paying for the room, you know, you can\u2019t go buy bulk groceries because you have nothing to cook on,\u201d he said. \u201cYou end up wasting a lot of money on food. I\u2019m still grateful, but all I have is a microwave.\u201d \u201cIf you aren\u2019t careful you can easily have to spend $60 on food for a day for three meals.\u201d He has been able to access food relief programs and is trying to save as much money as possible in preparation for the jobseeker payment\u2019s return to pre-Covid levels. A spokeswoman for Launch Housing, Bollingmore\u2019s provider, said they ask people to contribute to accommodation \u201cwhen it\u2019s reasonable to do so\u201d. \u201cWe aim to help people and the community stay safe and to practice social distancing. Arrangements for supporting people into emergency accommodation are subject to constant review,\u201d she said. Smith said the Council for Homeless Persons was hopeful that the Victorian government would allow temporary hotel accommodation to continue until more permanent solutions could be found. \u201cIn other parts of the country, I\u2019m not sure that our sector is optimistic that there will be a response, other than to kick people back into homelessness, but we\u2019re still waiting on the Victorian government\u2019s response,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have no reason not to be hopeful.\u201d The council was advocating for the creation of additional housing to be used to stimulate the state\u2019s economy as the shutdown ended, she said. \u201cWe have asked for 6,000 homes a year for 10 years to bring us up to the country\u2019s average,\u201d she said.",

New Zealand went into lockdown for seven weeks from 25 March, and has become a global success story in containing the coronavirus, with fewer than 1,500 people infected and 21 deaths. During lockdown, many workers experimented with working from home for the first time, and a University of Otago study of more than 2,500 people found the arrangement suited many. According to the study 73% of people were \u201cequally or more productive\u201d when working from home, and 89% wanted to continue post-lockdown, at least part-time. Despite 38% of respondents never having worked from home before, 66% of people found it \u201ceasy or somewhat easy\u201d to adapt, with 82% saying they felt they had the right resources to do their job, although only 17% had all of those resources provided by their employer. Last week, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said lockdown has shown many New Zealanders \u2013 and businesses \u2013 that flexible working arrangements could be productive for both parties. In a Facebook video she urged Kiwis to explore a diverse range of options on returning to work, including the possibility of a four-day week. \u201cI hear lots of people suggesting we should have a four-day workweek.

The media company\u2019s chairman, Michael Miller, said the papers would move to digital as the impact of coronavirus has hit the advertising spending that keeps the print papers afloat. Dozens of other local mastheads will stop publishing altogether. Journalists and readers said this would leave a huge hole in local communities and \u201cthousands of stories\u201d untold. The Nationals MP and minister for veteran\u2019s affairs, Darren Chester, said it was \u201cgutting\u201d to see the closures. The former ABC managing director Mark Scott said it was \u201cdevastating\u201d and the former politician and broadcaster Derryn Hinch said it was a \u201cterrible day for journalism\u201d. Other pointed out that many regional readers needed a print edition to access news, and that local papers played a crucial role keeping local government accountable.",

      "bodyText": "From the confines of an unremitting detention, Moz Azimi wrote a song about love. From a guarded floor of the Mantra Hotel in suburban Melbourne \u2013 his \u201cluxury torture cell\u201d in his words \u2013 Azimi can wind open the window just a few centimetres. He stands by it to let the air and the noise of the outside world rush in, and to look out to those outside: protestors come to campaign for his freedom, people walking past oblivious, the slow crawl of cars on now-unhurried streets. For months it has been his only physical link to the outside world. \u201cI was looking at my friends outside ... And they waved at me and I just looked at them. And I thought \u2018I want to tell you I love you\u2019. That night, I started writing.\u201d And so he wrote. Azimi has been detained by Australia, in one place or another, for seven years. He is a member of Iran\u2019s Kurdish minority who fled persecution in his homeland and his refugee status was recognised three-and-a-half years ago. Australia is legally obliged to protect him. Dozens of those Azimi arrived with by boat to Christmas Island in July 2013 now live in the Australian community. They have built livelihoods and communities, friendships and families in their new country. Through no offence or fault, no action or omission, Azimi is detained still. The capriciousness of Australia\u2019s immigration detention system \u2013 why some are allowed free while others are not \u2013 erodes his spirit. So he writes. He writes poetry, song lyrics, social media missives to the outside world. And his music has drawn together an extraordinary cohort of Australian musicians in support. Azimi\u2019s first song, All the Same, was written and sung from inside the Manus Island detention centre, and completed with the help of an army of musicians, technicians and supporters in Australia. And his latest, Love, written by his window inside the Mantra Hotel, was mixed and produced by Jim Moginie of Midnight Oil fame, played on a guitar given to Azimi by Jimmy Barnes. The Kurdish people have a storied tradition of literature, song, and storytelling. \u201cBut fighting is a part of my cause too,\u201d Azimi says. \u201cFighting to be heard.\u201d The Covid-19 lockdowns imposed across Australia have reshaped communities and ways of life, imperilling basic freedoms once taken for granted. But the lockdowns have been felt too, and acutely, among those who knew few freedoms to begin with. For those held in immigration detention, their circumscribed worlds have shrunk further still: visits have been cancelled and medical appointments postponed. Formerly, those held at the Mantra Hotel were taken to a nearby immigration detention centre where they could walk outside \u2013 still behind wire fences, but at least in the open air \u2013 but those trips have been cancelled too. Moz spends 23 hours a day in his room. Alone. His roommate, one of his closest friends from Manus, Farhad Bandesh, was removed to another immigration detention centre in April \u2013 ostensibly over a disagreement with a guard \u2013 but also coincidentally two days after he had appeared on Q&amp;A by video questioning why he and his fellow refugees had to remain detained. The threat of Covid-19 is very real in Australia\u2019s immigration detention and in its Apods \u2013 alternative places of detention, usually commandeered hotels such as Azimi\u2019s Mantra \u2013 where physical distancing is impossible. Shuttered into a single floor of the hotel, its lifts guarded by a round-the-clock security detail, the 65 men held here share sleeping quarters and a dining room, a small communal recreation space, and corridors. \u201cWe are sitting ducks for Covid-19 and extremely exposed to becoming severely ill, with the possibility of death,\u201d detainees from across immigration detention centres wrote in a letter to the prime minister, Scott Morrison, pleading to be released into the community on health grounds. Many of the men detained at Mantra are refugees who have been brought to Australia under the now-repealed medevac laws, which put doctors in charge of the medical treatment of those held in Australia\u2019s offshore regime. Azimi was brought from PNG in November, suffering a series of severe medical conditions, including asthma and post-traumatic stress. He has not had any appointments since. Over regular conversations with Azimi, the grinding, oppressive nature of detention is starkly apparent. \u201cI am like a lion, I am strong,\u201d Azimi tells Guardian Australia one day, smiling. \u201cI am able to talk with my pain: this experience is bad, but there is a way to continue, and life is beautiful.\u201d The next week the smile is still there, though fleeting, forced. \u201cMy body is becoming weak. Every day weaker. They are killing my time, killing my potential. Slowly they are killing me.\u201d \u201cSooner or later, the virus will come,\u201d Azimi says, \u201cand we are right here, we can not escape it. I think they don\u2019t care about us. The government has no plan for releasing us, and we cannot be silent.\u201d Guardian Australia has met with Moz Azimi at a number of points on his seven-year odyssey through Australia\u2019s immigration detention regime. In Port Moresby last year, where Azimi lived a half-life in the PNG capital, unable to progress the US resettlement pathway he had begun, and caught by a bureaucratic intransigence. And earlier, on Manus Island in 2017, in the dying days of the Lombrum detention centre, when the men held there staged a desperate and doomed stand-off, refusing to leave for fear they would not be safe outside. In the middle of the night, we were was smuggled into the centre by sea, and shown around the decrepit, decaying site.

You\u2019re next, Governor \u2013 El 80.\u201d According to Mexican police, \u201cEl 80\u201d was Carlos Arturo Quintana, son of the leader of an organised crime syndicate known as La L\u00ednea, which in its heyday controlled one of the lucrative smuggling routes for the supply and transfer of drugs from Colombia to the US. Three days before Breach was murdered, Quintana\u2019s father had been killed in a confrontation between rival gangs.</p> <p>Breach worked for la Jornada and for the regional paper Norte de Ciudad Juarez, covering politics and crime; she had also set up her own news agency, Mir. She had reported extensively on the links between organised crime and politicians in Chihuahua state. On 4 March 2016, Breach wrote in la Jornada about the alleged criminal connections of mayoral candidates in several small towns in western Chihuahua. Breach had received threats to her life on at least three occasions as a result of her reporting.

She was one of six journalists killed in Mexico in 2017; more than 150 journalists have been <a href=\"https://www.cndh.org.mx/sites/default/files/documentos/2019-08/COMUNICADO%20324-2019.pdf\" title=\"\">killed</a> there since 2000, 22 of them in the state of Chihuahua. In 2019, according to <a href=\"https://cpj.org/reports/2019/10/getting-away-with-murder-killed-justice.php\" title=\"\">data compiled</a> by the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), Mexico had the seventh-highest number of unsolved murders of journalists in the world, behind Somalia, Syria, Iraq, South Sudan, the Philippines and Afghanistan. On 18 May this year, gunmen killed the owner of a newspaper, Jorge Miguel Armenta \u00c1valos, and one of the policemen assigned to protect him, following earlier threats. Armenta, who is at least the third journalist to be murdered in Mexico in 2020, was attacked in broad daylight while leaving a restaurant.</p> <p>According to the World Press Freedom Index for 2020, compiled by <a href=\"https://rsf.org/en/mexico\" title=\"\">Reporters Without Borders</a> (RSF) and released in March, journalists in Mexico face a dire situation: \u201cCollusion between officials and organized crime poses a grave threat to journalists\u2019 safety and cripples the judicial system at all levels. Journalists who cover sensitive political stories or organized crime are warned, threatened and often gunned down in cold blood.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Attacks on journalists around the world take many forms, some of which are sanctioned in law. Legal or quasi-legal mechanisms include the use of civil or criminal legal actions, covert surveillance, overt censorship and financial threats (such as withdrawing state advertising), as well as more direct intimidation and threats.</p> <p>In recent years, another way of silencing journalists has proliferated: the use of what are known as strategic lawsuits against public participation, or <a href=\"https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/help-record-rise-of-slapp-lawsuits-aiming-to-silence-journalists-comment/\" title=\"\">Slapps</a>, where defamation or criminal lawsuits are brought with the intention of shutting down forms of expression such as peaceful protest or writing blogs. Originally regarded as an American legal mechanism, such lawsuits are now fairly widespread in Europe. Before she was killed in 2017, the Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia was facing around 40 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/19/malta-urged-to-drop-libel-lawsuits-against-daphne-caruana-galizia\" title=\"\">libel lawsuits</a> filed by companies, government officials and individuals, which were described by her son Matthew as a \u201cnever-ending type of torture\u201d.</p> <p>V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1, the vice-president of the European Commission, the executive branch of the EU, has been working on introducing protections against Slapp lawsuits, the defence of which can cost individuals a fortune and tie up their time and resources. Justin Borg-Barthet, a legal academic at Aberdeen University, has called for EU law to be changed to prevent \u201cforum shopping\u201d to countries with claimant-friendly laws, so that defamation suits would have to be filed in the courts of the country where the media organisation or journalist was based. Slapp lawsuits are commonly used against journalists investigating government corruption or exposing corporate abuses, but are also used against civil society organisations, activists such as environmental campaigners, trade unionists and academics, to shut down or silence acts of criticism and protest.</p> <p>In France, media organisations and NGOs <a href=\"https://actionaid.org/stories/2019/slapp-face-accountability\" title=\"\">have been hit</a> with what they view as Slapp suits for publishing accusations of land-grabbing from villagers and farmers in Cameroon by companies associated with the Bollor\u00e9 Group. In the UK, fracking companies including Ineos, UK Oil &amp; Gas, Cuadrilla, IGas and Angus Energy have since 2017 <a href=\"https://www.lag.org.uk/article/205728/fracking-and-the-right-to-protest\" title=\"\">sought and been granted</a> wide-ranging court injunctions, often directed against persons unknown, to prevent protests and campaigning activities at drilling sites. These injunctions had a chilling effect on the right to protest and free speech, until the court of appeal <a href=\"https://drillordrop.com/2019/04/03/breaking-anti-fracking-campaigners-win-appeal-against-ineos-protest-injunction/\" title=\"\">ruled in April 2019</a> that parts of an Ineos injunction prohibiting protests on the public highway and against the Ineos supply chain, and which had been used as a template for similar orders granted to other oil and gas companies, were unlawful.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4079b38e070089a37d3e8539102f970c5c9e899e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4079b38e070089a37d3e8539102f970c5c9e899e/0_232_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maltese investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was murdered by a car bomb in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maltese investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was murdered by a car bomb in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darrin Zammit Lupi/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alongside Slapp suits, there are more traditional ways to keep journalists quiet. More than 150 countries retain some sort of criminal defamation laws, many of which include the possibility of imprisonment. Blasphemy and insult laws remain commonplace in many countries, and are often used by politicians and government officials against any critical media. A number of countries including Turkey and Egypt have expansive definitions of \u201cterrorism\u201d that allow them to arrest and detain anyone who voices political dissent or opposition, including journalists.</p> <p>In countries such as Hungary and Poland, governments and political allies exercise quasi-legal control of public information. Media owners can be pressured on what content to publish by threats to limit access to finance and advertising revenues.</p> <p>Separately, the lack of legal protections for journalists against those who attack them acts as a strong deterrent. Impunity fuels a vicious cycle of violence, bolstering those who aim to silence public debate and block sensitive information.</p> <p>In 2013, the UN published a <a href=\"https://en.unesco.org/un-plan-action-safety-journalists\" title=\"\">plan of action</a> on the safety of journalists, and the problem of impunity for perpetrators. The plan provides a framework for co-operation between UN bodies, national authorities, media actors and NGOs. Spearheaded through Unesco, the plan was incorporated into the Declaration of the Council of Europe in April 2014, and in guidelines published by the EU soon after. In April 2016, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe adopted a recommendation on the protection of journalism and safety of journalists and other media actors.</p> <p>By the end of 2018, the Council of Europe\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.coe.int/en/web/media-freedom/the-platform\" title=\"\">Platform for the Protection of Journalism and Safety of Journalists</a>, set up to record information on serious concerns about media freedom and the safety of journalists in Council of Europe (CoE) member states, had registered more than 500 <a href=\"https://www.coe.int/en/web/media-freedom/all-alerts\" title=\"\">alerts</a>, with year-on-year rises of incidents in every year except 2017. Nearly half of all alerts are marked as category 1, covering the most severe and damaging violations of media freedom, such as murder, direct threats to life and physical assaults. The majority of threats came from the state, with physical attacks and detentions making up nearly half the alerts. Since 2015, only 11% of all alerts have been marked as resolved, a figure that goes down to 1.82% for alerts entered in 2018. Interviews with journalists echo these statistics. In 2017, a study that interviewed 940 journalists from all CoE member states found that a staggering 40% of them had suffered slander.</p> <p>According to a <a href=\"https://rm.coe.int/background-paper-safety-of-journalists-and-other-media-actorsfinal/168094b396\" title=\"\">May 2020 report</a> by Peter Noorlander on the implementation of the 2016 CoE recommendation, attacks against journalists remain insufficiently investigated, and a very high percentage of incidents go unpunished. \u201cJournalists have little confidence that attacks or threats against them will be investigated, and often do not report them,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis has a grave effect on them, and many no longer report attacks but instead self-censor and shy away from potentially controversial issues \u2026 [CoE] Member States have committed to creating an enabling environment for freedom of expression, yet, what journalists experience on the ground is increased violence, threats, denigration, arbitrary arrests and detention.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Some of the most high-profile cases of attacks against the media in the last few years have involved journalists in countries where neither democracy nor the rule of law is respected. Many of the more recent attacks have been perpetrated or encouraged by heads of state.</p> <p>They include cases such as the politically sponsored harassment of Philippines journalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/maria-ressa\" title=\"\">Maria Ressa</a>, the editor of Rappler, a social news network. Under Ressa, the site has revealed the activities of the online \u201ctroll army\u201d that supports the presidency of Rodrigo Duterte and spreads disinformation about his opponents. Rappler has also reported critically on extrajudicial killings, human-rights violations and the rising death rates from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/18/philippines-rodrigo-duterte-war-on-drugs-catholic-church\" title=\"\">Duterte\u2019s war on drugs</a>. The law suits that would follow were presaged during Duterte\u2019s state of the union speech in July 2017, when he declared that Rappler was \u201cfully owned\u201d by the Americans, and therefore in violation of the constitution.</p> <p>In January 2018, the Philippine securities and exchange commission revoked Rappler\u2019s licence. The government then investigated Rappler for tax evasion, and a warrant for Ressa\u2019s arrest was issued in November 2018. In February 2019, Ressa and Rappler were hit with another lawsuit alleging libel relating to a story published in 2012, using a law enacted four months after the story was published.</p> <p>Other infamous cases of state-sponsored crimes against journalists include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/23/jamal-khashoggi-timeline-of-key-events\" title=\"\">the brutal murder</a>, on 2 October 2018, of Saudi dissident and Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. The CIA have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/17/cia-khashoggi-findings-highly-damaging-to-saudi-prince-mohammed-bin-salman\" title=\"\">concluded</a> that the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, ordered the journalist\u2019s assassination. On 19 July 2019, the office of the UNHCR released a report <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=24713\" title=\"\">describing</a> Khashoggi\u2019s death as \u201cpremeditated extra judicial execution\u201d.</p> <p>In many western countries, there is a risk that intimidation and violence against the media is becoming normalised.

But that would be a mistake. In 2007, Thames Valley police searched the home and office of Sally Murrer, a local journalist. \u201cI was just pottering around doing typical local stories and in May 2007, eight police officers swooped at my home while eight swooped simultaneously at the office,\u201d she <a href=\"https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/local-press-reporter-police-surveillance-destroyed-my-life-the-snoopers-charter-absolutely-terrifies-me/\" title=\"\">told</a> reporters from the Press Gazette. \u201cThey seized all my computer equipment, searched my house, phones, laptops. They took me into custody where I stayed for a couple of days, strip-searched me. I honestly had no idea [why]. They said the charge was aiding and abetting misconduct in a public office and it carried life imprisonment.</p> <p>\u201cIt was only later when they interviewed me, which they did copious times, and played me tapes and showed me transcripts of texts, that I realised I had been under surveillance for the previous eight weeks. It was just a ghastly feeling.\u201d</p> <p>Thames Valley police had secretly recorded a conversation that took place between her and a police officer. Murrer was accused of receiving sensitive stories from the police officer and selling them to the News of the World. \u201cThe stories were about a local GBH committed by a footballer, and the murder of a local man where there was a link to cannabis and his wife was the secretary of the then-MP.\u201d After 19 months, during which she had been on police bail, Murrer\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/nov/28/pressandpublishing-medialaw\" title=\"\">trial collapsed</a> after the judge ruled police had breached her rights.</p> <p>More recently, in August 2018, the police in Northern Ireland arrested two journalists, Trevor Birney and Barry McCaffrey, over the alleged theft of documents from the Northern Ireland police ombudsman into the 1994 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/mar/22/investigating-the-loughinisland-murders\" title=\"\">Loughinisland massacre</a>, when members of a loyalist paramilitary group, the Ulster Volunteer Force, burst into a pub with assault rifles and fired on the customers.

The raid on the home of the News Corporation journalist was in response to a story she had written about how the Australian Signals Directorate was seeking new powers to spy on Australian citizens. In February, a court ruled the search was legitimate as the police were investigating valid national security offences. ABC\u2019s managing director, David Anderson, described the decision as \u201ca blow for public interest journalism\u201d and argued that it highlighted a \u201cserious problem\u201d with Australia\u2019s national security laws.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Since the outbreak of coronavirus, protections for journalists have become <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-52363305\" title=\"\">more urgent than ever.</a> According to RSF\u2019s secretary-general, Christophe Deloire, \u201cThe coronavirus pandemic illustrates the negative factors threatening the right to reliable information, and is itself an exacerbating factor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBoth China and Iran censored their major coronavirus outbreaks extensively.

      "bodyText": "Just after 7am on the morning of 23 March 2017, journalist Miroslava Breach Velducea, a 54-year-old mother of three, was driving her 14-year-old son to school in the city of Chihuahua, Mexico, when a man walked up to her car and shot her eight times. According to reports, her son was not injured, but Breach died on the way to hospital. The Mexican newspaper la Jornada reported that a cardboard note was found at the scene of the murder, which read: \u201cFor being a snitch. You\u2019re next, Governor \u2013 El 80.\u201d According to Mexican police, \u201cEl 80\u201d was Carlos Arturo Quintana, son of the leader of an organised crime syndicate known as La L\u00ednea, which in its heyday controlled one of the lucrative smuggling routes for the supply and transfer of drugs from Colombia to the US. Three days before Breach was murdered, Quintana\u2019s father had been killed in a confrontation between rival gangs. Breach worked for la Jornada and for the regional paper Norte de Ciudad Juarez, covering politics and crime; she had also set up her own news agency, Mir. She had reported extensively on the links between organised crime and politicians in Chihuahua state. On 4 March 2016, Breach wrote in la Jornada about the alleged criminal connections of mayoral candidates in several small towns in western Chihuahua. Breach had received threats to her life on at least three occasions as a result of her reporting. In October 2016, she had told a meeting of the Federal Mechanism for Journalists and Human Rights Defenders that she had been threatened. Nevertheless, on the day she was killed, she had no protection. Breach\u2019s story is not an isolated one. She was one of six journalists killed in Mexico in 2017; more than 150 journalists have been killed there since 2000, 22 of them in the state of Chihuahua. In 2019, according to data compiled by the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), Mexico had the seventh-highest number of unsolved murders of journalists in the world, behind Somalia, Syria, Iraq, South Sudan, the Philippines and Afghanistan. On 18 May this year, gunmen killed the owner of a newspaper, Jorge Miguel Armenta \u00c1valos, and one of the policemen assigned to protect him, following earlier threats. Armenta, who is at least the third journalist to be murdered in Mexico in 2020, was attacked in broad daylight while leaving a restaurant. According to the World Press Freedom Index for 2020, compiled by Reporters Without Borders (RSF) and released in March, journalists in Mexico face a dire situation: \u201cCollusion between officials and organized crime poses a grave threat to journalists\u2019 safety and cripples the judicial system at all levels. Journalists who cover sensitive political stories or organized crime are warned, threatened and often gunned down in cold blood.\u201d * * * Attacks on journalists around the world take many forms, some of which are sanctioned in law. Legal or quasi-legal mechanisms include the use of civil or criminal legal actions, covert surveillance, overt censorship and financial threats (such as withdrawing state advertising), as well as more direct intimidation and threats. In recent years, another way of silencing journalists has proliferated: the use of what are known as strategic lawsuits against public participation, or Slapps, where defamation or criminal lawsuits are brought with the intention of shutting down forms of expression such as peaceful protest or writing blogs. Originally regarded as an American legal mechanism, such lawsuits are now fairly widespread in Europe. Before she was killed in 2017, the Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia was facing around 40 libel lawsuits filed by companies, government officials and individuals, which were described by her son Matthew as a \u201cnever-ending type of torture\u201d. V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1, the vice-president of the European Commission, the executive branch of the EU, has been working on introducing protections against Slapp lawsuits, the defence of which can cost individuals a fortune and tie up their time and resources. Justin Borg-Barthet, a legal academic at Aberdeen University, has called for EU law to be changed to prevent \u201cforum shopping\u201d to countries with claimant-friendly laws, so that defamation suits would have to be filed in the courts of the country where the media organisation or journalist was based. Slapp lawsuits are commonly used against journalists investigating government corruption or exposing corporate abuses, but are also used against civil society organisations, activists such as environmental campaigners, trade unionists and academics, to shut down or silence acts of criticism and protest. In France, media organisations and NGOs have been hit with what they view as Slapp suits for publishing accusations of land-grabbing from villagers and farmers in Cameroon by companies associated with the Bollor\u00e9 Group. In the UK, fracking companies including Ineos, UK Oil &amp; Gas, Cuadrilla, IGas and Angus Energy have since 2017 sought and been granted wide-ranging court injunctions, often directed against persons unknown, to prevent protests and campaigning activities at drilling sites. These injunctions had a chilling effect on the right to protest and free speech, until the court of appeal ruled in April 2019 that parts of an Ineos injunction prohibiting protests on the public highway and against the Ineos supply chain, and which had been used as a template for similar orders granted to other oil and gas companies, were unlawful. Alongside Slapp suits, there are more traditional ways to keep journalists quiet. More than 150 countries retain some sort of criminal defamation laws, many of which include the possibility of imprisonment. Blasphemy and insult laws remain commonplace in many countries, and are often used by politicians and government officials against any critical media. A number of countries including Turkey and Egypt have expansive definitions of \u201cterrorism\u201d that allow them to arrest and detain anyone who voices political dissent or opposition, including journalists. In countries such as Hungary and Poland, governments and political allies exercise quasi-legal control of public information. Media owners can be pressured on what content to publish by threats to limit access to finance and advertising revenues. Separately, the lack of legal protections for journalists against those who attack them acts as a strong deterrent. Impunity fuels a vicious cycle of violence, bolstering those who aim to silence public debate and block sensitive information. In 2013, the UN published a plan of action on the safety of journalists, and the problem of impunity for perpetrators. The plan provides a framework for co-operation between UN bodies, national authorities, media actors and NGOs. Spearheaded through Unesco, the plan was incorporated into the Declaration of the Council of Europe in April 2014, and in guidelines published by the EU soon after. In April 2016, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe adopted a recommendation on the protection of journalism and safety of journalists and other media actors. By the end of 2018, the Council of Europe\u2019s Platform for the Protection of Journalism and Safety of Journalists, set up to record information on serious concerns about media freedom and the safety of journalists in Council of Europe (CoE) member states, had registered more than 500 alerts, with year-on-year rises of incidents in every year except 2017. Nearly half of all alerts are marked as category 1, covering the most severe and damaging violations of media freedom, such as murder, direct threats to life and physical assaults. The majority of threats came from the state, with physical attacks and detentions making up nearly half the alerts. Since 2015, only 11% of all alerts have been marked as resolved, a figure that goes down to 1.82% for alerts entered in 2018. Interviews with journalists echo these statistics. In 2017, a study that interviewed 940 journalists from all CoE member states found that a staggering 40% of them had suffered slander. According to a May 2020 report by Peter Noorlander on the implementation of the 2016 CoE recommendation, attacks against journalists remain insufficiently investigated, and a very high percentage of incidents go unpunished. \u201cJournalists have little confidence that attacks or threats against them will be investigated, and often do not report them,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis has a grave effect on them, and many no longer report attacks but instead self-censor and shy away from potentially controversial issues \u2026 [CoE] Member States have committed to creating an enabling environment for freedom of expression, yet, what journalists experience on the ground is increased violence, threats, denigration, arbitrary arrests and detention.\u201d * * * Some of the most high-profile cases of attacks against the media in the last few years have involved journalists in countries where neither democracy nor the rule of law is respected. Many of the more recent attacks have been perpetrated or encouraged by heads of state. They include cases such as the politically sponsored harassment of Philippines journalist Maria Ressa, the editor of Rappler, a social news network. Under Ressa, the site has revealed the activities of the online \u201ctroll army\u201d that supports the presidency of Rodrigo Duterte and spreads disinformation about his opponents. Rappler has also reported critically on extrajudicial killings, human-rights violations and the rising death rates from Duterte\u2019s war on drugs. The law suits that would follow were presaged during Duterte\u2019s state of the union speech in July 2017, when he declared that Rappler was \u201cfully owned\u201d by the Americans, and therefore in violation of the constitution. In January 2018, the Philippine securities and exchange commission revoked Rappler\u2019s licence. The government then investigated Rappler for tax evasion, and a warrant for Ressa\u2019s arrest was issued in November 2018. In February 2019, Ressa and Rappler were hit with another lawsuit alleging libel relating to a story published in 2012, using a law enacted four months after the story was published. Other infamous cases of state-sponsored crimes against journalists include the brutal murder, on 2 October 2018, of Saudi dissident and Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. The CIA have concluded that the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, ordered the journalist\u2019s assassination. On 19 July 2019, the office of the UNHCR released a report describing Khashoggi\u2019s death as \u201cpremeditated extra judicial execution\u201d. In many western countries, there is a risk that intimidation and violence against the media is becoming normalised. On Czech election day in October 2017, Czech president Milo\u0161 Zeman held up a mock assault rifle with an inscription that was translated as \u201cAt journalists\u201d. Donald Trump has regularly shouted at and abused journalists, and a BBC camera operator was violently shoved and abused at a Donald Trump rally in 2019; in May 2017, a Guardian reporter was assaulted by a Republican candidate, now an elected congressman. Most recently there have been threats against reporter Glenn Greenwald from the far-right government of President Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil. This sort of hostility towards journalists by political leaders has global as well as domestic repercussions. The Wikileaks founder Julian Assange is currently held in HMP Belmarsh, while the UK decides if he can be extradited to the US, where he has been charged with violating the Espionage Act, and faces the prospect of spending the rest of his life in prison if he is found guilty. As Alan Rusbridger, the former editor of the Guardian, has written, the charges against Assange are \u201cattempting to criminalise things journalists regularly do when they receive and publish true information given to them by sources or whistleblowers\u201d. According to the RSF, \u201cthe next 10 years will be pivotal for press freedom because of converging crises affecting the future of journalism: a geopolitical crisis (due to the aggressiveness of authoritarian regimes); a technological crisis (due to a lack of democratic guarantees); a democratic crisis (due to polarisation and repressive policies); a crisis of trust (due to suspicion and even hatred of the media); and an economic crisis (impoverishing quality journalism).\u201d It is easy to dismiss concerns about press freedom as relevant only to countries led by repressive, unelected regimes. But that would be a mistake. In 2007, Thames Valley police searched the home and office of Sally Murrer, a local journalist. \u201cI was just pottering around doing typical local stories and in May 2007, eight police officers swooped at my home while eight swooped simultaneously at the office,\u201d she told reporters from the Press Gazette. \u201cThey seized all my computer equipment, searched my house, phones, laptops. They took me into custody where I stayed for a couple of days, strip-searched me. I honestly had no idea [why]. They said the charge was aiding and abetting misconduct in a public office and it carried life imprisonment. \u201cIt was only later when they interviewed me, which they did copious times, and played me tapes and showed me transcripts of texts, that I realised I had been under surveillance for the previous eight weeks. It was just a ghastly feeling.\u201d Thames Valley police had secretly recorded a conversation that took place between her and a police officer. Murrer was accused of receiving sensitive stories from the police officer and selling them to the News of the World. \u201cThe stories were about a local GBH committed by a footballer, and the murder of a local man where there was a link to cannabis and his wife was the secretary of the then-MP.\u201d After 19 months, during which she had been on police bail, Murrer\u2019s trial collapsed after the judge ruled police had breached her rights. More recently, in August 2018, the police in Northern Ireland arrested two journalists, Trevor Birney and Barry McCaffrey, over the alleged theft of documents from the Northern Ireland police ombudsman into the 1994 Loughinisland massacre, when members of a loyalist paramilitary group, the Ulster Volunteer Force, burst into a pub with assault rifles and fired on the customers. Six were killed and five wounded. Birney and McCaffrey\u2019s homes and offices were raided. In May 2019, three appeal judges quashed the search warrants. In the US in 2019, San Francisco police officers investigating the leak of a police report following the death of a public defender, Jeff Adachi, obtained a warrant \u201cto conduct remote monitoring on a journalist\u2019s telephone number device, day or night, including those signals produced in public, or location not open to public or visual surveillance\u201d. In May 2019, the police raided the journalist Bryan Carmody\u2019s home and office, and seized computers, phones and other electronic devices. A court has now ruled that the raid was unlawful, and the San Francisco police department has reportedly paid a substantial amount of damages to the journalist. In Australia, in June 2019, police launched raids on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation\u2019s Sydney HQ, with search warrants naming two reporters and a news director; and on the home of a News Corporation journalist. The ABC raid related to articles published in 2017 about alleged misconduct by Australian special forces in Afghanistan, \u201cbased off hundreds of pages of secret defence documents leaked to the ABC\u201d. The raid on the home of the News Corporation journalist was in response to a story she had written about how the Australian Signals Directorate was seeking new powers to spy on Australian citizens. In February, a court ruled the search was legitimate as the police were investigating valid national security offences. ABC\u2019s managing director, David Anderson, described the decision as \u201ca blow for public interest journalism\u201d and argued that it highlighted a \u201cserious problem\u201d with Australia\u2019s national security laws. * * * Since the outbreak of coronavirus, protections for journalists have become more urgent than ever. According to RSF\u2019s secretary-general, Christophe Deloire, \u201cThe coronavirus pandemic illustrates the negative factors threatening the right to reliable information, and is itself an exacerbating factor.\u201d \u201cBoth China and Iran censored their major coronavirus outbreaks extensively. In Iraq, the authorities stripped Reuters of its licence for three months after it published a story questioning official coronavirus figures. Even in Europe, prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n of Hungary had a \u2018coronavirus\u2019 law passed with penalties of up to five years in prison for false information, a completely disproportionate and coercive measure.\u201d RSF also say reporters have been arrested in Algeria, Jordan and Zimbabwe while reporting on lockdown-related issues, and that Cambodia\u2019s prime minister has used the coronavirus crisis to bolster his authority. In March, the Guardian journalist Ruth Michaelson was forced to leave Egypt after she reported on a scientific study that said Egypt was likely to have many more coronavirus cases than have been officially confirmed, and the New York Times Cairo bureau chief was reprimanded over supposed \u201cbad faith\u201d reporting on the country\u2019s coronavirus cases. The Columbia Journalism Review, in an article entitled \u201cCovid-19 is spawning a global press-freedom crackdown\u201d, reported at the end of March that police in Venezuela had violently detained a journalist in reprisal for reporting on the pandemic, and that in Turkey, seven journalists were detained in reprisal for their reporting. In South Africa, the government has enacted a new law that makes it a crime to publish \u201cdisinformation\u201d about Covid-19. In light of the pandemic, the UK and other members of the executive group of the Media Freedom Coalition (Canada, Germany, Latvia, the Netherlands and the US), agreed a statement on 6 April 2020, reaffirming the fundamental importance of media freedom, and calling on all states to continue to protect access to free media and the free exchange of information. The statement said that the executive group were concerned by the efforts by some states to use the crisis to put in place undue restrictions on a free and independent media: \u201cSuch actions deny societies critical information on the spread of the disease and undermine trust in responsible government\u201d. It also urged \u201cgovernments to continue guaranteeing the freedom and independence of media, the safety of journalists and other media professionals, and to refrain from imposing undue restrictions in the fight against proliferation of the coronavirus\u201d. * * * On the day of the murder of Miroslava Breach Velducea in 2017, Mexico\u2019s federal special prosecutor for crimes against freedom of expression stated that a federal investigation had begun. Seven days later, according to la Jornada, Chihuahua\u2019s attorney general said that two suspects had been identified in the shooting, and that Breach was killed because her reporting affected the interests of organised crime. Later that year, the finger of blame for the killing was pointed at \u201cLos Salazares\u201d, a criminal organisation linked to the Sinaloa cartel, led by the Mexican drug lord El Chapo, who has since been convicted in the US for trafficking tons of cocaine, heroin and marijuana and engaging in multiple murder conspiracies, and sentenced to spend the rest of his life in prison . A hitman linked to Los Salazares \u2013 Juan Carlos Moreno Ochoa, alias \u201cEl Larry\u201d \u2013 was arrested by authorities on Christmas Day 2017 during an early morning raid. Surveillance cameras had captured him walking in the vicinity of the murder scene. In March 2020, a federal court judge found Moreno guilty of overseeing the journalist\u2019s murder. Testifying under the alias \u201cApolo\u201d, the son of the leader of Los Salazares gave evidence about how his father was upset that a relative lost a mayoral election in the town of Chinipas, el Heraldo newspaper reported. The judge found that Moreno supervised the crime and enlisted the help of two other people, Jaciel Vega Villa, who allegedly drove the car to Breach\u2019s home, and Ram\u00f3n Andr\u00e9s Zavala Corral, who was suspected of having fired the shots that fatally wounded her. Zavala had been found dead in December 2017, a few days before Moreno Ochoa\u2019s arrest. Vega remains at large, a fugitive from justice. The guilty verdict came too late to save Breach\u2019s newspaper. In April 2017, the editor of Norte de Ciudad Juarez, where Breach had worked, announced that the paper was closing. In an editorial published shortly after the assassination, Oscar Cant\u00fa said he could not continue to publish in the face of the violence against journalists in Mexico and the impunity of those responsible. \u201cThere are neither the guarantees nor the security to exercise critical, balanced journalism,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEverything in life has a beginning and an end, and a price to pay, and if the price is life, I am not prepared for any more of my colleagues to pay it, nor am I prepared to pay it either.\u201d The work of journalists in all media around the world is even more important at a time when misinformation and disinformation spread so rapidly across the internet, and when powerful political and business actors can attack journalists with impunity. As Unesco said in their campaign literature for this year\u2019s World Press Freedom Day: \u201cToday, citizens are on lockdown, eager for news like never before. And more than ever, the news must be fact-checked, verified. Because disinformation spreads as fast as the virus itself, and journalists are on the frontline in the fight against the distortion of truth. More than ever we need facts. Facts to avoid spreading fear, fake news and panic. More than ever we need a free press.\u201d Gill Phillips is director of editorial legal services at the Guardian \u2022 This article was amended on 28 May 2020 to clarify details of the respective raids on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and on the home of a News Corporation journalist in 2019. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here",

One study showed the country lost 12,000 km2 (4,633 sq miles) of forest last year and also provided important information about those behind deforestation. The other research flagged a 27% increase in the destruction of tropical forests in eastern Brazil. Both studies were released days after it was revealed that the environment minister, Ricardo Salles, had advocated that the government use the cover of the coronavirus pandemic to further weaken the country\u2019s increasingly shaky environmental protection laws. Amazon deforestation and fires have soared since Bolsonaro took office in January 2019, vowing to end the \u201cfines industry\u201d of environment agencies and develop the rainforest. \u201cWe need to make an effort while we are in a quiet moment for press coverage because they only talk about Covid,\u201d Salles said in a ministerial meeting in April. Video of the meeting was released on Friday and showed the minister using an expression about cattle to push for \u201cchanging all the rules and simplifying norms\u201d. Environmentalists had warned that this was what the government had been doing. \u201cThe government\u2019s position is weaken policies and this increases deforestation,\u201d said Mariana Mota, a public policy specialist at Greenpeace Brasil. \u201cThe deforestation numbers don\u2019t lie.\u201d The first annual study by MapBiomas \u2013 a coalition of NGOs, universities and technology companies \u2013 confirmed deforestation alerts from Brazil\u2019s Space Research Institute with high resolution images.

The Bolsonaro government is trying to approve a law that would allow farmers who had illegally occupied land on protected reserves before a cutoff date to claim legal title, legislation environmentalists have called the \u201cland grabbers\u201d bill. Brazil\u2019s vice-president, Gen Hamilton Mour\u00e3o, leads an \u201cAmazon council\u201d and an environmental operation by thousands of Brazilian soldiers whose effectiveness has been questioned by local media.

      "body": "<p>We all now know the basics \u2013 the R is the average number of people someone infected with Covid-19 passes the virus on to.&nbsp;If it is greater than 1.0 the epidemic will grow exponentially.&nbsp;If it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/22/uk-coronavirus-r-number-stays-the-same-for-two-weeks-in-a-row\">less than 1.0</a> it will eventually disappear.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>There are several types of R: the R0 that applies to a naive population with no immunity or interventions; and the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/when-will-it-be-over-an-introduction-to-viral-reproduction-numbers-r0-and-re/\">effective R</a>\u201d or Re (also called Rt) that the politicians are talking about, and that measures how we are doing in controlling the virus.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>We calculate the R in several ways.&nbsp;What it was two to four weeks ago can be back-calculated by the changes in Covid-19 hospitalisations or deaths.&nbsp;The Office for National Statistics (ONS) is now doing national swab surveys to estimate the proportion of people who carry the virus and how that changes over time; but these take a week or two to process and report.&nbsp;Thus, we cannot be very confident about the precise value of the R day to day, and can be even less confident about regional variations that are inevitably based on less data than the national numbers.</p> \n<p>The government\u2019s science committee, Sage, estimates that the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-publishes-latest-r-number\">R value for the UK</a> was between 0.7 and 1.0 on 22 May. This is an average value across the nation, and there is substantial regional variation \u2013 Re may be twice as high in the north-east than in London, the original centre of the UK\u2019s epidemic.&nbsp;The R value varies across individuals, with \u201csuper-spreading\u201d events being associated with a high proportion of the infections, and many people, perhaps most, not passing the infection on to anyone.&nbsp;Infectious <a href=\"https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/5-67\">disease modelling</a> and <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.21.20104521v1\">virus sequencing data</a> suggest that, early in the epidemic, 10% or less of virus carriers led to about 80% of infections.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The amount of virus each individual&nbsp;carries may be partially responsible for this, but his or her opportunities to contact others \u2013 at parties, in the workplace, in restaurants or religious services \u2013 is important too.&nbsp;Thus, one man may have infected more than 90 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/south-korea-struggles-to-contain-new-outbreak-amid-anti-lgbt-backlash\">clubgoers in South Korea</a>, and one member of a <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6919e6.htm\">choir in Washington State</a> may have infected 52 out of 61 fellow chorists at a single rehearsal.</p> \n<p>Early estimates of R0, the original infection rate, for Covid-19 were in the range of 2.0 to 3.0, but more recent estimates have come in at <a href=\"https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2020/05/r-nought\">4.0 or more</a>.&nbsp;This is substantially higher than the usual estimate for influenza of about 1.4 to 2.0.&nbsp;The infection rate dropped incrementally with the series of recommendations that started on 12 March, but did not <a href=\"https://mrc-ide.github.io/covid19estimates/#/details/United_Kingdom\">drop precipitously</a> until the full lockdown was announced 11 days later.&nbsp;The epidemic grew much faster prior to the lockdown than it has diminished afterwards.&nbsp;To decline at the same rate, the R number would now have to be about 0.25 \u2013 and no one thinks it has declined to that level.&nbsp;As Harvard epidemiology professor Bill Hanage has put it: \u201cA fire burns fast at first but the embers take a long time to die down.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"480d1656-ca71-4050-91e8-119eeea78569\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"

close to 1.0 there are basically two options.&nbsp;First, we could try to accelerate the decline in the number of infected people \u2013 bringing Re down further \u2013 so that efficient test, trace and isolate measures combined with the quarantine of new arrivals might give us a chance of suppressing the virus to the point of virtual elimination, as has been done in South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand and perhaps China.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It became clear from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/11/boris-johnson-advice-coronavirus-spread-work\">prime </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/11/boris-johnson-advice-coronavirus-spread-work\">minister\u2019s announcement on 10 May</a> on easing the lockdown that the government has chosen instead to open up the economy when there are still large numbers of infected people who do not know they carry the virus \u2013 guaranteeing ongoing infections and the inability to suppress the virus.&nbsp;As a consequence, the Covid-19 death rate will stabilise but may not drop much lower, and the threat to older people and those in care homes will remain serious.</p> \n<p>Even to achieve stabilisation in the context of the \u201cback to work <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/24/pm-accepts-some-english-primary-schools-may-not-return-on-1-june\">and school</a>\u201d decisions already announced, three key control elements must be put in place.&nbsp;Indoor gatherings of any sort must remain limited in size to prevent super-spreading events, and those who encounter many people each day, such as shop workers, care workers and bus drivers, should be given protective equipment and be tested regularly.&nbsp;On trains and buses, there are obvious implications for how many people can be commuting.&nbsp;And the <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/company/newsroom/time-to-encourage-people-to-wear-face-masks-as-a-precaution-say-experts/\">use of face coverings</a> should be the new normal \u2013 including at government press briefings.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7a8aefc4-c87c-430c-81cd-7b8b5fa27431\"

</gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The contact-tracking system must be up and running efficiently.&nbsp;Though a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52820592\">test and trace system</a> is being introduced today, scientists have already warned that it will prevent less than 15% of infections,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>given the large numbers still infected.</p> \n<aside class=\"element

Horton</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>And travel from one part of the country to another should be minimised, so infected travellers do not spark new epidemics in lower-risk regions.&nbsp;There are ominous signs that the mixed messages from the government have already led to more <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-52754039\">gatherings</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/13/uk/london-underground-boris-johnson-analysis-gbr-intl/index.html\">crowded trains</a>, and, in backing No 10 adviser Dominic Cummings, it has given the green light to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/26/anger-over-dominic-cummings-actions-has-encouraged-lockdown-rule-breaking\">long-distance travel</a>.</p> \n<p>Stabilising the epidemic only buys time to find an effective treatment or vaccine.&nbsp;Perhaps the warmer temperatures will help, if we responsibly socially distance outdoors while the epidemic rumbles on.&nbsp;But when the colder weather pushes us indoors, without a vaccine, and unless contact tracing is massively stepped up, there will be a second wave: the epidemic will resurge. Not because it had to, but because we did not push the virus closer to extinction, we did not plan properly for the rebound, and thus gave the virus a second lease of life. And all of this will guarantee more Covid-19 deaths in the UK.</p> \n<p>\u2022&nbsp;David Hunter is the Richard Doll professor of epidemiology and medicine in the Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford</p>",

      "bodyText": "We all now know the basics \u2013 the R is the average number of people someone infected with Covid-19 passes the virus on to. If it is greater than 1.0 the epidemic will grow exponentially. If it is less than 1.0 it will eventually disappear. There are several types of R: the R0 that applies to a naive population with no immunity or interventions; and the \u201ceffective R\u201d or Re (also called Rt) that the politicians are talking about, and that measures how we are doing in controlling the virus. We calculate the R in several ways. What it was two to four weeks ago can be back-calculated by the changes in Covid-19 hospitalisations or deaths. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) is now doing national swab surveys to estimate the proportion of people who carry the virus and how that changes over time; but these take a week or two to process and report. Thus, we cannot be very confident about the precise value of the R day to day, and can be even less confident about regional variations that are inevitably based on less data than the national numbers. The government\u2019s science committee, Sage, estimates that the R value for the UK was between 0.7 and 1.0 on 22 May. This is an average value across the nation, and there is substantial regional variation \u2013 Re may be twice as high in the north-east than in London, the original centre of the UK\u2019s epidemic. The R value varies across individuals, with \u201csuper-spreading\u201d events being associated with a high proportion of the infections, and many people, perhaps most, not passing the infection on to anyone. Infectious disease modelling and virus sequencing data suggest that, early in the epidemic, 10% or less of virus carriers led to about 80% of infections. The amount of virus each individual carries may be partially responsible for this, but his or her opportunities to contact others \u2013 at parties, in the workplace, in restaurants or religious services \u2013 is important too. Thus, one man may have infected more than 90 clubgoers in South Korea, and one member of a choir in Washington State may have infected 52 out of 61 fellow chorists at a single rehearsal. Early estimates of R0, the original infection rate, for Covid-19 were in the range of 2.0 to 3.0, but more recent estimates have come in at 4.0 or more. This is substantially higher than the usual estimate for influenza of about 1.4 to 2.0. The infection rate dropped incrementally with the series of recommendations that started on 12 March, but did not drop precipitously until the full lockdown was announced 11 days later. The epidemic grew much faster prior to the lockdown than it has diminished afterwards. To decline at the same rate, the R number would now have to be about 0.25 \u2013 and no one thinks it has declined to that level. As Harvard epidemiology professor Bill Hanage has put it: \u201cA fire burns fast at first but the embers take a long time to die down.\u201d So where does this leave us over the next few months? With Re so close to 1.0 there are basically two options. First, we could try to accelerate the decline in the number of infected people \u2013 bringing Re down further \u2013 so that efficient test, trace and isolate measures combined with the quarantine of new arrivals might give us a chance of suppressing the virus to the point of virtual elimination, as has been done in South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand and perhaps China. It became clear from the prime minister\u2019s announcement on 10 May on easing the lockdown that the government has chosen instead to open up the economy when there are still large numbers of infected people who do not know they carry the virus \u2013 guaranteeing ongoing infections and the inability to suppress the virus. As a consequence, the Covid-19 death rate will stabilise but may not drop much lower, and the threat to older people and those in care homes will remain serious. Even to achieve stabilisation in the context of the \u201cback to work and school\u201d decisions already announced, three key control elements must be put in place. Indoor gatherings of any sort must remain limited in size to prevent super-spreading events, and those who encounter many people each day, such as shop workers, care workers and bus drivers, should be given protective equipment and be tested regularly. On trains and buses, there are obvious implications for how many people can be commuting. And the use of face coverings should be the new normal \u2013 including at government press briefings. The contact-tracking system must be up and running efficiently. Though a test and trace system is being introduced today, scientists have already warned that it will prevent less than 15% of infections, given the large numbers still infected. And travel from one part of the country to another should be minimised, so infected travellers do not spark new epidemics in lower-risk regions. There are ominous signs that the mixed messages from the government have already led to more gatherings and crowded trains, and, in backing No 10 adviser Dominic Cummings, it has given the green light to long-distance travel. Stabilising the epidemic only buys time to find an effective treatment or vaccine. Perhaps the warmer temperatures will help, if we responsibly socially distance outdoors while the epidemic rumbles on. But when the colder weather pushes us indoors, without a vaccine, and unless contact tracing is massively stepped up, there will be a second wave: the epidemic will resurge. Not because it had to, but because we did not push the virus closer to extinction, we did not plan properly for the rebound, and thus gave the virus a second lease of life. And all of this will guarantee more Covid-19 deaths in the UK. \u2022 David Hunter is the Richard Doll professor of epidemiology and medicine in the Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford",

      "body": "<p>As a form of physical activity, it is easy to dismiss walking as, well, pedestrian. But now its benefits, both physical and mental, are being appreciated once again. Under lockdown, daily walks became sacred. Now they are the safest way to commute, and, for those stuck at home, there is little place else to go other than to wander the streets, forests, towpaths, cemeteries and eerily deserted business quarters.</p> <p>We have become nosy tourists in our own neighbourhoods. We seek out less-travelled backwaters, eyeing curiously the fragments of human and animal lives that we pass, gazing on seasonal changes like besotted new parents. But are we walking to the best of our abilities? Possibly not. Sports scientist Joanna Hall has dedicated her career to coaching people in how to walk the way their bodies were designed to, which no longer comes easily in this sedentary, screen-based era.</p> <p>\u201cI approach this as you would do if you wanted to get better at tennis,\u201d she says. She developed her <a href=\"https://www.joannahall.net/\">Walk Active</a> programme to enable people to ease their aches and pains as they exercise, rather than exacerbate them. Lifestyle, ageing and injuries mean that when we put one foot in front of the other, the way we use our muscles may be, she says, \u201csuboptimal for improving our posture, or reducing joint strain and getting the most out of walking\u201d.</p> <p>According to Hall, there are four common aspects we get wrong, and each has knock-on effects on the body. Firstly, instead of propelling ourselves forwards by pushing off with the back foot, like an ice-skater, we try to use our stepping foot to power us along. This is because sitting down too much has made our hip flexor muscles short and tight. Hall describes the necessary adjustment as the subtle difference between stepping into a space (wrong) and pushing off from a space, which will recruit the right muscles up the backs of your legs. \u201cYou use your glutes and you open up the core,\u201d says Hall.</p> <p>The second problem is what Hall calls a passive foot strike. The movement provided by the joints in our feet offers suspension and balance but we often plod along flatly instead, leaving us compromised. \u201cThat\u2019s what causes knee discomfort,\u201d says Hall. \u201cIt can create slight misalignment of the back, stiffness of the shoulders.\u201d</p> <p>The third thing to watch out for is letting your head hang forwards. Screens, reading and desk work have made this the default position, which is a bit of a disaster. \u201cWhen the head is slightly forward,\u201d says Hall, \u201cthe muscles of the upper back and the shoulders have to contract to hold it there. The shoulders come forward and can stiffen. Back mobility becomes restricted and you will not be able to rotate your spine from the hips.\u201d Try lifting your head before looking over your shoulder and you may discover, as I did, that you can turn your head much further all of a sudden.</p> <p>Finally, our arms tend to hang awkwardly or we force them into tense, power-walk movements, when what they want is to dangle freely. If you get steps one to three right, this should happen naturally. Hall has devised various drills to help correct these bad habits, such as measuring with your hand the gap between your bottom rib and your hip, and between your collarbone and your earlobe, and then adjusting your posture to lengthen those gaps. Walking with her tips in mind has made me feel lighter; more gazelle than galumph.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df9e3a2301c8999af213e13bfc1baa249af5ef06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df9e3a2301c8999af213e13bfc1baa249af5ef06/0_374_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Friends having a conversation while walking in the park\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Walking in step is like a physically distanced hug.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marilyn Nieves/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now that lockdown rules have eased, we can get some desperately needed time with friends or family members. Yes, not being allowed to hug is painful, but physically distanced walking together is the next best thing. This is because when two people walk together, they unconsciously fall into step. As a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/srep00959\">2012 study</a> by US and Japanese researchers found, when people move in sync together, their neural activity synchronises too. The more in sync we are, the deeper our social connection, so walking in step is pretty much a physically distanced hug.</p> <p>Walking has long been hailed as an aid to creativity, too, by big thinkers from Aristotle to Wordsworth to Stanford University behavioural scientist Marily Ann Oppezzo. In 2018, Oppezzo and her colleagues, who study creativity, published research that set out to demonstrate this lightbulb effect. Participants who brainstormed while walking thought of significantly more valid ideas than those who tried to do the same while sitting.</p> <p>So if you have to attend a (socially-distanced) brainstorming meeting, says Oppezzo, \u201cgo think about ideas beforehand while walking.\u201d Brainstorming in groups, she says, is far less productive.</p> <p>If you need to maximise the potential of a creative walk \u2013 perhaps you are finally starting that novel while quarantining \u2013 she suggests picking a problem or topic beforehand and thinking about potential new perspectives on it while you walk. Rather than taking a \u201cdeep dive\u201d, she says, walking is great for taking a stroll around a subject, seeing it from different sides and coming up with new ideas.</p> <p>She recommends travelling at a comfortable pace, so your physical exertion needs minimal attention, and coming up with as many ideas as you can, rather than trying to lock on to the first one you have. And if the ideas aren\u2019t flowing, don\u2019t force it. Come back to it another time.</p> <p>Crucially, in the study, she had participants record their ideas, rather than write them down, \u201cbecause the idea of writing something down is already a filter \u2013 is this good enough to write down? You can put your headphones on and record through your phone.\u201d And if you are feeling self-conscious, the headphones allow you to pretend to passers-by that you\u2019re having a phone conversation.</p> <p>As well as percolating the cerebral juices, there are powerful mental-health benefits to be gained from walking. Half an hour of walking per day has been found to be as helpful as more intense 20-minute workouts in <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/regular-walking-can-help-ease-depression/\">treating depression</a>. <a href=\"http://hoda.ie/\">Hugh O\u2019Donovan, a psychologist based in Cork</a>, wrote about the beneficial effects in his 2015 book Mindful Walking: Walk Your Way to Mental and Physical Well-Being. Walking provides what he calls \u201cnatural meds\u201d, and there are no rules. Do you want to walk alone or with others? Do you listen to music or the outside world? Right now, enjoying the variety of options is key. \u201cYou have different locations and different routes,\u201d says O\u2019Donovan. \u201cYou can pick up the pace when you like, or you can slow down and be a bit more mindful. It doesn\u2019t really matter. It\u2019s just the fact that you\u2019re doing it.\u201d</p> <p>To reinforce the positive effects, he suggests \u201cexperimenting with noticing how you\u2019re feeling. Is it lifting my mood? Am I meeting people and socialising a little?\u201d However you prefer to walk, he invites you to \u201ccome to your senses. This is profoundly important because much of the time we\u2019re on autopilot. We\u2019re unconscious, unaware of what\u2019s going on around us. There\u2019s magic all around us all the time but we\u2019re too busy.\u201d Coronavirus has slowed life down, perhaps making it a little easier to pay attention. \u201cWhat are you seeing, smelling, tasting?\u201d he asks. \u201cThe world looks like a completely different place when you bring this quality of curiosity to everything you do. People underestimate its value.\u201d</p> <p>While walking helps oil the cogs of the mind, and can help you get perspective if you\u2019re struggling with something seismic such as grief, a job loss or the uncertainty of life under Covid-19, it pays to be aware of the risks of rumination. Namely, says O\u2019Donovan, \u201cthe error and bias that\u2019s associated with thinking, which lead us down a slippery slope into catastrophising and predicting the future negatively.\u201d How can you avoid repeating the unhelpful and yet perfectly natural response, \u201cwhy me?\u201d or \u201cwhy this?\u201d Ask instead, says O\u2019Donovan, \u201cwhat now?\u201d Walking can help with this. \u201cThe world opens up in a different way when we lift our mood, when we don\u2019t fall into the hole.</p> <p>\u201cYour best chance to stay in contention, as I call it, is to be mindful about what\u2019s going on in the world,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt might seem like it\u2019s very dark at the moment, but there\u2019s lots of good stuff going on too. Focus on what kind of a story you choose to tell. And, by getting out, moving and keeping your energy up, you have the possibility of telling a more positive story.\u201d</p>",

Hall has devised various drills to help correct these bad habits, such as measuring with your hand the gap between your bottom rib and your hip, and between your collarbone and your earlobe, and then adjusting your posture to lengthen those gaps. Walking with her tips in mind has made me feel lighter; more gazelle than galumph. Now that lockdown rules have eased, we can get some desperately needed time with friends or family members. Yes, not being allowed to hug is painful, but physically distanced walking together is the next best thing. This is because when two people walk together, they unconsciously fall into step. As a 2012 study by US and Japanese researchers found, when people move in sync together, their neural activity synchronises too. The more in sync we are, the deeper our social connection, so walking in step is pretty much a physically distanced hug. Walking has long been hailed as an aid to creativity, too, by big thinkers from Aristotle to Wordsworth to Stanford University behavioural scientist Marily Ann Oppezzo. In 2018, Oppezzo and her colleagues, who study creativity, published research that set out to demonstrate this lightbulb effect. Participants who brainstormed while walking thought of significantly more valid ideas than those who tried to do the same while sitting. So if you have to attend a (socially-distanced) brainstorming meeting, says Oppezzo, \u201cgo think about ideas beforehand while walking.\u201d Brainstorming in groups, she says, is far less productive. If you need to maximise the potential of a creative walk \u2013 perhaps you are finally starting that novel while quarantining \u2013 she suggests picking a problem or topic beforehand and thinking about potential new perspectives on it while you walk. Rather than taking a \u201cdeep dive\u201d, she says, walking is great for taking a stroll around a subject, seeing it from different sides and coming up with new ideas. She recommends travelling at a comfortable pace, so your physical exertion needs minimal attention, and coming up with as many ideas as you can, rather than trying to lock on to the first one you have. And if the ideas aren\u2019t flowing, don\u2019t force it. Come back to it another time. Crucially, in the study, she had participants record their ideas, rather than write them down, \u201cbecause the idea of writing something down is already a filter \u2013 is this good enough to write down? You can put your headphones on and record through your phone.\u201d And if you are feeling self-conscious, the headphones allow you to pretend to passers-by that you\u2019re having a phone conversation. As well as percolating the cerebral juices, there are powerful mental-health benefits to be gained from walking. Half an hour of walking per day has been found to be as helpful as more intense 20-minute workouts in treating depression. Hugh O\u2019Donovan, a psychologist based in Cork, wrote about the beneficial effects in his 2015 book Mindful Walking: Walk Your Way to Mental and Physical Well-Being. Walking provides what he calls \u201cnatural meds\u201d, and there are no rules. Do you want to walk alone or with others? Do you listen to music or the outside world? Right now, enjoying the variety of options is key. \u201cYou have different locations and different routes,\u201d says O\u2019Donovan. \u201cYou can pick up the pace when you like, or you can slow down and be a bit more mindful. It doesn\u2019t really matter. It\u2019s just the fact that you\u2019re doing it.\u201d To reinforce the positive effects, he suggests \u201cexperimenting with noticing how you\u2019re feeling. Is it lifting my mood? Am I meeting people and socialising a little?\u201d However you prefer to walk, he invites you to \u201ccome to your senses. This is profoundly important because much of the time we\u2019re on autopilot. We\u2019re unconscious, unaware of what\u2019s going on around us. There\u2019s magic all around us all the time but we\u2019re too busy.\u201d Coronavirus has slowed life down, perhaps making it a little easier to pay attention. \u201cWhat are you seeing, smelling, tasting?\u201d he asks. \u201cThe world looks like a completely different place when you bring this quality of curiosity to everything you do. People underestimate its value.\u201d While walking helps oil the cogs of the mind, and can help you get perspective if you\u2019re struggling with something seismic such as grief, a job loss or the uncertainty of life under Covid-19, it pays to be aware of the risks of rumination. Namely, says O\u2019Donovan, \u201cthe error and bias that\u2019s associated with thinking, which lead us down a slippery slope into catastrophising and predicting the future negatively.\u201d How can you avoid repeating the unhelpful and yet perfectly natural response, \u201cwhy me?\u201d or \u201cwhy this?\u201d Ask instead, says O\u2019Donovan, \u201cwhat now?\u201d Walking can help with this. \u201cThe world opens up in a different way when we lift our mood, when we don\u2019t fall into the hole. \u201cYour best chance to stay in contention, as I call it, is to be mindful about what\u2019s going on in the world,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt might seem like it\u2019s very dark at the moment, but there\u2019s lots of good stuff going on too. Focus on what kind of a story you choose to tell. And, by getting out, moving and keeping your energy up, you have the possibility of telling a more positive story.\u201d",

Coronavirus Extra Ryanair is the worst major airline for refunding British customers whose flights have been cancelled during the coronavirus pandemic, with more than eight out of 10 people still waiting for their money back, according to figures from Which?. No planes in the sky, empty hotels, deserted attractions: with the world at a standstill, the tourism industry has been one of the industries worst hit. But as destinations slowly emerge from lockdown and borders tentatively reopen, many in the sector are wondering if this is a chance for tourism to rebuild in a greener, more sustainable way. Lockdown has reminded us of the pleasures of walking. But making small changes can boost its benefits to our health, mood and creativity, too. Here is how to optimise your stride and focus your mind to get the most from your daily stroll. Today in Focus podcast: Scandal of Covid-19 in care homes Why did so many people die in care homes? That may be the most urgent question of the likely public inquiry into the UK\u2019s Covid-19 response. Listen to Rob Booth, the Guardian\u2019s social affairs correspondent, on the government failures that led to thousands of care home deaths. Lunchtime read: Global threat to free press From Mexico to Malta, attacks on journalists and publishers have proved deadly to individuals and chilling to broader freedoms. And now Covid-19 is being used as an excuse to silence more voices, writes Gill Phillips. Sport A group of clubs, led by Liverpool, will argue against paying a \u00a3330m rebate to Sky and other broadcasters at a meeting to discuss the matter on Thursday, despite the Premier League\u2019s recommendation that it should be accepted. Andy Murray will be hoping to compete in his first match since November when competitive tennis returns to Great Britain at the end of next month with a national tournament organised by his brother, Jamie. Formula One teams must make significant cuts to their budgets in each of the next five seasons after the FIA announced new budget caps on Wednesday. And Alex Hales looks set to remain frozen out of England\u2019s one-day setup for some time yet after Eoin Morgan scotched talk of an imminent comeback and stressed the opener\u2019s recreational drugs ban could have derailed last year\u2019s World Cup bid. Business Asian stocks were mixed after an upbeat open on Thursday, as investors pinned their hopes on an economic rebound from the coronavirus crisis. Shares rose in Tokyo, Sydney and Shanghai but dropped in Hong Kong where tensions are flaring over Beijing\u2019s effort to exert more control by forcing security laws on to the territory. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has told Congress the Trump administration no longer regards Hong Kong as autonomous from mainland China, which sets the stage for the US to withdraw its preferential trade and financial status. The pound is worth $1.224 and \u20ac1.112 at time of writing, at which point the FTSE is trending about 70 points higher. The papers You can see all the front pages here today. The Guardian says \u201cTories defy PM to pile pressure on Cummings\u201d. It also gives prominence to Emily Maitlis, who did not present Newsnight on Wednesday after a statement from the BBC said she broke impartiality rules on Tuesday\u2019s programme. The FT\u2019s headline is \u201cJohnson brushes aside Cummings inquiry demands despite backlash\u201d, quoting the PM saying it\u2019s time to \u201cmove on\u201d. Its sub headline is \u201cBlame shifted for pandemic failings\u201d. The Telegraph also carries a large picture of Maitlis and says she \u201cbroke BBC rules with Cummings rant\u201d. Its splash is \u201cPublic told they have \u2018duty\u2019 to test and trace\u201d. The Mirror, which jointly broke the Cummings story with the Guardian, still has Cummings squarely in its sights, picturing him on the front page with the PM and the headline: \u201cWhy don\u2019t YOU do YOUR duty \u2026\u201d The Times also leads on the new test-and-trace policy: \u201cDo your duty and we can defeat virus, Britain told\u201d. It covers Emily Maitlis in the right-hand column. The Metro says Boris Johnson is \u201cZooming Fuming\u201d, saying PM \u201csticks by Cummings as he\u2019s grilled by furious MPs\u201d. The Daily Mail is Cummings-free on its front, instead splashing on the \u201cTest &amp; trace revolution\u201d while the Express has \u201cTest and Trace: Key to our freedom\u201d. The Sun says \u201cAle meet again\u201d, with the news that pubs are to \u201copen in June\u201d. And finally, while strictly speaking not a newspaper front page, the New European\u2019s headline is too good to ignore: \u201cNerd Immunity: why the PM risked everything to protect Cummings\u201d.

A nationwide curfew had been in place for just a week, as part of Uganda\u2019s coronavirus lockdown.</p> <p>The next moment, security forces arrived. \u201cThey said you pack your things and go. I told them I\u2019m packing, I want to leave,\u201d she says. At that point, Joyce says, a local government enforcement officer walked over and kicked her saucepan, which was filled with boiling oil. \u201cHe came and kicked it without saying anything.

      "bodyText": "In her small home in Gulu, northern Uganda, Alanyo Joyce dabs at her bare breasts. In some areas, pink and oozing, the skin has been burnt off. It hurts, deeply, from the bone, she says. She is also grappling with her new appearance \u2013 the burns extend across her face, arms and legs, as well as her chest. On Wednesday, 8 April, the softly-spoken 31-year-old was cooking chips and chicken at her usual spot in the city when she realised it was approaching 7pm. A nationwide curfew had been in place for just a week, as part of Uganda\u2019s coronavirus lockdown. The next moment, security forces arrived. \u201cThey said you pack your things and go. I told them I\u2019m packing, I want to leave,\u201d she says. At that point, Joyce says, a local government enforcement officer walked over and kicked her saucepan, which was filled with boiling oil. \u201cHe came and kicked it without saying anything. I realised my body was burning,\u201d she says. \u201cThat day I had put on a white dress and the whole thing was brown.\u201d Joyce\u2019s account fits a pattern of security forces using excessive force during Uganda\u2019s lockdown, which began on 30 March. Days before the incident, dozens of women and men were allegedly tortured in Elegu, two hours drive from Gulu. The soldiers and police said to be responsible were only arrested after images of the victims went viral on social media. \u201cPolice brutality is always prohibited, pandemic or no pandemic,\u201d says Oryem Nyeko, the Uganda researcher at Human Rights Watch. The New York-headquartered organisation say security forces in Uganda have arbitrarily arrested, beaten and shot civilians, including journalists, vendors and LGBT people, since coronavirus restrictions began. It is one of many African countries where there have been complaints about harsh lockdown enforcement, yet little social protection for citizens who fear they will starve if they can\u2019t continue working. Ugandan activists have been detained while protesting against the lack of food distributions for people in need, while opposition politician Francis Zaake was arrested for handing out food without going through government channels, and says he was tortured in police custody. On patrol with the Ugandan military in Gulu after curfew, the Guardian witnessed one soldier slapping and then kicking a man in the head. In interviews conducted separately, several victims of brutality by security forces have described abuse they went through and displayed their injuries. \u201cWhen I was beaten there was no medicine, I couldn\u2019t get treatment until the next day,\u201d says one man, pointing to a round wound on the crown of his head. He asked not to be named for fear of retaliation. He he had been walking home close to the curfew time when he was hit in the head from behind, he says. \u201cNow I still feel the pain and it keeps itching.\u201d Joyce was in hospital for five days. Her landlady\u2019s children brought her food \u2013 the only assistance she got, she says. After months making between 20,000 and 30,000 Ugandan shillings (\u00a34\u2013\u00a36) profit a day while she was working, Joyce had no savings. Her alleged attacker was arrested, but later released on police bail. She worries that if charges against him go ahead, and he is imprisoned, she won\u2019t receive any compensation. \u201cAt least if we can negotiate, [maybe] he can [give] me something little which can earn me a living for the meantime,\u201d she says. The day after the attack, the man allegedly responsible called to ask for forgiveness, saying he didn\u2019t mean to do it, she says. \u201cYou know what you did, you did it purposefully,\u201d she remembers telling him, saying she was \u201cfull of anger\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m a human being like you,\u201d she said. As she spoke, her five-year-old boy peered from outside, through a curtained door. In a phone interview with the Guardian, Gulu\u2019s resident district commissioner and chairman of the coronavirus task force, Maj Santos Okot Lapolo, said the enforcement officer had been excessive in his actions. \u201cWhen this issue of curfew and what have you was taking place some people were extra vigilant,\u201d he said. He added that further questions of aid or compensation for Joyce cannot be discussed while the coronavirus lockdown is ongoing. \u201cWe cannot do anything right now when we are still in the crisis mood,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll cross the bridge when we [assess] what is our stability. In the future we will get something to support her.\u201d Joyce is taking antibiotics to prevent infection, as well as painkillers, but she\u2019s struggling. \u201cMy blood pressure shot up that day,\u201d she says. \u201cNow I don\u2019t know what will come tomorrow and I have no ways of getting money for my living.

BBC sources said Newsnight\u2019s editor, Esme Wren, worked on Tuesday night\u2019s episode. \u201cThe BBC must uphold the highest standards of due impartiality in its news output,\u201d the corporation said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve reviewed the entirety of last night\u2019s Newsnight, including the opening section, and while we believe the programme contained fair, reasonable and rigorous journalism, we feel that we should have done more to make clear the introduction was a summary of the questions we would examine, with all the accompanying evidence, in the rest of the programme. \u201cAs it was, we believe the introduction we broadcast did not meet our standards of due impartiality. Our staff have been reminded of the guidelines.\u201d Keith Brown, SNP deputy leader, said: \u201cThis statement is a gutless capitulation by BBC bosses. Newsnight should be commended - not slapped down - for their serious investigative work on Cummings, that\u2019s not something you could say about the BBC News at 10. \u201cPandering to 10 Downing Street by curbing journalists from being able to hold the UK government to account is of serious concern.\u201d An SNP spokesperson added: \u201cIt\u2019s ironic that the only apology over the whole Dominic Cummings lockdown breaches scandal comes from the BBC.\u201d Maitlis\u2019s profile, already high, has risen further since she was made lead presenter of the nightly current affairs show last year, shortly after publishing her book Airhead on life as a television presenter. She received global acclaim after confronting Prince Andrew about his connections with the deceased paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. In April she had a viral hit with another monologue of hers dismissing the idea that coronavirus is a \u201cgreat leveller\u201d given its disproportionate impact on poorer people . The BBC has faced heavy criticism over the issue of maintaining impartiality in its news coverage, particularly over its handling of complaints about comments that BBC Breakfast\u2019s presenter Naga Munchetty made about Donald Trump. It also struggled to deal with the enormous levels of criticism from both Labour and the Conservatives during the 2019 general election. \u2022 This article was amended on 27 and 28 May 2020. A comment from Esme Wren was added shortly after publication on 27 May; a further update was made on 28 May to include a tweet from Emily Maitlis saying that she had \u201casked for the night off\u201d.",

A briefing paper released on Thursday by Tasmanian independent state MP Meg Webb examines the cuts to sitting across state and territory parliaments during the pandemic.

      "body": "<p>On a Tuesday in early April, viewers around the globe watched streamers on Twitch play one particular game for a combined 34m hours, smashing established live-streaming viewership records. The game in question, Valorant by Riot Games, has been averaging hundreds of thousands of daily spectators ever since, quickly displacing Twitch stalwarts such as League of Legends and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/fortnite\">Fortnite</a>.</p> <p>Valorant is a ready-baked esport: a competitive shooter designed to be watched as well as played. After a few weeks with Valorant, I\u2019ve found it to be a careful mix of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive\u2019s meticulous but rewarding gunplay and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/27/overwatch-review-blizzard\">Overwatch</a>\u2019s characters and soft-edged charm.</p> <p>This combination \u2013 complemented by expensive anti-cheat measures and super-fast servers \u2013 has made it an easy sell for hardcore players. Many professional crack shots are jumping ship from games such as Apex Legends and Fortnite, the most notable departure thus far being 2019 Overwatch League MVP Jay \u201cSinatraa\u201d Won, who revealed in April that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SFShock/status/1255250197510225922?s=20\">he was leaving Blizzard\u2019s hero shooter behind to focus on Valorant.</a></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8amyzDHOKw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/g8amyzDHOKw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Yet for the casual player like me, Valorant still has a lot to offer. While I might not be the most accurate shot, I can still be useful in other areas. My preferred character, Cypher \u2013 one of nine in the game right now \u2013 has the tools to provide match-winning information about the enemy team through careful camera placement and pesky tripwires. It turns every round into a battle of wits as well as accuracy, weaving personal narratives into a conventionally cold competitive format.</p> <p>The game\u2019s slick design has enabled its meteoric rise on Twitch, but a crucial difference between this game and previous contenders is that almost no one could get their hands on it for weeks. Valorant spent almost two months in a very limited closed beta stage, which ends today on 28 May, and the digital keys to the virtual kingdom were a hot commodity. Riot Games\u2019 clever marketing scheme was to let streamers give away keys to their viewers, incentivising millions of people to watch the game being played in the hopes of gaining access for themselves.</p> <p>This led to an initial boom, but it didn\u2019t take long for things to turn sour. Top streamer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/drdisrespect/status/1248075009790103554?s=20\">Dr Disrespect was caught fraudulently advertising</a> beta keys, and some players with access took to eBay to trade their accounts for profit. In an attempt to keep the system fair, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PlayVALORANT/status/1248047652500992002?s=20\">Riot swept its player database, banning many account sellers</a>, and later opened up giveaway drops to all streamers with beta access instead of a curated few. But then people started streaming prerecorded footage of their gameplay, claiming that they were \u201clive-playing\u201d Valorant, trying to bring in more viewers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb60cbe2d88c971202e0e542f129890248aea9c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb60cbe2d88c971202e0e542f129890248aea9c6/0_0_1634_920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Team game\u2019 \u2026 Valorant.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Team game\u2019 \u2026 Valorant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Riot Games</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Under lockdown, when viewers may have more free time than usual, Riot\u2019s approach has created a perfect storm of hype. But it has also left some debris in its wake. While writing this, I watched a houseful of streamers play the game in shifts to a drop-desperate audience in the hundreds \u2013 yet the chat was devoid of conversation, beyond viewers pinging the watch-time command to expose the nauseating amount of hours they\u2019ve spent watching and hoping for access.

      "bodyText": "On a Tuesday in early April, viewers around the globe watched streamers on Twitch play one particular game for a combined 34m hours, smashing established live-streaming viewership records. The game in question, Valorant by Riot Games, has been averaging hundreds of thousands of daily spectators ever since, quickly displacing Twitch stalwarts such as League of Legends and Fortnite. Valorant is a ready-baked esport: a competitive shooter designed to be watched as well as played. After a few weeks with Valorant, I\u2019ve found it to be a careful mix of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive\u2019s meticulous but rewarding gunplay and Overwatch\u2019s characters and soft-edged charm. This combination \u2013 complemented by expensive anti-cheat measures and super-fast servers \u2013 has made it an easy sell for hardcore players. Many professional crack shots are jumping ship from games such as Apex Legends and Fortnite, the most notable departure thus far being 2019 Overwatch League MVP Jay \u201cSinatraa\u201d Won, who revealed in April that he was leaving Blizzard\u2019s hero shooter behind to focus on Valorant. Yet for the casual player like me, Valorant still has a lot to offer. While I might not be the most accurate shot, I can still be useful in other areas. My preferred character, Cypher \u2013 one of nine in the game right now \u2013 has the tools to provide match-winning information about the enemy team through careful camera placement and pesky tripwires. It turns every round into a battle of wits as well as accuracy, weaving personal narratives into a conventionally cold competitive format. The game\u2019s slick design has enabled its meteoric rise on Twitch, but a crucial difference between this game and previous contenders is that almost no one could get their hands on it for weeks. Valorant spent almost two months in a very limited closed beta stage, which ends today on 28 May, and the digital keys to the virtual kingdom were a hot commodity. Riot Games\u2019 clever marketing scheme was to let streamers give away keys to their viewers, incentivising millions of people to watch the game being played in the hopes of gaining access for themselves. This led to an initial boom, but it didn\u2019t take long for things to turn sour. Top streamer Dr Disrespect was caught fraudulently advertising beta keys, and some players with access took to eBay to trade their accounts for profit. In an attempt to keep the system fair, Riot swept its player database, banning many account sellers, and later opened up giveaway drops to all streamers with beta access instead of a curated few. But then people started streaming prerecorded footage of their gameplay, claiming that they were \u201clive-playing\u201d Valorant, trying to bring in more viewers. Under lockdown, when viewers may have more free time than usual, Riot\u2019s approach has created a perfect storm of hype. But it has also left some debris in its wake. While writing this, I watched a houseful of streamers play the game in shifts to a drop-desperate audience in the hundreds \u2013 yet the chat was devoid of conversation, beyond viewers pinging the watch-time command to expose the nauseating amount of hours they\u2019ve spent watching and hoping for access. I\u2019m not sure this is what Riot had in mind when it kicked off this campaign. For those who snagged a coveted beta key, the watching and waiting was worth it. Having played Counter-Strike for almost two decades, Kai Powell spent roughly 50 hours waiting for Valorant access over three or four days. \u201cI like that Valorant feels different from other hero shooters because the abilities supplement the gunplay,\u201d Powell tells me. \u201cIf you look at Overwatch, you\u2019re locked into whatever weapons that character comes with.\u201d Natalie Flores has spent more than 1,500 hours in Overwatch, but now plays Valorant on a daily basis. \u201cValorant is a team game, but doing well individually is enough to lead your team to victory,\u201d Flores tells me. \u201cToo often, I\u2019m doing well in Overwatch, but my teammates will deny constant opportunities to coordinate attacks together \u2026 even if it ends in a victory, the process leading up to the win was so exhausting that it usually doesn\u2019t feel rewarding!\u201d Yet like many competitive esports \u2013 including Riot\u2019s own League of Legends \u2013 Valorant already has a toxicity problem. (A recent example posted to Twitter shows a Riot developer being hit on and then harassed while playing her own game.) \u201cRiot will need to focus on creating some structural changes or else many people, especially people of colour or women like me, won\u2019t stick around,\u201d Flores says. \u201cAnd we make up a too significant portion of every game\u2019s player base for any company to ignore.\u201d With the recent introduction of a ranked mode bringing structure to competitive play, Valorant\u2019s success appears to be a foregone conclusion.

      "bodyText": "The mining magnate, Clive Palmer, has instructed his lawyers to commence a high court challenge against the Queensland government\u2019s ongoing border closure. The court on Thursday afternoon heard that a similar case launched by Palmer, challenging the Western Australia border closure, would likely take at least six weeks to proceed to a hearing in mid-July. Peter Dunning QC, representing Palmer, told the court it was hoped the cases could dovetail. Both states have said publicly that border closures are based on health advice, and that they will likely keep the measures in place for several months. The high court chief justice, Susan Kiefel, advised Palmer\u2019s lawyers to consider the mining multimillionaire\u2019s standing to bring a case against his home state, given his own movement is not restricted by the border closure. Dunning said the closure had affected Mineralogy, Palmer\u2019s flagship company. Earlier Joshua Thompson, Western Australia\u2019s solicitor-general, told the court the state may seek to present to the court \u201copinion evidence\u201d to establish the reasonableness of the state\u2019s border closure and its effect in preventing the spread of the Covid-19 virus. \u201cThe establishment of the constitutional facts-related reasonableness of the [border closure] measures is on the defendants [the state of Western Australia] \u2026 in this case. If you can\u2019t, the validity of the measure has not been established. \u201cThat\u2019s why we will have some significant evidence in relation to that \u2026 that will require some evidence about a number of different things and some of those things may not be capable of statistical quantification.\u201d Palmer launched the proceedings after being denied entry to Western Australia this month. Before the court hearing on Thursday, Palmer released a statement calling the border closure in Queensland \u201can injustice\u201d. \u201cI am duty-bound to show solidarity towards and do whatever is in my power to help those who are now unemployed and have businesses that have been adversely affected,\u201d he said of the imminent Queensland challenge. \u201cOpening the borders in Queensland will provide the boost needed to return jobs and prosperity to this state. \u201c[The premier] Annastacia Palaszczuk is discriminating against her own people by locking away the fruits of Queensland such as the Great Barrier Reef and other treasures from interstate visitors.\u201d Palaszczuk has said the border closure could remain in place until September and that it was based on the advice of the state\u2019s chief health officer. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, on Wednesday said that states with closed borders needed to justify the decision with public health advice. While Queensland residents are not able to travel long distances or take overnight trips within their own state, authorities say they will not stop residents from entering New South Wales next week to take advantage of newly-relaxed restrictions south of the border. The situation means a Brisbane resident can potentially visit Albury 1,400km away but not lawfully travel north of Noosa, from 1 June. The Queensland health minister, Steven Miles, the health department and police each advise residents they should only cross the border to leave the state for an essential purpose, but after questions from Guardian Australia police confirmed they were not stopping any Queenslanders from leaving or returning. Only those who have visited coronavirus \u201chotspots\u201d \u2013 of which there are none in NSW \u2013 would be required to self-isolate for 14 days on return. \u201cThe actions of a person within another state in relation to Covid-19 are subject to that state\u2019s chief health officer and enforcement agency,\u201d a police spokesman said. Current Queensland regulations limit people to travel within 150km of their homes, or 500km if they live in outback areas. No overnight tourism is allowed until 13 June. From 1 June, New South Wales will allow travel to regional areas in an attempt to restart its local tourism industry. More than 3 million Queenslanders live within 150km of the New South Wales border and could cross without breaching the existing local restrictions. Miles told Guardian Australia that the state\u2019s border restrictions were in place to keep Queenslanders safe. \u201cThere is still community transmission in Sydney and Melbourne,\u201d Miles said. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t want to see is that spread to Queensland \u201cSo far, Queenslanders have done an incredible job following the directions and limiting their movements. \u201cWe\u2019re asking Queenslanders not to cross the border, unless for an essential service. \u201cAs the restrictions are lifted, let\u2019s take an inch not a mile. On 13 June, Queenslanders can holiday in Queensland within 150km of their home. \u201cIf we all keep following the rules, restrictions will continue to be lifted.\u201d",

That\u2019s why we made the difficult decision to temporarily limit prisoners\u2019 daily routines in response to the outbreak of coronavirus in the UK, and moved quickly to introduce measures such as family video calls to minimise the impact of spending more time in cells.\u201d",

<p>South Australia has called a halt to granting international travel exemptions on compassionate grounds after SA Health bungled the case of a British woman who arrived on the weekend and tested positive to Covid-19.</p> \n  <p>Premier <strong> Steven Marshall </strong>says he wants to get to the bottom of the problem, which resulted in the woman presenting herself to authorities on arrival in Adelaide rather than being met by health officials, before allowing any further international travellers into SA in such circumstances.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we should be granting any further exemptions for overseas travel to South Australia until we\u2019ve ironed out this administrative error,\u201d Mr Marshall said on Thursday.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to make sure we have airtight systems going forward before we grant further exemptions for people coming from overseas.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But Marshall said he did not intend to \u201chang SA Health out to dry\u201d and praised the department\u2019s overall handling of the pandemic as well as the previous arrival of international travellers.</p> \n  <p>The premier also confirmed police commissioner Grant Stevens would meet the SA Health chief executive to develop new arrangements for future transfers.<br></p> \n  <p>Before Sunday\u2019s case, 21 other people had come to SA from overseas on compassionate grounds, about half to attend a funeral and the others to visit a dying relative.</p> \n  <p>The British woman, in her 50s, was granted her exemption to visit a dying relative.<br></p> \n  <p>She had spent about a week in quarantine in Victoria after arriving in Australia from the UK and had tested negative while in isolation.</p> \n  <p>She wore a mask while travelling to SA and made herself known to airport authorities and was then escorted out by police.</p> \n  <p>When tested again, she returned the positive result, becoming the state\u2019s 440th case of Covid-19 and the first for almost three weeks.</p> \n  <p>The woman was returned to quarantine while almost 20 close contacts were also ordered into self-isolation.</p> \n  <p>After initially saying Victorian officials did not tell them when the woman would arrive, chief public health Officer <strong>Nicola Spurrier </strong>issued a statement on Thursday conceding the flight information was passed on.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cDue to an administrative oversight, we can confirm the relevant flight details involving an overseas traveller arriving in South Australia were provided to SA Health prior to their arrival,\u201d Spurrier said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWhat this issue has highlighted is the need to strengthen the processes involving travellers arriving from overseas and travelling between states during their quarantine period.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>After SA\u2019s initial comments, Victorian chief health officer <strong>Brett Sutton</strong> said South Australia was told of the woman\u2019s travel details and he had the email to prove it.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure why there is a misunderstanding about having been informed, but that email was sent and South Australian authorities were alerted about the time and flight details,\u201d Sutton said.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T04:14:10.397Z\">at 5.14am BST</time></p>

And he set out to have not just a single, unified medical voice, but to have the unity with the states. <br></p> \n   <p>And I believe that that national cabinet process has been extremely valuable. <br></p> \n   <p>I hope that there is support for it from the states and the premiers and the chief ministers going forward. My personal view, looking at what\u2019s happened with health, it\u2019s allowed us to strike the private hospitals agreement, it\u2019s allowed us to strike the public hospitals agreement. <br></p> \n   <p>It\u2019s allowed us to work with the public health units on the contact tracing.

This rule supports our regulated businesses to uphold their AML/CTF obligations while adopting a flexible approach to customer identity processes.<br></p> \n  <p>Austrac collaborated on the rule change with the Australian Banking Association and the Australian Israel Chamber of Commerce NSW who initiated the project and identified the opening of bank accounts as a significant barrier.

This is directly related to the level of pre-pandemic income support payments.</li> \n   <li>The single rate of Newstart in January 2018 (including rent assistance and energy supplement) was $117pw below the poverty line ($185pw if they did not receive rent assistance). Youth allowance (plus these supplements) was $164pw below the poverty line ($232pw without rent assistance).</li> \n   <li>Households that have to rely mainly on social security payments (eg unemployment, parenting, and disability payments) are five times more likely to experience poverty (36%) than those receiving most income from wages and salaries (7%). However, 38% of those in poverty are in wage-earning households; the majority of whom are households with children.</li> \n   <li>In households where the main earner is a female, the poverty rate is 19% \u2013 almost double the rate when the main earner is male \u2013 10%. </li> \n   <li>In single parent families in which the main earner is a woman the rate of poverty (37%) is twice that in which the main earner is a man (18%).</li> \n   <li>The biggest differences in poverty rates between households with male and female main earners are in families with children. The average poverty rate among people in families with children where the main income-earner is female is 23%, compared with 10% where the main income-earner is male (which is the more common arrangement). In contrast, among households without children, the average poverty rate where the main income-earner is female is 12%, compared with 10% where the main income-earner is male.</li> \n   <li>Nearly half the children in sole parent families live in poverty (44%) compared with 13% for children living with both parents.</li> \n   <li>While those of working age are at greater risk of poverty than older people, over 65s who are living in private rental face a relatively high risk of poverty (41%).</li> \n   <li> Renters are almost twice as likely to live in poverty as home-owners (19% compared with 9%) with public housing tenants at greatest risk (58%).</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>You can read the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/Poverty2020pt2\">whole report here</a>. <br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T00:01:37.126Z\">at 1.01am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ecee3f58f0898700351d85f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-27T22:07:26.544Z\">11.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Australian Council of Social Services has released a report \u2013 Poverty in Australia 2020: Part 2 \u2013 Who is affected? <em>\u2013 </em>which looks at the impact of poverty before the Covid-19 crisis.</p> \n  <p>Its findings, unfortunately shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise to anyone. As the acting Acoss CEO, <strong>Jacqueline Phillips</strong>,<strong> </strong>says:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><strong>This report exposes the disproportionate impact of poverty on households in which women are the main income earners. These households are twice as likely to live in poverty as those in which men are the main income earners (19% and 10%, respectively), with the gap even higher in households with children (at 23% and 10% respectively).</strong></p> \n   <p> Disturbingly, more than a third of single mothers and their children are living in poverty (37%). The challenges faced by single mothers that lead to so many being on low incomes have serious implications for the wellbeing of those women and their children.</p> \n   <p>Early indications suggest that women have been suffering some of the worst economic impacts of the current pandemic, and effective policy action is needed to ensure this does not translate into an ongoing reduction in female employment or an increase in poverty amongst women and children. A snapback on childcare or income support risks trapping single mothers and their children in poverty.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-27T23:59:58.446Z\">at 12.59am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ecedd6f8f087e3ca0f64ae2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-27T21:36:56.374Z\">10.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Rugby League is back.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NRL/status/1265756229772603397\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">May 28.<br><br>That\u2019s it.

And don\u2019t forget our live coverage of tonight\u2019s NRL resumption. Here\u2019s a quick rundown on everything that happened today: News Corp Australia have announced the print closure of more than 100 local and regional newspapers, resulting in hundreds of job losses. Reserve Bank head Phil Lowe told a senate select committee into Covid-19 that the JobKeeper wage subsidy scheme may need to be extended. The Australian Paramedics Association accused the NSW government of showing \u201ccomplete disregard\u201d for workers in response to its decision to freeze public sector wages, including for health workers. Two security guards at a Victorian quarantine hotel for returned travellers have tested positive for Covid-19, after an employee earlier tested positive. South Australian health authorities have retracted their claim Victoria did not tell them about a British woman who arrived in Adelaide from Melbourne and later tested positive for coronavirus. The situation has also led premier Steven Marshall to declare a halt to international travel exemptions on compassionate grounds. Clive Palmer has decided he\u2019ll take Queensland to the high court at the same time as he pursues WA over the border closures. Six more crew from the Al Kuwait live export ship docked at Fremantle have tested positive to Covid-19, taking WA\u2019s total to 577. WA Health have released updated Covid-19 figures for Thursday that reveal a further seven cases in the state, taking the total to 577. A statement said: Of these seven new cases, six are crew members from the Al Kuwait and one is a returned overseas traveller who is already in hotel quarantine. Three of the Al Kuwait crew members tested positive while still onboard the ship and are being transferred to hotel quarantine. The other three crew members who tested positive are already in hotel quarantine after disembarking the ship yesterday. An additional two crew members are being transferred from the ship into hotel quarantine as they had significant contact with crew members who have tested positive. The 10 crew members remaining on the ship have been tested for COVID-19 and all crew members in hotel quarantine will also be tested. There are now 18 active cases in Western Australia. Of the active cases one is a Western Australian, five are from interstate and 12 are crew members from the Al Kuwait. Sports fans haven\u2019t had much to get excited about recently, which might explain why my colleague Mike Hytner, Guardian Australia\u2019s sport editor, is typing in caps lock over on our NRL live blog. The season resumes tonight, in about two hours, with the Brisbane Broncos hosting the Parramatta Eels. Catch all the pre-match action over at the blog: For those of you curious about why Clive Palmer has been in the headlines recently, my colleague Ben Smee has written this piece, hot off the press. Australian Associated Press has provided a brief markets report and it seems sentiment was buoyed by the Reserve Bank governor\u2019s comments that the federal government may need to extend the jobkeeper program beyond its current cut-off date in September. Shares in Australia\u2019s big banks surged on Thursday following similar gains made by US banks on Wall Street overnight. The S&amp;P/ASX200 benchmark index was up as much as 2.5% around midday, but finished the day 1.32% higher at 5,851.1 points. The All Ordinaries index rose by 72.9 points, or 1.24%, to 5,957.8. One Australian dollar was buying 66.28 US cents, down slightly from Wednesday. Australia is still slated to host cricket\u2019s T20 World Cup in November, but England\u2019s skipper, Eoin Morgan, is doubtful ... Morgan would be \u201csurprised\u201d if the T20 World Cup goes ahead as scheduled later this year but indicated any deferment will not shape his future as England captain. The International Cricket Council on Wednesday rejected claims a decision had been made to postpone the tournament from its original slot of 18 October to 15 November in Australia and that all contingency plans were being explored. However, the vagaries presented by the global coronavirus pandemic present significant obstacles, not least how the squads and support staff from 16 nations, including the hosts, can be accommodated without risking an outbreak. And Morgan believes potentially exposing a country that has had just over 7,000 confirmed cases with a death toll of 103 presents a significant risk, as things stand. Speaking to promote the British cricket charity Chance to Shine, Morgan said: \u201cI\u2019d be surprised if it goes ahead. \u201cMy reasons for that would be if you look at how Australia have handled the pandemic, they\u2019ve shut down the borders pretty early, had a limited number of cases and deaths in comparison to the rest of the world. \u201cTheir biggest worry moving forward \u2013 a small negative to a huge positive \u2013 would be they almost don\u2019t know what the immunity would be like if the virus does have an outbreak. \u201cHaving 16 teams across several venues has the potential to expose something. \u201cIt might only be a handful of cases to be spread, but when you look at how quickly it escalates, you weigh up the chance of playing a World Cup or postponing it, (which is) probably a bigger positive.\u201d Any alteration to the calendar lends itself to speculation about the impact on Morgan, who considered his position after leading England to a historic 50-over World Cup triumph last summer because of a back injury. Last winter he announced his intention to captain England at the 2020 and 2021 T20 World Cups and he reaffirmed the desire to do so on Wednesday after revealing the current hiatus has left him feeling revitalised. \u201cI feel at that stage now where I want to pick up a bat again and I\u2019m ready to go as opposed to picking up a bat because I\u2019m playing in three weeks\u2019 time. That\u2019s always a nice place to be.\u201d Fraudsters have again targeted the Covid-19 early access to super scheme. A tool used by Australians to consolidate their superannuation accounts has been shut down after fake accounts were set up. The fraud was detected through the federal government\u2019s early access to super scheme, which many people have been using to financially survive the coronavirus crisis. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority deputy chair, Helen Rowell, has told a Senate inquiry the Australian Taxation Office\u2019s SuperMatch tool has been suspended. The tool helps people find all of their super accounts so they can be merged into one. Fraudsters were using the tool to see what other accounts people had. \u201cWe made the decision (with the ATO) to close the system down in order to engage with industry to tighten up the requirements around member account creation,\u201d Rowell said on Thursday. There\u2019s no evidence money has been lost through the fraud. Postcard from the pandemic: Child abuse and the spread of child pornography are on the rise as more Australians access the dark web, exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic. From AAP: Police say there has been a disturbing increase in Australians downloading and sharing illegal images during the coronavirus lockdown period. The Australian federal police is working with the Department of Home Affairs, telecommunications companies and other agencies on how best to \u201cdeliver a stronger punch into the dark web\u201d, commissioner Reece Kershaw told a parliamentary committee on Thursday. \u201cThe amount of, whether it be from guns to drugs to child abuse material that you can access within minutes, it\u2019s not good at all for the health of our nation. It\u2019s quite disturbing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to disrupt that.\u201d The rise in sharing child pornography has alarmed police and Kershaw said there had been a definite increase during the virus period because more people were using the dark web and spending more time there. \u201cWe\u2019re not alone \u2013 the rest of the western world has a real issue,\u201d he told the committee. \u201cIt\u2019s not so great in some of our other (neighbouring) countries nearby, which is interesting in itself, but (offenders) have certainly taken advantage of those vulnerable communities offshore. \u201cI think it\u2019s a real threat to the fabric of our society, young people being damaged through all of this.\u201d Police are also readying for an expected increase in organised crime once coronavirus restrictions ease around the world. Kershaw said the AFP and overseas police forces had shared intelligence that while organised crime and international syndicates had gone quiet as movement was curtailed, they were planning multiple operations once freedom was restored. \u201cWe\u2019re taking advantage of this Covid-19 and we\u2019re coming after all these groups,\u201d he said. \u201cThey probably don\u2019t realise \u2013 and I\u2019m probably giving away some of my strategies here \u2013 but we\u2019re going to ... turn over every rock, dig underneath it and do whatever we can to prevent and disrupt these particular syndicates.\u201d I am going to hand you over to Ben Doherty now. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow morning, for what I believe will be Friday. Please \u2013 take care of you. The Queensland group chats are filled with warnings to take it easy on the rums, so that\u2019s how you know footy is back. Jim Chalmers and Katy Gallagher really don\u2019t want people to forget what the RBA governor just said about the potential need for the stimulus packages to be extended beyond September: Echoing calls from experts, the business community and Labor, the RBA Governor today said the Morrison Government should consider an extension or modification of the JobKeeper scheme to ensure that vulnerable workers and businesses continue to be supported where necessary. Noting that the Government\u2019s September deadline represented a \u201ccritical point\u201d in Australia\u2019s recovery, Governor Lowe highlighted the need for ongoing fiscal support: \u201cRight through the next year or so, the economy is going to need support from both monetary and fiscal policy.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that the fiscal support will be there for a long period of time.\u201d \u201cIn the next little while, there\u2019s not going to be very much scope at all to use monetary policy in that way so I think fiscal policy will have to be used.\u201d In contrast to Josh Frydenberg\u2019s reluctance to release updated economic forecasts, the Governor emphasised the importance of releasing economic forecasts at a time of uncertainty, arguing that it is in the public interest to support confidence and promote an informed public conversation about the downturn and recovery. The federal government has launched an inquiry into food prices and food security in remote Aboriginal communities, amid regular reports of people going without food and essentials, and having to pay exorbitant prices. The inquiry terms of reference include investigating situations where prices are considered unreasonable and whether there is price gouging in remote community stores. \u201cThere have been significant reports of very high food and grocery prices in remote communities and issues around the secure supply of fresh food,\u201d committee chair Julian Leeser said. \u201cThe inquiry will look at the situation in remote Indigenous communities, and the effect of supply chains and local businesses on the cost of food. The inquiry will also look at the role of regulators in dealing with the situation.\u201d \u201cI strongly encourage Indigenous people and people in the food and grocery industry to make a submission to the inquiry.\u201d The committee will consult with communities, community stores and supply chain businesses, Government agencies and other stakeholders to determine Indigenous communities have access to reasonably priced healthy food. The committee will present its final report by the end of October. The ACT remains (known) active Covid free: There have been no new cases of COVID-19 recorded in the ACT in the past 24 hours. The ACT\u2019s total is still 107. The number of negative tests in the ACT is now 16,962 with 494 test results received in the past 24 hours. While it sounds stupid, the border challenges could have some pretty far-reaching implications if the high court decides states can\u2019t actually close down their entry points, particularly when it comes to protecting Indigenous communities from these sorts of viruses. By the time the high court decides any challenge, the states will most likely be ready to reopen. But that doesn\u2019t mean the ruling won\u2019t potentially have future ramifications for public health responses. Maybe Pauline Hanson doesn\u2019t even need to bother with her crowdfunding now \u2013 Clive Palmer has decided he\u2019ll take Queensland to the high court at the same time as WA over the border closures (from AAP). Billionaire Clive Palmer is taking on his home state as well as Western Australia over their border closures. Palmer announced the addition of Queensland to his high court challenge ahead of a directions hearing on Thursday afternoon, saying the border closures were unconstitutional and discriminatory. He hopes documents and submissions will be filed by 26 June so the matter can be heard soon. Palmer says he is confident the high court will agree WA\u2019s border closure is an \u201cact of stupidity\u201d while the state government says it is also confident of defending the challenge. Palmer says Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk is \u201clocking away the fruits of Queensland such as the Great Barrier Reef and other treasures from interstate visitors\u201d. Both states are adamant they will keep their borders closed for many months. Australian researchers have halted recruitment of patients in more than 70 hospitals in every Australian state and territory, and 11 hospitals in New Zealand for its randomised control trial to explore whether hydroxychloroquine in combination or on its own can treat Covid-19 patients. The study, known as the Ascot trial, will help researchers see whether patients who receive specific drugs including hydroxychloroquine fare better, worse or the same compared to patients who received a different drug or standard of care. But a study published in The Lancet on Friday found Covid-19 patients who received hydroxychloroquine were dying at higher rates and experiencing more heart-related complications than other virus patients. It prompted the World Health Organisation to temporarily halt its studies of the drug while it reviewed the data. On Thursday a spokeswoman for the Ascot study said following meetings of the ethics and governance committee, patient recruitment had been put on hold. \u201cFollowing an observational study published in The Lancet, Ascot has paused patient recruitment pending deliberations by the governance and ethics committees overseeing the trial,\u201d she said. \u201cWe expect these deliberations to occur rapidly and will provide further information as they arise.\u201d Basically, it should be common sense \u2013 and I doubt raises more than an eyebrow for anyone who has been following along, most especially economists, but people need to plan. So not having a plan of what is happening beyond September, tends to be a problem. Katy Gallagher: But we are saying to the government, at the moment, they\u2019re not providing any information. Whether they\u2019re prepared to taper, whether they\u2019re prepared to target. We\u2019re not having a budget until October. We\u2019re saying you need to be clear about that. You need to be up front, you need to be considering. We know the governor spoke today about the construction sector and professional services sector and about the challenges they\u2019re going to be facing. These are the challenges the government need to be talking about, even if they are just providing confidence at this point in time, before putting a dollar figure on it. Katy Gallagher is holding a press conference now that the Covid committee has finished hearing its evidence. She says Phil Lowe\u2019s evidence \u2013 that if the economy is still looking bad (which it most likely will be) the Covid stimulus package should be continued beyond September, is something Scott Morrison should listen to: I think his evidence, along with a lot of other commentators, finally proves that Scott Morrison\u2019s snapback economic recovery is simply not going to happen. The governor spoke of September and October being a critical point in our recovery from Covid-19. And he expressed a view that fiscal policy was going to be required for some time over a number of years as we work through the economic impacts of the Covid-19 restrictions. I think for a moment if you just think what is about - what is due to occur in September, about 3.5 million workers coming off jobkeeper, 1.6 million people keeping off the jobseeker extra corona supplement, you\u2019re not going to have the $20bn in early access super going through, and we\u2019ve also got as we heard today over $250bn at this point in time, in loan deferrals. So that is the fiscal cliff that we are facing. It\u2019s been confirmed today that there is a critical point in terms of Australia\u2019s response. And we would say to Scott Morrison, as we have been and others have been saying for some time, there is a need to target and taper the fiscal support going forward, to look after the economy, to look after jobs, to look after households. From AAP: South Australia has called a halt to granting international travel exemptions on compassionate grounds after SA Health bungled the case of a British woman who arrived on the weekend and tested positive to Covid-19. Premier Steven Marshall says he wants to get to the bottom of the problem, which resulted in the woman presenting herself to authorities on arrival in Adelaide rather than being met by health officials, before allowing any further international travellers into SA in such circumstances. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be granting any further exemptions for overseas travel to South Australia until we\u2019ve ironed out this administrative error,\u201d Mr Marshall said on Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make sure we have airtight systems going forward before we grant further exemptions for people coming from overseas.\u201d But Marshall said he did not intend to \u201chang SA Health out to dry\u201d and praised the department\u2019s overall handling of the pandemic as well as the previous arrival of international travellers. The premier also confirmed police commissioner Grant Stevens would meet the SA Health chief executive to develop new arrangements for future transfers. Before Sunday\u2019s case, 21 other people had come to SA from overseas on compassionate grounds, about half to attend a funeral and the others to visit a dying relative. The British woman, in her 50s, was granted her exemption to visit a dying relative. She had spent about a week in quarantine in Victoria after arriving in Australia from the UK and had tested negative while in isolation. She wore a mask while travelling to SA and made herself known to airport authorities and was then escorted out by police. When tested again, she returned the positive result, becoming the state\u2019s 440th case of Covid-19 and the first for almost three weeks. The woman was returned to quarantine while almost 20 close contacts were also ordered into self-isolation. After initially saying Victorian officials did not tell them when the woman would arrive, chief public health Officer Nicola Spurrier issued a statement on Thursday conceding the flight information was passed on. \u201cDue to an administrative oversight, we can confirm the relevant flight details involving an overseas traveller arriving in South Australia were provided to SA Health prior to their arrival,\u201d Spurrier said. \u201cWhat this issue has highlighted is the need to strengthen the processes involving travellers arriving from overseas and travelling between states during their quarantine period.\u201d After SA\u2019s initial comments, Victorian chief health officer Brett Sutton said South Australia was told of the woman\u2019s travel details and he had the email to prove it. \u201cI\u2019m not sure why there is a misunderstanding about having been informed, but that email was sent and South Australian authorities were alerted about the time and flight details,\u201d Sutton said. The NT is changing its quarantine arrangements: From Monday, 15 June, the Northern Territory will transition from mandatory, monitored quarantine to mandatory, self-quarantine. Arrivals from interstate will be able to choose their own quarantine arrangements \u2013 as long as it is appropriate, within the guidelines directed by the Chief Health Officer. Arrivals will not have to stay at accommodation selected and secured by the NT Government, and the $2500 quarantine fee will no longer apply. Arrivals will be able to undertake the 14-day quarantine period in their own home, in private accommodation, or in appropriate commercial accommodation, at their own cost. This change will not apply to people arriving from overseas, including overseas arrivals transiting from interstate. Monitored quarantine will continue to apply for this cohort, given the much higher risk associated with international arrivals. This decision applies to all domestic interstate arrivals, but it has been made for Territorians \u2013 to help Territorians return home. This new arrangement will also include mandatory coronavirus testing regime for all arrivals going into quarantine. Arrivals will be tested for COVID-19 in the first 72 hours of their quarantine, and tested again in the final 72 hours of their quarantine. Ending their quarantine after 14 days will depend on returning two negative tests. Police and Environmental Health Officers will be spot checking people at random points throughout their quarantine. The existing penalties for breaches of quarantine will continue to apply. Greg Hunt was also asked about Phil Lowe\u2019s comments that Jobkeeper shouldn\u2019t just be switched off, if the economy remains in need of stimulus: In terms of JobKeeper, the Prime Minister, the Treasurer have been absolutely clear there\u2019s a review in June. And beyond that, I\u2019m not going to try to foretell or foresee the future, but the Prime Minister has said that all of these measures are temporary measures to get Australia through. That principle remains the case. The review is something where he will be looking at the needs. Greg Hunt on the death of Nathan Turner in Blackwater, in Queensland, a region which has not had any other previous Covid cases: I do have to say this - I think Queensland has responded rapidly and appropriately. One of the things we all have to be prepared for is there will be cases in unexpected places. This one is a case which is especially tragic, because it\u2019s not just a death, it\u2019s the death of a young man with a whole life ahead of him. But what they have done is respond in the way that Tasmania did in Burnie, and with the north-west region, where they\u2019ve reacted quickly, they\u2019re testing broadly, and they\u2019re seeking the outcomes and they\u2019re doing all of the contact tracing. Just a point - it is an abiding feature. It\u2019s the Council of Australian Governments \u2013 Coag \u2013 without the partisan bullshit. It was literally state and territory leaders working with a federal government for the national good, instead of allowing ridiculous political bullshit to get in the way. For that to continue, well, that is probably up to the participants. A lot of the angst has previously come from the federal government \u2013 as the bank - not wanting to extend national partnerships beyond certain points. National partnerships are also ridiculous and make long term funding plans in health and education almost impossible. So for what we have seen in the national cabinet to continue, then leaders just need to leave the bullshit at the door at Coag. And that seems to be the tricky thing. Does Greg Hunt, health minister, want national cabinet (of which he is not a part) to continue beyond the pandemic? Firstly, I think that the national cabinet has been an extraordinarily important part of the way that Australia has operated successfully as a country in helping to manage and contain coronavirus. We do know that the history of not just the Spanish flu but also the depression was that, in times of extreme stress, the federation splintered. And the prime minister came into this very aware of that history. We had talked about it and discussed it. And he set out to have not just a single, unified medical voice, but to have the unity with the states. And I believe that that national cabinet process has been extremely valuable. I hope that there is support for it from the states and the premiers and the chief ministers going forward. My personal view, looking at what\u2019s happened with health, it\u2019s allowed us to strike the private hospitals agreement, it\u2019s allowed us to strike the public hospitals agreement. It\u2019s allowed us to work with the public health units on the contact tracing. So, it\u2019s actually facilitated Australia\u2019s response, and it\u2019s been an immensely important, and I hope, abiding feature. Greg Hunt wants people to go back to the doctor \u2013 and to get their tests done. Do it. I just did a whole range of tests I had been putting off, and let\u2019s just say it was lucky I put on my big girl pants and went and did it. Don\u2019t put that shiz off. It literally can be life and death: Hunt: As we\u2019ve flattened the curve, and now we\u2019ve reached 40 days at less than 0.5% growth, with 10 cases in the period to 6:30am this morning in the previous 24 hours, at the same time we\u2019ve built the capacity. And our telehealth numbers have now reached 12 million. That\u2019s an extraordinary achievement by our medical community. They\u2019ve helped provide our general health support, but they can\u2019t replace some things, such as pathology tests. In April, pathology tests dropped by 40%. They\u2019re now back up to being 3% below the normal rate for this time of year. But that emphasises that we also should feel confident in seeing our doctors and our pathology services getting our screening, getting our blood tests, getting our X-rays and our diagnostic tests. Those tests can also help save your life. And they\u2019re equally important. So, we\u2019d encourage Australians to continue to go back to see the doctor, to see the pathologist, to see the X-ray or MRI providers face-to-face. They are fundamental and can\u2019t be replaced by telehealth. Yesterday was national sunscreen day (wear it and don\u2019t forget your hands and feet) and today is also world burger day, which obviously should be a public holiday. While Greg Hunt is making this (very important and necessary) funding announcement for endometriosis treatment and diagnosis, it is worth pointing out that today is World Menstrual Hygiene Day. Plan International Australia has put together a report on how women have handled their periods during the pandemic. And for many, it has been a very stressful time: \u00b7 Just over half (51%) reported that period products had become harder to find during the pandemic. \u00b7 One in 4 (26%) said they had trouble finding facilities for changing and disposing of period products safely, privately and hygienically. \u00b7 One in five (20%) reported the cost of period products had risen since COVID-19 started. \u00b7 One in 10 (15%) said they had trouble knowing where they could comfortably dispose of period products. \u00b7 One in 10 (11%) said they\u2019d encountered issues with finding information or people to discuss their periods with during the pandemic. \u00b7 One in 10 (10%) said they felt more embarrassed about their periods during the pandemic. \u00b7 Unlike in many other developing countries, access to clean and reliable water to manage menstrual hygiene was not reported as a major issue for Australian survey-takers, with only 5% of survey respondents reporting problems, mostly those who rely on tank water. Maybe these things should be a phone call, rather than an email? I say that as someone who hates talking on the phone. But seriously. Greg Hunt is announcing $9.5m from the Medical Research Future Fund for endometriosis. This is a condition which affects approximately a million Australian girls and women. It can be agonising, debilitating, it can have health and mental health effects. It can be profound in the way that a young woman\u2019s life can be changed and altered. It can impact their fertility. It can impact their general day-to-day existence, with chronic and agonising pain and debilitating conditions. So, all of these things are immensely important. AAP has an update on that South Australian Covid traveller case: South Australian health authorities have retracted their claim Victoria did not tell them about a British woman who arrived in Adelaide from Melbourne and later tested positive for coronavirus. After initially saying Victorian officials did not tell them when the woman would arrive, chief public health officer Nicola Spurrier issued a statement conceding the flight information was passed on. \u201cDue to an administrative oversight, we can confirm the relevant flight details involving an overseas traveller arriving in South Australia were provided to SA Health prior to their arrival,\u201d Spurrier said on Thursday. \u201cWhat this issue has highlighted is the need to strengthen the processes involving travellers arriving from overseas and travelling between states during their quarantine period.\u201d Spurrier said she would work with her federal and state counterparts to ensure all cases involving interstate transfers were reviewed and managed to a consistently high standard. The woman, in her 50s, had been given an exemption to come to SA last weekend on compassionate grounds to visit a dying relative. She had spent about a week in quarantine in Victoria after arriving in Australia from the UK and had tested negative while in isolation. She wore a mask while travelling to SA and made herself known to airport authorities and was then escorted out by police. When tested again, she returned the positive result, becoming SA\u2019s 440th case of Covid-19 and the first for almost three weeks. The woman was returned to quarantine while almost 20 close contacts were also ordered into self-isolation. After SA\u2019s initial denials, Victorian officials said the woman\u2019s details were passed on and they had the email to prove it. \u201cSouth Australian authorities were alerted about the time and the flight details,\u201d they said. An update on the media closures: The number contractions in Australia\u2019s public interest news landscape has grown to over 200 since January 2019, according to newly updated data from the Public Interest Journalism Initiative\u2019s Australian Newsroom Mapping Project. Fifty-two new entries were made today, including 19 masthead closures, four mergers into other newspapers and 29 print editions ended. Sixty suspended print editions announced in April were today changed to permanent digital-only editions. This takes total contractions to 213. Of the 52 new entries, 41 were based in Queensland, making it the hardest hit state among the new data. An update on that AAP story from earlier this morning. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission are appearing before the coronavirus Senate committee at the same time. NSW senator Perin Davey (Nationals, nice house), tried to get Apra chairman Wayne Byres to reject a statement from the shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, that the early access to super scheme was \u201crobbing them [workers] of a decent retirement\u201d. It backfired, with Byres pointing out that, yes, taking money out now would have an effect on what you had later on. Like many things we\u2019re grappling with in this environment, there are always trade-offs, nothing is free. People are having to trade off some of their short-term financial needs for their long-term financial needs. Murray Watt (Labor, Queensland, messy bookcase), has also grilled Apra over fraud in the early release scheme, which has caused the shut-down of an ATO service used to find lost super. Apra member Helen Rowell, who is responsible for super oversight, said funds warned the regulator about the possibility of fraud before the early release scheme started. She said that at the moment super funds were able to meet the withdrawals, but if the economy materially deteriorates \u201cthat could cause concerns for some funds\u201d. Watt also asked if there was a risk to ending the small business loan deferral scheme, under which Byres said repayments on some $60bn had been kicked down the road. He joined the RBA\u2019s Philip Lowe in indicating government money was going to be needed once the emergency measures end. No one has an interest in going off the cliff so we have to work out what the next phase will be,\u201d he said. Watt asked if there was \u201ca pretty serious risk to the economy and our banks through the ending of the loan deferral scheme\u201d. Byres\u2019 response: I think the risks are there whether the loan deferral schemes end or not. The risks are clearly there because we\u2019re clearly in a very difficult economic environment and banks are just the arteries by which the economy operates. It\u2019s all happening in the Senate Covid committee. Apra has informed the committee they needed to put a freeze on the SuperMatch scheme because of new fraud concerns over the early access to superannuation withdrawals. It seems very complicated, but what my layperson brain picked up is fake accounts are being set up and then merged with existing, authentic accounts - which are then being targeted for the early withdrawals. That\u2019s separate to the news from a couple of weeks ago that accounts were being targeted by fraudsters withdrawing from accounts. Greg Hunt will hold the national Covid-19 update with the chief nursing and midwifery officer, Alison McMillan, at 1pm. Here is the official word from Victoria Health on those two cases at the Rydges\u2019 hotel, which is being used to quarantine returned travellers: A second case of Covid-19 has been detected in a staff member at the Rydges on Swanston, Melbourne. The source of acquisition for both cases remains under investigation and all potential sources of transmission will be explored. All close contacts of both staff members have been contacted and placed into quarantine. None of the close contacts identified are hotel guests at this stage Thorough cleaning of relevant parts of the hotel has been undertaken, alongside other appropriate public health actions including contact tracing, isolation and quarantine. The hotel is not currently open to the public. There are some returned overseas travellers observing their quarantine at the hotel. Potential links between the staff members and positive cases among travellers at the site are being investigated. As a precaution, all staff who have worked in the hotel since early May have been offered testing. Of yesterday\u2019s other cases, three were detected in returned travelers in hotel quarantine, and six cases were detected in household contacts, including five members of one household. All household members are in isolation and contact tracing is under way. There were no new cases linked to outbreaks in aged care centres. Looks like there are two staff members at Rydges \u2013 security guards \u2013 who have tested positive. Prof Brett Sutton: Obviously, we are looking into the circumstances on how these two cases might have acquired their infection. The possible links between the two of them. There wasn\u2019t very much overlap in their working schedules, but there is the possibility that they have overlapped at some point, but we are going to review all processes there, how they use the perform protective equipment, what their procedures are for wearing gloves, for cleaning, the shared spaces that staff have there and obviously there is very broad testing of staff there now to identify whether anyone else might have become positive. We obviously will look into the genetics of those cases as well to see if it is linked to a particular individual on a particular floor who has been in quarantine there or who has been in isolation with illness \u2026 They are security staff who have come down with illness. Normally with would have a security member at the front entrance, as well as a security guard on each floor to monitor all of those who are in quarantine there. Victoria\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Brett Sutton, is giving an update on the Victorian situation, including a worker at Rydges\u2019 hotel, which has been housing quarantining travellers, testing positive for Covid-19: There are six new cases who are household contacts\u2019 previously confirmed cases, including five from the one household who were close contacts of a confirmed case. The number of deaths fortunately remains at 19 and the numbers of cases in Victoria that we call \u201ccommunity cases\u201d or those with an unknown source has decreased by 18 since yesterday. So this means we have found a link with those 18 cases and I\u2019ll be able to update in coming days on exactly what they might have been linked to, but it brings the number unknown course cases in Victoria down to 165. Rydges has 13 people who are still suffering from Covid-19 and three people who are close contacts who are being isolated. Anthony Albanese also said that the coming IR roundtables need to ensure the 12% super guarantee is protected: Superannuation is good for individuals and for the quality of life they enjoy once they retire. But it\u2019s also good for the national economy. We have a $3tn bank of national savings that has served us well. It\u2019s a ballast for the national economy that served us well, including during this crisis. This government has used this crisis to once again undermine superannuation. All those people who because they\u2019ve missed out on jobkeeper and jobseeker have had to withdraw their savings. For some young people, they\u2019ve withdrawn all of their superannuation savings. And that will not serve them and will not serve the country well either. Because it will mean that they have less money when they retire. And we are supporters of compulsory superannuation. It\u2019s important that occur. We have a legislated 12% increase but no doubt the government has always taken every opportunity. They never supported at the beginning when it was introduced by Bob Hawke and Paul Keating. And they have undermined it ever since. Again, Queensland, which has a Labor government, has also done this. But election campaigning can bring out all sorts of grey zones \u2013 here is what Anthony Albanese had to say about the NSW public servant pay freeze today: Well, this is an outrageous slap in the face for those working people who\u2019ve kept the economy and our society going during these difficult times. Our nurses, our police, our emergency service workers. They have put literally their own health on the line in order to support their community. And for a government to effectively have, bear in mind, a pay freeze is a real wage cut, is what the Berejiklian government is asking them to just accept, and it is unacceptable. And I say to Scott Morrison, don\u2019t just give a speech at the National Press Club saying that you recognise that working people actually have a role in our society. Step in here, pick up the phone to the New South Wales premier, and talk to her about why this is unacceptable. Further to Ben\u2019s post on Phil Lowe\u2019s advice not to withdraw the jobkeeper wage subsidy too early, here is what he had to say in full: The key observation is that the world is very uncertain and I think it\u2019s too early to say what it\u2019s going to be, what the economy is going to be like in four months\u2019 time. But if we have not come out of the current trough in economic activity, there will be, and there should be, a debate about how the jobkeeper program transitions into something else, whether it\u2019s extended for specific industries, or somehow tapered. I think it\u2019s very important we don\u2019t withdraw the fiscal stimulus too early Tasmania has no new cases of Covid-19 and just eight active cases across the state. New South Wales is not the only jurisdiction to freeze public servant pay, including for health workers. Queensland did the same thing. The Australian Paramedics Association in NSW is not happy with the decision: Freezing our wages shows complete disregard for us and our colleagues when we have risked our health and safety to keep New South Wales on its feet throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The NSW Government says this is about saving jobs, but freezing wages of frontline public sector workers only makes us pay for this pandemic, when we have worked so hard to protect our communities. The governor of the Reserve Bank, Philip Lowe, is appearing before the Senate\u2019s coronavirus inquiry this morning, calling for more support for workers once jobkeeper expires in September. He\u2019ll be followed by leadership of the other two of Australia\u2019s regulatory triforce, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. After some cheery back and forth about the Aboriginal art in his office, Lowe said the economy may not be as bad as initially thought \u2013 although the numbers are still \u201cshocking\u201d. He said the RBA had revised its estimate of working hours lost in May down from 20% to 15%. But he warned that, although jobs were coming back in industries that were shut down due to the pandemic, such as hospitality and retail, the pipeline of work in industries that had kept going \u2013 construction and professional services \u2013 was starting to dry up. Pressed by the WA Greens senator Rachel Siewert on whether jobkeeper would need to be extended, Lowe said: \u201cIf the labour market is not improving we will need to keep the fiscal support, some way or other.\u201d He said the government has to keep pumping money into the economy and has more capacity to borrow money cheaply. \u201cI think it would be a mistake to withdraw the fiscal stimulus too early,\u201d he said. He was also asked by James Paterson (Liberal, Victoria, holiday beard), about whether regulation was bad, and agreed. \u201cI fear that over time we\u2019ve erred too far in the direction of regulation,\u201d he said. It\u2019s less than two years since we had a royal commission that exposed vast wrongdoing in the banking sector, prompting a wave of new regulations that have yet to be fully enacted, but apparently that\u2019s all forgotten now. NSW has recorded one new diagnosis of Covid-19 in the last 24 hours, Gladys Berejiklian says: There was only one case identified, which was be someone in quarantine \u2013 ironically a Queenslander \u2013 and as soon as it\u2019s safe for them to go home, they will. Again, an encouraging result, but we can\u2019t let down our guard. We always have to be vigilant because of the daily risk that the deadly virus poses to all of us. (Side note, Gladys o\u2019clock is all over the place now. Is it 8am? 11am? Monday? Who knows.) Phil Lowe is asked by the Labor senator Katy Gallagher if he has any views on what the end of the stimulus measures in September will mean for the economy. He says the measures may need to be extended but at this point it is too early to say: Well, it\u2019s clearly going to be a critical point when that scheme comes to an end and also when the deferral for six months of mortgage payments and other payments that the banks are offering ... so that\u2019s a critical point for the economy. I note the jobkeeper program, it\u2019s six months, but a three-month review was built into that program and I think that was very sensible of the government to do that. It will be important to review the parameters of that scheme. It may be in six months\u2019 time we bounce back well and the economy is doing \u2013 doing reasonably well, and these schemes, which were temporary in nature, can be withdrawn without problems. But if the economy is not recovered reasonably well by then, as part of that review we should be looking at, perhaps, the extension of that scheme or the modification in some way. But I think at this point I think it\u2019s too hard to say because the outlook remains very uncertain but it\u2019s going to be a very critical point in the economy. Philip Lowe says the RBA is hoping it can revise its hours worked downturn forecast to something more positive \u2013 15% instead of a 20% downturn: We will see further declines in jobs. They will not be as stark as the declines we saw in April. I think the worst of it was the period up until mid- to late-April. Since then, there has been some stabilisation. In certain parts of the economy there has been a recovery in jobs. When we put out our statement on monetary policy in early May, we were expecting a decline in total hours worked in the economy of 20%. So a staggering number. As they\u2019ve come in, they\u2019re progressively revising that number. I don\u2019t have a firm estimate for you, but I\u2019m hoping now that it will be not that declining but more 15%. It will be staggering but as the data has come in we\u2019ve progressively likely downward. This is a very good move, and one which will help a lot of people: Today, Austrac announced a change to the AML/CTF customer ID and verification rule to help people experiencing family and domestic violence. Under the rule, if a customer cannot produce their driver\u2019s licence or birth certificate, or show a different address, banks and other regulated businesses can use alternative ways to verify their customer\u2019s identity. Financial abuse is a form of family and domestic violence and will be experienced by over 2 million Australians over their lifetime, with 63% of women experiencing financial stress having a background of financial abuse. The abuser uses violence and intimidation to restrict access to a person\u2019s bank accounts, prevent them from working or accessing benefits, or withholds living expenses from them or their children. Austrac\u2019s CEO, Nicole Rose PSM, said having a bank account independent of an abuser was essential for those who are leaving or have left an abusive relationship. This rule supports our regulated businesses to uphold their AML/CTF obligations while adopting a flexible approach to customer identity processes. Austrac collaborated on the rule change with the Australian Banking Association and the Australian Israel Chamber of Commerce NSW who initiated the project and identified the opening of bank accounts as a significant barrier. Austrac consulted with the financial sector and community organisations including family violence services, community legal services and financial counselling services, many of who offer frontline services to people experiencing family violence and financial abuse. A reminder that the ABC is about to undergo more cuts as well, because of cuts to its recurrent funding. Regional and rural communities are losing their voices all over Australia. The Senate committee looking at the Covid response has Phil Lowe, the RBA governor, in front of it today, along with heads of Apra and Asic. Together the troika make up what the business calls \u201cthe Regulators\u201d (capital R) but in the least Warren G way possible. Lots more people are getting the flu vaccine this year, which is great, but GPs fear they are missing out on their allocation for their patients. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners wants the government to prioritise GP clinics when distributing the stockpile: In a survey in April 2020 of more than 1,100 GPs from every state and territory in Australia, 55% reported that they were unable to access enough stock to provide flu vaccinations to their patients. The RACGP president, Dr Harry Nespolon, said the delay many patients faced to get their flu vaccine this year was unacceptable and needed to be urgently addressed: The problem was never that there was shortage of the flu vaccine. The government secured enough of the special flu vaccine for over-65s, who are more vulnerable, for everyone in the country, and we commended them for this. The problem is with the distribution of the flu vaccine and it has been a problem for a long time. Every year we see the same issue \u2013 the vaccine comes too slowly to GP clinics and we don\u2019t get enough of it for our patients. This year we saw increased demand due to the Covid-19 pandemic. We were glad to see people heeding our advice \u2013 the RACGP and other medical bodies advised people to get their vaccine earlier than usual to prevent the double whammy of the flu and Covid-19 and reduce pressure on the health system. We could not have anticipated this pandemic but we learned a big lesson from it when we saw the impact it had on patients getting their flu shot \u2013 the cracks in the distribution system gaped open and many people had to wait far too long. Meanwhile \u2026 Queensland Health authorities still don\u2019t know how Nathan Turner, the youngest person to die in Australia having tested positive for Covid-19, contracted the virus. A second postmortem test for coronavirus tested negative, but authorities have discounted that test, as it was contaminated \u201cwith quite a lot of blood\u201d. The coroner is investigating the death. His partner remains in isolation, with symptoms of the virus. No one has tested positive for Covid in Queensland in the last 24 hours. Queensland\u2019s chief medical officer, Dr Jeannette Young, says more Queenslanders need to come forward for testing, for restrictions to be lifted: For us to go forward and to lift those very onerous restrictions that have been in place now, we must do more testing. We have the capacity in Queensland to test 10,000 Queenslanders every single day. We have not even reached half of that number, so I implore Queenslanders, if you have any symptoms at all, or a fever of 37.5 degrees Celsius or above, or a history of fever, then please come forward and get tested. There\u2019s a number of reasons for that. First, it is vitally important for you. Although we don\u2019t have an effective pharmaceutical treatment, or a drug treatment for this virus, we do have really, really good supportive care we can offer here in Queensland. We know of the 15 people who\u2019ve been admitted to ICU in Queensland, 14 have survived, because we have great treatment available. So please, come forward and get tested for your own sake. Come forward and get tested for your family\u2019s sake, because we know the most likely transmission is within a household. So if we can test you, we can stop you spreading it to other people if you have them in your household. And come forward for your community\u2019s sake. Because then, if you have got a case, we can contact-trace around you and make sure we don\u2019t end up with an outbreak. This is really, really important, as we lift restrictions going forward. There were 1,200 jobs in News Corp\u2019s regional and community titles. In the press release announcing the changes to the publishing business, there will be 375 journalists left to cover regional and community news. The loss to those communities is immeasurable. That is a lot of stories which are going to go untold. News Corp Australia is announcing today that: Our major regional titles \u2013 the Hobart Mercury, NT News, Cairns Post, Townsville Bulletin, Gold Coast Bulletin, Toowoomba Chronicle and Geelong Advertiser \u2013 will continue to publish both in print and digitally. The following regional titles will become digital only: Queensland \u2013 Mackay Daily Mercury, Rockhampton Morning Bulletin, Gladstone Observer, Bundaberg News Mail, Fraser Coast Chronicle, Gympie Times, Sunshine Coast Daily, Queensland Times, Warwick Daily News, Central and North Burnett Times, Central Queensland News, Chinchilla News, Dalby Herald. Gatton Star, Noosa News, South Burnett Times, Stanthorpe Border Post, Western Star, Western Times, Whitsunday Times, Whitsunday Coast Guardian and Bowen Independent, news from the towns covered by the Atherton Tablelander, Northern Miner, Post Douglas &amp; Mossman Gazette and Burdekin Advocate will continue to appear, as it does currently, under the regional sections of the Cairns Post and Townsville Bulletin; NSW \u2013 Tweed Daily News, Ballina Advocate, Byron Shire News, Coffs Coast Advocate, Grafton Daily Examiner and Lismore Northern Star; Northern Territory \u2013 The Centralian Advocate. The bulk of titles in our community groups \u2013 NewsLocal in NSW/ACT, Leader in Melbourne, Quest in Brisbane and Messenger in Adelaide \u2013 will become digital only. Community print editions were suspended early in April because of the impact of COVID-19 restrictions. It has been one of the most heartbreaking parts of the pandemic \u2013 the border closures stopping people from being able to say their final goodbyes. AAP has a story on how South Australia reacted, which included giving an exemption to a woman to visit a relative who was in palliative care, despite having tested positive for Covid-19: A British woman allowed into South Australia to visit a dying relative is among 22 people given exemptions to travel over the past two months, with health officials defending the process despite her testing positive for coronavirus. Premier Steven Marshall said authorities have \u201cgot to have a heart\u201d as he also backed the decision to allow the woman, in her 50s, to travel from Victoria to Adelaide. The woman had spent about a week in quarantine after arriving in Australia and had tested negative while in isolation. She wore a mask while travelling to SA but returned a positive swab soon after flying into Adelaide on the weekend and has now been returned to quarantine. She has not yet been able to visit her relative. Chief public health officer Nicola Spurrier said the woman was among 22 people from overseas given exemptions to come to SA on compassionate grounds. About half of those were to attend funerals and the rest to visit a close dying relative. Pauline Hanson issued a 4pm deadline to Annastacia Palaszczuk to open Queensland\u2019s borders or face a high court challenge. Putting aside that is not how a) the federation works or b) how democracy works or even c) how sane people work, the fundraiser set up to crowdfund the move, which was originally going to be pro bono, is still crawling along: $14,731 has so far been raised of the $1,000,000 goal. They are not numbers. They are people. Here are just some of those lives lost. From our US colleagues comes this tragic news: More than 100,000 Americans with coronavirus have died, four months after the US reported its first confirmed case. The country now has more than 1.6m reported cases and has recorded more deaths from the disease than any other nation. According to Johns Hopkins University data, 100,047 fatalities have been recorded. The actual death toll is likely to be higher the official count, experts say. Up to half the deaths in some states have occurred among nursing home residents and workers, studies suggest. Almost three times as many black Americans are dying of the virus as white people. Although the number of cases and deaths appears to be trending down in many states, experts are bracing for a possible uptick as states begin reopening businesses. The key findings from the report: Being unemployed remains the greatest poverty risk factor, with two-thirds (66%) of people in households in which the main earner is unemployed living below the poverty line. This is directly related to the level of pre-pandemic income support payments. The single rate of Newstart in January 2018 (including rent assistance and energy supplement) was $117pw below the poverty line ($185pw if they did not receive rent assistance). Youth allowance (plus these supplements) was $164pw below the poverty line ($232pw without rent assistance). Households that have to rely mainly on social security payments (eg unemployment, parenting, and disability payments) are five times more likely to experience poverty (36%) than those receiving most income from wages and salaries (7%). However, 38% of those in poverty are in wage-earning households; the majority of whom are households with children. In households where the main earner is a female, the poverty rate is 19% \u2013 almost double the rate when the main earner is male \u2013 10%. In single parent families in which the main earner is a woman the rate of poverty (37%) is twice that in which the main earner is a man (18%). The biggest differences in poverty rates between households with male and female main earners are in families with children. The average poverty rate among people in families with children where the main income-earner is female is 23%, compared with 10% where the main income-earner is male (which is the more common arrangement). In contrast, among households without children, the average poverty rate where the main income-earner is female is 12%, compared with 10% where the main income-earner is male. Nearly half the children in sole parent families live in poverty (44%) compared with 13% for children living with both parents. While those of working age are at greater risk of poverty than older people, over 65s who are living in private rental face a relatively high risk of poverty (41%). Renters are almost twice as likely to live in poverty as home-owners (19% compared with 9%) with public housing tenants at greatest risk (58%). You can read the whole report here. The Australian Council of Social Services has released a report \u2013 Poverty in Australia 2020: Part 2 \u2013 Who is affected? \u2013 which looks at the impact of poverty before the Covid-19 crisis. Its findings, unfortunately shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise to anyone. As the acting Acoss CEO, Jacqueline Phillips, says: This report exposes the disproportionate impact of poverty on households in which women are the main income earners. These households are twice as likely to live in poverty as those in which men are the main income earners (19% and 10%, respectively), with the gap even higher in households with children (at 23% and 10% respectively). Disturbingly, more than a third of single mothers and their children are living in poverty (37%). The challenges faced by single mothers that lead to so many being on low incomes have serious implications for the wellbeing of those women and their children. Early indications suggest that women have been suffering some of the worst economic impacts of the current pandemic, and effective policy action is needed to ensure this does not translate into an ongoing reduction in female employment or an increase in poverty amongst women and children. A snapback on childcare or income support risks trapping single mothers and their children in poverty. Rugby League is back. Nathan Turner had not worked since November because of some very serious health problems. He had not left his Queensland town of Blackwater, near Emerald, since February. Blackwater had no recorded cases of Covid-19. But when the 30-year-old, who had been showing respiratory symptoms since early May, died on the 26th, a postmortem test proved positive for the virus. Now his grieving partner is in isolation, and the emergency service workers who responded when he was found unresponsive in his home are self-isolating, while Queensland Health authorities race to find out how he may have come into contact with the virus, and try and ensure Queensland\u2019s regional and remote towns remain as safe for residents as possible. As Australia opens back up, you\u2019ll be hearing more about localised clusters. In states like Western Australia and Queensland, where communities are spread far and wide from city centres, opening the state borders to potential community transmission risks still seems like a risk. We\u2019ll hear more about that today, as well as how the states are pushing forward with relaxing the restrictions. In NSW, that means joining Victoria in opening up a ski season from 22 June. There won\u2019t be season passes, or \u201csnow play\u201d, meaning snowball fights are out and of course there will be limits to the number of people on the slopes and ski lifts as social distancing becomes part of the experience. But for many of the surrounding towns, which were hit hard during the summer bushfires, it will be the first time in which they can welcome back tourists. We\u2019ll cover that and everything else as it happens today, which is a Thursday. I know, because I checked. Twice. You have Amy Remeikis with you for most of the day. Ready?",

The worry right now is that with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/coronavirus-vaccine-when-will-we-have-one\">a vaccine still months away</a>, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterbeaumont\"><b>Peter Beaumont</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>DMGT said that for the half-year to the end of March the company\u2019s pre-tax profits fell by 44%, from \u00a3100m to \u00a356m, as group revenues dropped by 5%, to \u00a3690m.</p> \n<p>Despite the tough trading conditions, the company, which has also cancelled or postponed all events and exhibitions through to the end of August and expects to extend this to September, increased its interim dividend payout to investors.

Daily Mail &amp; and General Trust, which also owns Mail Online and the Mail on Sunday, said that total revenues across its consumer media division were down by a third in April. In April, DMGT said circulation revenues fell by 17%, with total advertising revenue down 46% \u2013 with print ads down 69% and digital advertising falling 16%. It fared little better in the first four weeks of this month, to 24 May, with total revenues down 30%.

It does not expect demand to reach 2019 levels for about three years.

EasyJet expects passenger demand to return slowly, reaching only 30% of capacity in the final quarter of the year compared with the final quarter of 2019. It does not expect demand to reach 2019 levels for about three years. The Luton-based airline employs 15,000 people and will start a consultation process with staff in the coming days.

We\u2019re doing this because we\u2019re hearing from our fans overwhelmingly that they\u2019d like us to conclude the season. They\u2019d like the game back. It represents a sense of normalcy.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/26/miami-dolphins-owner-says-there-will-definitely-be-an-nfl-season-in-2020\">Miami Dolphins owner says there will 'definitely' be an NFL season in 2020</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Here is the thing: a <em>sense</em> of normalcy is more like a <em>very</em> <em>faint</em> <em>whiff</em> of normalcy. First, these playoffs will likely be in mid- to late-summer (not normal), in two \u201chub\u201d cities (not normal), before no fans (not normal). A whopping 24 of the league\u2019s 31 teams will be eligible for the Cup, not the normal 16.</p> <p>The format is not normal, either: As 16 of the 24 teams compete in best-of-five series (not normal) in a qualifying round, the eight teams that have earned byes will play a round-robin tournament (not normal) to determine seedings for series against the first-round winners (not normal).</p> <p>The conference finals and Stanley Cup final will be best-of-seven series, as normal, but the lengths of the first and second round have not been determined. It is possible that a team could need to win more playoff games for the Cup than the usual 16, which is not normal, either.</p> <p>Even though NBC lost thousands of hours of summer programming because of the one-year postponement of the Tokyo Olympics, this was the NHL\u2019s idea. It is clear from the solid ratings of early telecasts of live Nascar and golf events that people want to watch sports, even though they don\u2019t carry the same impact because there are no fans.</p> <p>Those events are not the Stanley Cup playoffs, though. They always say the Cup is the hardest to win in sports because each round is quite literally a two-week <em>battle </em>\u2013 and there are four rounds. By the end, almost everyone is playing with some sort of injury. Each series, even the last one, ends with a noble handshake line of the two combatants, honoring each other.</p> <p>Teams have competed for the Cup for nearly 130 years through a simple playoff system free of gimmicks. There are no shootouts in the playoffs, and if six overtimes are needed for a tie-breaking goal (as in 1936), well, they play six overtimes. This get-up feels like a gimmick.</p> <p>To its credit, the NHL is approaching these amended playoffs with caution per the coronavirus, with NHL Players\u2019 Association executive director Donald Fehr saying on NBC: \u201cWe have done as best we can at this point to design appropriate health and safety protocols. If they need to be amended over time, we will amend them. This is a living document.\u201d</p> <p>The playoffs won\u2019t feel anything like a stirring crescendo, as usual. The season was suspended on 12 March, so the players will have been out of action for more than three months before they gather again for pre-tournament training camps. Eight teams could see their seasons end after going through a training camp, then losing three straight games.</p> <p>Those first-round \u201cseeding\u201d games among the top eight teams, four per conference, won\u2019t feel anything like playoff games \u2013 or even regular-season games among the league\u2019s elite. Hockey players, much like basketball players, feed off the thunderous emotions of its fans (or feed off shutting up the other team\u2019s fans). This will feel like watching a good practice. Meanwhile, the players will be sequestered in hotels.</p> <p>Bettman is not optimistic about, but has not ruled out, holding later rounds of the playoffs in cities in which the teams play, but that seems to bring up other logistical problems, even without fans in the seats \u2013 like, those famous watching parties outside both teams\u2019 arenas. These will pretty much exclusively be a watch-it-from-your-couch playoffs.</p> <p>Which is the way most people watch sports on TV, anyway, so it is not as if most people will be missing a lot. I\u2019d bet the players will be trying their hardest. But the quality of play could be compromised by the long layoff, and the atmosphere will be lacking inside the arenas.</p> <p>It just feels so \u2026 <em>forced</em>. This is not like cancelling the NCAA basketball tournaments, which include teams that change entirely over four years. There was no Stanley Cup champion in 2005 because an unresolved labor dispute led the NHL to cancel the season. There was no World Series champion in 1994. It sucked, but both leagues got back to it next year.</p> <p>The 2020 Stanley Cup champion, if one is decided, won\u2019t feel the same as the others. Teams did complete 85% of the regular season, and the season is expected to be concluded with the winners\u2019 hoisting of the gleaming silver chalice. But it won\u2019t come close to a sense of normal, even to the players, I\u2019d bet.</p> <p>A pandemic is certainly a valid enough reason to cancel the crowning of a sports champion for one year. What has been derived for the NHL takes away some value of a beloved and cherished trophy that, in normal times, is the most difficult to win.</p>",

We\u2019re doing this because we\u2019re hearing from our fans overwhelmingly that they\u2019d like us to conclude the season. They\u2019d like the game back. It represents a sense of normalcy.\u201d Here is the thing: a sense of normalcy is more like a very faint whiff of normalcy. First, these playoffs will likely be in mid- to late-summer (not normal), in two \u201chub\u201d cities (not normal), before no fans (not normal). A whopping 24 of the league\u2019s 31 teams will be eligible for the Cup, not the normal 16. The format is not normal, either: As 16 of the 24 teams compete in best-of-five series (not normal) in a qualifying round, the eight teams that have earned byes will play a round-robin tournament (not normal) to determine seedings for series against the first-round winners (not normal). The conference finals and Stanley Cup final will be best-of-seven series, as normal, but the lengths of the first and second round have not been determined. It is possible that a team could need to win more playoff games for the Cup than the usual 16, which is not normal, either. Even though NBC lost thousands of hours of summer programming because of the one-year postponement of the Tokyo Olympics, this was the NHL\u2019s idea. It is clear from the solid ratings of early telecasts of live Nascar and golf events that people want to watch sports, even though they don\u2019t carry the same impact because there are no fans. Those events are not the Stanley Cup playoffs, though. They always say the Cup is the hardest to win in sports because each round is quite literally a two-week battle \u2013 and there are four rounds. By the end, almost everyone is playing with some sort of injury. Each series, even the last one, ends with a noble handshake line of the two combatants, honoring each other. Teams have competed for the Cup for nearly 130 years through a simple playoff system free of gimmicks. There are no shootouts in the playoffs, and if six overtimes are needed for a tie-breaking goal (as in 1936), well, they play six overtimes. This get-up feels like a gimmick. To its credit, the NHL is approaching these amended playoffs with caution per the coronavirus, with NHL Players\u2019 Association executive director Donald Fehr saying on NBC: \u201cWe have done as best we can at this point to design appropriate health and safety protocols. If they need to be amended over time, we will amend them. This is a living document.\u201d The playoffs won\u2019t feel anything like a stirring crescendo, as usual. The season was suspended on 12 March, so the players will have been out of action for more than three months before they gather again for pre-tournament training camps. Eight teams could see their seasons end after going through a training camp, then losing three straight games. Those first-round \u201cseeding\u201d games among the top eight teams, four per conference, won\u2019t feel anything like playoff games \u2013 or even regular-season games among the league\u2019s elite. Hockey players, much like basketball players, feed off the thunderous emotions of its fans (or feed off shutting up the other team\u2019s fans). This will feel like watching a good practice. Meanwhile, the players will be sequestered in hotels. Bettman is not optimistic about, but has not ruled out, holding later rounds of the playoffs in cities in which the teams play, but that seems to bring up other logistical problems, even without fans in the seats \u2013 like, those famous watching parties outside both teams\u2019 arenas. These will pretty much exclusively be a watch-it-from-your-couch playoffs. Which is the way most people watch sports on TV, anyway, so it is not as if most people will be missing a lot. I\u2019d bet the players will be trying their hardest. But the quality of play could be compromised by the long layoff, and the atmosphere will be lacking inside the arenas. It just feels so \u2026 forced. This is not like cancelling the NCAA basketball tournaments, which include teams that change entirely over four years. There was no Stanley Cup champion in 2005 because an unresolved labor dispute led the NHL to cancel the season. There was no World Series champion in 1994. It sucked, but both leagues got back to it next year. The 2020 Stanley Cup champion, if one is decided, won\u2019t feel the same as the others. Teams did complete 85% of the regular season, and the season is expected to be concluded with the winners\u2019 hoisting of the gleaming silver chalice. But it won\u2019t come close to a sense of normal, even to the players, I\u2019d bet. A pandemic is certainly a valid enough reason to cancel the crowning of a sports champion for one year. What has been derived for the NHL takes away some value of a beloved and cherished trophy that, in normal times, is the most difficult to win.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cI hate it!\u201d says Jim Clinton jocularly of the lockdown. \u201cI hate not being able to see the grandchildren \u2026 not being able to see a newborn baby is one of those things as a grandparent you don\u2019t really contemplate happening. You can\u2019t imagine you won\u2019t be there to experience those early days up close and personal.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton, a 74-year-old nonprofit worker from Alexandria, Louisiana, hasn\u2019t met the newest addition to his family, five-week-old baby Julia, due to the coronavirus restrictions. His son Ryan and daughter-in-law Sarah had baby Julia on 23 April. Julia is their third child, and under normal circumstances Clinton and his wife Susan would have visited as soon as possible after the birth.</p> <p>But that wasn\u2019t going to be possible: the family lives in Austin, Texas, and it wouldn\u2019t be responsible to visit, even if only to see the baby from a distance. \u201cThe process of getting to Julia, being exposed to the gas stations and convenience stores \u2026 it just wasn\u2019t possible,\u201d says Clinton. \u201cWe agonize over it, we grieve over it, but at the end of the day, we know it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton is one of the many grandparents across the world missing out on those precious early months of their grandchildren\u2019s lives. This is a challenging time for them: they are grateful that their grandchildren have arrived safe and healthy in the face of a frightening virus \u2013 doctors are not yet sure of Covid-19\u2019s effect in pregnancy \u2013 and yet that relief is tempered with sadness at the knowledge that they may not see these babies for months, or possibly more if a vaccine is not found.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to keep it in perspective,\u201d says Liz Griffiths, 63, a retiree from Surrey, UK. Her first grandchild, Max, was born on 29 March to Griffiths\u2019 daughter, Bekki. \u201cHe\u2019s safe, we\u2019re safe, Bekki is safe, and this hopefully won\u2019t last forever.\u201d But of course, missing the birth of your first grandchild is a challenging experience. Griffiths and her husband had cleared their schedule so that they could visit after Max\u2019s birth and help with childcare. After Boris Johnson announced a nationwide lockdown on 23 March, they realised that would be impossible.</p> <p>There is the emotional side of the coronavirus lockdown: the anguished realisation that you won\u2019t be there for your grandchildren\u2019s first weeks in the world. But there are also practical considerations. In those early months, grandparents often look after older children, help keep the house tidy and prepare meals, and watch the baby whie the parents sleep. Without that support, new parents can feel overwhelmed.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been so stressful,\u201d sighs 31-year-old stay-at-home mom Katelyn Cousins from St Petersburg, Florida. Katelyn gave birth to her second child with her husband Will three weeks ago. In addition to baby Meadow, Katelyn has an 18-month old daughter, Margot. When we speak, Katelyn sounds tired \u2013 I can hear the baby crying in the background. \u201cI\u2019m about an eight out of 10 for exhaustion right now,\u201d she admits.</p> <p>The difference between Meadow and Margot\u2019s births feels stark. When Margot was born, Will\u2019s parents stayed with them for two weeks, before Katelyn\u2019s mom took over. During those weeks, the grandparents helped with childcare and gave them parenting tips. \u201cThey showed us different methods for calming the baby when it\u2019s crying, how to ease gas, that kind of thing,\u201d she says. \u201cI definitely look up to my mom and her parenting style, so it was nice to have that comfort there, and my husband doesn\u2019t always know the right thing to do when both of them are crying.\u201d</p> <p>Now, with Will working from home due to the coronavirus restrictions, the burden of almost all the childcare falls on Katelyn. \u201cMy husband is a hard sleeper, so night duty is basically me,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s super-helpful when he can be, but with him having to work, it\u2019s hard. I definitely feel like I\u2019m in zombie mode all the time.\u201d</p> <p>When you\u2019re sacrificing the ability to see your grandchildren to obey the rules, watching others flout lockdown rules can be hugely chagrinning. \u201cI get very annoyed,\u201d says Paul Hawkins, 64, a retiree from Warwickshire. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen my grandchild yet, and you see other people living nearby whose grandchildren are coming around every day.\u201d Hawkins\u2019 son Neil and his wife, Ellen, gave birth to their second child, son Chester, on 17 April. Even when the lockdown restrictions are eased, Hawkins probably won\u2019t meet Chester for a while \u2013 his mother-in-law Peggy lives with him, and as she\u2019s 97, she\u2019s extremely vulnerable to coronavirus.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"84d10968723dbcf14f957cb33dc2439fa4df8fa0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84d10968723dbcf14f957cb33dc2439fa4df8fa0/0_0_480_640/375.jpg\" alt=\"Dorothy\u2019s funeral group hug.\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dorothy\u2019s funeral group hug.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Griffiths is the only grandparent to have caught a glimpse of the baby: tragically, her mother-in-law Dorothy died the week after baby Max was born. At the small, socially distanced funeral, Griffiths saw baby Max from a distance, in the car park. \u201cWe stayed a safe distance away,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s bizarre, meeting your grandson at a funeral. It was very difficult.\u201d One small blessing \u2013 Griffiths was able to show Dorothy pictures of Max before she died. \u201cShe was in frail health by then, but she smiled,\u201d Griffiths remembers. \u201cWe think she did understand who he was.\u201d</p> <p>All the grandparents I speak with have been keeping in touch through FaceTime and Zoom. It\u2019s nice, but no substitute for being able to hold the newborns or sing them to sleep.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI hate it!\u201d says Jim Clinton jocularly of the lockdown. \u201cI hate not being able to see the grandchildren \u2026 not being able to see a newborn baby is one of those things as a grandparent you don\u2019t really contemplate happening. You can\u2019t imagine you won\u2019t be there to experience those early days up close and personal.\u201d Clinton, a 74-year-old nonprofit worker from Alexandria, Louisiana, hasn\u2019t met the newest addition to his family, five-week-old baby Julia, due to the coronavirus restrictions. His son Ryan and daughter-in-law Sarah had baby Julia on 23 April. Julia is their third child, and under normal circumstances Clinton and his wife Susan would have visited as soon as possible after the birth. But that wasn\u2019t going to be possible: the family lives in Austin, Texas, and it wouldn\u2019t be responsible to visit, even if only to see the baby from a distance. \u201cThe process of getting to Julia, being exposed to the gas stations and convenience stores \u2026 it just wasn\u2019t possible,\u201d says Clinton. \u201cWe agonize over it, we grieve over it, but at the end of the day, we know it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d Clinton is one of the many grandparents across the world missing out on those precious early months of their grandchildren\u2019s lives. This is a challenging time for them: they are grateful that their grandchildren have arrived safe and healthy in the face of a frightening virus \u2013 doctors are not yet sure of Covid-19\u2019s effect in pregnancy \u2013 and yet that relief is tempered with sadness at the knowledge that they may not see these babies for months, or possibly more if a vaccine is not found. \u201cWe have to keep it in perspective,\u201d says Liz Griffiths, 63, a retiree from Surrey, UK. Her first grandchild, Max, was born on 29 March to Griffiths\u2019 daughter, Bekki. \u201cHe\u2019s safe, we\u2019re safe, Bekki is safe, and this hopefully won\u2019t last forever.\u201d But of course, missing the birth of your first grandchild is a challenging experience. Griffiths and her husband had cleared their schedule so that they could visit after Max\u2019s birth and help with childcare. After Boris Johnson announced a nationwide lockdown on 23 March, they realised that would be impossible. There is the emotional side of the coronavirus lockdown: the anguished realisation that you won\u2019t be there for your grandchildren\u2019s first weeks in the world. But there are also practical considerations. In those early months, grandparents often look after older children, help keep the house tidy and prepare meals, and watch the baby whie the parents sleep. Without that support, new parents can feel overwhelmed. \u201cIt\u2019s been so stressful,\u201d sighs 31-year-old stay-at-home mom Katelyn Cousins from St Petersburg, Florida. Katelyn gave birth to her second child with her husband Will three weeks ago. In addition to baby Meadow, Katelyn has an 18-month old daughter, Margot. When we speak, Katelyn sounds tired \u2013 I can hear the baby crying in the background. \u201cI\u2019m about an eight out of 10 for exhaustion right now,\u201d she admits. The difference between Meadow and Margot\u2019s births feels stark. When Margot was born, Will\u2019s parents stayed with them for two weeks, before Katelyn\u2019s mom took over. During those weeks, the grandparents helped with childcare and gave them parenting tips. \u201cThey showed us different methods for calming the baby when it\u2019s crying, how to ease gas, that kind of thing,\u201d she says. \u201cI definitely look up to my mom and her parenting style, so it was nice to have that comfort there, and my husband doesn\u2019t always know the right thing to do when both of them are crying.\u201d Now, with Will working from home due to the coronavirus restrictions, the burden of almost all the childcare falls on Katelyn. \u201cMy husband is a hard sleeper, so night duty is basically me,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s super-helpful when he can be, but with him having to work, it\u2019s hard. I definitely feel like I\u2019m in zombie mode all the time.\u201d When you\u2019re sacrificing the ability to see your grandchildren to obey the rules, watching others flout lockdown rules can be hugely chagrinning. \u201cI get very annoyed,\u201d says Paul Hawkins, 64, a retiree from Warwickshire. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen my grandchild yet, and you see other people living nearby whose grandchildren are coming around every day.\u201d Hawkins\u2019 son Neil and his wife, Ellen, gave birth to their second child, son Chester, on 17 April. Even when the lockdown restrictions are eased, Hawkins probably won\u2019t meet Chester for a while \u2013 his mother-in-law Peggy lives with him, and as she\u2019s 97, she\u2019s extremely vulnerable to coronavirus. Griffiths is the only grandparent to have caught a glimpse of the baby: tragically, her mother-in-law Dorothy died the week after baby Max was born. At the small, socially distanced funeral, Griffiths saw baby Max from a distance, in the car park. \u201cWe stayed a safe distance away,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s bizarre, meeting your grandson at a funeral. It was very difficult.\u201d One small blessing \u2013 Griffiths was able to show Dorothy pictures of Max before she died. \u201cShe was in frail health by then, but she smiled,\u201d Griffiths remembers. \u201cWe think she did understand who he was.\u201d All the grandparents I speak with have been keeping in touch through FaceTime and Zoom. It\u2019s nice, but no substitute for being able to hold the newborns or sing them to sleep. Griffiths has attended online baby classes on Zoom, for parents and grandparents. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen him a lot on screen,\u201d Hawkins says of baby Chester, \u201cbut it\u2019s not the same as holding him or being there, I suppose.\u201d Watching a baby\u2019s first weeks on Earth digitally can be jarring: you notice their growth more acutely than you would in real life. \u201cIn such a short time,\u201d Hawkins says, \u201cyou really see how he\u2019s grown and changed. It\u2019s sad to know you\u2019ve missed that first month.\u201d Clinton relishes the photos and videos Ryan and Sarah send him of baby Julia. \u201cWe are taking advantage of the technology, which makes things so much better than they would have been if we were living through the 1918 flu pandemic, and relying on letters for news,\u201d he says.

Asked why the public should follow the new self-isolation rules, when even Conservative MPs believe Boris Johnson\u2019s most senior aide breached them, Matt Hancock said it was in everyone\u2019s interests that \u201cpeople follow the instructions from the NHS\u201d. The health secretary is launching the government\u2019s test-and-trace system in England on Thursday with 25,000 tracers who will call members of the public if they have been in contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus.

However, there has been criticism that Cummings\u2019 260-mile journey from London to Durham, and a second journey to Barnard Castle that he said was to test his eyesight, risks undermining the success of this new programme. Asked repeatedly on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme if Cummings had done the right thing, Hancock said he had answered the question in previous days and the prime minister had responded to \u201call these questions endlessly\u201d.

On 18 May, the doors of cafes, restaurants and shops were flung wide in Denmark and the high streets are bustling again. Even hairdressers have reopened (what did we learn during lockdown? How many Danes are natural blondes). There are no face masks in sight, few gloved hands, and little sign of any seismic global interruption. The only visible difference between the throng pre-lockdown and now is that pedestrians walk in \u201clanes\u201d, depending on their direction of traffic, and mobile hand sanitiser stations are parked at intervals along the high streets. Sanitiser pumps grace every shop doorway and smaller retailers display signs instructing customers how many are allowed in at any given time. But Danes are happy to comply for the most part \u2013 if there are already four people buying ice-cream, they\u2019ll just come back later.

      "bodyText": "Good evening, here are the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Michael McGowan and it is Thursday 28 May. News Corp announces regional paper closures News Corp Australia announced significant job cuts and the print closure of more than 100 local and regional newspapers, a significant blow to the nation\u2019s media landscape caused in part by the impact of Covid-19 on advertising revenues. In an email to staff on Thursday, the company\u2019s chairman, Michael Miller, announced that 112 Murdoch-owned newspapers will stop the presses. Of those, 36 will close altogether and 76 will remain as online mastheads. News Corp did not specify how many staff each title will have, if any, or how much local reporting will continue. The closures mark the most significant hit to local media since the beginning of the pandemic, which has devastated the advertising revenue on which local and regional print papers survive. Palmer launches border closure challenge The mining magnate Clive Palmer has instructed lawyers to commence a high court challenge against the Queensland government\u2019s ongoing border closure. The lawsuit, which Palmer\u2019s lawyers said was in part based on the impact of the closure on Palmer\u2019s company Mineralogy, follows a similar case launched by Palmer against the Western Australian government. That case, the court heard on Thursday, would likely take at least six weeks to proceed to a hearing in mid-July. Queensland and WA are not the only states to insist on keeping border closures in place despite calls from the federal government for them to reopen; South Australia and Tasmania have also kept their borders shut to outsiders. But much of the angst has been aimed aimed at Queensland and WA. The New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has been in a running sparring contest with her Queensland and WA counterparts over the closures, which she has described as illogical. New outbreak in Western Australia The number of Covid-19 cases linked to a live export ship which docked in Western Australia doubled from six to 12. Of these seven new cases recorded in the state on Thursday, six are crew members from the Al-Kuwait ship which docked in Fremantle this week. The only other case was a returned overseas traveller who is already in hotel quarantine. The WA premier, Mark McGowan, previously criticised the federal agriculture department and Australian Border Force, claiming they had not sufficiently notified the state government of health issues on board the ship. \u201cThere have clearly been some errors made all around. We can and must do better, and we will,\u201d he said. Paramedics slam NSW government\u2019s public sector wage freeze The NSW Paramedics Association slammed the state government\u2019s decision to institute a wage freeze on the public service, which it says shows \u201ccomplete disregard for us and our colleagues when we have risked our health and safety to keep NSW on its feet throughout the COVID-19 pandemic\u201d. \u201cThe NSW government says this is about saving jobs, but freezing wages of frontline public sector workers only makes us pay for this pandemic, when we have worked so hard to protect our communities,\u201d the association said in a statement. NSW is not the only state to institute a wage freeze in the midst of the pandemic. The state\u2019s premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has described the decision as necessary to save jobs. Early access super scheme targeted by fraudsters, again The government\u2019s early access to superannuation scheme has again been targeted by fraudsters. On Thursday the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority deputy chair, Helen Rowell, told a Senate inquiry the Australian Taxation Office\u2019s SuperMatch tool has been suspended after fake accounts were set up. The SuperMatch tool allowed people find all of their super accounts so they can be merged into one, but fraudsters were using the tool to see what other accounts people had. \u201cWe made the decision (with the ATO) to close the system down in order to engage with industry to tighten up the requirements around member account creation,\u201d Rowell said on Thursday. Sydney braces for \u2018new rat plague\u2019 Sydney could see \u201ca new rat plague\u201d once Covid-19 restrictions are loosened. While empty offices and restaurants in the city have driven hungry rats into homes and suburbs and likely led to rodent cannibalism, experts warn that once people return to cities rats will also return in significant numbers. \u201cThey respond to food within days,\u201d Prof Peter Banks, a rodent expert from the University of Sydney, told the Guardian. \u201cIf you give them a burst of food, that can turn into babies in three weeks\u2019 time, no worries. They usually go through a winter lull, so that is not normally their breeding time. But if we are out in springtime or late winter, out there spilling food, they will be there to exploit it.\u201d Geoff Milton, a Sydney rat-catcher with 35 years\u2019 experience, agreed, saying: \u201cThere will probably be a new plague of rats take over the city. \u201cBut a lot of the ones that are left unattended in suburbia will stay there.

The ravages of Covid-19 have revealed the deep cracks in the glittering facade of the richest and most powerful nation on Earth.</p> <h2><strong>Racial disparities</strong></h2> <p>Covid-19 is supposed to be an equal-opportunities killer. It willingly ravages the lungs of any American, regardless of their skin color or visa status.</p> <p>But as America passes the 100,000 death mark, it has become abundantly clear that the pandemic amounts to a racial disaster of stunning proportions. Figures compiled by <a href=\"https://www.apmresearchlab.org/covid/deaths-by-race\">APM Research Lab</a> from 40 states show that African Americans are being killed at almost three times the rate of white people.</p> <p>Black Kansans are <a href=\"https://www.apmresearchlab.org/covid/deaths-by-race\">seven times</a> more likely to die from the virus than white Kansans.

What better way to deflect attention from his administration\u2019s dire handling of the pandemic than to swing the spotlight on to the dead themselves?</p> <p>Decades of segregation, decrepit housing, joblessness, stress, police brutality, poor hospitals, lack of health insurance, failing schools \u2013 these are also relevant factors that the White House tends to gloss over. So too is the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/10/us/coronavirus-african-americans-bias.html\">discrimination in access</a> to testing and treatment for coronavirus that has increased the chances that black people contract and then die from the disease.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>America has become a failed social experiment, a decayed empire that is unable to meet the basic needs of its people</p> <footer> <cite>Cornel West</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Cornel West, the Harvard philosopher, activist and writer, argues that you have to dig deeper to find the source of such disproportionate fatalities. \u201cThe virus encounters deeply racist structures and institutions already in place, against the backdrop of wealth inequality, a militarized state and a commodified culture in which everybody and everything is for sale,\u201d he said.</p> <p>For West, the pandemic has revealed nothing less than the country\u2019s demise. \u201cAmerica has become a failed social experiment, a decayed empire that is unable to meet the basic needs of its people.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Partisan wounds</strong></h2> <p>When the US has endured past attacks by stealthy enemies \u2013 Pearl Harbor, say, or 9/11 \u2013 there has been some effort from the White House down to rally the nation around a common defense.

A survey by the University of Chicago found that 77% of Democrats want lockdown restrictions to remain in place for as long as needed to protect health, while only 45% of Republicans take that view.</p> <p>\u201cPolitics more than economics is dividing Americans,\u201d the Chicago researchers concluded.</p> <p>Trump has adopted a similar partisan stance.

That\u2019s the view of the Rev William Barber, co-chair of the Poor People\u2019s Campaign.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are being forced to work, putting profit over protection,\u201d he said. \u201cThis pandemic will highlight how poverty \u2013 and our willingness to let people remain in it \u2013 presents a clear and present danger for all of us.\u201d</p> <p>Barber, a leading voice on the scourge of income inequality which saw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/15/america-extreme-poverty-un-special-rapporteur\">41 million people</a> officially living in poverty even before the virus made landfall in the US, also pointed out that coronavirus is a disease that benefits the rich. \u201cBillionaires have made nearly $500m while essential workers have not even been given guaranteed health care, a living wage or a water supply that is protected from being shut off,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cf8db1d9303b67e368b5b15037248ec8134c84ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf8db1d9303b67e368b5b15037248ec8134c84ad/0_0_5264_3509/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Free food is distributed at the Spring Creek Towers in the East New York neighborhood.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Free food is distributed at the Spring Creek Towers in the East New York neighborhood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As with race, the fault line of inequality is glaringly obvious in New York City, where more than <a href=\"https://projects.thecity.nyc/2020_03_covid-19-tracker/\">21,000</a> of the 100,000 have died. Many low-income New Yorkers in the outer boroughs are obliged to risk their lives by turning up for work every day, branded as \u201cessential workers\u201d, while Manhattan\u2019s wealthy neighborhoods have become virtual ghost towns after their residents fled to vacation homes.</p> <p>It will take time for the full extent of mortality among low-income Americans to be known, but anecdotally it is clear the <a href=\"https://publicintegrity.org/health/coronavirus-and-inequality/pre-existing-inequality-could-make-coronavirus-hit-some-harder/\">poorest counties</a> have been hit hardest. That\u2019s evident in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/12/coronavirus-us-deep-south-poverty-race-perfect-storm\">southern states</a> such as Louisiana and Alabama where low-income people have been dying in high proportions through a combination of lack of health insurance, hospital closures and policies pursued by southern governors that have exposed vulnerable citizens to danger.</p> <p>There is nothing new in any of this for the beleaguered souls now feeling the full force of the virus\u2019s wrath. But coronavirus has made an old story newly visible, as the endless lines at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/food-banks-problems-immigrants-coronavirus-texas\">food banks</a> now attest.</p> <h2><strong>Misinformation</strong></h2> <p>The infodemic of misinformation that has battered the country over the past four months starts with the misinformer-in-chief: Trump.</p> <p>From the start of the crisis, the president has shown <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/04/trump-coronavirus-science-analysis\">disdain</a> for the facts. On 27 February, the day the country first mourned a death from Covid-19, he predicted the virus \u201cwill disappear\u201d like a \u201cmiracle\u201d.</p> <p>He has gone on to spread unfounded claims that coronavirus started in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/30/donald-trump-coronavirus-chinese-lab-claim\">Chinese lab</a>. He also promoted untested and potentially life-threatening treatments, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/trump-coronavirus-treatment-disinfectant\">disinfectant</a> and the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/19/trump-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-white-house\">revealed</a> he is taking himself \u2013 against the advice of his own administration.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s embrace of untruths has emboldened peddlers in misinformation, including sellers of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/revealed-leader-group-peddling-bleach-cure-lobbied-trump-coronavirus\">bleach</a> as a miracle cure.

Over the last six weeks there has been an explosion of conspiracy theories on social media, epitomized by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/coronavirus-viral-video-plandemic-judy-mikovits-conspiracy-theories\">Plandemic</a> documentary, which claimed a cabal led by Bill Gates were exploiting the virus to seize power.</p> <p>Wardle has been surprised how quickly conspiracy theories have erupted into the mainstream. \u201cYou have high school friends and mums and aunts who would never normally share this material now on it.\u201d</p> <p>Wardle sees the vast proliferation of misinformation as a result of deep uncertainty about the pandemic, combined with a paucity of quality information following the collapse of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-us-newspapers-impact\">US news industry</a>, which has itself been accelerated by the virus\u2019 economic impact.</p> <p>Bad information cost lives. It can encourage states to reopen their economies precipitously and lure individuals to drop their guard and expose themselves to the virus.</p> <p>Wardle said: \u201cHistorians are going to look back on all of this and have a much clearer idea of how misinformation led to real-world harm \u2013 and death.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "In one of the rare expressions of empathy that Donald Trump has displayed during the course of the coronavirus pandemic, he talked earlier this month about the disease claiming so many lives it was \u201cfilling up Yankee Stadium with death\u201d. Now the death toll from Covid-19 stands at almost twice the capacity of the Yankees\u2019 home stadium, and has reached another booming landmark: 100,000 deaths. A country that prides itself on its exceptionalism can now without ambiguity claim that title for its experience of the virus. The United States stands head and shoulders at the top of the world league table of confirmed cases, as well as the total number of deaths. There will be much to analyse in coming years about how the US responded to this contagion, including how many lives have been lost needlessly as a result of Trump\u2019s maverick response. Already one lesson of the pandemic is clear: America\u2019s deep and brutal fault lines \u2013 of race, partisanship, gender, poverty and misinformation \u2013 rendered the country ill-prepared to meet the challenges of this disease. The ravages of Covid-19 have revealed the deep cracks in the glittering facade of the richest and most powerful nation on Earth. Racial disparities Covid-19 is supposed to be an equal-opportunities killer. It willingly ravages the lungs of any American, regardless of their skin color or visa status. But as America passes the 100,000 death mark, it has become abundantly clear that the pandemic amounts to a racial disaster of stunning proportions. Figures compiled by APM Research Lab from 40 states show that African Americans are being killed at almost three times the rate of white people. Black Kansans are seven times more likely to die from the virus than white Kansans. In Missouri, Wisconsin and Washington DC the ratio is six times. Such grotesque distortions are most visible in New York City, that giant laboratory test into virulent racial inequity. Data released this week showed that when the city\u2019s zip codes are ranked according to highest death rates, eight out of the top 10 have majority black or Latino populations. None of the 10 are in wealthy, largely white Manhattan. The Trump administration says black Americans\u2019 high death rate is because they were already unhealthy. They have \u201cgreater risk profiles\u201d, as the health secretary, Alex Azar, put it. It is true that diabetes, hypertension, obesity and other underlying health conditions are prevalent in many black communities. But focusing on these co-morbidities is tantamount to victim-blaming. In an election year, that would suit Trump very well. What better way to deflect attention from his administration\u2019s dire handling of the pandemic than to swing the spotlight on to the dead themselves? Decades of segregation, decrepit housing, joblessness, stress, police brutality, poor hospitals, lack of health insurance, failing schools \u2013 these are also relevant factors that the White House tends to gloss over. So too is the discrimination in access to testing and treatment for coronavirus that has increased the chances that black people contract and then die from the disease. Cornel West, the Harvard philosopher, activist and writer, argues that you have to dig deeper to find the source of such disproportionate fatalities. \u201cThe virus encounters deeply racist structures and institutions already in place, against the backdrop of wealth inequality, a militarized state and a commodified culture in which everybody and everything is for sale,\u201d he said. For West, the pandemic has revealed nothing less than the country\u2019s demise. \u201cAmerica has become a failed social experiment, a decayed empire that is unable to meet the basic needs of its people.\u201d Partisan wounds When the US has endured past attacks by stealthy enemies \u2013 Pearl Harbor, say, or 9/11 \u2013 there has been some effort from the White House down to rally the nation around a common defense. Not so this time. When Americans are asked about key policies relating to coronavirus, such as when lockdown should be eased and economies reopened, their answer is starkly partisan. A survey by the University of Chicago found that 77% of Democrats want lockdown restrictions to remain in place for as long as needed to protect health, while only 45% of Republicans take that view. \u201cPolitics more than economics is dividing Americans,\u201d the Chicago researchers concluded. Trump has adopted a similar partisan stance. Instead of acting for the nation as a whole, he has favored party political point scoring ahead of November\u2019s presidential election. Republican states such as Florida have received all the emergency medical supplies they requested from federal government. Democratic ones have gone short-changed. Trump admitted he rebuffed the calls of Democratic governors who \u201cdon\u2019t treat you right\u201d. He threatened financial penalties against Democratic states trying to make absentee voting easier during the pandemic. To Kamala Harris, the former Democratic presidential candidate, such moves indicate that the president is \u201cworried about the outcome of the upcoming election rather than the safety of people\u201d. Harris, a US senator from California, told the Guardian that for many citizens, especially African Americans, the consequences of such partisan posturing \u201care life and death. In a matter of months, 100,000 Americans have died. That\u2019s more than 40 times those who died in Pearl Harbor.\u201d Among the 100,000 victims, there are partisan fissures, too. It is no surprise that Democratic parts of the country have suffered greatly as they include the big cities such as New York and Chicago where the virus has struck most aggressively. Across the US, Reuters has reported, counties that voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election have recorded 39 deaths from Covid-19 per 100,000 residents, three times the rate of counties who went for Trump. For Harris, it doesn\u2019t matter what party a victim supports. \u201cWe must remember that each death is one too many. This is a moment where we all \u2013 regardless of our position or title \u2013 must come together to lift the American people up.\u201d The gender divide One of the paradoxes of coronavirus in the US is that while men are dying in greater proportions, it is women who suffer most while living with the pandemic. In New York City, men are dying at almost twice the rate of women. Yet in every other aspect of this epic contagion, the load is being borne by women. Most of the frontline health workers, including nine out of 10 nurses, are female, putting them in the thick of the storm. Then there\u2019s the tidal wave of US unemployment: 55% of the jobs lost last month were held by women. Within the lockdown at home, women are also shouldering the burden, whether they are one of the 80% of single-parent families in the US who are headed by women or are in a heterosexual relationship and taking on the lion\u2019s share of homeschooling. That\u2019s before you consider the normal imbalance in childcare and household chores that has intensified. Rebecca Solnit, the influential writer whose book Men Explain Things to Me gave rise to the phrase \u201cmansplaining\u201d, pithily summed up the impact of the pandemic for American women. \u201cEverything wrong with life at home got a lot wronger,\u201d she said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s the rise of domestic violence and the withering away of escapes from it, the way that the sudden requirement of parents across the US to become homeschoolers fell primarily on women, and that heterosexual men living with women are still far from shouldering their fair share of domestic labor.\u201d Solnit pointed to the contradiction that while most face masks are being voluntarily sewn by women, men are far more likely to refuse to wear the protective items on grounds they show \u201cweakness\u201d. Displays of reckless masculinity start at the top \u2013 Trump recently toured a mask-making factory in Arizona without wearing a mask. Solnit offered the Guardian a couple of remedies for the pandemic of men behaving badly during the pandemic. \u201cDivorce may be one treatment in some cases,\u201d she said, \u201cfeminism liberally applied across all parties the only known cure.\u201d Inequality Coronavirus in America is a disease of the poor. That\u2019s the view of the Rev William Barber, co-chair of the Poor People\u2019s Campaign. \u201cPeople are being forced to work, putting profit over protection,\u201d he said. \u201cThis pandemic will highlight how poverty \u2013 and our willingness to let people remain in it \u2013 presents a clear and present danger for all of us.\u201d Barber, a leading voice on the scourge of income inequality which saw 41 million people officially living in poverty even before the virus made landfall in the US, also pointed out that coronavirus is a disease that benefits the rich. \u201cBillionaires have made nearly $500m while essential workers have not even been given guaranteed health care, a living wage or a water supply that is protected from being shut off,\u201d he said. As with race, the fault line of inequality is glaringly obvious in New York City, where more than 21,000 of the 100,000 have died. Many low-income New Yorkers in the outer boroughs are obliged to risk their lives by turning up for work every day, branded as \u201cessential workers\u201d, while Manhattan\u2019s wealthy neighborhoods have become virtual ghost towns after their residents fled to vacation homes. It will take time for the full extent of mortality among low-income Americans to be known, but anecdotally it is clear the poorest counties have been hit hardest. That\u2019s evident in southern states such as Louisiana and Alabama where low-income people have been dying in high proportions through a combination of lack of health insurance, hospital closures and policies pursued by southern governors that have exposed vulnerable citizens to danger. There is nothing new in any of this for the beleaguered souls now feeling the full force of the virus\u2019s wrath. But coronavirus has made an old story newly visible, as the endless lines at food banks now attest. Misinformation The infodemic of misinformation that has battered the country over the past four months starts with the misinformer-in-chief: Trump. From the start of the crisis, the president has shown disdain for the facts. On 27 February, the day the country first mourned a death from Covid-19, he predicted the virus \u201cwill disappear\u201d like a \u201cmiracle\u201d. He has gone on to spread unfounded claims that coronavirus started in a Chinese lab. He also promoted untested and potentially life-threatening treatments, including disinfectant and the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which he revealed he is taking himself \u2013 against the advice of his own administration. Trump\u2019s embrace of untruths has emboldened peddlers in misinformation, including sellers of bleach as a miracle cure. And it has imperiled lives. A man in Arizona died, and his wife was hospitalized, after they took chloroquine phosphate \u2013 used to clean fish tanks. All that forms part of an unparalleled wave of misinformation that has swept the US. \u201cI have never seen so much of this stuff,\u201d said Claire Wardle, director of First Draft, a nonprofit that tackles misinformation worldwide. Early on in the crisis, rumors that lockdown would see the government impose martial law began to circulate through closed-messaging apps and texts. Over the last six weeks there has been an explosion of conspiracy theories on social media, epitomized by the Plandemic documentary, which claimed a cabal led by Bill Gates were exploiting the virus to seize power. Wardle has been surprised how quickly conspiracy theories have erupted into the mainstream. \u201cYou have high school friends and mums and aunts who would never normally share this material now on it.\u201d Wardle sees the vast proliferation of misinformation as a result of deep uncertainty about the pandemic, combined with a paucity of quality information following the collapse of the US news industry, which has itself been accelerated by the virus\u2019 economic impact. Bad information cost lives. It can encourage states to reopen their economies precipitously and lure individuals to drop their guard and expose themselves to the virus. Wardle said: \u201cHistorians are going to look back on all of this and have a much clearer idea of how misinformation led to real-world harm \u2013 and death.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Most weekday mornings, a few minutes before 8.00, the circling begins. Two young children and what looks like a parent appear, on bikes, in the church parking lot next to my house. They immediately begin riding in circles. Both kids look like they\u2019re under six years old. Tuesdays and Thursdays, they tend to be with their dad; Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, they\u2019re usually with their mom.</p> <p>The morning circlings started suddenly \u2013 right after Minnesota\u2019s stay-at-home order was issued, to be exact. I\u2019m working from home because of lockdown, and I can see this little family bicycling from my kitchen table.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s ride fast-fast-fast!\u201d their mom will call, and the kids will zoom around on their tiny bikes, shrieking with excitement, their legs blurring. \u201cOK, let\u2019s slooooooow it down,\u201d she\u2019ll say, and they\u2019ll compete to see who can pedal slowest without toppling over. There is so much giggling.</p> <p>The circling ends promptly at 8.30am. They straggle home in a wobbly line, a zigzag of helmeted ducklings.</p> <p>We live on a high-traffic street, and the closest park isn\u2019t good for biking. A precise half-hour of circling with small children, every weekday morning since lockdown began?</p> <p>These parents are switching off for each other\u2019s 8am Zoom meetings.</p> <p>The circling family \u2013 a family with small, noisy kids \u2013 lives only a few houses away from me, and I had no idea they existed. On our large city block, pre-lockdown, I couldn\u2019t have told you if a single kid lived near me. Now kids are everywhere \u2013 lolling on the grass, gangling on stoops, sulking along on family walks, and \u2026 do they all live here? Where were they all before this? Did these kids never go outside before stay-at-home, or was I just never home long enough to notice them?</p> <p>Is it both?</p> <p>Whatever it is, since lockdown, something about the area where I live has fundamentally changed. For the first time in my adult life, I feel like I live in a <em>neighborhood.</em> A neighborhood with real neighbors, ones I recognize and wave to on my daily walks.</p> <p>Lockdown has created the neighborhood that Sesame Street prepared me for as a child. It\u2019s been a side-effect I hadn\u2019t expected.&nbsp;</p> <p>I grew up with 80s-era Sesame Street, pre-Elmo hitting the big time, thank God. It was just Big Bird, Oscar the Grouch, Bert and Ernie, the Count, Grover and Maria, the friendly lady who was always sitting on the stoop, waiting to chat or sing a song about sharing. Everyone knew everyone. The newsstand was open; Mr Hooper\u2019s store was ready for business and a lesson in counting to 10 in Spanish.</p> <p>Because of lockdown, this feels like the world I am suddenly living in. Now, I\u2019ve been extremely lucky. I\u2019ve been able to keep my job, and I\u2019ve been able to work from home. I haven\u2019t had to deal with the effects of the virus almost at all yet, so this is the different way of living I\u2019ve been experiencing.</p> <p>I now know my UPS driver. I noticed the day he switched from long brown pants to brown shorts, and was so happy, because I knew \u2013 without checking the weather \u2013 that it would finally be warm all week.</p> <p>I know the wire-haired dachshund who goes for a hopping walk around the block twice a day. Toby. He wears little sweaters when it\u2019s chilly and always sniffs a particular pine tree that flanks the parking lot.</p> <p>The person across the street who has a cool dog isn\u2019t just the person across the street any more \u2013 it\u2019s Melissa (names changed) and her gentle English pitbull, Rania. I know this now, because after weeks of seeing her as I walked my dog, Elwood, every day during lockdown, she waved me over and invited Elwood into her fenced yard to play with Rania. Elwood hadn\u2019t so much as sniffed another dog in over a month, and every inch of the fur on his back stood on end, electrified with the thrill of making a friend.</p> <p>Recently, I dropped a postcard into the metal postbox on the corner, and the mailman, about to empty the box, stopped to chat with me for five whole minutes. We talked about what the dangers of being a mail carrier were right now and which gardens in the neighborhood were blooming early. Would I have chatted with him for so long two months ago? I\u2019d like to think so, but I doubt it \u2013 our paths would never have crossed so often before the pandemic, and I wasn\u2019t nearly so excited about meeting new people then.</p> <p>Believe me, now I am.</p> <p>Everyone is outside, all of a sudden. Everyone is gardening in their tiny yard each evening.

      "bodyText": "Most weekday mornings, a few minutes before 8.00, the circling begins. Two young children and what looks like a parent appear, on bikes, in the church parking lot next to my house. They immediately begin riding in circles. Both kids look like they\u2019re under six years old. Tuesdays and Thursdays, they tend to be with their dad; Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, they\u2019re usually with their mom. The morning circlings started suddenly \u2013 right after Minnesota\u2019s stay-at-home order was issued, to be exact. I\u2019m working from home because of lockdown, and I can see this little family bicycling from my kitchen table. \u201cLet\u2019s ride fast-fast-fast!\u201d their mom will call, and the kids will zoom around on their tiny bikes, shrieking with excitement, their legs blurring. \u201cOK, let\u2019s slooooooow it down,\u201d she\u2019ll say, and they\u2019ll compete to see who can pedal slowest without toppling over. There is so much giggling. The circling ends promptly at 8.30am. They straggle home in a wobbly line, a zigzag of helmeted ducklings. We live on a high-traffic street, and the closest park isn\u2019t good for biking. A precise half-hour of circling with small children, every weekday morning since lockdown began? These parents are switching off for each other\u2019s 8am Zoom meetings. The circling family \u2013 a family with small, noisy kids \u2013 lives only a few houses away from me, and I had no idea they existed. On our large city block, pre-lockdown, I couldn\u2019t have told you if a single kid lived near me. Now kids are everywhere \u2013 lolling on the grass, gangling on stoops, sulking along on family walks, and \u2026 do they all live here? Where were they all before this? Did these kids never go outside before stay-at-home, or was I just never home long enough to notice them? Is it both? Whatever it is, since lockdown, something about the area where I live has fundamentally changed. For the first time in my adult life, I feel like I live in a neighborhood. A neighborhood with real neighbors, ones I recognize and wave to on my daily walks. Lockdown has created the neighborhood that Sesame Street prepared me for as a child. It\u2019s been a side-effect I hadn\u2019t expected. I grew up with 80s-era Sesame Street, pre-Elmo hitting the big time, thank God. It was just Big Bird, Oscar the Grouch, Bert and Ernie, the Count, Grover and Maria, the friendly lady who was always sitting on the stoop, waiting to chat or sing a song about sharing. Everyone knew everyone. The newsstand was open; Mr Hooper\u2019s store was ready for business and a lesson in counting to 10 in Spanish. Because of lockdown, this feels like the world I am suddenly living in. Now, I\u2019ve been extremely lucky. I\u2019ve been able to keep my job, and I\u2019ve been able to work from home. I haven\u2019t had to deal with the effects of the virus almost at all yet, so this is the different way of living I\u2019ve been experiencing. I now know my UPS driver. I noticed the day he switched from long brown pants to brown shorts, and was so happy, because I knew \u2013 without checking the weather \u2013 that it would finally be warm all week. I know the wire-haired dachshund who goes for a hopping walk around the block twice a day. Toby. He wears little sweaters when it\u2019s chilly and always sniffs a particular pine tree that flanks the parking lot. The person across the street who has a cool dog isn\u2019t just the person across the street any more \u2013 it\u2019s Melissa (names changed) and her gentle English pitbull, Rania. I know this now, because after weeks of seeing her as I walked my dog, Elwood, every day during lockdown, she waved me over and invited Elwood into her fenced yard to play with Rania. Elwood hadn\u2019t so much as sniffed another dog in over a month, and every inch of the fur on his back stood on end, electrified with the thrill of making a friend. Recently, I dropped a postcard into the metal postbox on the corner, and the mailman, about to empty the box, stopped to chat with me for five whole minutes. We talked about what the dangers of being a mail carrier were right now and which gardens in the neighborhood were blooming early. Would I have chatted with him for so long two months ago? I\u2019d like to think so, but I doubt it \u2013 our paths would never have crossed so often before the pandemic, and I wasn\u2019t nearly so excited about meeting new people then. Believe me, now I am. Everyone is outside, all of a sudden. Everyone is gardening in their tiny yard each evening. A few nights ago, I was sitting on a bench at the park, and a father and daughter brought a ball, a bat and a glove and started practicing hitting and catching. She kept missing the ball when she swung, and he just kept encouraging her and coaching her, and she started hitting the ball more often. And here\u2019s the thing: there were so many people with time on their hands, just going for a stroll at dusk, that a tiny, socially distanced crowd formed and started clapping when she hit the ball. It was so wholesome I got teary-eyed. I live in a city. If you live in a city, you know that you almost never meet or speak to your neighbors. I\u2019ve shared apartment walls for years with people I\u2019ve never met. Suddenly speaking to my neighbors feels a little thrilling, like we\u2019re all crossing a once-forbidden boundary together. \u201cOh, who are the people in your neighborhood, in your neighborhood, in your ney-bor-hoood?\u201d sang the Sesame Street puppets to me decades ago. Lockdown continues. The little circling family bikes past my window, and I finally know the answer to that question. Krista Burton is a writer",

      "bodyText": "Good morning. More than 100,000 US citizens have died from the coronavirus, a toll almost three times that of any other country and more than the US lost in the Korean and Vietnam wars combined. The pandemic has laid bare the US\u2019s brutal social faultlines \u2013 race, gender and poverty \u2013 writes Ed Pilkington, while the government\u2019s abject failure to prepare for it exposed a broken politics. Here, loved ones pay tribute to a few of those who have lost their lives. Donald Trump did not acknowledge the grim milestone on Wednesday, instead choosing to renew his attacks on the tech companies he claims are trying to censor him. Joe Biden released a video extending his condolences to all those who were grieving loved ones. Trump\u2019s son Eric tweeted about the stock market, calling it a \u201cGREAT DAY for the DOW!!\u201d 20% of US citizens would choose not to get a Covid-19 vaccine if or when one is available, according to a poll. Even if such a vaccine were developed in the next 18 months, only 49% of respondents said they would agree to be immunised. About one-third said they weren\u2019t sure. Trump is threatening to \u2018close down\u2019 social media companies Days after Twitter slapped Trump\u2019s tweets with a fact-check label for the first time, the president is set to sign an executive order that could expose Twitter and other large tech firms such as Facebook and Google to lawsuits over material posted by their users, according to Reuters. On Wednesday morning Trump threatened to \u201cstrongly regulate\u201d or \u201cclose down\u201d social media platforms that he and his allies perceive as \u201csilencing conservative voices\u201d. In the evening, he tweeted again: Big Tech is doing everything in their very considerable power to CENSOR in advance of the 2020 Election. If that happens, we no longer have our freedom. I will never let it happen! South Korea is locking down again after a new spike in cases South Korea, one of the first countries to successfully contain the coronavirus, has reintroduced some lockdown measures in the capital, Seoul, after its biggest rise in infections for almost two months. The two-week closure of museums, galleries and parks in the city \u2013 which is home to half of the country\u2019s 52 million people \u2013 comes after the Korean CDC reported 79 new infections on Thursday, 67 of them in the Seoul metropolitan area. France, Italy and Belgium have all taken steps to block the use of hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malarial drug that Trump has backed and says he is taking, as a Covid-19 treatment over concerns about the drug\u2019s safety. Argentina\u2019s security forces have cordoned off one of the country\u2019s poorest slums after a surge of coronavirus cases, a move criticised by one of the leftwing government\u2019s own ministers as \u201ccreating ghettoes for poor people\u201d. George Floyd\u2019s sister says police should face murder charges As protests over the police killing of George Floyd continued in Minneapolis on Wednesday, his sister, Bridget called for the officers involved in the incident to be charged with murder. Sports stars including LeBron James, Colin Kaepernick and Lewis Hamilton have expressed anger over the killing of another unarmed African American man by a white police officer. Everyday racism. A video of a man in Minneapolis questioning whether a group of black men were entitled to work out at his gym has gone viral. The men were entrepreneurs whose office is in the same block as the gym. Police abolition. The futile cycle of police killings, protest and promises of justice unfulfilled suggest police reform is not enough to address the problem, argues Derecka Purnell: If we can understand that the calls to abolish Ice [the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency] actually mean that this country needs a new, transformational immigration system, then why dismiss police abolition as a viable option for a transformative society? In other news \u2026 The US no longer considers Hong Kong autonomous and will cease to treat it as such for trade and economic purposes, Mike Pompeo has announced, as the Chinese parliament approved a new law stripping the territory of its freedoms. Brazil lost 4,633 sq miles of forest last year, according to a study that raises fresh alarm over the rate of deforestation under Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s government. Another study noted a 27% increase in the destruction of tropical forests in eastern Brazil. The SpaceX-Nasa rocket launch was scrubbed owing to poor weather in Florida on Wednesday. The first crewed spaceflight from US soil since 2011 could now take off on Saturday. The US funded pro-democracy rock groups in Venezuela and encouraged them to write songs that would undermine the rule of the country\u2019s late president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, according to documents released after a Freedom of Information Act request. Great reads Gary Busey has a new reality show about pets The star of Big Wednesday, who survived a serious Harley Davidson accident \u2013 and the Hollywood party scene \u2013 tells Simon Hattenstone about his new show, Pet Judge, in which he presides over a court in which litigants resolve quarrels about their pets. \u201cNone of the other judge shows hold a candle fire, bonfire or rocket to this.\u201d The free press is under threat worldwide Journalists and publishers around the world increasingly face attacks on their work and on themselves, ranging from strategic lawsuits to targeted assassinations. Now the pandemic is being used as cover to crack down further on independent voices, as Gill Phillips reports.

Last week, Vietnam\u2019s health ministry said it was considering repatriating the man to the UK for further treatment if his condition allowed. \u201cA lung transplant would obviously only be considered if there were no other options,\u201d Pollack said. \u201cThere are case reports from China of successful lung transplants being performed for patients with respiratory failures.\u201d The British embassy in Hanoi said it was unable to comment on the case, citing patient confidentiality, although the British consul general, Ian Gibbons, sent a letter to medical staff in Ho Chi Minh City on 21 May thanking them for their support. Vietnam, a country of 96 million people that shares a border with China, has so far recorded just 327 cases of Covid-19, owing in part to its aggressive contact tracing campaigns, creative public health messaging and decisive, early action. Nguyen Quoc Thai, an intensive care doctor at the infectious disease department of Hanoi\u2019s Bach Mai hospital, said: \u201cIn China, they did the operation with teams who have experienced hundreds of cases each year. Our Vietnam team has worked on just a few cases, so it\u2019s \u2026 very courageous when we mention such a double lung transplant. I hope everything will go smoothly, but still, I worry so much. \u201cAt this time, with advances in medical transportation, I believe the patient could be transported safely back to his home country \u2026 but I am afraid the decision would push him to be in peace, instead of fighting in his homeland. \u201cNow, we all know the patient cannot live without the continuation of ECMO support. His lungs and other organs are in bad condition. But he is still alive. \u201cMany people want to save money for other very poor patients, and they are thinking about ending the treatment. However, I don\u2019t think we should. For me, as a physician, I value any tiny opportunity to save lives. We cannot bargain over lives.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Assuming such things carry on as normal in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, in a few months\u2019 time, denizens of the music industry will be asked to cast their votes for the BBC\u2019s Sound of \u2026 poll and the 2021 Brits rising star award (formerly known as critics\u2019 choice). For new artists, topping these polls is generally assumed to make success a foregone conclusion. But heaping accolades on any artist at the start of their career can have unpredictable effects: just ask Jack Garratt, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/08/jack-garratt-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-bbc-sound-of-2016-poll-winner\">won both polls in 2016</a> \u2013 a feat, as it was customary to point out, that had previously been achieved by Adele, Sam Smith and Ellie Goulding, multi-platinum transatlantic success stories all.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"50f61fc9ce16cce55be14cc6d4e65a7f877ebe18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50f61fc9ce16cce55be14cc6d4e65a7f877ebe18/0_2_655_655/500.jpg\" alt=\"Jack Garratt: Love, Death and Dancing album art work\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jack Garratt: Love, Death and Dancing album art work</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Released in the accompanying publicity blaze, Garratt\u2019s debut album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/21/jack-garratt-phase-review-chemical-the-love-youre-given-dubstep\">Phase</a>, wasn\u2019t bad \u2013 the Buckinghamshire-born songwriter could write bulletproof pop melodies \u2013 but he was audibly still working out who he wanted to be: you could hear both the looming influence of James Blake and that of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/15/ordinary-boys-ed-sheeran-inspired-troubadours-swept-charts\">current crop of earnest acoustic pop singer-songwriters</a>. But a debut album with potential wasn\u2019t good enough in the overheated climate the awards had created. It sold well rather than spectacularly, a state of affairs that somehow meant Garratt\u2019s name became a byword for commercial underachievement within 12 months: \u201cHe must have heard certain people talking about his album and saying that it was a failure,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/feb/02/ragnbone-man-and-ray-blk-2017s-most-hotly-tipped#maincontent\">Rag</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/feb/02/ragnbone-man-and-ray-blk-2017s-most-hotly-tipped#maincontent\">\u2019n\u2019Bone Man said</a>, warily, when it was announced that he had won the 2017 critics\u2019 choice award. \u201cYou sold 60,000 copies of your album, how can that be a failure?\u201d</p> <p>By then, Garratt had vanished from view. The intervening four years have apparently been spent trying to cope with the fallout from his tumultuous 12 months as the next big thing: something that, in Garratt\u2019s telling, he was never comfortable about, but naively found himself swept along with. The lyrics of his recent single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyCffYKtWI8\">Time </a>sounded like a mental note-to-self not to give up: \u201cYou\u2019re overthinking, in a rut and terrified \u2026 but time is on your side.\u201d Virtually the first words you hear on Love, Death and Dancing are: \u201cI\u2019m not the main event, won\u2019t you take me as I am?\u201d After that, there are a lot of references to mental health, medication, visits to the doctor: Get in My Way finds Garratt chewing himself to death over bad reviews and commercial expectations (\u201cyou need the boy with the arena eyes\u201d) while Mara suggests he\u2019s found some kind of peace through Buddhism or meditation.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZC2MHDACXkc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZC2MHDACXkc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Jack Garratt: Better \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s troubled stuff, but in the midst of all this turmoil, Garratt has clearly found time to strip away the more overbearing influences from his music. Instead of trying to distil a mass of currently modish styles into something resembling the flavour of the month, he has devised a take on modern pop idiosyncratic enough to call his own. Under the circumstances, Garratt could be forgiven for coming up with something abstruse and how-do-you-like-me-now? but his melodic instincts are fully intact. While Circles and Mend a Heart come equipped with wildly commercial choruses, sonically, Love, Death and Dancing frequently deals in rough-edged maximalism, where tape hiss coexists with stacked, Queen-esque vocal harmonies and abrasive synth tones. House beats and extravagantly glitching electronics \u2013 the intro of Old Enough keeps cutting out entirely, as if you\u2019re streaming it via a shonky wi-fi connection \u2013 are overlaid with distorted glam guitars or disrupted by rhythmic shifts and sudden bursts of proggy riffing.</p> <p>The effect is striking, paring disconsolate lyrics with fizzily exciting music: there\u2019s something breathless about the number of ideas Better packs into four minutes, without losing its grip on its melody; Anyone starts out as a hazy sliver of Prince-y rock-soul decorated with birdsong, unexpectedly bursts into a high-drama chorus and undergoes an equally unexpected twist in time signature before reaching a chaotic, noisy finale. It\u2019s not all perfect \u2013 presumably in search of an uplifting finale, the album overdoes the gospel-inspired inflections in its final tracks, which is precisely the kind of overfamiliar 2010\u2019s pop trope that the rest goes out of its way to avoid \u2013 but there\u2019s no mistaking a fresh sense of invention and originality about Love, Death and Dancing, a desire to rattle the sonic homogeneity of current pop.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/22/i-hope-we-all-now-realise-how-special-live-music-is-stars-on-pops-future-after-coronavirus\">\u2018Spotify's tip jar is offensive to artists and consumers\u2019: stars on pop\u2019s future after coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It might well work \u2013 Better would cause your head to turn if it cropped up on Radio 1 or amid a Hot Hits playlist \u2013 although you suspect vast commercial success probably isn\u2019t the point this time around. For all its lyrical tales of trauma and disappointment, Love, Death and Dancing sounds like the work of a man who\u2019s had the weight of expectation lifted from his shoulders and felt free to do what he wanted: a stark contrast to its predecessor. In that sense, if no other, the premature awards and their aftermath might be the best thing that could have happened to Jack Garratt.</p> <p>\u2022 Love, Death and Dancing is released on 12 June.</p> <h2>This week Alexis listened to</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://moodymann.bandcamp.com/track/do-wrong\">Moodymann: Do Wrong</a></strong><br>Moodymann\u2019s thus-far <a href=\"https://moodymann.bandcamp.com/album/taken-away-kdj-49\">Bandcamp-only new album</a> is packed with fantastic songs: the sleazy Detroit funk of opener Do Wrong is one highlight among many.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Assuming such things carry on as normal in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, in a few months\u2019 time, denizens of the music industry will be asked to cast their votes for the BBC\u2019s Sound of \u2026 poll and the 2021 Brits rising star award (formerly known as critics\u2019 choice). For new artists, topping these polls is generally assumed to make success a foregone conclusion. But heaping accolades on any artist at the start of their career can have unpredictable effects: just ask Jack Garratt, who won both polls in 2016 \u2013 a feat, as it was customary to point out, that had previously been achieved by Adele, Sam Smith and Ellie Goulding, multi-platinum transatlantic success stories all. Released in the accompanying publicity blaze, Garratt\u2019s debut album, Phase, wasn\u2019t bad \u2013 the Buckinghamshire-born songwriter could write bulletproof pop melodies \u2013 but he was audibly still working out who he wanted to be: you could hear both the looming influence of James Blake and that of the current crop of earnest acoustic pop singer-songwriters. But a debut album with potential wasn\u2019t good enough in the overheated climate the awards had created. It sold well rather than spectacularly, a state of affairs that somehow meant Garratt\u2019s name became a byword for commercial underachievement within 12 months: \u201cHe must have heard certain people talking about his album and saying that it was a failure,\u201d Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone Man said, warily, when it was announced that he had won the 2017 critics\u2019 choice award. \u201cYou sold 60,000 copies of your album, how can that be a failure?\u201d By then, Garratt had vanished from view. The intervening four years have apparently been spent trying to cope with the fallout from his tumultuous 12 months as the next big thing: something that, in Garratt\u2019s telling, he was never comfortable about, but naively found himself swept along with. The lyrics of his recent single Time sounded like a mental note-to-self not to give up: \u201cYou\u2019re overthinking, in a rut and terrified \u2026 but time is on your side.\u201d Virtually the first words you hear on Love, Death and Dancing are: \u201cI\u2019m not the main event, won\u2019t you take me as I am?\u201d After that, there are a lot of references to mental health, medication, visits to the doctor: Get in My Way finds Garratt chewing himself to death over bad reviews and commercial expectations (\u201cyou need the boy with the arena eyes\u201d) while Mara suggests he\u2019s found some kind of peace through Buddhism or meditation. It\u2019s troubled stuff, but in the midst of all this turmoil, Garratt has clearly found time to strip away the more overbearing influences from his music. Instead of trying to distil a mass of currently modish styles into something resembling the flavour of the month, he has devised a take on modern pop idiosyncratic enough to call his own. Under the circumstances, Garratt could be forgiven for coming up with something abstruse and how-do-you-like-me-now? but his melodic instincts are fully intact. While Circles and Mend a Heart come equipped with wildly commercial choruses, sonically, Love, Death and Dancing frequently deals in rough-edged maximalism, where tape hiss coexists with stacked, Queen-esque vocal harmonies and abrasive synth tones. House beats and extravagantly glitching electronics \u2013 the intro of Old Enough keeps cutting out entirely, as if you\u2019re streaming it via a shonky wi-fi connection \u2013 are overlaid with distorted glam guitars or disrupted by rhythmic shifts and sudden bursts of proggy riffing. The effect is striking, paring disconsolate lyrics with fizzily exciting music: there\u2019s something breathless about the number of ideas Better packs into four minutes, without losing its grip on its melody; Anyone starts out as a hazy sliver of Prince-y rock-soul decorated with birdsong, unexpectedly bursts into a high-drama chorus and undergoes an equally unexpected twist in time signature before reaching a chaotic, noisy finale. It\u2019s not all perfect \u2013 presumably in search of an uplifting finale, the album overdoes the gospel-inspired inflections in its final tracks, which is precisely the kind of overfamiliar 2010\u2019s pop trope that the rest goes out of its way to avoid \u2013 but there\u2019s no mistaking a fresh sense of invention and originality about Love, Death and Dancing, a desire to rattle the sonic homogeneity of current pop. It might well work \u2013 Better would cause your head to turn if it cropped up on Radio 1 or amid a Hot Hits playlist \u2013 although you suspect vast commercial success probably isn\u2019t the point this time around. For all its lyrical tales of trauma and disappointment, Love, Death and Dancing sounds like the work of a man who\u2019s had the weight of expectation lifted from his shoulders and felt free to do what he wanted: a stark contrast to its predecessor. In that sense, if no other, the premature awards and their aftermath might be the best thing that could have happened to Jack Garratt. \u2022 Love, Death and Dancing is released on 12 June. This week Alexis listened to Moodymann: Do Wrong Moodymann\u2019s thus-far Bandcamp-only new album is packed with fantastic songs: the sleazy Detroit funk of opener Do Wrong is one highlight among many.",

What was lacking was a profound shock that would make change possible. Now we\u2019ve had one.</p> <p>Governments are creating, borrowing and spending money like never before in peacetime, in an attempt to mitigate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. They have the opportunity to reshape their economies in a way that would be consistent with preventing catastrophic increases in global temperatures. Businesses are already learning lessons from the lockdown, such as that modern technology no longer makes it essential for an executive to travel half way round the world for a business meeting, and that employees can be just as productive working from home as they can when sat in expensive set-piece city centre offices.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/17/labour-to-plan-green-economic-rescue-from-coronavirus-crisis\">Labour to plan green economic rescue from coronavirus crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The world has been here before, though, and there is no guarantee that an opportunity proffered will be an opportunity taken. One was certainly missed at the back end of the 2000s, when the banks nearly went bust. Supporters of a <a href=\"https://greennewdealgroup.org/\">Green New Deal</a>&nbsp;(of whom I was one) said governments should avert the possibility of a second Great Depression by investing in decarbonisation of their economies and programmes that would put people back to work by making their homes energy-efficient.</p> <p>As now, the global economy contracted. As now, this led to a fall in carbon emissions. Yet, there was only a brief flirtation with the idea of a Green New Deal, and the attraction of a return to business as usual proved more powerful. A <a href=\"https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/30797/EGR2019.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y\">1% fall in emissions in 2009 was followed by a </a><a href=\"https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/30797/EGR2019.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y\">near 6%</a> rise in 2010 as conventional stimulus packages kicked in. The banks were bailed out; governments took fright at the size of budget deficits and imposed austerity; nothing really changed.</p> <p>Things look a bit different this time. The UK economy shrank by as much in March \u2013 when there was barely more than a week of lockdown \u2013 as it did in the whole of the 2008-9 recession. April\u2019s number will be a lot worse, and recovery is going to be slow, even assuming there is no second wave of infections.</p> <p>During the financial crisis, the then Labour government took a stake in two of Britain\u2019s high-street banks. This time, a Conservative government has effectively nationalised the railways, announced plans to support strategically important companies, and is paying the wages of more than 10 million workers.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, it has been a case of money is no object. The UK is on course to borrow \u00a3300bn this year at dirt cheap interest rates. The Bank of England is creating money through its quantitative easing programme. The argument that a Green New Deal is unaffordable is still knocking around, but is much less powerful than it was a decade ago. Ministers can decide whether they want to do more than respond to the immediate crisis and they certainly have the power to shape the recovery by making demands of the companies they are supporting, if they choose to use it.</p> <p>Here the picture is mixed. Governments make all the right noises about sustainability, yet many of them have used the crisis as an excuse for relaxing or suspending environmental regulations in order to stimulate activity of any sort. Those who think action of global heating should be a matter for markets not governments see Covid-19 as an opportunity too.</p> <p>The mood has changed, though. The World Economic Forum, the body that organises the annual gathering of the global elite in Davos noted in a recent <a href=\"https://www.zurich.com/en/knowledge/topics/global-risks/covid-19-risks-outlook\">report</a>&nbsp;that carbon emissions were on course to decline by 8% this year, but in order to limit the increase in global temperatures to 1.5C they would have to fall by a similar amount every year for a decade. When the world\u2019s biggest investor, BlackRock, says it will vote<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/27/blackrock-to-flag-climate-concerns-at-exxonmobil-agm\"> against ExxonMobil at its annual meeting</a> because the oil giant is failing to do enough to hit emissions targets, it is clear that global heating has permeated the mainstream.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/may/28/so-much-living-to-do-stories-of-the-uks-coronavirus-victims\">'So much living to do': stories of the UK's coronavirus victims</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But only up to a point. For some, lockdown has provided a glimpse of what a sustainable economy might look like. For others \u2013 those who face losing their jobs in carbon-intensive sectors \u2013 that sort of future doesn\u2019t look so attractive.</p> <p>Politics reflects this tension. If parties of the left sometimes seem less enthusiastic about a GND than they might be, it is because a lot of the people who vote for them like the idea of cheap flights and rely on their old banger to pay visits to their mum. No question, any transition to a greener, more sustainable economy will have to overcome not just active opposition but passive resistance from those who would like life to return to its pre-Covid-19 crisis state.</p> <p>One solution might be to trial in one of the UK\u2019s big cities \u2013 Manchester or Glasgow, say \u2013 to see whether a GND creates jobs, cuts emissions and generates a new wave of profitable environmental innovation. Opponents of change don\u2019t need to do anything; they simply need to wait for inertia to kick in. Those who want a different sort of economy need to start somewhere. And they should start with a simple question: if not now, when?</p> <p>\u2022 Larry Elliott is the Guardian\u2019s economics editor</p>",

They have the opportunity to reshape their economies in a way that would be consistent with preventing catastrophic increases in global temperatures. Businesses are already learning lessons from the lockdown, such as that modern technology no longer makes it essential for an executive to travel half way round the world for a business meeting, and that employees can be just as productive working from home as they can when sat in expensive set-piece city centre offices. The world has been here before, though, and there is no guarantee that an opportunity proffered will be an opportunity taken. One was certainly missed at the back end of the 2000s, when the banks nearly went bust. Supporters of a Green New Deal (of whom I was one) said governments should avert the possibility of a second Great Depression by investing in decarbonisation of their economies and programmes that would put people back to work by making their homes energy-efficient. As now, the global economy contracted. As now, this led to a fall in carbon emissions. Yet, there was only a brief flirtation with the idea of a Green New Deal, and the attraction of a return to business as usual proved more powerful. A 1% fall in emissions in 2009 was followed by a near 6% rise in 2010 as conventional stimulus packages kicked in. The banks were bailed out; governments took fright at the size of budget deficits and imposed austerity; nothing really changed. Things look a bit different this time. The UK economy shrank by as much in March \u2013 when there was barely more than a week of lockdown \u2013 as it did in the whole of the 2008-9 recession. April\u2019s number will be a lot worse, and recovery is going to be slow, even assuming there is no second wave of infections. During the financial crisis, the then Labour government took a stake in two of Britain\u2019s high-street banks. This time, a Conservative government has effectively nationalised the railways, announced plans to support strategically important companies, and is paying the wages of more than 10 million workers. What\u2019s more, it has been a case of money is no object. The UK is on course to borrow \u00a3300bn this year at dirt cheap interest rates. The Bank of England is creating money through its quantitative easing programme. The argument that a Green New Deal is unaffordable is still knocking around, but is much less powerful than it was a decade ago. Ministers can decide whether they want to do more than respond to the immediate crisis and they certainly have the power to shape the recovery by making demands of the companies they are supporting, if they choose to use it. Here the picture is mixed. Governments make all the right noises about sustainability, yet many of them have used the crisis as an excuse for relaxing or suspending environmental regulations in order to stimulate activity of any sort. Those who think action of global heating should be a matter for markets not governments see Covid-19 as an opportunity too. The mood has changed, though. The World Economic Forum, the body that organises the annual gathering of the global elite in Davos noted in a recent report that carbon emissions were on course to decline by 8% this year, but in order to limit the increase in global temperatures to 1.5C they would have to fall by a similar amount every year for a decade. When the world\u2019s biggest investor, BlackRock, says it will vote against ExxonMobil at its annual meeting because the oil giant is failing to do enough to hit emissions targets, it is clear that global heating has permeated the mainstream. But only up to a point. For some, lockdown has provided a glimpse of what a sustainable economy might look like. For others \u2013 those who face losing their jobs in carbon-intensive sectors \u2013 that sort of future doesn\u2019t look so attractive. Politics reflects this tension. If parties of the left sometimes seem less enthusiastic about a GND than they might be, it is because a lot of the people who vote for them like the idea of cheap flights and rely on their old banger to pay visits to their mum. No question, any transition to a greener, more sustainable economy will have to overcome not just active opposition but passive resistance from those who would like life to return to its pre-Covid-19 crisis state. One solution might be to trial in one of the UK\u2019s big cities \u2013 Manchester or Glasgow, say \u2013 to see whether a GND creates jobs, cuts emissions and generates a new wave of profitable environmental innovation. Opponents of change don\u2019t need to do anything; they simply need to wait for inertia to kick in. Those who want a different sort of economy need to start somewhere. And they should start with a simple question: if not now, when? \u2022 Larry Elliott is the Guardian\u2019s economics editor",

How we\u2019ve missed you. In the dark initial days of Covid-19, many feared Australia\u2019s winter codes would be done for 2020. But some old-fashioned bullocking from the NRL saw it return to action first, and tonight\u2019s game between Brisbane and Parramatta was the first step towards completing an unlikely premiership season. </p> <p>And what an advert for the sport it was. The Eels were irrepressible, bossing the Broncos from the first minute to the last in a fine advertisement for their title credentials. They are now unbeaten after three rounds and, revealingly, revelled in the new environs formed by the six-again rule. Parramatta held the ball well, attacked and capitalised when Brisbane made their errors \u2013 and there were plenty of them. </p> <p>On this evidence, the awarding of a fresh set of six tackles for ruck infringements opens the game up and forces it to be played at a greater speed. Inevitably this also leads to a higher incidence of errors, leading to the conclusion there are fewer places to hide for inferior teams. Blowouts could become frequent in this brave new world for rugby league. </p> <p>The move to use just one referee was ridiculed by some but tonight, Gerard Sutton was barely sighted. And that it always a good thing. So while cardboard cutouts and virtual crowd audio was as close as fans got to the live experience, the reboot of the 2020 season should be considered nothing other than resounding success for the NRL. </p> <p>For more of the same, we hope, be sure to return tomorrow night for our liveblog of the Roosters-Rabbitohs clash. Thanks for your company. Footy\u2019s back. How good is that?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"98d62ceddc4836501c72e43a854101f42804c441\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98d62ceddc4836501c72e43a854101f42804c441/0_371_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Suncorp Stadium\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Not a fan in sight, but Parramatta put on a showing worthy of a packed stadium against the Broncos.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darren England/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T12:10:48.348Z\">at 1.10pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ecfa3368f0898700351dd37\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T11:42:15.206Z\">12.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FT: Brisbane 6-34 Parramatta</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Well, it wasn\u2019t the 58-0 flogging of 2019 but the Eels were no less impressive in putting Brisbane away to shoot to the top of the ladder with a 3-0 record.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T11:44:06.584Z\">at 12.44pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ecfa23e8f084e882655a524\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T11:40:34.621Z\">12.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">TRY!

It has been a high-risk gambit. Governments can and will shut the game down the moment there is a health breach. Failure to have the backing of health departments and public officials gives the game zero wiggle room if something goes wrong.

But some old-fashioned bullocking from the NRL saw it return to action first, and tonight\u2019s game between Brisbane and Parramatta was the first step towards completing an unlikely premiership season. And what an advert for the sport it was. The Eels were irrepressible, bossing the Broncos from the first minute to the last in a fine advertisement for their title credentials. They are now unbeaten after three rounds and, revealingly, revelled in the new environs formed by the six-again rule. Parramatta held the ball well, attacked and capitalised when Brisbane made their errors \u2013 and there were plenty of them. On this evidence, the awarding of a fresh set of six tackles for ruck infringements opens the game up and forces it to be played at a greater speed. Inevitably this also leads to a higher incidence of errors, leading to the conclusion there are fewer places to hide for inferior teams. Blowouts could become frequent in this brave new world for rugby league. The move to use just one referee was ridiculed by some but tonight, Gerard Sutton was barely sighted. And that it always a good thing. So while cardboard cutouts and virtual crowd audio was as close as fans got to the live experience, the reboot of the 2020 season should be considered nothing other than resounding success for the NRL. For more of the same, we hope, be sure to return tomorrow night for our liveblog of the Roosters-Rabbitohs clash. Thanks for your company. Footy\u2019s back. How good is that? Well, it wasn\u2019t the 58-0 flogging of 2019 but the Eels were no less impressive in putting Brisbane away to shoot to the top of the ladder with a 3-0 record. The ball is again with Parra and the Broncos can do no more than concede a line dropout from the Eels\u2019 latest attacking play. From the restart Parra thrust forward and this time the Broncos are powerless as Matterson offloads to Blake, who crosses over for an easy try. Put a fork in the Broncos. They\u2019re done. 73 mins: The Eels have really, ahem, taken the crowd out of this game but in fairness to Brisbane they are running out the final minutes strongly. And the crunching tackles are showing no signs of stopping. But tonight they\u2019ve been outclassed by a better team. Here\u2019s that Lane try. Crunch. 66 mins: The Eels are fairly well queuing up to score tries, and now it\u2019s Shaun Lane\u2019s turn to cross that line as he takes the ball five metres out and mows his way through an unfortunate Kotoni Staggs, who tackles but is flattened by the huge Eel\u2019s frame. I wasn\u2019t joking when I said Brodie Croft twice failed the temperature test tonight. It begs the question: how many times can you fail before you are told to go home? 62 mins: Jennings rolls back the years with a sublime solo try from dummy half, sidestepping and feigning all the way to the promised land - and between the posts at that. An easy conversion and the scoreline is now more reflective of this one-sided encounter. Oh, if you were wondering about Alex Glenn\u2019s cut calf, wonder no more. 60 mins: Not a bad set from the Broncos, but Ferguson holds onto a high kick just outside the danger zone to snuff out a rare Broncos forward thrust. 55 mins: Aaaaaaaand, they\u2019ve lost it courtesy of a forward pass. The Broncos just haven\u2019t been able to retain possession tonight. A penalty for obstructing the kick-chase - Oates did a good job at cleaning up Ferguson - then keeps the ball in Parra\u2019s keeping, and the dance goes on. The Broncos hold on again, however, and finally begin their own attacking foray. Brisbane 6-16 Parramatta 51 mins: Another Broncos error gives Parra a set of six 20m out from the Broncos line before an infringement hands them another six. Evans looks set to cross before five, yes, five, Broncos gang tackle him and Brisbane appear to have weathered the storm before a penalty on the final tackle awards the Eels yet another set of six. Somehow, the Broncos stand firm and force the turnover. Incredible defending under heavy pressure. Seems like an eternity since Brisbane have had the ball but now they do. 47 mins: The Eels look likely again but a Moses fumble gives the Broncos some much-needed breathing space. But errors are creeping in everywhere and Brisbane hand the ball straight back to Parra, who then hand it straight back to the Broncos. Yes, the play is faster under the six-again rule but errors look to be increasing, also. 43 mins: Another Hopoate handling error hands Parra a new set of six and the rest was akin to shelling peas for the Eels, Gutherson the one with the ball when it mattered to make it three tries to one. Oddly, Moses misses one of his easier conversion attempts and that\u2019s at least something for the Broncos. 41 mins: And we\u2019re back. Big news out of the break: Broncos skipper Alex Glenn is done for the night after being taken to hospital for treatment on a laceration to his left calf. Apparently Brodie Croft failed the temperature test twice upon arrival at Suncorp today, before making it third time lucky and being passed fit to play. I wonder, were these motley figures tested before they took to their seats? Or doesn\u2019t it matter, given they\u2019re observing requisite social distance? Well, that last Broncos play could, nay should, have squared things up and that would have presented an awry state of affairs at the break. Brisbane do not deserve to be level in this match after 40 minutes and in fact are somewhat lucky to be only six points down. The Eels are on top everywhere: 59-41% in possession, 1,130-779 in metres run, 135-87 in total passes, 12-6 on the scoreboard. The Broncos are finding it hard to get the ball, and then keep it when do. But they\u2019re only six points down. But, the big question needs to be asked: what is going on with the dos on some of these men? 39 mins: An Eels infringement hands the Broncos a fresh set in the dying seconds and Milford puts it on a plate for Boyd with a devilish left-foot kick, only for the recipient to do no receiving at all, fumbling the ball when he should have been pounding it into the Suncorp turf. Might have been 12-12. Games aren\u2019t won on might\u2019ve-beens. 36 mins: The Eels threaten again, tossing the ball around like Western Sydney Globetrotters, but a handling error returns possession to the Broncos. And then just that, a handling error, from Hopoate hands the ball back to Parra. The Eels are on top here and the Broncos are doing themselves no favours. Brisbane 6-12 Parramatta. 32 mins: For a fleeing moment it looks like the Eels have another try, but before Sivo raced over the line and touched down, Gutherson was guilty of a forward pass. Food for thought: in this brave new world of six-again rules and one ref, how about doing away with the forward pass rule? Settle down you lot, I\u2019m kidding. 27 mins: From the ensuing set of six, Sivo finds himself on the receiving end of the final play, a pass from Jennings, before showing wonderful balance and strength to stay just inside the field of play and score the try. A little cruel on the Broncos, who defended stoutly, but it\u2019s now a six-point lead for the Eels following another deft conversion. 25 mins: Back to the game, and it\u2019s still six points each. Arthars is penalised for a knock-on and this, as well as a fresh set of six, has opened the door for the Eels. But the Broncos are defending better now and Hopoate takes the ball dead to snuff out an attacking play. But now comes another one, albeit from much father away than the try line. I was tempted to trot out the hackneyed, \u2018And the crowd goes wild\u2019 line after Croft\u2019s brilliant try. Not just because that\u2019s what tired old sports writers do. It\u2019s because they actually did go wild. Broadcasters are splicing virtual crowd audio amongst the sounds of the game, and I have to say it\u2019s working quite well. I was sceptical, but you can still hear the bumps, crunches and urgings of the players. In the background, however, is the sound of the fan. Hey, if it worked for Seinfeld it can work for the NRL. 17 mins: Brodie Croft has been influential already and now he\u2019s taken it upon himself, going on a 40m run for a superb solo try. Where some halves might\u2019ve looked to pass, he spotted some turf and turned on the burners. Great vision, great speed, great try. And a sweet conversion from Isaako from an acute angle. 15 mins: Parra commit their first ruck infringement and now the Broncos get a fresh set of six. We\u2019re only 15 minutes in, but this rule has opened the game up and made it played at a far greater pace. It\u2019s frenetic. And it\u2019s leading to more errors seemingly. The eels look like they\u2019re away but Sivo tosses it straight into the arms of Arthars. Right to him. Brisbane 0-6 Parramatta. 12 mins: It should be one try apiece but the Eels slip the noose as Croft throws a dummy pass before dribbling the ball into the path of Milford, who only has to stay on his feet to claim the ball and score the try. But he slips on the Suncorp turf and the score remains 6-0 to the Eels. 11 mins: Arthars and Hopoate team up on Sivo and force the ball free. The Broncos gain possession from the ensuing scrum in their best moment of the game. 9 mins: Brisbane are trying to muscle their way back into the match, Staggs dropping Gutherson with a big tackle and letting him know about it. But The Eels are winning the territory battle. And so far, the game. 7 mins: The Eels have started the match much the better. They trap the Broncos in their own zone, win the ball back and still Brisbane have just the one set to their name. Can\u2019t get their hands on the ball yet. 3 mins: A pair of ruck infringements award the Eels two fresh sets of tackles and the sheer force of momentum has the Broncos buckling under the pressure. Marata Niukore is nimble on his feet, sidesteps a potential suitor before crossing the line and just retaining downward force on the ball. First blood to Parra. 2 mins: Both teams complete their opening sets but the Eels do so more convincingly, with the Broncos gaining just 20m for their six tackles. And we are away!!!!!!!!!! Ferguson wears the second tackle for the Eels and live sport is back in this country. Can the Broncos pull off a 59-point form, reversal and win this match? You know what I mean, last year\u2019s 58-0 drubbing plus one point to triumph? Yes they can, I hear you say, but will they? Yes, I think they will. There you go. The Eels are morals now. When I said two minutes, I forgot this is the NRL. They love being fashionably late. You\u2019ll see it when you\u2019re lookin\u2019 at it. Should be soon. I hope. In the meantime, I think we can all identify with this hound. Two minutes to go. Feels kinda good saying that. I think now is an appropriate time for us all to spare a thought for Gerard Sutton. He\u2019s tonight\u2019s ref. Note the singular. Good luck, Gezza. Billy Slater was asked tonight which sort of teams would be most suited by the NRL\u2019s new six-again rule. \u201cThe team that holds the ball,\u201d responded The Kid. Simple game innit, rugba league. Though he does have a point outside the bleeding obvious: the more you have the nut, the more they have to chase and the wearier they get. And if any team is underdone fitness-wise after this unique preparation, the resetting of six tackles will likely expose that. I reckon this bloke will be watching tonight\u2019s game. Gallons on water, much of it muddied by the filth of Covid-19, have passed under the bridge since these teams last met, so forgive me for not recalling the match, the result or possessing the cognisance it in fact ever took place. Oh hang on, it\u2019s coming back to me now. If I\u2019d read Larissa O\u2019Connor\u2019s fabulous overview of what has taken place in the 67 days since round two ended before writing what I\u2019ve just written, I wouldn\u2019t have bothered writing what I\u2019ve just written. Because she\u2019s said it all. Go on, have a read. You won\u2019t regret it. My takeouts: 1. Brodie Croft v Mitch Moses will go a way to determining the result of this match; 2. The Eels would prefer it if Nathan Brown was out there; 3. Clint Gutherson. Show us what you\u2019ve got. 4. Reed Mahoney is a freak of nature. Break your foot in round two, butter up for round three. Hard as nails. Thanks Mike. Haven\u2019t seen a countdown like that since Molly Meldrum was doing us all a favour. Lovely stuff. And a big welcome to all patronising this liveblog. Yes, L-I-V-E-blog. Its animation is down to one incredible, irrefutable fact: footy\u2019s baaaaaack! Like a Hugh Hefner party, Peter V\u2019landys has his knockers but tonight he is feted in near-deity terms as the saviour of rugba league. If being the first sport in Australia to resume competition was ever a race, the NRL has won it. Bulldozing its way through the Covid-19 red tape to arrive at this point might not have been to everyone\u2019s taste, but tonight isn\u2019t about the rights, wrongs or hypothetical rhetoric. Time will have its say on these matters. Tonight is about sport, glorious sport. So let\u2019s just enjoy that. The game is on. And with that, it\u2019s time for me to leave you in the capable hands of my colleague, Scott Heinrich, who will take you through the actual footy, which is why we\u2019re all here, after all. Not long to wait. Bye for now. Some pre-match drama to report: Brodie Croft, the young Brisbane halfback, failed two temperature checks on his way into the stadium. He was put in a holding room, waited for 15 minutes and was then reassessed, according to Corey Parker, the former Broncos player, who is talking on Fox Sports. Croft is good to go now though, but it\u2019s a stark reminder of what rugby league \u2013 and all sport, for that matter \u2013 now looks like in this Covid-era. 30 MINUTES TO GO! We\u2019re approaching kick-off. Excitement is building. A video montage with inspirational music has been played on Fox (\u201cIt\u2019s time to get this party restarted\u201d etc etc). And someone\u2019s put a surgical mask on the Wally Lewis statue outside the stadium. Here\u2019s what it looks like inside: Breaking news: With less than an hour to go before kick-off, the Australian Rugby League Commission, Foxtel and Nine Entertainment Co have agreed to a broadcast partnership, with Fox extending its deal by five years until 2027. The financial details of the deal, the NRL said, will remain commercial in confidence. A league statement said the deals would provide certainty with both broadcasters recommitted to the current rights period until the end of 2022; Foxtel has extended its partnership for a further five years until the end of 2027. \u201cI am delighted to have worked with our long-standing partners Foxtel and Nine to reshape and resume the 2020 NRL Telstra Premiership. It is significant that on one of the most important days in our game\u2019s history, we have finalised the deals to ensure its future,\u201d ALRC chair Peter V\u2019landys said. \u201cOur negotiations were tough but always in a spirit of goodwill and shared ambitions for the betterment of rugby league. We could not have reached our 28 May restart ambitions without the teamwork and collaboration of our partners. \u201cThese deals provide certainty to ensure our 16 clubs remain strong and that we can continue to invest in grassroots rugby league across our communities.\u201d For the resumed 2020 season: Foxtel will continue to show all eight games every round - including five exclusive telecasts each weekend; Nine will continue to televise three weekly NRL matches - Thursday and Friday nights, plus Sunday afternoon; Nine will provide exclusive coverage of the October 25 grand final; Nine will continue its exclusive coverage of the three State of Origin matches, to be held this year over three weeks on November 4, 11 and 18. ONE HOUR TO GO! If this was Lego Masters or some other reality TV show, we\u2019d be treated to a panic-inducing siren and flashing red lights at this stage. But it isn\u2019t, it\u2019s not even NRL Island (sadly), so we\u2019ll have to make do with caps and bold. Anyway, with so few major sports leagues around the world up and running, the return of the NRL presents itself as something of an opportunity to showcase the league\u2019s wares to the world. The NRL has made clear it senses this, and has been tweeting to the US (\u201cYo America, we have LIVE sport for you\u201d) with suggested teams for NFL fans to support, the UK and Ireland, Canada and pretty much anyone else who\u2019ll listen. It makes sense though. With so little live sport, competitions are getting coverage previously unheard of and reaching places they might not in more normal times. I can\u2019t remember, for example, the last time the Guardian liveblogged a K-League match before the other week. Meanwhile, here\u2019s the scene at an eerily quiet Suncorp: ONE AND A HALF HOURS TO GO! To the football, and there would be plenty to capture the imagination about this clash, even if it wasn\u2019t the first live rugby league we\u2019ve been able to watch for 10 weeks. Last year\u2019s 58-0 finals drubbing at the hands of the Eels should already have done Anthony Seibold\u2019s team talk for him; the coach said earlier this week they haven\u2019t spoken about that game in the build up to tonight, but Corey Oates admitted the defeat was very much in the players\u2019 minds. \u201cWe feel physically we have grown a fair bit [since],\u201d Seibold said. \u201cIf there was any redemption or talk around whether we have become a better team I think that was put to bed with some pretty tough games against the Cowboys and South Sydney.\u201d Those wins in the opening two rounds of the season, pre-shutdown, have given the Broncos a perfect start, but equally, if not more perfect are the Eels, who top the table after winning their own two games, the second a 46-6 thumping of the Titans in the last game before the break. The question is: is a form team in March a form team in May? We simply don\u2019t know just yet, and given the length of the break, and the short lead in time to round three, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess. And there are question marks around fitness, as well as form \u2013 it\u2019ll be interesting to see how players go around the hour mark. All will be revealed soon enough. In the meantime... only six? TWO HOURS TO GO! The Danes aren\u2019t the only ones pulling out all the stops in a bid to create an atmosphere in stadiums devoid of actual fans. In Japan, a similar-sounding remote cheering app has been tested at two of the nation\u2019s top football clubs. As Justin McCurry reports from Tokyo: \u201cThe Remote Cheerer system developed by the Japanese firm Yamaha allows fans following the match on TV, the radio or online to encourage \u2013 or berate \u2013 players via their smartphones, their voices reverberating around the stadium in realtime via loudspeakers. In a recent field test, users in multiple remote locations chose from a range of on-screen options that sent their cheers, applause, chants and boos into the 50,000-seat Shizuoka Stadium Ecopa via 58 speakers set up among the empty seats. The app does not, as yet, allow fans to question the referee\u2019s eyesight, or the eating habits of players who struggled to stay match-fit during the league\u2019s virus-enforced break.\u201d Less technological but none the less innovative has been the NRL\u2019s own attempt to give off the impression a stadium is full, with fans able to buy $22 cardboard cutouts of themselves, which would be placed in the stands. In an idea borrowed from the Bundesliga, fans can upload a headshot to a website; it would then be printed out and put in a seat where it would remain for seven weeks. The concept will be trialled tomorrow and Saturday at Bankwest and Central Coast stadiums and if a success will be heavily promoted before next week\u2019s round four. It seems like a great idea; but presumably that\u2019s also what K-League club FC Seoul thought when they decided to populate the stands with plastic dolls the other week. It\u2019s a question that has been often asked over the past weeks, but what could possibly go wrong? TWO AND A HALF HOURS TO GO! To underline the point that it will be an altogether different experience once the NRL resumes, Nine\u2019s World Wide of Sport reports Broncos fans not allowed in the stadium will tonight still be able to watch the game with likeminded Queenslanders \u2013 just at a temporary drive-through movie theatre. It\u2019s not exactly a pub, but at least there\u2019s a chance of creating an atmosphere of some kind in front of the giant screen, which has been erected 15 minutes from Brisbane\u2019s CBD. Need any added incentive to head out there? Sam Thaiday will be there too, apparently. Meanwhile, in Denmark, where top flight football will also recommence on Thursday night, a giant screen \u2013 40 metres long and 3m high \u2013 in front of one stand will be filled with fans watching via video link. Supporters have signed up for free tickets to take part and can even choose their preferred section of the \u201cvirtual stand\u201d. More here: THREE HOURS TO GO! Tik-Tok and Instagram have played their part in the build-up to tonight. Indeed, social media could have brought the whole thing crashing down before it even restarted, thanks to some ill-advised photos and videos featuring Latrell Mitchell and Josh Addo Carr on a camping retreat in NSW and the now infamous video of Nathan Cleary at his home with several visitors \u2013 socially distant it was not. That all came at a time when the NRL was trying to convince the authorities and the general public its players were fine upstanding citizens who could be relied upon to follow simple orders and keep themselves in check should the league be given the green light to resume. It wasn\u2019t always star players with too much spare time on their hands getting up to no good, though. There was a time when the game of rugby league produced players like Olsen Filipaina \u2013 garbage collector by day, rugby league player by night. And a man who famously tamed one of Australia\u2019s best ever. They don\u2019t make them like Olsen anymore. A new book has chronicled his life; you can read an extract about a Test match New Zealand played against Australia in 1985 here: THREE AND A HALF HOURS TO GO! Once the teams run out to an empty Suncorp Stadium tonight, we\u2019ll witness an NRL game, but it won\u2019t entirely be as we knew it in the pre-Covid era. The impact of the coronavirus has been far-reaching, not only forcing a 10-week suspension, but also acting as the first domino to fall and spark a sequence of events that has resulted in a fundamental change in how the game is run. So instead of two referees officiating tonight\u2019s game, there will be just one. We\u2019ll have to wait and see how that pans out, but this is the NRL and even more so than usual, the spotlight will be firmly on Gerard Sutton, all alone out there in the middle. To note: Belinda Sharpe, who made history as the first woman to referee an NRL game in July, has been relegated to the touchlines and will be joined by fellow touchie Phil Henderson there. There is also the small matter of a rule change: the six-again rule will be employed for the first time as of tonight, with six additional tackles awarded for ruck infringements \u2013 an attempt to speed up the game. It has only ever been trialled once before \u2013 in an Indigenous All-Stars game in 2012 \u2013 and quite who the rule stands to benefit has been the subject of much debate in recent weeks. Another one to watch. As Larissa O\u2019Connor wrote today: \u201cTeams would be well advised to watch the early games this round to gauge how the rule will be enforced, how it may open up attacking opportunities and to what extend it could wear down defending sides, particularly in the latter stages of a game.\u201d Read more on that here: FOUR HOURS TO GO! Strong words from V\u2019landys, but hardly surprising given the stance he has taken in his quest to get the ball rolling again. Yet, as Nick Tedeschi wrote on these pages earlier this week, \u201cFor good or ill, V\u2019landys has bulldozed a path for the game\u2019s return and to label him one of the most omnipotent figures in Australia is not hyperbole. He has defied the prime minister and state premiers, taken the fight to broadcasters and unions, unilaterally changed the laws of the game and obliterated rivals along the way.\u201d Nick goes on: \u201cV\u2019landys was twice chastised by Scott Morrison for declaring the Warriors would be given a travel exemption, yet they set up camp in Tamworth and will play on Saturday. It has been a high-risk gambit. Governments can and will shut the game down the moment there is a health breach. Failure to have the backing of health departments and public officials gives the game zero wiggle room if something goes wrong. A thirst for brinksmanship and risk has its downside and his making, of course, could yet be his breaking.\u201d Read the full article: FOUR AND A HALF HOURS TO GO! Where to begin? Honestly, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s been an, um, eventful couple of months. How about the latest on the NRL\u2019s idea to get fans back into stadiums by 1 July, a plan that has already been dismissed by the Australian Medical Association president (\u201cabsurd and dangerous\u201d) and treated with caution by state governments (\u201cnot on the list yet\u201d). NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian, who said on Monday \u201ccertainly we\u2019re not in that space yet\u201d, has doubled down on that view today. \u201cA lot of people are looking forward [to NRL being back on TV]. I\u2019m glad it gives some normality back to NSW,\u201d she said. \u201c[But] I can\u2019t see [crowds returning] by that date.\u201d Not that the opinion of a state premier is likely to deter Peter V\u2019landys, the ARLC chairman. He reckons he knows best and is adamant a crowd should be allowed back into stadiums \u2013 not just by 1 July either. \u201cThere should be [fans allowed at tonight\u2019s game]. I see no reason why there can\u2019t be,\u201d V\u2019landys said on 2GB. \u201cAnd you have to base it on data, not emotional scare-mongering cliches. That\u2019s what they do. They bring up these cliches that put fear into people. \u201cThey\u2019ve got no data to show. The infection rate is less than half a per cent \u2013 how low do we need to get it? I just can\u2019t believe what we\u2019re going through at the moment because our infection rate is less than half a per cent and has been for 40 or 50 days. \u201cWhen we stopped playing the game it was 25.5%. There\u2019s a level of risk in anything you do in life. What we have to be doing is assessing the risk and acting accordingly, rather than having this overall blanket policy that is stifling everyone.\u201d Wow. But there won\u2019t be fans tonight, because health experts have ruled it\u2019s not safe. And even if they were allowed into Suncorp, would it really be worth it? Megan Maurice asked that very question yesterday. Sport! Real, actual, professional live sport! It\u2019s been what seems like an age since Australians last had the chance to watch a sporting event, but here we are, finally, with the NRL \u2013 trailblazers in their own way \u2013 on the cusp of becoming the first major league in the country to get back down to business on a pitch. It\u2019s been exactly 67 days since the referee\u2019s whistle brought an end to the NRL as we knew it, back on 22 March, before the Covid-19 pandemic brought the league \u2013 and all sport around the globe, with a few notable exceptions (hello Belarus!) \u2013 to a shuddering halt. Sixty-seven days of initial uncertainty, which gradually gave way to optimism and finally, a date of 28 May set in stone as the day the NRL would resume. That, of course, massively simplifies the process the league has gone through to get to this point \u2013 the ups and downs, the barriers hurdled or simply ran around, the bonkers plans that never got off the ground (RIP NRL Island) \u2013 but more on all that to come as we count down to kick-off at Suncorp Stadium. Brisbane and Parramatta \u2013 the latter who were involved in that final, pre-shutdown game \u2013 have the honour of getting things back up and running tonight and, regardless of the significance of the event in its broader context, it should be a belter of a match. Stick with is throughout the afternoon. Send an email if you wish (mike.hytner@theguardian.com) or tweet @mike_hytner if that\u2019s more your thing. To say there are plenty of discussion points is an understatement. It\u2019s *checks clock* exactly 2:52pm AEST, and that means there are... FIVE HOURS TO GO!",

Figures from the Department of Labor earlier this month showed the leisure and hospitality industry was the hardest-hit, with 4.8 million jobs lost \u2013 nearly a 40% unemployment rate \u2013 as traveling came to a halt with shutdown measures.

      "bodyText": "The number of Americans who have lost their jobs in the past 10 weeks soared to more than 40 million as the number of unemployment claims continued to rise with 2.1 million people filing for unemployment last week. The staggering job losses mark a grim milestone in the economic crisis that has gripped the US since the coronavirus triggered widespread shutdowns and stay-at-home orders in an effort to halt the spread of the deadly pandemic. The latest figures from the Department of Labor show that the rate of new unemployment claims has continued to fall over the last few weeks, down from its peak in early April, when 6.6 million Americans filed for unemployment in a single week. Earlier this month, the department reported that more than 20 million Americans lost their jobs in April, bringing the unemployment rate to 14.7%, up from 4.4% in March. While the growth of unemployment claims has slowed, millions more have continued to file for unemployment each week, bringing the total number of unemployed to a disastrous rate not seen since the Great Depression. Job losses have hit virtually every industry, though some harder than others. Figures from the Department of Labor earlier this month showed the leisure and hospitality industry was the hardest-hit, with 4.8 million jobs lost \u2013 nearly a 40% unemployment rate \u2013 as traveling came to a halt with shutdown measures. Millions of education and health services, retail and manufacturing jobs were also cut. Even months after shutdown orders were put in place, the reported unemployment figures may not show a complete picture of how many people were laid off due to the crisis. Many states are still trying to work through backlogs of thousands of applications as antiquated online systems struggle to keep up with the number of applicants.

      "body": "<p>The weather is getting warmer, businesses across the US are reopening, and many people who have stayed home for nearly two months are anxious to resume some of their routines. Yet the pandemic is far from over, and in many states Covid-19 cases are growing. It\u2019s still safest to stay home, experts say, but if you must see others, they have one word for you: outside.</p> <p><strong>What are the benefits of getting outdoors during the pandemic?</strong></p> <p><strong>Gregory Poland: </strong>There\u2019s nothing in any context in any place that is risk free. All we can do is mitigate or reduce risk. But outdoors, you have greater [circulation] and the ability to have greater [social] distance.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Barun Mathema: </strong>It has to do with the volume of air. Compare a park to a restaurant in New York: typically a small space, where concentrations [of virus] can get quite high if you have a few people who are infected. Outdoors, it\u2019s harder for virus to become concentrated.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/08/coronavirus-face-mask-exercise-outside\">Should I wear a mask when I'm exercising outside?</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>What are some outdoor summer activities that can be done safely with others?</strong></p> <p><strong>Julia Marcus: </strong>Walking, running, and biking together are all relatively low risk activities when meeting up with people outside. For any outdoor activities or gatherings this summer, including swimming, sports, or picnics, there are a few important ways to reduce risk, including maintaining at least six feet of distance, wearing masks, keeping interactions short, and not sharing food or drinks.</p> <p><strong>Mathema: </strong>Context is everything. Everyone wants to go to the beach. The beach isn\u2019t a problem. It\u2019s what you do at the beach. You\u2019re more social, tend to interact. Certain norms we\u2019re trying to abide by are going to slide.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Poland: </strong>Want to go for a walk in, say, Brooklyn? Wear a mask. You can go out for a bike ride on Long Island, and you probably don\u2019t need a mask because it won\u2019t be that crowded. Under no circumstances should you go down to Hell\u2019s Kitchen to the bars. Large church gatherings? Those are high risk.&nbsp;</p> <p>Going for a picnic with a friend who\u2019s as careful as you maintaining social distancing \u2013 and not hugging, kissing, touching \u2013 I think you can safely do that. Riding the subway? Probably not. Taking an Uber? Wear a mask and disinfect anything you touch before clicking your seatbelt and touching the door handle.</p> <p><strong>Is it safe to go to a friend\u2019s house if you stay outside?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>Jarone Lee:</strong> I think in many ways that\u2019s better than going into a public area. You just have to remember that you still need to do all the precautions and wear your mask and stay socially distant.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Is it okay to use a friend\u2019s bathroom?</strong></p> <p><strong>Jarone:</strong> I think it\u2019s okay. Be sure to wash your hands. It might be a good idea to have one designated guest bathroom if you\u2019re able to do that.</p> <p><strong>Poland: </strong>We had two couples over last weekend. We said, \u201cGo to the bathroom before you come, we\u2019re not going to serve any food. Bring your own lawn chairs.\u201d We sat, probably, 12 \u2013 15 feet apart on the driveway.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>What are the risks of weekend travel?</strong></p> <p><strong>Marcus: </strong>Driving somewhere is going to be lower risk than flying. We know that the virus can remain on surfaces, but [its potency] decreases rapidly over time. If you rent an Airbnb, by the time you\u2019re there, it\u2019s very, very unlikely that there\u2019s any viable virus on any surfaces. Consider all the places you might go in your travels, including restaurants. That\u2019s where you\u2019ll need to navigate risk.</p> <p><strong>Is it safe to go for a walk with a friend?</strong></p> <p><strong>Marcus: </strong>Going for a walk with a friend is a fairly low-risk activity\u2013again, not zero risk. From what we know, you need prolonged, fairly close contact in order for transmission to happen. And if you\u2019re just walking near somebody outdoors, it seems unlikely that transmission will occur.</p> <p><strong>Mathema: </strong>The risk of contracting coronavirus is not very high in an absolute sense, but when you\u2019re talking at the population level, that\u2019s when the problem comes about. Say doing that gives you a 3% risk of getting sick. But if everyone like you did this, a lot of people would get very ill. Even if it\u2019s 2% of the population, that\u2019s 2% too many.</p> <p><strong>What do you say to parents of children who are desperate for a playmate?</strong></p> <p><strong>Marcus: </strong>There are a couple ways that people are thinking about this now: <em>do I extend my bubble to include another family?</em> Trust and understanding where the other family\u2019s risk is and making sure to communicate about any potential exposures is important. The risk is going to be different if one of the families has, say, a frontline worker.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Can grandparents see their grandchildren yet?</strong></p> <p><strong>Poland: </strong>No, no, no. Unless you\u2019re willing to, say, drive to go see grandma and grandpa, and stand 12 feet away. There\u2019s not going to be any hugging or kissing.</p> <p><strong>Mathema: </strong>It\u2019s a heartbreaking question. I would err on the side of caution.</p> <p><strong>Are there concerns about this more nuanced guidance leading to less vigilance?</strong></p> <p><strong>Marcus: </strong>This concern is often brought up around harm reduction. In HIV prevention, people often worry that if we offer HIV prevention tools, like pre-exposure prophylaxis [also known as PrEP], people will compensate by increasing their risky behavior. It\u2019s generally unfounded.</p> <p>Not taking a harm-reduction approach is simply denial, and it will inevitably backfire.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Experts:</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Julia Marcus, </strong>infectious disease epidemiologist and assistant professor in the Department of Population Medicine at Harvard medical school.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Gregory Poland</strong>, vaccine expert and internal medicine physician at the Mayo Clinic.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Barun Mathema, </strong>assistant professor of epidemiology at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Jarone Lee</strong>, medical director, Blake 12 Intensive Care Unit, Massachusetts general hospital and associate professor, Harvard Medical School.</p></li> </ul>",

I would err on the side of caution. Are there concerns about this more nuanced guidance leading to less vigilance? Marcus: This concern is often brought up around harm reduction. In HIV prevention, people often worry that if we offer HIV prevention tools, like pre-exposure prophylaxis [also known as PrEP], people will compensate by increasing their risky behavior. It\u2019s generally unfounded. Not taking a harm-reduction approach is simply denial, and it will inevitably backfire. Experts: Julia Marcus, infectious disease epidemiologist and assistant professor in the Department of Population Medicine at Harvard medical school. Gregory Poland, vaccine expert and internal medicine physician at the Mayo Clinic. Barun Mathema, assistant professor of epidemiology at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health. Jarone Lee, medical director, Blake 12 Intensive Care Unit, Massachusetts general hospital and associate professor, Harvard Medical School.",

The national unemployment rate: 14.7%</h2> <p>The Department of Labor releases the latest national unemployment rate at the beginning of each month. In the figures for April, which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/08/april-jobs-report-us-unemployment-rate\">released</a> earlier in May, the rate was 14.7%, up from 4.4% in March. While many states have begun gradual reopening processes, the figure only represents those whose claims were filed up until mid-April. Millions more have filed claims since then, though we will not know how that has affected the unemployment rate until May\u2019s figures are released in early June.</p> <h2>2. The black and Hispanic unemployment rates: 16.7% and 18.9% </h2> <p>Economists have long known that black and Hispanic Americans are the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/28/african-americans-unemployment-covid-19-economic-impact\">most vulnerable</a> during economic recessions, and while many workers of color are in essential jobs, the Covid-19 economic crisis has proved <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.a.htm\">no different</a>. Even at its lowest, the black unemployment rate is typically double that of white unemployment, with Hispanic unemployment not too far behind. Experts say job segregation pushes black and Hispanic workers into low-paying industries, like hospitality, that come with little to no benefits and have been hit hardest.</p> <h2>3. Percentage of unemployed Americans who are women: 55%</h2> <p>Though women make up a smaller percentage of the working population, a slight majority of people who were laid off in the last few months are women. At the beginning of May, the Department of Labor <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t01.htm\">reported</a> nearly 11.5 million women had lost jobs, compared with about 11 million men. This is no coincidence given that the industries that have been hardest-hit by shutdown orders, hospitality and leisure, education and healthcare, employ more women than others.</p> <h2>4. The leisure and hospitality unemployment rate: 39.8%</h2> <p>Last month\u2019s Department of Labor figures confirmed that the leisure and hospitality industry has been the<a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t14.htm\"> hardest-hit </a>by the economic downturn. About 4.8 million workers, the highest of any industry have lost their jobs in the industry.</p> <h2>5. State with the highest unemployment rate: Nevada</h2> <p>Nevada\u2019s unemployment rate is the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/web/laus/laumstrk.htm\">highest</a> of any state at 28.2%, meaning one in four people in the state of 3 million was unemployed in April. Nevada\u2019s economy relies heavily on tourism, which brought in <a href=\"https://www.casino.org/news/nevada-tourism-industry-delivers-state-67-6b-economic-impact/\">$67.6</a><a href=\"https://www.casino.org/news/nevada-tourism-industry-delivers-state-67-6b-economic-impact/\">bn</a> in 2018. Michigan and Hawaii had the second and third highest rates with 22.7% and 22.3% unemployment, respectively.</p> <h2>6. Average unemployment insurance benefit amount: about $980</h2> <p>Pre-pandemic, the average unemployment insurance <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/09/how-much-unemployment-will-i-get-that-depends-on-your-state.html\">check</a> was about $380. But because each state is in charge of its own unemployment system, and sets the amount that is given in unemployment insurance, it varies widely. Some states give about a fifth of a person\u2019s paycheck while others give half or more. To compensate for the widespread differences, those who successfully file for unemployment are given an extra $600 a week through the end of July with money Congress set aside in its massive coronavirus stimulus package in March. While this means some are still barely making ends meet, others are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/25/unemployment-benefits-600-renewal-republicans\">getting more</a> than they were getting in the jobs they were laid off from.</p> <h2>7. Highest number of unemployment claims in one week: 6.6m</h2> <p>Between 29 March and 4 April, 6.6 million Americans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/09/us-unemployment-filings-coronavirus\">filed</a> for unemployment, a staggering number that signaled the true depths of the economic crisis.</p> <h2>8. Number of households deemed food insecure: 1 in 5</h2> <p>An <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/05/06/the-covid-19-crisis-has-already-left-too-many-children-hungry-in-america/\">analysis</a> by the Brookings Institution found one in five households in the US were deemed food insecure by the end of April. Food banks have seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/17/us-food-banks-over-budget-demand-coronavirus\">shortages</a> in light of increased demand as millions of families struggle to pay for groceries. The analysis found the situation is worse for families with children: two in five households with mothers and children under the age of 12 are food insecure.</p> <h2>9. Number of gig workers unemployed: more than 6.1m</h2> <p>In its latest stimulus package, Congress included a federal <a href=\"https://edd.ca.gov/about_edd/coronavirus-2019/pandemic-unemployment-assistance.htm\">program</a> that allows self-employed workers and contractors to receive unemployment benefits. In its <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf\">unemployment report</a> last week, the Department of Labor said that 6.1 million Americans who classify as self-employed were receiving unemployment insurance. </p> <h2>10. Percentage of low-wage workers unemployed: 40%</h2> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200513a.htm\">remarks</a> given on 13 May, the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, delivered a shocking statistic from a Fed survey: 40% of households making under $40,000 a year lost a job in March. \u201cThis reversal of economic fortune has caused a level of pain that is hard to capture in words,\u201d Powell said.</p>",

The illustration shows Trump with supporters in Maga hats, serving them a drink that has been labeled \u201cKool-Aid\u201d, then \u201cChloroquine\u201d and finally \u201cClorox\u201d, a US bleach brand. The cartoon is a reference to the 1978 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/17/an-apocalyptic-cult-900-dead-remembering-the-jonestown-massacre-40-years-on\">Jonestown massacre</a>, where more than 900 people died after drinking cyanide-laced punch at the order of cult leader Jim Jones, and to Trump\u2019s widely denounced idea of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/24/trump-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus-claims-reaction\">injecting bleach to </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/24/trump-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus-claims-reaction\">protect against </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/24/trump-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus-claims-reaction\"> coronavirus</a>.

If it happened to me so quickly, it likely has happened to others. How much other content has been removed this way on Redbubble and other sites?\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cIt must be pointed out: the president of the United States is a hypocrite who complains about the \u2018violation\u2019 of his free speech on Twitter, then tries to actively suppress the free speech of others. These are actions of an adolescent wannabe-authoritarian.\u201d</p> <p>Trump criticised Twitter this week for \u201ccompletely stifling FREE SPEECH\u201d, after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/27/trump-twitter-social-media-threat-conservatives\">social media platform put a warning label</a> on two of his tweets <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1265255835124539392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1265255845358645254%7Ctwgr%5E&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2020%2Fmay%2F26%2Ftrump-twitter-fact-check-warning-label\">spreading lies about mail-in voting</a>.</p> <p>CBLDF executive director Charles Brownstein said the organisation was \u201csensitive to the issues companies like Redbubble face in balancing competing rights owner issues, and were alarmed to see the president\u2019s re-election campaign exploiting those issues to suppress protected speech\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re pleased that Redbubble has done the right thing in this case,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope that they will continue to assert the First Amendment rights they and their sellers are guaranteed by rejecting any similar censorship attempts.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Pulitzer-winning cartoonist Nick Anderson has described Donald Trump as an \u201cadolescent wannabe authoritarian\u201d, after the US president\u2019s re-election campaign failed to pull one of Anderson\u2019s cartoons mocking Trump\u2019s inaccurate suggestion that injecting disinfectant could protect against Covid-19. Anderson put his cartoon The Trump Cult up for sale on the online retailer Redbubble this month. The illustration shows Trump with supporters in Maga hats, serving them a drink that has been labeled \u201cKool-Aid\u201d, then \u201cChloroquine\u201d and finally \u201cClorox\u201d, a US bleach brand. The cartoon is a reference to the 1978 Jonestown massacre, where more than 900 people died after drinking cyanide-laced punch at the order of cult leader Jim Jones, and to Trump\u2019s widely denounced idea of injecting bleach to protect against coronavirus. Trump has also been taking the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a protection against Covid-19, despite a study showing it has been linked to increased deaths in patients. But Redbubble pulled Anderson\u2019s illustration from sale following a trademark infringement claim made by Trump\u2019s campaign organisation, Donald J Trump for President Inc. Writing on the Daily Kos, Anderson said that he believed the claim was made due to his depiction of Maga hats, and described the situation as \u201cabsurd\u201d. \u201cWe live in a strange time when the #POTUS can falsely accuse someone of murder with impunity (violating @Twitter\u2019s terms of service), while at the same time bully a private business into removing content it doesn\u2019t like,\u201d Anderson added on Twitter. The Comic Book Legal Defense Fund (CBLDF) and other free speech organisations subsequently got involved, sending a group letter to Redbubble that accused Trump\u2019s campaign of having \u201cmisused Redbubble\u2019s reporting mechanism to suppress protected political expression in the form of parody, critique, and satire\u201d, and arguing that the work and those who publish it are protected by the first amendment. Redbubble reinstated Anderson\u2019s cartoon this week, saying that it strives \u201cto respect IP rights and freedom of speech, but we sometimes make mistakes, as we did here \u2026 We\u2019re sorry for any inconvenience this has caused.\u201d In a statement, Anderson praised Redbubble for recognising the error, but said there were some \u201ctroubling issues\u201d raised by the affair, including that the cartoon was removed less than 24 hours after he posted it, before he had received a single order. \u201cI doubt anyone had even seen it yet on the site,\u201d he said. \u201cThis reveals that the Trump campaign has a system in place, trawling for material they find objectionable. If it happened to me so quickly, it likely has happened to others. How much other content has been removed this way on Redbubble and other sites?\u201d He added: \u201cIt must be pointed out: the president of the United States is a hypocrite who complains about the \u2018violation\u2019 of his free speech on Twitter, then tries to actively suppress the free speech of others. These are actions of an adolescent wannabe-authoritarian.\u201d Trump criticised Twitter this week for \u201ccompletely stifling FREE SPEECH\u201d, after the social media platform put a warning label on two of his tweets spreading lies about mail-in voting. CBLDF executive director Charles Brownstein said the organisation was \u201csensitive to the issues companies like Redbubble face in balancing competing rights owner issues, and were alarmed to see the president\u2019s re-election campaign exploiting those issues to suppress protected speech\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased that Redbubble has done the right thing in this case,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope that they will continue to assert the First Amendment rights they and their sellers are guaranteed by rejecting any similar censorship attempts.\u201d",

However, officials have recorded the biggest spike in infections in nearly two months, prompting the closure of museums, parks and art galleries in the Seoul area for two weeks from Friday. Half of South Korea\u2019s 51 million people live in the metropolitan area where restrictions are being tightened.</p> <h2>US deaths pass 100,000</h2> <p>Data from Johns Hopkins University shows that the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/us-coronavirus-deaths-toll-1000000\">United States has recorded more than 100,000 deaths</a>&nbsp;from Covid-19, moving past a sombre milestone even as many states relax mitigation measures to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. The US has recorded more deaths from the disease than any other country in the pandemic, and almost three times as many as the second-ranking country, Britain.</p> <h2><strong>Trump silent on US death toll</strong></h2> <p>Donald Trump remained silent on the death of more than 100,000 Americans from Covid-19 as the US mourned the milestone.

So far few severely ill patients in UK intensive care units have been treated with convalescent plasma, but the transfusions are thought to be more effective if used earlier on before the coronavirus causes devastating damage. The NHS Blood and Transplant service (NHSBT) said its clinical trial unit had this week begun collaborating with the Oxford-led Recovery trial with the aim of getting convalescent plasma into thousands of people in hospital with coronavirus in England. Under the trial all patients in hospital with Covid-19, rather than only those in intensive care, will be eligible for a serum transfusion provided they have no medical conditions or allergies to blood products that could put them at risk. NHSBT has issued hospitals with 154 units of plasma from recovered patients but is actively seeking donors to provide more. Nearly 300 further units have been blood typed and screened for viruses to ensure they are safe to use. More than 1,500 are awaiting approval before they too are sent to hospitals. Doctors at Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 hospital, in London, have administered convalescent plasma to one severely ill patient as part of a second trial NHSBT is working with, named Remap-Cap.

      "bodyText": "We started off the day with news that easyJet is set to cut up to 4,500 jobs or around 30% of its workforce in preparation for a post-Covid flight schedule. However, the BALPA union said it wasn\u2019t convinced that those cuts were necessary But investors reacted positively to easyJet\u2019s plans, and the shares rose in tandem with European stocks, which continued to climb amid hopes that further easing of Covid-19 lockdown measures would get economies back on track ONS data showed that 24% of UK businesses which were effectively put on pause during the outbreak plan to re-start trading within the next month HSBC and StanChart shares fell amid fears that further tensions in Hong Kong would hurt the region\u2019s financial sector Reports also emerged that Debenhams is cutting hundreds of jobs from its head office, after it fell into administration in April German inflation eased further in May, and is now at its lowest level in four years US data then showed weekly jobless claims rose another 2.1m bringing the total to more than 40m since the pandemic took hold. US Q1 GDP was also was revised lower to -5.0% compared to -4.8% in the preliminary reading Thanks for joining us today. We\u2019ll be back from 8am tomorrow. Stay safe -KM ING\u2019s chief international economist James Knightly cautions that despite the relative drop in US jobless claims, further hiring will be constrained by social distancing restrictions. Social distancing will limit the ability of many retail, restaurant and leisure firms to open properly and they may find it isn\u2019t economically viable to do so with the constraints currently being placed on them \u2013 such as limiting customer numbers. Other businesses in various sectors may find that demand doesn\u2019t return as quickly as hoped and may need to adjust employment levels in the months ahead. Knightly also claims the government\u2019s own support efforts could also hinder hiring, as some businesses won\u2019t pay prospective employees as much as they are getting through emergency unemployment benefits. The national average weekly unemployment payment for recipients is nearly $1,000 and there are many industries in which this is substantially above what an employee could ordinarily receive in wages. In fact a paper from the University of Chicago estimates that 68% of benefit recipients are actually receiving a higher income as a result. Many businesses will not be able to pay enough to compete with this, so while this additional payment is good news for individual incomes and cash flow, it may have the negative effect of hampering small businesses re-opening/recovery effort. The Nasdaq has bucked the trend and fallen at the open. Here\u2019s how Wall Street opened the session: S&amp;P 500 rises 0.33% Dow Jones rises 0.58% Nasdaq falls 0.14% America cities and towns are dealing with some of the highest unemployment rates since the Great Depression. Our team has put together a photo gallery capturing the reality on the ground: US GDP for Q1 may have been revised down to -5%, but like most economies hit by the virus, the worst is yet to come. The staggering job losses mark a grim milestone in the economic crisis that has gripped the US since the coronavirus triggered widespread shutdowns and stay-at-home orders in an effort to halt the spread of the deadly pandemic, my colleague Lauren Aratani writes. The latest figures from the Department of Labor show that the rate of new unemployment claims has continued to fall over the last few weeks, down from its peak in early April, when 6.6 million Americans filed for unemployment in a single week. Earlier this month, the department reported that more than 20 million Americans lost their jobs in April, bringing the unemployment rate to 14.7%, up from 4.4% in March. While the growth of unemployment claims has slowed, millions more have continued to file for unemployment each week, bringing the total number of unemployed to a disastrous rate not seen since the Great Depression. Job losses have hit virtually every industry, though some harder than others. Figures from the Department of Labor earlier this month showed the leisure and hospitality industry was the hardest-hit, with 4.8 million jobs lost \u2013 nearly a 40% unemployment rate \u2013 as traveling came to a halt with shutdown measures. Millions of education and health services, retail and manufacturing jobs were also cut. S&amp;P 500 futures have extended their gains after the release of the GDP and jobless figures. S&amp;P 500 futures are up 0.14% Dow Jones futures are up 0.67% However, Nasdaq futures are down 0.99% There seems to be a slight sense of relief that this is the lowest number of weekly claims since early March 14 when claims rose by 282,000. While US jobless figures are incredibly high, the number of claims are starting to ease compared to a few weeks ago, as Bloomberg highlights on this handy chart: More data out of the US, with first quarter GDP shown to have contracted by -5.0%. That is worse than forecast, with economists predicting that the reading would remain unchanged from preliminary estimates of -4.8%. Dataflash: Fresh data shows US jobless claims rose another 2.1 million in the week ending 23 May. It means more than 40 million Americans have now filed for unemployment insurance after losing their jobs over the past 10 weeks during the coronavirus crisis. ING economist Carsten Brzeski says German inflation is likely to fall further over the coming months: The drop in prices for consumer goods witnessed in many regional states suggests that a lack of demand, as well as an attempt to get rid of the goods piled up during the lockdown, have put downward pressure on inflation. Looking ahead, there could be a more structural problem for inflation statistics. If consumer behaviour were to change structurally after an end to the lockdown measures, at least for a while, the basket measuring consumer price inflation might have to be adjusted, or at least taken with a pinch of salt. In short, with low oil prices and deflationary forces stemming from the economic damage of Covid-19, German headline inflation will, in our view, continue moving in one direction in the coming months: down. Holger Zschaeitz, reporter for Germany\u2019s Welt, points out that inflation is now at its lowest level in four years: Dataflash: Preliminary CPI data out of Germany shows consumer prices rose 0.6% year-on-year, compared to 0.9% in April. Adjusted figures, which make it comparable to other EU countries, shows inflation only rose 0.5% year on year, compared with 0.8% a month earlier. On a month-on-month basis, EU-harmonised prices were unchanged between April and May. Nissan has confirmed it will not close its Sunderland manufacturing plant, instead shutting a factory in Barcelona as the Japanese carmaker seeks to cut \u00a32.3bn in costs worldwide. The decision puts 2,800 jobs at risk in Spain but removed a short-term threat to most of the 6,700 jobs at Britain\u2019s biggest car plant in Sunderland. However, the carmaker said it would seek to \u201cimprove efficiency\u201d at the factory in the north-east of England as it revealed a plan to reduce annual spending by \u00a5300bn (\u00a32.3bn) worldwide. The cost-cutting programme the coronavirus pandemic pushed Nissan to its first annual loss in 11 years. Revenues fell by 14% year on year in the 12 months to 31 March, pushing it to a net loss of \u00a35.1bn. A Nissan spokesman declined to comment on employment levels at Sunderland but said\u201cEurope will remain an important part of Nissan\u2019s global business\u201d, even though the Barcelona plant closure will leave the Japanese carmaker with no EU car factories. Production in Sunderland, which produces the Qashqai and Juke SUVs and the Leaf electric car, is scheduled to restart in early June. Virgin Media is to disappear from the high street after deciding its network of more than 50 retail stores will stay shut once the coronavirus pandemic lockdown ends. The cable and TV company, which operates 53 stores in the UK, is offering the 341 affected staff the opportunity to move to newly created roles. About 300 of those posts will be in customer care, the majority of those based permanently at home, a decision Virgin Media has taken because of the success of its call centre staff moving to a working-from-home environment during the lockdown. Another 50 newly created roles relate mostly to field sales roles. Rob Orr, an executive director for sales at Virgin Media, said: We are focused on delivering the service customers want, in the ways they want it and at a time and place that suits them. By creating new jobs in our most popular care and sales channels, we will be better able to provide our customers with the top service and support they rightly expect while retaining our talented workforce. The coronavirus pandemic has hastened a strategic shift the company was already making \u2013 moving away from the high street as more and more sales and customer inquiries were taking place online or over the phone. Virgin Media has already whittled down the number of stores and kiosks it operates in the UK from 140 in 2016. Read more here: EasyJet has been pushed out of the top 10 performers on London\u2019s blue chip index, as pharma stocks like Hikma and AstraZeneca push ahead. It comes as AstraZeneca tests one of its diabetes drugs as a treatment for Covid-19. However, the budget airline is still trading higher by over 3%, as investors seem to welcome its cost cutting measures given the coronavirus crisis. William Ryder, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown explains: One possible silver lining for shareholders is that the crisis provides airlines with a chance to reset their costs structures. Airlines can renegotiate with airports and other suppliers, as well as reducing headcount and agreeing reductions in staff pay. That would make the surviving airlines leaner and more efficient than they were previously, even if social distancing measures prevent them from exploiting this in the near term. Either way, shareholders would have preferred none of this had happened in the first place. Whether the new cost reductions ever make it through to ticket prices is another question though, and will depend on the market structure once everything settles down. If you have all but given up using cash over the crisis, you are not alone. Mastercard has found that two thirds of all transactions and now being made using contactless payments. The increase of the payment threshold from \u00a330 to \u00a345 and health concerns over the handling of cash has boosted its use to the point that 22% of Brits have said they have given up using cash completely. Mastercard said 43% of people in the UK have used contactless payments more often since the Covid-19 pandemic hit. Almost 10% of card users started to use contactless for the first time as a result of the crisis. Mastercard\u2019s Marcia Clay said three quarters of Brits say they are very likely to continue using contactless payments after the pandemic ends, with 66% saying they are now their preferred way to pay. Over 20% of contactless payments are now being conducted via a mobile phone. Clay said: The shift to contactless has been accelerating over the past few years in the UK and it is clear that this rate of adoption has increased in recent months. More on Debenhams: Reuters cites one source as saying that 160 jobs have been axed from Debenhams\u2019 merchandising department and a similar number from its buying division. Others have been axed from design and HR. The cuts are part of efforts to slim down its administrative workforce, as its prepares to support a smaller business in the future, the report explains. Newsflash: Department store Debenhams has cut \u201chundreds\u201d of head office staff, according to Reuters which is citing sources. It comes just weeks after Debenhams announced it would close a further five department stores, putting 1,000 jobs at risk. Debenhams fell into administration for the second time in a year in April, as it sought to protect itself from legal action by its creditors during the pandemic. Time for a market update. All major stock markets across Europe are continuing to trade in positive territory, though not as strongly as earlier this week. Meanwhile, Wall Street looks set for a mixed open, bucking the upward trend on the other side of the Atlantic. Here\u2019s how futures are faring: Dow Jones futures are up +0.3% S&amp;P 500 futures are flat Nasdaq futures are down -0.5% HSBC and Standard Chartered are two of the worst performing stocks on the FTSE 100 today. The banks, which conduct a significant amount of their business in and around Hong Kong, have been knocked by renewed tensions in the region after China approved a controversial national security law that aims to bring Hong Kong further under Beijing\u2019s control. China\u2019s strengthening grip on the semi-autonomous region prompted the US to announce it would no longer consider Hong Kong as separate from mainland China. It could have a serious impact on the Hong Kong economy and could threaten the prosperity of its its financial sector, if it is hit by sanctions as a result of the move. It is just the latest crisis to impact lenders like HSBC and StanChart, having weathered last summer\u2019s democracy protests in Hong Kong, and the Covid-19 pandemic which has hit key markets in Europe, Asia and the US. HSBC is down today but still holding above lows seen in 2009. Newsflash: RBS is to refund customers \u00a32.2m after failing to alert new adult account holders that they were about to dip into unauthorised overdrafts. The Competition and Markets Authority said there were effectively two breaches: RBS failed to enrol about 179,000 youth account holders into the alert programme within 10 days of migrating them to adult accounts As a result, RBS charged around 36,000 customers for going into (or attempting to go into) unarranged overdraft without first sending an alert In a letter to RBS (published here) the CMA expresses its \u201cdisappointment\u201d in the bank for the mistake. However, the lender will now refund customers for unfair treatment, with 8% interest. RBS will also \u201cconsider any reasonable claims for extra costs suffered as a result of the charges,\u201d the CMA said. Separately, the CMA announced that a Santander had put aside \u00a317m for six previously disclosed breached of the retail banking order. It brings the total customer refunds secured through the CMA for overdraft alert breaches over the past two years to \u00a347m. Dataflash: Eurozone consumer confidence somewhat improved in May (though it\u2019s all relative at this point). The European Commission said consumer sentiment came in at -18.8 this month, slightly better than the -22 reading in April. Economic sentiment also rose to 67.5 from 64.9 a month earlier. Pret a Manger will reopen a further 204 of its shops for takeaway and delivery on 1 June, taking the number its has reopened to 300. The coffee and sandwich chain is reopening branches in towns and cities including Bath, Bournemouth, Newcastle, Exeter and Liverpool, for the first time since they temporarily closed in March. When the shops reopen, they will offer a limited menu of sandwiches, salads and hot and cold drinks. The company says it will restrict the number of customers entering each shop at any time, and that it has introduced social distancing measures its kitchens and has installed perspex screens at the till counter. Expecting more people to continue working from home, Pret has brought out a retail range of coffee to make and drink at home, as well as son \u201cheat me at home\u201d soups for customers to take-away with them. Pano Christou, Pret\u2019s chief executive said: It\u2019s going to continue to be tough for Pret in the months ahead, and I\u2019d like to thank our team members who are returning to work and making reopening possible. The Office for National Statistics has issued its latest Covid-19 economic indicators linked to the coronavirus outbreak. Here are some of the main stats from surveys collected earlier this month, laying bare the cash squeeze many businesses are facing: 42% of responding businesses had less than six months of cash reserves 4% of responding businesses had no cash reserves 79% of responding businesses had applied for the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. Around 27% of the workforce in these businesses had been furloughed Some businesses that temporarily ceased trading are now reopening: Of businesses who responded as trading, 8% said they had started trading again in the last two weeks 24% of businesses who have currently paused trading expect to start trading again in the next four weeks 31% expect to start trading in more than 4 weeks\u2019 time The British Airline Pilots\u2019 Association (BALPA) union has hit out at easyJet\u2019s job cut announcement this morning. BALPA said the airline has not discussed its plans with the union and would need \u201ca lot of convincing\u201d that easyJet needs to make such dramatic cuts. BALPA general secretary Brian Strutton said: easyJet staff will be shocked at the scale of this announcement and only 2 days ago staff got a \u2018good news\u2019 message from their boss with no mention of job losses, so this is a real kick in the teeth. Those staff have taken pay cuts to keep the airline afloat and this is the treatment they get in return. easyJet has not discussed its plans with BALPA so we will wait and see what impact there will be in the UK. But given easyJet is a British company, the UK is its strongest market and it has had hundreds of millions in support from the UK taxpayer, I can safely say that we will need a lot of convincing that easyJet needs to make such dramatic cuts. Indeed, easyJet\u2019s own projections, though on the pessimistic side, point to recovery by 2023, so this is a temporary problem that doesn\u2019t need this ill-considered knee-jerk reaction. The owner of the Daily Mail, the i and Metro said that its portfolio of titles saw print advertising revenues plunge by 70% in April and May as the coronavirus lockdown hammers the newspaper industry. Daily Mail &amp; General Trust, which also owns Mail Online and the Mail on Sunday, said that total revenues across its consumer media division were down a third in April. In April, DMGT said that circulation revenues fell 17% with total advertising revenue down 46% \u2013 with print ads down 69% and digital advertising falling 16%. The first four weeks of this month, to 24th May, have fared little better with total revenues down 30%. The decline in circulation revenues has improved to a 9% fall, with total advertising revenue down 45%. Print advertising remains down 70% with digital advertising falling 17%. Newspaper publishers have benefited from record digital audiences as readers crave news on the coronavirus. But with businesses shutdown and many advertisers keen to steer clear of running promotions around content relating to the health pandemic, publishers have failed to reap the benefits of an ad boost. More news from the travel sector this morning, this time from Stagecoach. The bus and train operator has set its earnings guidance for the year to 2 May 2020 to between 12.5p and 14.0p. (We\u2019ve asked for the previous guidance but are waiting for confirmation) It came as the group revealed that sales as its regional bus hubs are just 17% of what they were a year ago. The publication of full year results will now be delayed until late July. Stagecoach said it had tapped UK assistance programmes and issued \u00a3300m of commercial paper through the government and Bank of England\u2019s COVID-19 Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF). It said its financial cushion had grown, with available cash and undrawn loans now worth \u00a3800m. Stagecoach chief executive Martin Griffiths said: We see a lasting effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on travel patterns with an acceleration in trends of increased working from home, shopping from home, telemedicine and home education. We anticipate that it will be some time before demand for our public transport services returns to pre-COVID levels and we are planning for a number of scenarios. On top of job cuts, EasyJet intends to reduce costs by revising its contracts with airports and ground handling, reassessing what it spends on maintenance, as well as renegotiating what it spends on marketing, my colleague Joanna Partridge writes. The airline also gave details of new onboard safety measures ahead of flights resuming on 15 June, including the mandatory wearing of face masks. The company\u2019s fleet has been grounded since 30 March. You can read the full story here: EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren has been speaking to journalists this morning to explain the rationale behind its Covid-19 strategy. He said the budget airline has no plans to raise equity today, but will keep that option on the table if needed. Lundgren also warned that EasyJet could be forced to close some of its bases, but is currently in talks with airports to optimise its network, Reuters reports. In a statement released earlier this morning, the chief executive said: We realise that these are very difficult times and we are having to consider very difficult decisions which will impact our people, but we want to protect as many jobs as we can for the long-term. We remain focused on doing what is right for the company and its long-term health and success, following the swift action we have taken over the last three months to meet the challenges of the virus. Although we will restart flying on 15 June, we expect demand to build slowly, only returning to 2019 levels in about three years\u2019 time. Against this backdrop, we are planning to reduce the size of our fleet and to optimise the network and our bases. As a result, we anticipate reducing staff numbers by up to 30% across the business and we will continue to remove cost and non-critical expenditure at every level. We will be launching an employee consultation over the coming days. We want to ensure that we emerge from the pandemic an even more competitive business than before, so that easyJet can thrive in the future. EasyJet is among the biggest risers on the FTSE 100, having started the session around 4.2% higher before falling back to around 2.6%. We\u2019ll see whether investors will continue to buy in to the companies plans throughout the session. Meanwhile, M&amp;G is getting a strong reception after the fund manager and insurance group said it would keep its dividend intact. It goes against the grain, with most UK insurers heeding the Bank of England\u2019s warnings to scrap investor payouts during the Covid-19 crisis. Investors in Europe are again shrugging off tensions in Hong Kong, extending an upward run on stocks since Tuesday. Here\u2019s now major indices have opened: FTSE 100 up 0.8% FTSE 250 up 0.9% France\u2019s CAC 40 up 0.6% Spain\u2019s IBEX up 0.6% Germany\u2019s DAX up 0.7% Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, eurozone and business. EasyJet has laid out fresh cost cutting plans that will involve axing up to a third of its 15,000-strong workforce in response to the Covid-19 crisis. EasyJet said its fleet will also involve 51 fewer aircraft than expected by year-end 2021. The move, which will impact up to 4,500 staff, is being announced just weeks before it is set to re-start some flights (primarily domestic routes in the UK and France) on 15 June. The budget airline said it is preparing itself for a prolonged drop in bookings, citing projections by the International Air Transport Association (IATA). IATA has said levels of demand last seen in 2019 are unlikely to be reached until 2023. Elsewhere, markets were mixed in Asia, after the US announced that it no longer views Hong Kong as autonomous from China. It comes as China prepares to impose a new security law that would drastically limit civil liberties in the territory. The US declaration could have a serious impact on the Hong Kong economy, particularly if its financial sector is hit by sanctions as a result of the move.

      "bodyText": "Domestic abuse survivors have been told they must appear in person to give evidence to MPs despite raising concerns about coronavirus infection risks. The requirement has raised criticism from charities and campaigning groups. Eighteen domestic abuse and women\u2019s rights groups, including Women\u2019s Aid, Refuge, and Amnesty International, have written to the leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, to say it is unacceptable to require survivors of domestic abuse to attend parliament in person. So-called hybrid parliament arrangements, allowing individuals to provide evidence to scrutiny committees via video link, are set to end next week after a decision by Rees-Mogg. At least three women who have experienced domestic abuse are to give evidence on 4 June to the public bill committee for the domestic abuse bill, a long-awaited piece of legislation going through parliament. The role of the committee, made up of 17 MPs, including ministers, is to scrutinise the legislation line by line. Nicki Norman, the acting co-chief executive of Women\u2019s Aid, said: \u201cWe welcome the public bill committee\u2019s decision to hear the expert evidence of domestic abuse survivors, as they scrutinise the landmark domestic abuse bill. \u201cHowever, it is clearly wrong to require them to give evidence in person. This requirement is unsafe for survivors, especially for women from black and minority ethnic communities and those with disabilities. It will put survivors and staff supporting them at risk and force them to breach current government guidance. \u201cThe government must urgently reconsider this requirement. We also urge the bill committee to make time to hear from a wide range of organisations working to end domestic abuse, including organisations supporting marginalised survivors whose voices are often unheard.\u201d Other signatories to the letter include the End Violence Against Women Coalition, Respect, SafeLives, and Rape Crisis England and Wales. A government spokesperson said: \u201cThe landmark domestic abuse bill will transform the way we support victims and tackle perpetrators. \u201cThe government is committed to ensuring the House of Commons has the opportunity to hear from survivors and we are looking at options to facilitate remote participation for those in unique circumstances so their voices are heard and they can continue to contribute to the bill.\u201d A Commons spokesperson said: \u201cThe scheduling of legislation in the Commons is a matter for the government. Staff have been drawing up plans for socially distanced, physical, public bill committee meetings. Work is being undertaken to enable such committees to take evidence remotely from mid-June.\u201d The domestic abuse bill includes plans to force domestic abusers to take polygraph tests, commonly referred to as lie detectors. Among other proposals the legislation pledges to ban perpetrators from cross-examining their victims during family court proceedings and could require councils to find safe accommodation for victims and their children.",

      "body": "<p>I love <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatre\">theatre</a>. I love the people, the community, the buzz. But the future of this industry is under threat \u2013 a pain felt most deeply by the people who make it a fabulous business. On 16 March, London\u2019s West End <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/may/15/uk-theatres-in-high-jeopardy-as-doors-remain-closed-amid-pandemic\">closed its doors</a>. Regional tours followed suit shortly afterwards, leaving actors, musicians, technical, wardrobe, wigs and front-of-house staff unemployed overnight. Performers and musicians couldn\u2019t be furloughed because they\u2019re technically self-employed, despite many of them being contracted well into 2021. Of course, that was OK because of chancellor Rishi Sunak\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/may/14/uk-scheme-signs-up-440000-self-employed-workers-on-first-day\"> self-employment income support scheme</a> (SEISS). Or was it?</p> <p>Unfortunately, for the thousands of people employed in the theatre industry, there were so many gaps to fall through. The help for self-employed people only lasts until the end of May, while the furlough scheme extends until <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/12/uk-furlough-scheme-extended-rishi-sunak-coronavirus\">October</a>. Show business is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/may/27/thousands-are-in-jeopardy-freelance-theatre-makers-count-cost-of-crisis-covid-lockdown\">notoriously unpredictable</a>; there is no job security, so if you earned more than \u00a350,000 in profits each year over the past three years but haven\u2019t been able to find work since, you are not eligible for the grant.</p> <p>Imagine if you\u2019d just landed yourself the role of a lifetime and moved to London to pursue your dream. Perhaps you took out a six- or 12-month lease on a property, knowing you were contracted for the duration of the tenure, despite not earning anywhere near this amount last year. The hundreds of graduates fresh out of training, many with massive student debt, who have been working in the industry since last summer are also not eligible for the scheme as they haven\u2019t yet had the chance to file a tax return. And another group who won\u2019t benefit, despite paying their taxes, are people who trade as limited liability companies.</p> <p>It\u2019s not that these people don\u2019t want to work, are shielding, or taking an extended break during the pandemic. It\u2019s that there are no jobs in the industry they\u2019re employed in. What we all hoped might happen \u2013 SEISS until May, ready for a triumphant reopening of the West End in June, with all regions following shortly afterwards \u2013 has turned out to not be so simple. What happens after the end of May, both for those lucky enough to have claimed SEISS, and for those who fell through the gaps?</p> <p>These are real people with mortgages, rent, bills, children, elderly relatives. We\u2019ve all accepted that theatre will be one of the last industries to regain some semblance of \u201cnormality\u201d, so why can\u2019t the government accept that the people who have fallen through the gaps need ongoing help?</p> <p>Many members of the theatre industry applied for universal credit only to be told they did not qualify. Every supermarket around London now has its own ensemble cast of temporary staff consisting of the hardworking, versatile people of the theatre industry \u2013 but these jobs won\u2019t be here forever. And not everyone is able to get a temporary job.&nbsp;The government must act now to preserve the arts and help the amazing network of people that make the industry as spectacular as it is.</p> <p>Better schemes are possible. The Spanish government recently announced it would be <a href=\"https://www.thelocal.es/20200523/coronavirus-spain-announces-3-billion-universal-basic-income-scheme\">introducing</a> a universal basic income. And in the Netherlands and France, theatre professionals can rely on an established social security system that ensures artists still get paid between jobs \u2013 coronavirus or no coronavirus. What if the next Elaine Paige or Michael Ball has just had their first professional job cut short by the pandemic, and is financially unable to continue in the industry? The lack of support for people working in this industry sends a signal the government thinks that such occupations are merely a paid hobby, that people can rely on savings, or get a \u201cproper\u201d job until they\u2019re \u201cfortunate\u201d enough to pick up where they left off.</p> <p>When I was <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/love-islands-amy-hart-quit-18936277\">employed by British Airways</a>, belonging to Unite the Union was a saving grace. Amid the economic uncertainty caused by coronavirus, unions have greater power to hold industries and government to account. I recently spoke to Paul Fleming, who is a candidate to be the general secretary of Equity, the trade union for creative practitioners, and is currently the central London theatres organiser. \u201cThanks to strong unions, our members have organised good agreements to put the industry on pause; we\u2019re ready to reopen when it\u2019s safe and practical. But without guaranteed income for all our industry\u2019s freelancers, a whole workforce is threatened with being washed away \u2013 the most under-represented artists first,\u201d he told me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/UnitePolitics/status/1260277432147423232\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The best thing you can do in these uncertain times is join a union but don\u2019t just take our word for it, listen to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/amyhart1707?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@amyhart1707</a> and couple up with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/unitetheunion?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@unitetheunion</a> \u2764\ufe0f<br><br>Join at <a href=\"https://t.co/oW2ogon4TL\">https://t.co/oW2ogon4TL</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LoveIsland?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@LoveIsland</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/LoveIsland?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#LoveIsland</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/TYN2sOT541\">pic.twitter.com/TYN2sOT541</a></p>&mdash; Unite Politics (@UnitePolitics) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UnitePolitics/status/1260277432147423232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 12, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>\u201cWith no unions on the government\u2019s reopening task force, and just days to go until SEISS ends, the government risks telling artists and audiences that they don\u2019t care about theatre\u2019s economic and social importance.\u201d</p> <p>As a whole, the arts and culture industry brings<a href=\"https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/publication/contribution-arts-and-culture-industry-uk-economy-0\"> \u00a310.8b</a><a href=\"https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/publication/contribution-arts-and-culture-industry-uk-economy-0\">n</a>&nbsp;to the economy every year \u2013 not to mention every pre- and post-theatre dinner, every quick glass of wine in a pub before a show, every train, plane and bus ticket, every hotel stay. The true contribution of theatreland to local economies is incalculable. For every \u00a31 invested in the arts by the government, the industry returns \u00a35. This is our hour of need. At a moment like this, we need the arts more than ever.</p> <p>\u2022 Amy Hart is a former cabin crew manager and a 2019 Love Island contestant</p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "I love theatre. I love the people, the community, the buzz. But the future of this industry is under threat \u2013 a pain felt most deeply by the people who make it a fabulous business. On 16 March, London\u2019s West End closed its doors. Regional tours followed suit shortly afterwards, leaving actors, musicians, technical, wardrobe, wigs and front-of-house staff unemployed overnight. Performers and musicians couldn\u2019t be furloughed because they\u2019re technically self-employed, despite many of them being contracted well into 2021. Of course, that was OK because of chancellor Rishi Sunak\u2019s self-employment income support scheme (SEISS). Or was it? Unfortunately, for the thousands of people employed in the theatre industry, there were so many gaps to fall through. The help for self-employed people only lasts until the end of May, while the furlough scheme extends until October. Show business is notoriously unpredictable; there is no job security, so if you earned more than \u00a350,000 in profits each year over the past three years but haven\u2019t been able to find work since, you are not eligible for the grant. Imagine if you\u2019d just landed yourself the role of a lifetime and moved to London to pursue your dream. Perhaps you took out a six- or 12-month lease on a property, knowing you were contracted for the duration of the tenure, despite not earning anywhere near this amount last year. The hundreds of graduates fresh out of training, many with massive student debt, who have been working in the industry since last summer are also not eligible for the scheme as they haven\u2019t yet had the chance to file a tax return. And another group who won\u2019t benefit, despite paying their taxes, are people who trade as limited liability companies. It\u2019s not that these people don\u2019t want to work, are shielding, or taking an extended break during the pandemic. It\u2019s that there are no jobs in the industry they\u2019re employed in. What we all hoped might happen \u2013 SEISS until May, ready for a triumphant reopening of the West End in June, with all regions following shortly afterwards \u2013 has turned out to not be so simple. What happens after the end of May, both for those lucky enough to have claimed SEISS, and for those who fell through the gaps? These are real people with mortgages, rent, bills, children, elderly relatives. We\u2019ve all accepted that theatre will be one of the last industries to regain some semblance of \u201cnormality\u201d, so why can\u2019t the government accept that the people who have fallen through the gaps need ongoing help? Many members of the theatre industry applied for universal credit only to be told they did not qualify. Every supermarket around London now has its own ensemble cast of temporary staff consisting of the hardworking, versatile people of the theatre industry \u2013 but these jobs won\u2019t be here forever. And not everyone is able to get a temporary job. The government must act now to preserve the arts and help the amazing network of people that make the industry as spectacular as it is. Better schemes are possible. The Spanish government recently announced it would be introducing a universal basic income. And in the Netherlands and France, theatre professionals can rely on an established social security system that ensures artists still get paid between jobs \u2013 coronavirus or no coronavirus. What if the next Elaine Paige or Michael Ball has just had their first professional job cut short by the pandemic, and is financially unable to continue in the industry? The lack of support for people working in this industry sends a signal the government thinks that such occupations are merely a paid hobby, that people can rely on savings, or get a \u201cproper\u201d job until they\u2019re \u201cfortunate\u201d enough to pick up where they left off. When I was employed by British Airways, belonging to Unite the Union was a saving grace. Amid the economic uncertainty caused by coronavirus, unions have greater power to hold industries and government to account. I recently spoke to Paul Fleming, who is a candidate to be the general secretary of Equity, the trade union for creative practitioners, and is currently the central London theatres organiser. \u201cThanks to strong unions, our members have organised good agreements to put the industry on pause; we\u2019re ready to reopen when it\u2019s safe and practical. But without guaranteed income for all our industry\u2019s freelancers, a whole workforce is threatened with being washed away \u2013 the most under-represented artists first,\u201d he told me. \u201cWith no unions on the government\u2019s reopening task force, and just days to go until SEISS ends, the government risks telling artists and audiences that they don\u2019t care about theatre\u2019s economic and social importance.\u201d As a whole, the arts and culture industry brings \u00a310.8bn to the economy every year \u2013 not to mention every pre- and post-theatre dinner, every quick glass of wine in a pub before a show, every train, plane and bus ticket, every hotel stay. The true contribution of theatreland to local economies is incalculable. For every \u00a31 invested in the arts by the government, the industry returns \u00a35. This is our hour of need. At a moment like this, we need the arts more than ever. \u2022 Amy Hart is a former cabin crew manager and a 2019 Love Island contestant",

The DHSC said: \u201cWe are proud of the achievement of our public and private sector partners and the amazing work of their staff and volunteers in creating a programme that is easy to use during a stressful and worrying time when they have symptoms of coronavirus. \u201cWe have been working collaboratively across the UK to increase access to testing and as a result, we have seen a huge rise in the number of tests over a matter of weeks.\u201d Deloitte declined to comment further, other than to say it was one of a number of private and public contractors supporting the work. Jonathan Ashworth, Labour\u2019s shadow health secretary, said: \u201cThe government\u2019s testing and tracing regime is looking increasingly shambolic. Ministers insisted on ploughing on with handing this contract to Deloitte which has meant GPs and local directors of public health kept in the dark over test results while patient records don\u2019t get updated. \u201cThis is no way to run an effective public health response to this deadly, highly infectious virus.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 2 June 2020 to make clear that the Institute of Biomedical Science is the membership body for hospital biomedical scientists and laboratory staff.",

      "bodyText": "Britain risks a long period of low growth and high unemployment as the economy stutters back to life, a Bank of England policymaker has warned. Michael Saunders, a member of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee, said the \u201csearing experience\u201d of the coronavirus crisis would leave its mark long after the lockdown was lifted and the central bank should risk pumping too much stimulus into economy rather than too little to combat a severe downturn. Saunders, who was one of only two members of the nine-strong MPC this month to back an increase in the stimulus programme, said he thought the economy was on course to suffer more long-term damage from the pandemic than the Bank said in its most recent assessment. An acceleration in the already high rate of unemployment and an increase in the number of companies going bust would leave long-term scars on badly affected industries while the threat of a resurgence in Covid-19 cases was likely to weigh on business and consumer confidence, he said in a speech delivered online on Thursday. Setting out a gloomy prognosis for the economy, he warned that banks could become wary of lending to companies while businesses, nervous about the prospects for the economy, pulled back from making investment decisions, leaving the GDP growth to stagnate. \u201cIf unchecked, there are risks of a vicious circle, whereby the economy gets stuck in a self-feeding loop of weak activity, pessimistic expectations and low investment,\u201d Saunders said. Earlier this week the Bank\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, said the economy was showing early signs of returning to previous levels of output, but could take longer to recover than first estimated. The Bank cut interest rates to a record low 0.1% and injected a further \u00a3200bn into the financial system, taking its stimulus programme to \u00a3645bn. Many City analysts expect the central bank to take further steps at its meeting next month to cut the cost of borrowing. \u201cIt is safer to err on the side of easing somewhat too much, and then if necessary tighten as capacity pressures eventually build, rather than ease too little and find the economy gets stuck in a low inflation rut,\u201d Saunders said. Dismissing concerns that a spending splurge by the central bank could ignite a spike in inflation, he said the evidence was of heavy price cutting and squeezed margins across most commercial sectors and the more likely prospect was for inflation to fall close to zero by the end of the year. \u201cThe risk of inflation picking up is negligible,\u201d he said, adding that a fall in the demand for credit would reduce the demand for goods and services, further easing the pressure on prices. \u201cThe desire to self-insure is likely to lead to businesses and households having a lower risk appetite in a post-Covid environment,\u201d he said, leading to higher rates of household savings and moves by companies to pay down debts.",

      "body": "<h2>START FOOTBALL!</h2> <p>Following the Premier League\u2019s unanimous decision to embark on Phase Two of Project Restart, Troy Deeney has agreed to return to Watford training having opted to sit out his team\u2019s first tentative steps back on to the pitch because he didn\u2019t want to risk bringing home a virus that might endanger his infant son\u2019s life.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Fiver presumed curiosity had got the better of Troy, who wished to see how his teammates would pull off the impressive feat of gathering in small groups and tackling one other while simultaneously&nbsp;\u201cminimising unnecessary close contact\u201d. Sort of like a government advisor simultaneously breaking the law while not actually breaking the law, such contortions take a certain level of expertise to pull off. But let\u2019s face it, Craig Cathcart and Daryl Janmaat didn\u2019t get where they are today trying to achieve the mundane.</p> <p>As it happens, Deeney has decided to return to work after having his concerns about the disproportionate amount of coronavirus deaths in the BAME community allayed by Dr Jonathan Van Tam, the government\u2019s deputy chief medical officer and a man you may have seen standing behind a Downing Street lectern alongside assorted Tory hypocrites as they portentously told us all to stay at home, stay safe and not under any circumstances embark on any unnecessary 260-mile trips to Durham.</p> <p>\u201cThe first conversation I had with Jonathan was maybe three weeks ago,\u201d said Deeney. \u201cThe last conversation we had was on Friday and he had so much more information, so much more detailed analysis.\u201d But what\u2019s this?!?!?! It seems Deeney hasn\u2019t a second to lose when it comes to shifting any excess timber with which he may have inadvertently become upholstered during lockdown.</p> <p>It appears that the Fiver\u2019s surprisingly successful STOP FOOTBALL campaign has been overturned on appeal and FOOTBALL WILL START AGAIN on 17 June when Aston Villa entertain Sheffield United and Manchester City host Arsenal, with a full Premier League fixture list to follow behind closed doors on the weekend of 19-21 June. Now how\u2019s that for a mid-Fiver newsflash?!?!?!</p> <p>Anyway Troy, you were saying? \u201cI saw some comments in regards to my son, people saying: \u2018I hope your son gets corona\u2019,\u201d he said, showing that while football may have stopped, some of the more unsavoury weirdos who follow it certainly haven\u2019t.&nbsp;Referring to the manner in which he and Danny Rose got \u201cabsolutely hammered and battered\u201d for voicing concerns about returning to the training ground, Deeney said it wasn\u2019t just the players themselves who were shipping abuse.</p> <p>\u201cThe missus gets direct messages and you\u2019ll be walking down the street and people will be like: \u2018Oh, I\u2019m at work, you go back to work\u2019,\u201d he said. Given Troy\u2019s caution when it comes to contagion, the Fiver can but hope a respectful amount of social distancing was maintained when such conversations took place. A suitably wide Watford gap, if you will.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cMy plan was always just to go for the three years and then get into a club job, which would be what I wanted to do \u2026 I think international football for a 41, 42-year-old can get quite frustrating \u2014 so I thought, get some experience and then cut my teeth in day-to-day running with the energy that I\u2019ve got\u201d \u2013 Phil Neville says he managed England\u2019s women\u2019s team to get into club management. Now to wait for the offers to come flooding in.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7d4b5c90d65fa15389992a178984cc262fffd06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7d4b5c90d65fa15389992a178984cc262fffd06/0_35_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The good news is, I\u2019ll probably get a League One gig out of this\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The good news is, I\u2019ll probably get a League One gig out of this\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Sellers/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>RECOMMENDED LISTENING</h2> <p>The latest Football Weekly Extra <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/series/footballweekly\">will be right here</a> soon enough, while you can also get your ears around&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/audio/2020/may/27/forgotten-stories-of-football-jeff-hall-footballer-whose-death-turned-tide-against-polio-podcast\">the third podcast in our series of Forgotten Stories of Football</a>, focusing on Jeff Hall: the footballer whose death turned the tide against polio.</p> <h2>FIVER LETTERS</h2> <p>\u201cKevin McKee\u2019s niche request for Fifa 20 albums [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/27/being-warned-not-to-perform-donuts-outside-english-heritage-properties\">Wednesday\u2019s Fiver</a>], I have also been thinking about the game in far too much depth recently. I have gone so far in my quest for realism as to vividly picture hipster punditry on my Eintracht Frankfurt career mode side, in particular an Andy Brassell think-piece where he explores the roles of Jonathan De Guzman and Sebastian Larsson in the midfield of a team struggling domestically but flowering in their maiden Champions League campaign. Perhaps if the Covid content drought continues he\u2019ll write it for me\u201d \u2013 Niall Murtagh.</p> <p>\u201cThe Saudi Arabian regime being considered less than \u2018fit and proper\u2019 thanks to a dodgy TV channel, is the football equivalent of locking up Al Capone for tax-knack\u201d \u2013 Adam Preston.</p> <p>\u201cI was always annoyed by Alan Green\u2019s commentary. Specifically, it was his penchant for calling \u2018winning\u2019 goals in the latter stages of games, when there was clearly still time to play.

      "bodyText": "START FOOTBALL! Following the Premier League\u2019s unanimous decision to embark on Phase Two of Project Restart, Troy Deeney has agreed to return to Watford training having opted to sit out his team\u2019s first tentative steps back on to the pitch because he didn\u2019t want to risk bringing home a virus that might endanger his infant son\u2019s life. The Fiver presumed curiosity had got the better of Troy, who wished to see how his teammates would pull off the impressive feat of gathering in small groups and tackling one other while simultaneously \u201cminimising unnecessary close contact\u201d. Sort of like a government advisor simultaneously breaking the law while not actually breaking the law, such contortions take a certain level of expertise to pull off. But let\u2019s face it, Craig Cathcart and Daryl Janmaat didn\u2019t get where they are today trying to achieve the mundane. As it happens, Deeney has decided to return to work after having his concerns about the disproportionate amount of coronavirus deaths in the BAME community allayed by Dr Jonathan Van Tam, the government\u2019s deputy chief medical officer and a man you may have seen standing behind a Downing Street lectern alongside assorted Tory hypocrites as they portentously told us all to stay at home, stay safe and not under any circumstances embark on any unnecessary 260-mile trips to Durham. \u201cThe first conversation I had with Jonathan was maybe three weeks ago,\u201d said Deeney. \u201cThe last conversation we had was on Friday and he had so much more information, so much more detailed analysis.\u201d But what\u2019s this?!?!?! It seems Deeney hasn\u2019t a second to lose when it comes to shifting any excess timber with which he may have inadvertently become upholstered during lockdown. It appears that the Fiver\u2019s surprisingly successful STOP FOOTBALL campaign has been overturned on appeal and FOOTBALL WILL START AGAIN on 17 June when Aston Villa entertain Sheffield United and Manchester City host Arsenal, with a full Premier League fixture list to follow behind closed doors on the weekend of 19-21 June. Now how\u2019s that for a mid-Fiver newsflash?!?!?! Anyway Troy, you were saying? \u201cI saw some comments in regards to my son, people saying: \u2018I hope your son gets corona\u2019,\u201d he said, showing that while football may have stopped, some of the more unsavoury weirdos who follow it certainly haven\u2019t. Referring to the manner in which he and Danny Rose got \u201cabsolutely hammered and battered\u201d for voicing concerns about returning to the training ground, Deeney said it wasn\u2019t just the players themselves who were shipping abuse. \u201cThe missus gets direct messages and you\u2019ll be walking down the street and people will be like: \u2018Oh, I\u2019m at work, you go back to work\u2019,\u201d he said. Given Troy\u2019s caution when it comes to contagion, the Fiver can but hope a respectful amount of social distancing was maintained when such conversations took place. A suitably wide Watford gap, if you will. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cMy plan was always just to go for the three years and then get into a club job, which would be what I wanted to do \u2026 I think international football for a 41, 42-year-old can get quite frustrating \u2014 so I thought, get some experience and then cut my teeth in day-to-day running with the energy that I\u2019ve got\u201d \u2013 Phil Neville says he managed England\u2019s women\u2019s team to get into club management. Now to wait for the offers to come flooding in. RECOMMENDED LISTENING The latest Football Weekly Extra will be right here soon enough, while you can also get your ears around the third podcast in our series of Forgotten Stories of Football, focusing on Jeff Hall: the footballer whose death turned the tide against polio. FIVER LETTERS \u201cKevin McKee\u2019s niche request for Fifa 20 albums [Wednesday\u2019s Fiver], I have also been thinking about the game in far too much depth recently. I have gone so far in my quest for realism as to vividly picture hipster punditry on my Eintracht Frankfurt career mode side, in particular an Andy Brassell think-piece where he explores the roles of Jonathan De Guzman and Sebastian Larsson in the midfield of a team struggling domestically but flowering in their maiden Champions League campaign. Perhaps if the Covid content drought continues he\u2019ll write it for me\u201d \u2013 Niall Murtagh. \u201cThe Saudi Arabian regime being considered less than \u2018fit and proper\u2019 thanks to a dodgy TV channel, is the football equivalent of locking up Al Capone for tax-knack\u201d \u2013 Adam Preston. \u201cI was always annoyed by Alan Green\u2019s commentary. Specifically, it was his penchant for calling \u2018winning\u2019 goals in the latter stages of games, when there was clearly still time to play. Imagine my pleasure on listening to highlights of Istanbul 2005 for the first time (Oh, why not?) when he referred to Hern\u00e1n Crespo\u2019s first goal, and Milan\u2019s second, in the 39th minute as the winner.

Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Adam Preston. NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Aston Villa have announced that Ron Smith, the father of manager Dean Smith, has passed away at the age of 79 after contracting Covid-19. Damian Collins MP has called for urgent discussions to secure the financial future of lower-league clubs. \u201cWe may only have a few weeks to save professional football in this country as we know it,\u201d Collins said. Football\u2019s TV money men want some of it back following the Covid-19 crisis and its impact on their usually packed schedules.

Detailed legislation will now be drafted and could be enacted within the next few months.</p> <p>The move has been condemned and prompted anxiety inside and outside Hong Kong, where residents have chafed under China\u2019s tightening hold for years.</p> <p>\u201cIt is definitely the start of a new but sad chapter for Hong Kong,\u201d said the pro-democracy legislator<em> </em>Claudia Mo. \u201cHong Kong as we knew it is finally dead.\u201d</p> <p>Observers said the legislation was likely to aggravate unrest in the city, where pro-democracy protests have restarted after a pause during the coronavirus outbreak.

      "bodyText": "China\u2019s legislature has approved controversial national security laws for Hong Kong, dealing what critics have called a \u201ckiller blow\u201d to the city\u2019s autonomy and freedoms. Delegates of China\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress broke out into applause in Beijing\u2019s Great Hall of the People after voting through a draft decision that paves the way for sweeping anti-sedition laws to be directly enacted in Hong Kong. The legislation, aimed at stamping out protests that have racked the city for the past year, would ban \u201cany acts or activities\u201d that endanger China\u2019s national security, including separatism, subversion and terrorism \u2013 charges often used in mainland China to silence dissidents and other political opponents. The legislation would also allow \u201cnational security agencies\u201d \u2013 potentially Chinese security forces \u2013 to operate in the city. The decision had been widely expected to pass through parliament, which meets once a year to pass already approved measures. Detailed legislation will now be drafted and could be enacted within the next few months. The move has been condemned and prompted anxiety inside and outside Hong Kong, where residents have chafed under China\u2019s tightening hold for years. \u201cIt is definitely the start of a new but sad chapter for Hong Kong,\u201d said the pro-democracy legislator Claudia Mo. \u201cHong Kong as we knew it is finally dead.\u201d Observers said the legislation was likely to aggravate unrest in the city, where pro-democracy protests have restarted after a pause during the coronavirus outbreak. On Thursday, riot police were deployed after at least 360 people were arrested the day before in demonstrations against Beijing\u2019s plans. On LIHKG, a forum popular with protesters, users called for a \u201chundred-day war\u201d to take advantage of their last opportunity to protest before the laws come into force. \u201cSay no to China,\u201d one posted. \u201cAs a Hong Konger there is not much we can do except to show the world we are still fighting for our rights and freedom,\u201d said Serene Chow, 22, who has been part of the demonstrations since last year. Chinese and Hong Kong officials have promised the laws will target only a \u201cnarrow set of acts\u201d and say the vast majority of Hong Kong residents will not be affected. But critics say the laws will be used not only against protesters, but to undermine permanently the city\u2019s autonomy under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework and the city\u2019s de facto constitution, known as the basic law. An attempt by the Hong Kong government to pass similar legislation in 2003 was abandoned after mass protests. This time, the laws will be enacted through a provision that bypasses Hong Kong\u2019s legislature and therefore public debate and consultation. Legal experts have described the process as unconstitutional but say little can be done. \u201cThe Chinese communist party is \u2026 imposing a draconian law which can be used to silence dissent in Hong Kong and infringe on freedoms\u201d said Frances Eve, deputy director of research at Chinese Human Rights Defenders, a coalition of human rights NGOs. Thursday\u2019s decision appeared to expand the scope of the legislation to proscribe \u201cacts and activities\u201d that endanger national security, which experts say could target broader behaviour such as attending an unauthorised rally. The legislation, which bans all \u201cactivities of foreign forces\u201d interfering in Hong Kong affairs, has added to diplomatic tensions for Beijing, which is already facing international scrutiny over the coronavirus pandemic. In a joint statement, Australia, Canada, the UK and the US said: \u201cChina\u2019s decision to impose the new national security law on Hong Kong lies in direct conflict with its international obligations.\u201d They called on Beijing to work with the Hong Kong government and people to find a \u201cmutually acceptable accommodation\u201d. The UK separately said it would extend visa rights for as many as 300,000 Hong Kong British national (overseas) passport holders if China does not change tack. Tsai Ing-wen, the president of Taiwan, which has promised to help Hong Kong residents in need, posted on Twitter: \u201cWe will not sit back and watch while Hong Kong\u2019s freedom, democracy and human rights are eroded.\u201d On Wednesday, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said his government would no longer consider Hong Kong as separate from mainland China and would revoke its special trade status. China\u2019s foreign ministry office in Hong Kong called the US statement \u201cutterly imperious, unreasonable and shameless\u201d and ordered America to \u201cimmediately stop meddling\u201d. EU foreign ministers will meet on Friday over video link to discuss the Hong Kong crisis,. Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, said he hoped the UK would work with its allies to stand up to Beijing. \u201cI think we need to wake up to the fact that this is a new Chinese regime and it\u2019s a different sort of aggressive communism and it needs to be defended against,\u201d he said. After the vote, the Hong Kong government repeated its support for the legislation, which would require authorities to promote \u201cnational security education\u201d and report regularly to the central government. The chief executive, Carrie Lam, said the laws \u201calso show the care of the country toward Hong Kong\u201d, adding that her administration would fully cooperate to \u201ccomplete the relevant work \u2026 as soon as possible.\u201d Hong Kong residents predicted an increase in emigration as the laws move ahead. Wealthy residents have reportedly begun moving their funds elsewhere, afraid the new legislation will allow Chinese authorities seize their wealth. Others said the latest measure was part of Beijing\u2019s tightening grip over the city, despite the basic law proscribing Chinese interference in Hong Kong. \u201cBeijing has been eroding that in recent years,\u201d said Wilson Leung, 37, a barrister in the city. \u201cBut now this appears to be the killer blow. It is going to be very dark days ahead for the citizens of this once-great city.\u201d Additional reporting by Verna Yu",

Andy talked about how it was becoming impossible for such populist figures to not intrude into his lyrics. He\u2019d look at Trump\u2019s tweets and go, \u2018There\u2019s a Gang of Four lyric right there.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Although Gill\u2019s official cause of death was multiple organ failure and pneumonia, Mayer has said that she suspects that the guitarist \u2013 who toured China with Gang of Four in November \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p08dnym5\">may have been an early UK victim of Covid-19</a>. In early December, the band\u2019s tour manager was admitted to hospital for eight days with \u201csevere respiratory distress\u201d. When Gill became ill in January &nbsp;\u201cnobody at that point thought coronavirus had reached Europe\u201d, says Mayer. She has found that watching news broadcasts of coronavirus victims recounting similar symptoms was \u201clike watching Andy die again\u201d.</p> <p>She hopes that re-testing Gill\u2019s samples, along with those of the tour manager \u2013 who <a href=\"https://www.catherinemayer.co.uk/post/2020-vision-14-may-16-00\">she says</a> experienced \u201csevere respiratory distress\u201d in December\u201d \u2013 herself and Gang of Four\u2019s members, for antibodies may provide answers. \u201cIt won\u2019t help Andy, but may help&nbsp;understand what the timelines really were and what that means the public health response was, and how big a failure it was not to continue with containment and track and trace,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1a2d71f74bf84a374c39bdb792fec8babc3aef5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1a2d71f74bf84a374c39bdb792fec8babc3aef5/109_366_3445_2067/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gang of Four pictured in the late 1970s ...

Mayer said that while he felt resourcing the NHS should not fall to individuals, she \u201ccould not think of a better team of people\u201d to receive extra funding. Gill had been treated by the hospital for inflammatory condition sarcoidosis since 2012. He was admitted with respiratory issues in January.

      "bodyText": "The influential post-punk band Gang of Four are to release the final recordings featuring the group\u2019s influential guitarist and songwriter Andy Gill, who died in February. All proceeds from the Anti Hero EP will benefit Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS foundation trust, to \u201crecognise, celebrate and support\u201d those who cared for Gill during his hospitalisation. Gill\u2019s widow, the author and Women\u2019s Equality party co-founder Catherine Mayer, said her late husband was \u201cwas working on this music and overseeing mixes from his hospital bed until literally the last day when they put him under\u201d. Mayer and the surviving members of Gang of Four named the EP to recognise Gill\u2019s \u201cvery healthy scepticism of the lauding of so-called great men\u201d, she said. \u201cSo many \u2013 mainly men I\u2019m afraid \u2013 seem susceptible to the idea that if you behave and dress a bit badly and break the rules, it makes you a genius. Andy talked about how it was becoming impossible for such populist figures to not intrude into his lyrics. He\u2019d look at Trump\u2019s tweets and go, \u2018There\u2019s a Gang of Four lyric right there.\u2019\u201d Although Gill\u2019s official cause of death was multiple organ failure and pneumonia, Mayer has said that she suspects that the guitarist \u2013 who toured China with Gang of Four in November \u2013 may have been an early UK victim of Covid-19. In early December, the band\u2019s tour manager was admitted to hospital for eight days with \u201csevere respiratory distress\u201d. When Gill became ill in January \u201cnobody at that point thought coronavirus had reached Europe\u201d, says Mayer. She has found that watching news broadcasts of coronavirus victims recounting similar symptoms was \u201clike watching Andy die again\u201d. She hopes that re-testing Gill\u2019s samples, along with those of the tour manager \u2013 who she says experienced \u201csevere respiratory distress\u201d in December\u201d \u2013 herself and Gang of Four\u2019s members, for antibodies may provide answers. \u201cIt won\u2019t help Andy, but may help understand what the timelines really were and what that means the public health response was, and how big a failure it was not to continue with containment and track and trace,\u201d she says. Gill was famously political and often worked Marxist ideas into his lyrics. Mayer said that while he felt resourcing the NHS should not fall to individuals, she \u201ccould not think of a better team of people\u201d to receive extra funding. Gill had been treated by the hospital for inflammatory condition sarcoidosis since 2012. He was admitted with respiratory issues in January. Mayer said she and his bandmates were touched to be able to stay overnight in the hospital, and witness the specialists who treated Gill for sarcoidosis treat him for pneumonia and \u201csee him through until the end\u201d. Mayer said: \u201cI\u2019d never been in an intensive care unit before and it really is an extraordinary place. There\u2019s something about the combination of compassion and humanity at the same time as an astonishing level of expertise. I\u2019ve been acutely aware that those people who put so much emotional commitment into looking after Andy are so undervalued.\u201d The Anti Hero EP, released on 17 July, features art work by Shepard Fairey, creator of Barack Obama\u2019s Hope poster, who offered to create a portrait of Gill following his death. He said: \u201cGang of Four have been a profound inspiration for me because the band demonstrate that great art can powerfully merge pleasure and intellectual provocation. I was honoured to create an iconic image of one of my heroes.\u201d John Sterry wrote the album\u2019s second single, Day Turns to Night, as a tribute to his friend and mentor. Written shortly after Gill\u2019s death, it was not intended for release until Mayer \u201cheard it, cried for an hour, then insisted he include it\u201d, she said. Sterry, who joined the veteran post-punk band\u2019s remodelled line-up in 2012, explained that the \u201cunfiltered and honest\u201d lyrics \u201cpoured out in half an hour\u201d. Bassist/producer Thomas McNeice found the song too raw to work on at first. \u201cI had stop on the first day because the lyrics just got me,\u201d he said. The EP also includes new versions of Gang of Four\u2019s 1979 track Glass and 2019\u2019s Change the Locks. While the rerecordings were made in late 2019, Mayer said the songs\u2019 themes of security and civil liberty resonated with the current lockdown. Mayer recently led a \u201csocially distanced protest march\u201d on Downing Street to campaign about the crisis in care homes and personal protective equipment. She said she was appalled that Dominic Cummings undermined the lockdown with his trip to Durham. Gang of Four remain one of the most influential post-punk groups of all time. Formed in Leeds in 1976, they never had a Top 40 hit but their 1979 debut Entertainment! influenced artists from REM to U2, the Jam and St Vincent.

      "bodyText": "Four hours after Johns Hopkins University recorded that 100,000 American lives were lost to the coronavirus, Joe Biden released a solemn speech. \u201cMy fellow Americans, there are moments in our history so grim, so heart-rending, that they are forever fixed in each of our hearts as shared grief. Today is one of those moments,\u201d said Biden, speaking directly to the camera from an office adorned with American flags. It follows the release of a strategy by Biden on Thursday to use federal resources to drive coronavirus testing across the country. Trump, on the other hand, kept silent. Johns Hopkins announced the landmark death toll at 5.30pm on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Trump retweeted videos slating Republicans who pushed for an investigation into Russian election interference last year; lashed out at Twitter for factchecking his tweets; and sent out since deleted retweets of people praising him as \u201cthe greatest president in our history\u201d. Finally, he tweeted on Thursday at 9.37am to recognize \u201ca very sad milestone\u201d, without his usual capital letters and multiple exclamation marks. Trump is yet to release a full statement or video addressing the death toll. Earlier on Thursday, Trump had used Twitter to claim that social media platforms which intend to factcheck the president will be subject to harsh repercussions. \u201cThis will be a Big Day for Social Media and FAIRNESS!\u201d Trump tweeted at 8.37am, 12 hours after the death toll had been announced. The message appeared to be a threat to Twitter \u2013 which for the first time on Tuesday began applying factchecking disclaimers on Trump\u2019s tweets, which claimed mail-in elections result in widespread voter fraud. The move from the social media giant seemed to have Trump particularly riled up, as he continued to tweet about Republicans who previously had their accounts muted during an attempt by Twitter intended to decrease \u201ctroll-like behaviors that distort and detract from the public conversation\u201d. Trump also retweeted a video attacking Republicans such as Lindsey Graham and Mitch McConnell for pushing for an investigation into Russian election interference. Meanwhile, Biden, who has lost a wife, a daughter and a son in his lifetime, said to the American public: \u201cThe day will come when the memory of your loved one will bring a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eyes.\u201d",

It has been replicated \u2013 albeit more mildly \u2013 in subsequent flu pandemics.</p>\n    <p>How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there evidence of coronavirus coming back in a second wave?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/singapore-coronavirus-increase-revives-fears-of-post-lockdown-surge\">resurgence in infections</a>&nbsp;despite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.</p>\n    <p>Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/singapores-cramped-migrant-worker-dorms-hide-covid-19-surge-risk\">cramped dormitory accommodation</a>&nbsp;used by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.</p>\n    <p>Singapore\u2019s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are experts worried about?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.</p>\n    <p>The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.</p>\n    <p>In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune individuals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/coronavirus-vaccine-when-will-we-have-one\">a vaccine still months away</a>, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterbeaumont\"><b>Peter Beaumont</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>France <br></strong>Phase two of the country\u2019s exit begins next week.

      "body": "<p>Curbing the coronavirus outbreak involves a familiar mantra: test, trace, isolate. As of this week, the government will begin to roll out the second part of this strategy. In theory, contact tracers will call or text people in England who test positive for coronavirus, asking them to provide a list of everyone they have met for longer than 15 minutes, who will then receive a message instructing them to self-isolate for 14 days (Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are rolling out separate programmes).</p> <p>But already, England\u2019s contact-tracing strategy looks set to be hobbled by the government\u2019s reluctance to involve local authorities and regional public health expertise in its coronavirus response from the outset, and its dogmatic commitment to outsourcing health services to the private sector. &nbsp;</p> <p>Baroness Dido Harding, who is leading the programme of testing and tracing, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BenPBradshaw/status/1265943777589551104?s=20\">recently conceded</a> that the system won\u2019t be fully operational at the local level until late June. Elsewhere, contact tracers have spoken of difficulties accessing the government system, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rachaelvenables/status/1265914400441012226\">describing it as a \u201ccomplete shambles\u201d</a>. One recruit reportedly said their training amounted to reading a pdf and taking an online quiz - \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/SamCoatesSky/status/1265738582926544896\">all of which takes an hour</a>\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>For an idea of how contact tracing works best, look to Germany.

      "bodyText": "Curbing the coronavirus outbreak involves a familiar mantra: test, trace, isolate. As of this week, the government will begin to roll out the second part of this strategy. In theory, contact tracers will call or text people in England who test positive for coronavirus, asking them to provide a list of everyone they have met for longer than 15 minutes, who will then receive a message instructing them to self-isolate for 14 days (Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are rolling out separate programmes). But already, England\u2019s contact-tracing strategy looks set to be hobbled by the government\u2019s reluctance to involve local authorities and regional public health expertise in its coronavirus response from the outset, and its dogmatic commitment to outsourcing health services to the private sector. Baroness Dido Harding, who is leading the programme of testing and tracing, recently conceded that the system won\u2019t be fully operational at the local level until late June. Elsewhere, contact tracers have spoken of difficulties accessing the government system, describing it as a \u201ccomplete shambles\u201d. One recruit reportedly said their training amounted to reading a pdf and taking an online quiz - \u201call of which takes an hour\u201d. For an idea of how contact tracing works best, look to Germany. When interviewed about the country\u2019s successful contact-tracing programme recently on Newsnight, the German minister of health described how the response had worked through the country\u2019s federal structures and with the 400 different \u201ccommunities\u201d that are responsible for the track and trace system. England, on the other hand, started by pursuing a call-centre model run by Serco and staffed with customer service employees paid just above minimum wage. Recruitment agencies tasked with finding contact tracers are reportedly offering an hourly wage of \u00a38.72 to staff with experience of \u201ctelephone or face-to-face customer services\u201d. Viewing contact tracers as customer service call handlers may be a good business model for Serco, but I would like to know if a single public health specialist in this country thinks this was a good idea. Contact tracing is fundamentally a behavioural intervention; when used well, contact tracers don\u2019t just deliver messages about quarantine but also provide reactive advice and reassurance, and can act as important \u201ceyes and ears\u201d, gathering local intelligence that can be passed on to other members of the public health team. In Korea, health authorities deployed teams of specialist epidemiological intelligence service officers. In Massachusetts, local departments of health carried out contact tracing assisted by volunteers from the public health community, graduate students, Peace Corps volunteers, medical assistants and retired nurses, all of whom were paid more than twice the local minimum wage. This government\u2019s enthusiasm for outsourcing and centralisation has been an Achilles heel in its coronavirus strategy. Although it recently announced an extra \u00a3300m to support local authorities in England to deliver the new test and trace strategies, these authorities will have their work cut out to quickly stitch together a coherent and organised programme from a confusing landscape of NHS commissioners and providers, parallel central initiatives, outsourced private contractors, and the recently established Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC).

It sets a high standard for other nations, using the rebuilding of coronavirus-ravaged economies to tackle the even greater threat of the climate emergency, in principle at least.</p> <p>With the world fast approaching the point when climate chaos becomes inevitable, how the trillions of recovery dollars \u2013 or euros \u2013 are spent is a use-it-or-lose-it moment, so what the EU does really matters. Climate change is a global crisis, meaning all nations must act and some must lead the way.</p> <p>Under Donald Trump, the US is slashing green protections while the biggest polluter, China, is sending mixed messages by backing coal power stations as part of its recovery. The UK, host of the next critical UN summit, has been all but silent.</p> <p>The EU\u2019s plan seeks to <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-eu-budget-recovery-climate-factbox/factbox-key-climate-spending-in-eus-green-recovery-plan-idUKKBN2331RB?utm_campaign=Carbon%20Brief%20Daily%20Briefing&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter\">pour money into emissions-busting sectors</a>: \u20ac91bn (\u00a381bn) a year for home energy efficiency and green heating, \u20ac25bn of renewable energy, and \u20ac20bn for clean cars over two years, plus 2m charging points in five years. Up to \u20ac60bn will go to zero-emissions trains and the production of 1m tonnes of clean hydrogen is planned.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf0d90d7af3172ce965817353bab0ac46a02982f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf0d90d7af3172ce965817353bab0ac46a02982f/0_303_4043_2426/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A charging point for electric cars in Gdansk, Poland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A charging point for electric cars in Gdansk, Poland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At least a million green jobs will be created, with workers in polluting industries helped into new roles, a critical part of the plan. Increasing the Just Transition Fund more than fivefold to \u20ac40bn minimises the risk of protests against green measures, especially in states with the heaviest coal use such as Poland, Germany and Romania, which will be among the biggest recipients. This is politically necessary, despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/05/green-stimulus-can-repair-global-economy-and-climate-study-says\">investment in the green economy already being a no-brainer</a>.</p> <p>The EU plan may even have a direct impact on the rest of the world, with a border tax on carbon-intensive industrial imports from other nations <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a165a7c9-85d8-4ec9-9a1a-70d86412ac07\">potentially raising up to \u20ac14bn</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>But despite the European commission saying \u201cpublic investments in the recovery should respect the green oath to \u2018do no harm\u2019\u201d, critics worry there are no hard guarantees against the money seeping into dirty projects. The Covid-19 crisis has seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/17/coronavirus-profiteers-condemned-as-polluters-gain-bailout-billions\">polluters lobbying hard for bailouts</a>.</p> <p>The Just Transition Fund will be routed through the European Investment Bank, but campaigners say its climate criteria allow the backing of gas projects that would lock in emissions for years. Another key fund, the \u20ac150bn React EU programme, allows member states to decide how to spend the money \u2013 most of the almost \u20ac2tn in coronavirus rescue funds spent by EU nations so far has had no green guarantees.</p> <p>Worse, say critics, climate conditions on large parts of the main EU budget have been lifted for three years because of the pandemic. The proportion of the budget reserved for climate projects remains stuck at 25%, despite demands by the European parliament and many others to raise it.</p> <p>The commission rejects these criticisms, saying the \u201cobjective of the green economy is present throughout the whole management of the funds\u201d. Whether this oversight proves effective will be the critical test.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/19/sign-up-to-the-green-light-email\">Sign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nonetheless, green-leaning business and investor groups have welcomed the recovery package, calling it bold and substantive. To turn it into reality, there will now be weeks of wrangling between EU countries to finalise the deal.&nbsp;</p> <p>We must hope that they, and the rest of the world\u2019s nations, in turn, bear in mind the words of the EU commission president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/16/who-is-ursula-von-der-leyen-the-new-eu-commission-president\">Ursula von der Leyen</a>: \u201cSooner or later we will find a vaccine for the coronavirus.

      "bodyText": "The European commission has put down a marker for the world with its green recovery package. It sets a high standard for other nations, using the rebuilding of coronavirus-ravaged economies to tackle the even greater threat of the climate emergency, in principle at least. With the world fast approaching the point when climate chaos becomes inevitable, how the trillions of recovery dollars \u2013 or euros \u2013 are spent is a use-it-or-lose-it moment, so what the EU does really matters. Climate change is a global crisis, meaning all nations must act and some must lead the way. Under Donald Trump, the US is slashing green protections while the biggest polluter, China, is sending mixed messages by backing coal power stations as part of its recovery. The UK, host of the next critical UN summit, has been all but silent. The EU\u2019s plan seeks to pour money into emissions-busting sectors: \u20ac91bn (\u00a381bn) a year for home energy efficiency and green heating, \u20ac25bn of renewable energy, and \u20ac20bn for clean cars over two years, plus 2m charging points in five years. Up to \u20ac60bn will go to zero-emissions trains and the production of 1m tonnes of clean hydrogen is planned. At least a million green jobs will be created, with workers in polluting industries helped into new roles, a critical part of the plan. Increasing the Just Transition Fund more than fivefold to \u20ac40bn minimises the risk of protests against green measures, especially in states with the heaviest coal use such as Poland, Germany and Romania, which will be among the biggest recipients. This is politically necessary, despite investment in the green economy already being a no-brainer. The EU plan may even have a direct impact on the rest of the world, with a border tax on carbon-intensive industrial imports from other nations potentially raising up to \u20ac14bn. But despite the European commission saying \u201cpublic investments in the recovery should respect the green oath to \u2018do no harm\u2019\u201d, critics worry there are no hard guarantees against the money seeping into dirty projects. The Covid-19 crisis has seen polluters lobbying hard for bailouts. The Just Transition Fund will be routed through the European Investment Bank, but campaigners say its climate criteria allow the backing of gas projects that would lock in emissions for years. Another key fund, the \u20ac150bn React EU programme, allows member states to decide how to spend the money \u2013 most of the almost \u20ac2tn in coronavirus rescue funds spent by EU nations so far has had no green guarantees. Worse, say critics, climate conditions on large parts of the main EU budget have been lifted for three years because of the pandemic. The proportion of the budget reserved for climate projects remains stuck at 25%, despite demands by the European parliament and many others to raise it. The commission rejects these criticisms, saying the \u201cobjective of the green economy is present throughout the whole management of the funds\u201d. Whether this oversight proves effective will be the critical test. Nonetheless, green-leaning business and investor groups have welcomed the recovery package, calling it bold and substantive. To turn it into reality, there will now be weeks of wrangling between EU countries to finalise the deal. We must hope that they, and the rest of the world\u2019s nations, in turn, bear in mind the words of the EU commission president, Ursula von der Leyen: \u201cSooner or later we will find a vaccine for the coronavirus. But there is no vaccine for climate change. Therefore [we] need a recovery plan designed for the future.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Even leaders who thrive by bullying people have realised that they can\u2019t bully a pandemic. But nor does caution <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/17/putin-johnson-bolsonaro-and-trump-men-too-macho-for-masks\" title=\"\">fit</a> easily with their macho political image. Their temptation has been to let it run its course instead. Now the facts are catching up with them.</p> <p>The Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, has repeatedly dismissed the risks from coronavirus, defied his own government\u2019s advice by meeting crowds of supporters, and pushed states to reopen beauty parlours as the death toll climbed. This week it passed 25,000, and a study suggested it could hit 125,000 by early August. Brazil ranks second in the world for recorded cases \u2013 all the more shocking given its strong performance in the previous HIV and Zika virus health crises.</p> <p>Mr Bolsonaro\u2019s friend Donald Trump has now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/jair-bolsonaro-under-pressure-after-trump-bans-flights-from-brazil\" title=\"\">imposed a travel ban</a> on non-US citizens coming from Brazil. Yet the US is <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\" title=\"\">leading the world</a> for coronavirus cases and fatalities, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/27/us-coronavirus-victims-stories\" title=\"\">100,000 deaths</a>, and the toll is rising as the lockdown eases. Mr Trump brushed aside warnings of the approaching crisis, failed to prepare his country and has pushed for reopening in his desperation to see some improvement in economic conditions ahead of November\u2019s elections. Third in the tally of confirmed cases is Russia, where Vladimir Putin announced an end to the lockdown he imposed at the end of March even as infections hit a record high. More than 375,000 have now tested positive, though the death toll remains strikingly \u2013 many say suspiciously \u2013 low. Though officials <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/russia-to-hold-victory-day-parade-on-24-june-says-vladimir-putin\" title=\"\">claim</a> the rate of infections has begun to slow, the polls suggest that the Russian president, like Mr Trump and Mr Bolsonaro, is now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/he-is-failing-putins-approval-slides-as-covid-19-grips-russia\" title=\"\">paying a political price</a>.</p> <p>India is further behind, with around 150,000 cases, but catching up fast. The disastrous failure of Narendra Modi, the prime minister, to address the needs of millions of migrant workers when imposing lockdown created a humanitarian crisis and helped to facilitate the disease\u2019s spread through the country. Now he is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f86d3fda-9e72-11ea-b65d-489c67b0d85d\" title=\"\">easing restrictions</a> without introducing other effective measures such as test and trace, effectively telling Indians that they must just accept the risk.</p> <p>Last week, the World Health Organization <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/20/new-coronavirus-cases-across-the-world-jump-by-the-most-in-a-single-day-who-says.html\" title=\"\">noted</a> that these four countries accounted for two-thirds of all new cases. Instead of prioritising saving lives while finding ways to ameliorate the suffering caused by lockdowns, leaders have made the same cynical gamble: taking the shortest route to reopening their economies, blaming anyone more cautious for the lost jobs and hungry households \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/15/the-guardian-view-on-the-who-and-coronavirus-trumps-blame-game\" title=\"\">anyone convenient</a> for the death toll resulting from their own inaction.</p> <p>Abandoned by their national leaders, many states, cities, businesses and institutions have taken matters into their own hands to reduce the spread of the disease. So have individuals and communities. In Brazil\u2019s favelas, community organisers and volunteers are organising public information campaigns and hiring private medical teams.</p> <p>These welcome efforts may reduce the damage, but they cannot avert it entirely \u2013 as the rising death tolls show. These men have sold a cult of strength that mocks and dismisses the weak, yet are too feeble to shoulder the burden of responsibility. They use their power to protect not their countries but themselves. Will they ultimately pay, as their people have?</p>",

      "bodyText": "Even leaders who thrive by bullying people have realised that they can\u2019t bully a pandemic. But nor does caution fit easily with their macho political image. Their temptation has been to let it run its course instead. Now the facts are catching up with them. The Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, has repeatedly dismissed the risks from coronavirus, defied his own government\u2019s advice by meeting crowds of supporters, and pushed states to reopen beauty parlours as the death toll climbed. This week it passed 25,000, and a study suggested it could hit 125,000 by early August. Brazil ranks second in the world for recorded cases \u2013 all the more shocking given its strong performance in the previous HIV and Zika virus health crises. Mr Bolsonaro\u2019s friend Donald Trump has now imposed a travel ban on non-US citizens coming from Brazil. Yet the US is leading the world for coronavirus cases and fatalities, with 100,000 deaths, and the toll is rising as the lockdown eases. Mr Trump brushed aside warnings of the approaching crisis, failed to prepare his country and has pushed for reopening in his desperation to see some improvement in economic conditions ahead of November\u2019s elections. Third in the tally of confirmed cases is Russia, where Vladimir Putin announced an end to the lockdown he imposed at the end of March even as infections hit a record high. More than 375,000 have now tested positive, though the death toll remains strikingly \u2013 many say suspiciously \u2013 low. Though officials claim the rate of infections has begun to slow, the polls suggest that the Russian president, like Mr Trump and Mr Bolsonaro, is now paying a political price. India is further behind, with around 150,000 cases, but catching up fast. The disastrous failure of Narendra Modi, the prime minister, to address the needs of millions of migrant workers when imposing lockdown created a humanitarian crisis and helped to facilitate the disease\u2019s spread through the country. Now he is easing restrictions without introducing other effective measures such as test and trace, effectively telling Indians that they must just accept the risk. Last week, the World Health Organization noted that these four countries accounted for two-thirds of all new cases. Instead of prioritising saving lives while finding ways to ameliorate the suffering caused by lockdowns, leaders have made the same cynical gamble: taking the shortest route to reopening their economies, blaming anyone more cautious for the lost jobs and hungry households \u2013 and anyone convenient for the death toll resulting from their own inaction. Abandoned by their national leaders, many states, cities, businesses and institutions have taken matters into their own hands to reduce the spread of the disease. So have individuals and communities. In Brazil\u2019s favelas, community organisers and volunteers are organising public information campaigns and hiring private medical teams. These welcome efforts may reduce the damage, but they cannot avert it entirely \u2013 as the rising death tolls show. These men have sold a cult of strength that mocks and dismisses the weak, yet are too feeble to shoulder the burden of responsibility. They use their power to protect not their countries but themselves. Will they ultimately pay, as their people have?",

At the outset, the UK\u2019s different governments took similar approaches.

Boris Johnson and his ministers have announced arbitrary goals \u2013 often under short-term pressure \u2013 and have then battled, generally unsuccessfully and at human cost, to meet them. The approach has never been comprehensive, well explained or effective. Among the most shocking examples have been shortages of personal protective equipment, testing failures for nursing homes and the refusal to test at ports and airports.</p> <p>This week\u2019s virus tracing measures in England are the latest example of this shambolic approach. Mr Johnson said on 20 May that a \u201cworld beating\u201d system to test and trace for coronavirus would be in place by 1 June. Easing the lockdown is umbilically linked to the need for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/28/how-will-no-10-decide-to-ease-lockdown-and-reopen-schools\" title=\"\">such a system</a>. Without it the dangers of a second wave of cases are very real. Yet it is now clear that the tracing system in England will be much more muddled, modest and incomplete than Mr Johnson claimed. A much trumpeted app does not yet exist. It will not be ready before late June. A slower, less efficient and more labour-intensive tracing system is now starting to come into operation, but there are numerous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/coronavirus-testing-hit-struggle-match-results-with-nhs-records\" title=\"\">teething problems</a>.</p> <p>Nevertheless the UK government is pushing ahead. Mr Johnson set the ball rolling in his botched broadcast on 10 May; now, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/28/uk-coronavirus-live-test-and-trace-gets-under-way-in-england-and-scotland\" title=\"\">right on cue</a>, he has managed to get scientific cover for the move from Sage, though <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/28/coronavirus-infection-rate-too-high-second-wave\" title=\"\">other scientists</a> have different views. He has also brought forward other measures from July to mid-June and been followed by the ever greedy Premier League. This is chaos waiting to happen. Mr Johnson\u2019s eagerness is driven not just by his generally slapdash approach but also by his desperation to drown out the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/27/tory-anger-at-dominic-cummings-grows-as-dozens-of-mps-defy-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">Cummings scandal</a>. It seems all too likely that he will fail on both fronts, combining a mismanaged easing, which risks causing a spike in Covid-19 cases, with a stupid and damaging attempt to keep Mr Cummings in post.</p> <p>Meanwhile in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s government has proceeded in an altogether more cautious, logical and planned manner. Mark Drakeford in Wales and Arlene Foster in Northern Ireland have done the same, but Scotland\u2019s first minister has now committed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/people-scotland-can-meet-groups-eight-lockdown-eased\" title=\"\">some easing</a> from the end of this week. Many of these measures have been permitted in England for nearly three weeks, but Ms Sturgeon\u2019s message remains a more careful one and she has done nothing to encourage reckless headlines of the kind that Mr Johnson ignited so stupidly earlier in May. Travelling more than six miles in Scotland to take exercise will remain discouraged, for example. In England, one can travel 260 miles or more.</p> <p>Scotland\u2019s approach is far closer to public opinion in all parts of the UK, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/28/tories-shires-keir-starmer-boris-johnson-coronavirus-dominic-cummings\" title=\"\">England included</a>. One of the great lessons of the pandemic has been that governments that trust their publics, level with them, and prepare and explain their next moves properly, are the ones that enjoy public confidence for their handling. Ms Sturgeon, Mr Drakeford and Ms Foster continue to do that. Mr Johnson, as this week has underscored, sometimes seems to barely care. The people of England deserve so much better.</p>",

Mr Johnson set the ball rolling in his botched broadcast on 10 May; now, right on cue, he has managed to get scientific cover for the move from Sage, though other scientists have different views. He has also brought forward other measures from July to mid-June and been followed by the ever greedy Premier League. This is chaos waiting to happen. Mr Johnson\u2019s eagerness is driven not just by his generally slapdash approach but also by his desperation to drown out the Cummings scandal. It seems all too likely that he will fail on both fronts, combining a mismanaged easing, which risks causing a spike in Covid-19 cases, with a stupid and damaging attempt to keep Mr Cummings in post. Meanwhile in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s government has proceeded in an altogether more cautious, logical and planned manner. Mark Drakeford in Wales and Arlene Foster in Northern Ireland have done the same, but Scotland\u2019s first minister has now committed to some easing from the end of this week. Many of these measures have been permitted in England for nearly three weeks, but Ms Sturgeon\u2019s message remains a more careful one and she has done nothing to encourage reckless headlines of the kind that Mr Johnson ignited so stupidly earlier in May. Travelling more than six miles in Scotland to take exercise will remain discouraged, for example. In England, one can travel 260 miles or more. Scotland\u2019s approach is far closer to public opinion in all parts of the UK, England included. One of the great lessons of the pandemic has been that governments that trust their publics, level with them, and prepare and explain their next moves properly, are the ones that enjoy public confidence for their handling. Ms Sturgeon, Mr Drakeford and Ms Foster continue to do that. Mr Johnson, as this week has underscored, sometimes seems to barely care. The people of England deserve so much better.",

      "bodyText": "Potential bidders for Virgin Australia have expressed anxiety over the lack of financial support for the stricken airline from the Morrison government, Guardian Australia has learned. Sources close to the sales process said four shortlisted purchasers, who are due to lodge indicative bids for the airline on Friday, were becoming increasingly worried about a period estimated at between four to six weeks during which the airline will have no cash. The airline\u2019s administrator, Vaughan Strawbridge, has recently indicated Virgin Australia may need a bailout to bridge the gap between any sale late next month and a creditors\u2019 meeting likely to be held in August. Unions have also raised concerns about the role of the government\u2019s liasion with Virgin, former Macquarie Group chief executive Nicholas Moore, who Transport Workers Union national secretary Michael Kaine told Guardian Australia has become an impediment to the sales process because he has no power to make decisions. Kaine said Moore was like a sheriff without a badge. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to give him the badge, the authority, and the chequebook, the money, and let him get on with the job,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. The government has been approached for comment. Virgin Australia\u2019s crumbling financial position \u2013 it had just $100m in the bank a fortnight ago and continues to burn cash \u2013 and the lack of clarity from government has fuelled fears among potential buyers that the sale process might fail and Virgin Australia collapse into liquidation. A complete collapse of Virgin Australia would throw 10,000 people into unemployment during a brutal economic downturn and risk handing rival Qantas a near-monopoly over Australian air travel. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not guaranteed this airline will fly again,\u201d one source with knowledge of the bidding process told Guardian Australia. Another well-placed source said bidders were \u201cnervous at the moment\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019ll just walk away,\u201d the source said. Virgin Australia\u2019s directors called in administrators after the Morrison government rebuffed its repeated pleas for government help to see it through the almost complete grounding of its 144 airplanes due to coronavirus travel restrictions. The airline owes more than $6.8bn to creditors including aircraft financiers and leasing companies, bondholders, suppliers and employees. As of Thursday, there were four bidders in the race \u2013 American investment group Bain Capital, global investor Cyrus Capital, a consortium made up of investment group Oaktree Capital and specialist airline investor Indigo Partners and Australian private equity group BGH Capital. The bids stand to be whittled to two after indicative offers are lodged on Friday. However, the process has been complicated by the continuing interest of Canadian giant Brookfield Asset Management, which had previously been regarded as a leading contender. Despite pulling out of the process, Brookfield remains interested in participating in the purchase of Virgin Australia in some fashion. It also remains indirectly involved as a shareholder in Oaktree. In briefings with stakeholders, the four bidders have set out radically different plans for a reborn Virgin Australia. Sources said BGH plans to restart as a bare-bones airline, with just a handful of planes, which would result in the loss of most of the 10,000 jobs at Virgin Australia. The Oaktree and Indigo consortium plans to turn Virgin Australia into a budget airline, the sources said. Cyrus Capital wants to maintain a stripped-down version of the current airline, by reducing the number of different aircraft it flies and cutting some regional and international routes, while Bain Capital is regarded as the front-runner because it has spent significant resources setting up a well-regarded team of local advisors. However, all four potential bidders, and Brookfield, are understood to have expressed interest in some kind of government help to bridge the gap between agreeing to buy the airline and getting approval from the creditors. Options that have been canvassed include a government loan, the commonwealth purchasing a stake in the airline, the extension of jobkeeper payments to Virgin Australia employees after the scheme is supposed to finish in September, or a government guarantee of tickets sold by the airline. Bidders also want the government to stop airports taking away crucial take-off and landing slots, which are usually allocated on a \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d basis, and seek a raft of tax and fee concessions from state governments. Sources close to the process said time for the government to make its position clear was running short because, in addition to the cash burn problem, Virgin needed to be able to sell tickets for travel in August, after the administration is due to end. This was difficult when customers were uncertain they would be able to fly or get their money back, the sources said. Kaine said he met with Moore on Tuesday afternoon to raise his concerns. \u201cGovernment inaction is now having a material effect on the quality of the airline that gets back in the air \u2013 if it can get back in the air,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s already one bidder that\u2019s sat outside of the process because they\u2019re concerned about the funding gap.\u201d The government remains tight-lipped about its willingness to support Virgin Australia through the process. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said: \u201cThe government supports a market-led solution for Virgin Australia.\u201d \u201cWe will continue to work closely with the administrator.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The historic decline in jobs and incomes as a result of Covid-19 and associated restrictions may have come to a halt in May, according to a new ANU study. The ANU\u2019s Centre for Social Research and Methods found that \u2013 with dramatically improved health results and easing restrictions \u2013 employment has levelled out at 58% and average hours worked actually increased from 32.3 per week to 32.8 in May. Despite improvements in wellbeing and job prospects, the study warns more than half of Australians are still anxious about Covid-19, almost a third think it is very likely they will be infected in the next six months and more than a third of the population are lonely at least some of the time. The ANU\u2019s longitudinal survey of more than 3,200 Australians predicted a loss of 670,000 jobs in April \u2013 close to the official figure of 600,000 lost jobs measured by the Australian Bureau of Statistics heralding the largest contraction since the Great Depression. The latest edition of the survey, conducted on 12 May, just days after restrictions began to ease, found the employment rate had arrested its decline, nudging down slightly from 58.3% to 58%. The report\u2019s co-author, Nicholas Biddle, said \u201cthe fact that employment outcomes have not continued to worsen appears to have translated into a significantly more positive outlook for the future within the Australian workforce\u201d. People expecting to lose their jobs over the next 12 months fell from 24.4% in April to 20.6% in May. The proportion who thought there was no chance they would lose their job rose from 34.6% in April to 39.2% in May. Household after-tax weekly income has also slightly improved, increasing from $1,622 in April to $1,652 in May. Australians in the lowest household income bracket continued to enjoy the greatest percentage gains, with the lowest decile experiencing a 39% pay boost from February to May in large part due to jobkeeper wage subsidies and the doubling of the jobseeker unemployment benefit. On Thursday the Reserve Bank governor, Phil Lowe, warned against withdrawing these payments too early, telling the Senate Covid-19 committee that \u201cif the labour market is not improving we will need to keep the fiscal support, some way or other\u201d. Although unemployment sits at 6.2%, the Treasury believes the figure is in line with estimates of 10% unemployment once those who stopped searching for work due to restrictions are factored in. Scott Morrison has insisted that fiscal supports are temporary \u2013 even likening them to \u201cmedication\u201d the economy should not become accustomed to \u2013 although the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has left the door open to \u201cfurther support\u201d to the hardest hit industries, such as tourism. Labor has warned against withdrawing economic supports too soon and called for jobkeeper to be extended, although the opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, believes the $1,100 fortnightly rate of jobseeker should not continue, as it now sits higher than the aged pension. The ANU study found life satisfaction had declined from 6.98 out of 10 in January, to 6.51 in April, before bouncing back to 6.86 in May \u2013 \u201calmost back to what it was prior to the spread of Covid-19\u201d, according to the report\u2019s co-author, Matthew Gray. Fewer people reported being lonely at least some of the time, down from 45.5% in April to 35.8% in May. Overall Australians are less worried about the pandemic, with 57.4% saying they were worried or anxious as a consequence of Covid-19, down from 66.4% in April. \u201cHowever, young people are still doing it tough,\u201d Gray said. \u201cOur analysis shows that 18- to 24-year olds still feel the most anxious about Covid-19. \u201cIn April 76.7% of them felt this way \u2013 the largest percentage of any age cohort in the country.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions fell slightly last year, according to official data released on Friday, as new clean energy plants came online and the drought continued to limit farming output. But the reduction was largely wiped out by an increase in carbon pollution from big industrial sites, particularly liquefied natural gas plants off the country\u2019s northern coast. Emissions were down 0.9% compared with 2018, but were still higher than the previous two years. According to revised emissions data, they have dipped 1.5% since the Coalition was elected in 2013 after falling about 14% while Labor was in power for the previous six years. The biggest chunk of the reduction last year was in electricity, which fell 2.9%. It was largely the result of record renewable energy investment in 2018, driven in part by the national renewable energy target. The target, roughly equating to 23% of electricity generation on the national grid coming from clean sources, was filled last year and has not been replaced. The Reserve Bank recently noted that large-scale renewable energy investment fell 50% last year compared with 2018. Emissions from agriculture fell substantially, by nearly 6%, as an unprecedented drought led to significant reduction in stocks and both financial and carbon dioxide output. Together, the cut from electricity and agriculture was 9.5m tonnes of carbon dioxide. But emissions from stationary energy, which includes the manufacturing, construction and commercial sectors, were up 2.7%. Fugitive emissions, released during coal and gas extraction, were estimated to have increased 2.5%. It meant the overall decline for the year was 5m tonnes. In a statement released on Thursday, Angus Taylor, the energy and emissions reduction minister, said emissions were 13.7% below 2005 levels. This is relevant because the government has set a target under the Paris agreement of emissions being 26-28% less than in 2005 by 2030. In answers to parliament earlier this month, Taylor indicated Australia was not on track to meet the 2030 target unless it used credits carried over from the first global climate agreement, the Kyoto Protocol. Legal advice has suggested those credits have no force in the Paris agreement. Australia is the only nation planning to use the credits, and several countries have objected to their use. On Thursday, Taylor also said Australia was forecast to officially \u201cbeat\u201d its Kyoto target \u2013 a 5% cut below 2000 levels by 2020 \u2013 by 411m tonnes on 1 July. \u201cThis is an achievement all Australians can be proud of,\u201d he said. Australia is meeting its Kyoto target in part through the use of carbon accounting rules. In reality, national emissions are estimated to be 2.4% lower than in 2000. Taylor emphasised a significant percentage of national emissions were released by export industries. He said emissions generated for domestic consumption were down 33% since 2005. \u201cImportantly, our domestic emissions have fallen at the same time demand for Australian energy exports remains strong, which will be vital to our post Covid-19 economic recovery,\u201d he said. The minister has backed gas as being key to driving economic recovery after the shutdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The government is resisting calls internationally and at home to set a target of net zero emissions by 2050. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found global carbon dioxide emissions were likely to need to fall 45% between 2010 and 2030 and reach net zero by about 2050 if global heating was to be limited to 1.5C. The latest Australian emissions data includes a preliminary estimate of the impact of the pandemic on emissions from the national electricity grid only. It suggests they were down only 2.8% compared with a year earlier, little more than they would have expected to be if the economy had not shut down. It is consistent with an analysis by the Australia Institute, which found the country\u2019s coal-dominated grid had been little affected as large industry had mostly continued to operate.",

It gives businesses with a turnover of $50m or less to get a credit for the PAYG tax they would usually pay on behalf of employees.</p> \n<p>Each business received a minimum of $20,000 and up to $100,000 in two payments and they didn\u2019t need to do anything other than lodge their usual business activity statements.</p> \n<p>The credits for those who filed their BAS monthly flowed swiftly and gave them 300% in the first month. This meant that many did not then need to write cheques to the ATO during the crisis and could use the credit against other liabilities like GST payments.</p> \n<p>Combined with jobkeeper, which also injects money into businesses by way of a wage payment (that must be passed on to the employeee) it appears to have forestalled a mass of collapses, particularly in retail and hospitality.</p> \n<p>Whether businesses can survive beyond September without these cash injections depends entirely on how fast the economy comes back. If as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/21/australias-treasury-chief-says-government-should-worry-about-jobs-and-not-rising-debt-during-coronavirus-crisis\">Treasury secretary, Steven Kennedy, suggested</a> last week, we are heading more for a U than a V-shaped recovery, then some additional support for cash flow may be essential.</p> \n<p>However, other measures have proved less successful.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/28/the-hardest-time-in-my-life-how-service-providers-shoulder-the-burden-of-free-childcare\">'The hardest time in my life': how service providers shoulder the burden of free childcare</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>The devil in the writeoff detail</h2> \n<p>One of the early business Covid-19 stimulus measures \u2013 an enhanced instant asset writeoff to encourage businesses to invest \u2013 appears to have fizzed because of fears about the direction of the economy and disrupted supply lines during the crisis.</p> \n<p>The measure, announced in the first round of stimulus measures on March 12, allows businesses to claim the full value of equipment they buy up to the value of $150,000 (up from $30,000) against their income for the 2019-20 financial year.</p> \n<p>The writeoff is now available to not just small business but businesses with a turnover of up to $500m. But there\u2019s a catch. The equipment must be paid for and delivered to the business by 30 June.</p> \n<p>Hard data on the uptake of the concession won\u2019t be available until companies lodge their tax returns but anecdotal evidence (and perhaps common sense) suggests that many business owners, faced with uncertainty, are choosing to preserve their cash rather than buy new items.</p> \n<p>For instance, motor vehicle sales were down 48.5% in April, compared to the same month last year, according to the industry sales tracker, V-Facts. Sales were already sluggish in calendar 2019, down 8% in compared to 2018.</p> \n<p>V-Facts doesn\u2019t separate business and private sales, but purchases of Hi-Luxes, the ubiquitous tradie vehicle, were down 35.5% in April.</p> \n<p>\u201cI want to say it\u2019s fantastic: $150,000 gives farmers the capacity to buy a major piece of kit whereas $30,000 was not sufficient,\u201d said the small business ombudsman, Kate Carnell.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut you have to have something to write it off against. It\u2019s not a grant, it\u2019s an immediate writeoff of assets to $150,000,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>For farmers likely to get a decent crop this winter, a new harvester or tractor might be just what they need, but they have had big hits to their incomes over the past 12 months or more during the drought.</p> \n<p>Then there is the problem of disrupted supply lines.</p> \n<p>Around the world, factories such as John Deere, which makes farm machinery, have been affected by shutdowns or have pivoted to making Covid protective gear.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/27/work-in-progress-a-60bn-miscalculation-could-make-jobkeeper-fairer-and-lead-to-quicker-recovery\">Work in progress: a $60bn miscalculation could make jobkeeper fairer and lead to quicker recovery</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a great incentive for business to invest and that flows right through the economy. But there are issues around the rules. Not just ordering and paying for it but it must be delivered by June 30,\u201d says Carnell.</p> \n<p>That means businesses have to take a gamble on equipment coming from offshore. Carnell would like to see the rules on delivery relaxed so that companies, who can now see the light at the end of the lockdown, can take advantage.</p> \n<p>Surprisingly there are some bright spots. It seems Australians can\u2019t do without coffee.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"d1e0044870761de50e8c1e033a6853c2152d8a0d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1e0044870761de50e8c1e033a6853c2152d8a0d/0_0_4002_2668/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Baristas make takeaway coffees at the Lucky Penny Caf\u00e9 in South Yarra, Melbourne.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Baristas make takeaway coffees at the Lucky Penny Caf\u00e9 in South Yarra, Melbourne.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Speed Media/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Rob Maisano, managing director of the Coffee Machine Warehouse in Clayton Victoria said the stimulus measure had been good for his business and he had been busier than usual.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe usually keep about a thousand machines in stock.

They were given a six-month reprieve from personal liability for insolvent trading for \u201cany debts incurred in the ordinary course of the company\u2019s business\u201d.</p> \n<p>The debts are still payable and insolvency experts are predicting an escalation in October when six months expires.</p> \n<p>Michael Catchpoole, partner at Corrs Chambers Westgarth and an insolvency expert says with the exception of Virgin Australia and a few others, there has been a general deferral of insolvency applications.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat means we\u2019ve kicked the can down the road with some of these companies. It could be much more difficult to restructure. Cash burn will have increased and creditors are likely to be less sympathetic.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have seen a tidal wave of equity raisings and that will have helped. But there is an opportunity cost that is lost if companies delay restructuring. It will be harder for companies to restructure if they have exhausted their reserves, especially as we are less likely to have a V-shaped recovery.\u201d</p> \n<p>Catchpoole doesn\u2019t think there will be an avalanche of collapses in October but there will be \u201ca recommencement of push factors\u201d which will lead to an increase in filings for bankruptcy or insolvency.</p> \n<p>It will range from the very large public companies to small and medium-sized enterprises , he says.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"99543dac0f62249e5a91bf1491a2d7c47ff2e4e2\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99543dac0f62249e5a91bf1491a2d7c47ff2e4e2/0_0_3500_2336/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Virgin Australia plane at Sydney airport.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Insolvency expert Michael Catchpoole says, with the exception of Virgin Australia and few others, there has been a general deferral of insolvency applications.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Loren Elliott/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A wave of business failures will have some nasty side effects on the pace of recovery: a further spike in unemployment and a spiral effect as one collapse pushes creditors and those that depend on the enterprise into stress.</p> \n<p>He suggests that this hiatus offers an opportunity for Australia to look at further reforms to insolvency laws similar to those <a href=\"https://www.pinsentmasons.com/out-law/analysis/corporate-governance-insolvency-bill\">announced in the UK last week </a>, which will offer a better chance for companies that are genuinely trying to restructure to successfully navigate the process.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/26/the-cliff-what-happens-when-australias-coronavirus-stimulus-runs-out-of-road\">'The cliff': what happens when Australia's coronavirus stimulus runs out of road?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Adam Nikitins, an insolvency partner at EY said it looked like the hibernation strategy had been a success as there had not been a wave of corporate failures, which would be usual in a sharp downturn.</p> \n<p>But he says there are challenges in the next phase as companies begin trading again.</p> \n<p>He says many EY clients are concerned about the strains on working capital as they restart their businesses and begin ordering stock and paying suppliers again, but are still waiting for revenue from sales to come in the door.</p> \n<p>\u201cFrom a policy viewpoint, there has been a lot of support in place currently to keep people employed. A lot of the narrative has been about keeping skilled people engaged. Continued support will be required from government and financiers as we emerge from hibernation because of the increased cash flow need,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cNo one has been here before. We don\u2019t usually shut down the whole economy and then try to restart it,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cBusinesses will be laser-focused on cash flow and looking for clear signals from the government post-September, when its is expected the economy will have started percolating again,\u201d he said.</p>",

Now is the time to consider whether they have worked and what needs to be done to either taper them, or move to the next phase of support. The $31bn success story First the good news. The cash flow boost, one of the most costly measures at $31bn for six months, appears to have been largely successful in providing extra cash flow to small businesses that employ people. It has proved easy to access, did not involve extra paperwork, and was available early. It gives businesses with a turnover of $50m or less to get a credit for the PAYG tax they would usually pay on behalf of employees. Each business received a minimum of $20,000 and up to $100,000 in two payments and they didn\u2019t need to do anything other than lodge their usual business activity statements. The credits for those who filed their BAS monthly flowed swiftly and gave them 300% in the first month. This meant that many did not then need to write cheques to the ATO during the crisis and could use the credit against other liabilities like GST payments. Combined with jobkeeper, which also injects money into businesses by way of a wage payment (that must be passed on to the employeee) it appears to have forestalled a mass of collapses, particularly in retail and hospitality. Whether businesses can survive beyond September without these cash injections depends entirely on how fast the economy comes back. If as the Treasury secretary, Steven Kennedy, suggested last week, we are heading more for a U than a V-shaped recovery, then some additional support for cash flow may be essential. However, other measures have proved less successful. The devil in the writeoff detail One of the early business Covid-19 stimulus measures \u2013 an enhanced instant asset writeoff to encourage businesses to invest \u2013 appears to have fizzed because of fears about the direction of the economy and disrupted supply lines during the crisis. The measure, announced in the first round of stimulus measures on March 12, allows businesses to claim the full value of equipment they buy up to the value of $150,000 (up from $30,000) against their income for the 2019-20 financial year. The writeoff is now available to not just small business but businesses with a turnover of up to $500m. But there\u2019s a catch. The equipment must be paid for and delivered to the business by 30 June. Hard data on the uptake of the concession won\u2019t be available until companies lodge their tax returns but anecdotal evidence (and perhaps common sense) suggests that many business owners, faced with uncertainty, are choosing to preserve their cash rather than buy new items. For instance, motor vehicle sales were down 48.5% in April, compared to the same month last year, according to the industry sales tracker, V-Facts. Sales were already sluggish in calendar 2019, down 8% in compared to 2018. V-Facts doesn\u2019t separate business and private sales, but purchases of Hi-Luxes, the ubiquitous tradie vehicle, were down 35.5% in April. \u201cI want to say it\u2019s fantastic: $150,000 gives farmers the capacity to buy a major piece of kit whereas $30,000 was not sufficient,\u201d said the small business ombudsman, Kate Carnell. \u201cBut you have to have something to write it off against. It\u2019s not a grant, it\u2019s an immediate writeoff of assets to $150,000,\u201d she said. For farmers likely to get a decent crop this winter, a new harvester or tractor might be just what they need, but they have had big hits to their incomes over the past 12 months or more during the drought. Then there is the problem of disrupted supply lines. Around the world, factories such as John Deere, which makes farm machinery, have been affected by shutdowns or have pivoted to making Covid protective gear. \u201cIt\u2019s a great incentive for business to invest and that flows right through the economy. But there are issues around the rules. Not just ordering and paying for it but it must be delivered by June 30,\u201d says Carnell. That means businesses have to take a gamble on equipment coming from offshore. Carnell would like to see the rules on delivery relaxed so that companies, who can now see the light at the end of the lockdown, can take advantage. Surprisingly there are some bright spots. It seems Australians can\u2019t do without coffee. Rob Maisano, managing director of the Coffee Machine Warehouse in Clayton Victoria said the stimulus measure had been good for his business and he had been busier than usual. \u201cWe usually keep about a thousand machines in stock. We\u2019ve been selling to offices and to people who want to set up little cafes and coffee carts,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s some models that have run out of stock but suppliers have plenty and if customers want a specific model, they say they can get them here in four weeks, which should be before the June 30 deadline,\u201d he said. The great insolvency unknown Perhaps the most concerning is what will happen when the moratorium on filing for bankruptcy and insolvency are lifted. Experts say the extension of the time frames to respond to a claim created a six months\u2019 breathing space and staved off a tidal wave of corporate collapses and bankruptcies during the initial stages of the pandemic but will have unknown consequences down the track. The timeframe for a company to respond to a demand from a creditor was extended from 21 days to six months and the government also temporarily increased the minimum threshold for creditors issuing a statutory demand from $2,000 to $20,000. Accompanying those measures were changes to directors\u2019 duties. They were given a six-month reprieve from personal liability for insolvent trading for \u201cany debts incurred in the ordinary course of the company\u2019s business\u201d. The debts are still payable and insolvency experts are predicting an escalation in October when six months expires. Michael Catchpoole, partner at Corrs Chambers Westgarth and an insolvency expert says with the exception of Virgin Australia and a few others, there has been a general deferral of insolvency applications. \u201cThat means we\u2019ve kicked the can down the road with some of these companies. It could be much more difficult to restructure. Cash burn will have increased and creditors are likely to be less sympathetic. \u201cWe have seen a tidal wave of equity raisings and that will have helped. But there is an opportunity cost that is lost if companies delay restructuring. It will be harder for companies to restructure if they have exhausted their reserves, especially as we are less likely to have a V-shaped recovery.\u201d Catchpoole doesn\u2019t think there will be an avalanche of collapses in October but there will be \u201ca recommencement of push factors\u201d which will lead to an increase in filings for bankruptcy or insolvency. It will range from the very large public companies to small and medium-sized enterprises , he says. A wave of business failures will have some nasty side effects on the pace of recovery: a further spike in unemployment and a spiral effect as one collapse pushes creditors and those that depend on the enterprise into stress. He suggests that this hiatus offers an opportunity for Australia to look at further reforms to insolvency laws similar to those announced in the UK last week , which will offer a better chance for companies that are genuinely trying to restructure to successfully navigate the process. Adam Nikitins, an insolvency partner at EY said it looked like the hibernation strategy had been a success as there had not been a wave of corporate failures, which would be usual in a sharp downturn. But he says there are challenges in the next phase as companies begin trading again. He says many EY clients are concerned about the strains on working capital as they restart their businesses and begin ordering stock and paying suppliers again, but are still waiting for revenue from sales to come in the door. \u201cFrom a policy viewpoint, there has been a lot of support in place currently to keep people employed. A lot of the narrative has been about keeping skilled people engaged. Continued support will be required from government and financiers as we emerge from hibernation because of the increased cash flow need,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one has been here before. We don\u2019t usually shut down the whole economy and then try to restart it,\u201d he said. \u201cBusinesses will be laser-focused on cash flow and looking for clear signals from the government post-September, when its is expected the economy will have started percolating again,\u201d he said.",

Stick with me here, because the origin story is confusing.</p> <p>In January the Korean actor Jung Il-woo was filmed having a coffee at Macau\u2019s Hon Kee Cafe, which is famous for its whipped coffee. The owner, <a href=\"http://travel.cnn.com/leong-kam-hon-secret-kung-fu-coffee-maker-macau-552646/\">Leong Kam-hon</a> (who lost the use of one arm in a shipping container accident, became a kung fu devotee and opened a cafe) once served it to the Chinese actor Chow Yun-fat while he was filming Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon in the early aughts. I told you it was confusing.</p> <p>Hon says he learned the whipped coffee technique from \u201ca foreign couple\u201d years earlier. It\u2019s unclear if the couple were just explaining the common Indian homestyle \u201cbeaten coffee\u201d (for which the technique is identical), but soon Dalgona coffee (now named for its resemblance to a nostalgic Korean honeycomb candy) was spreading among YouTubers, TikTokkers and Instagrammers. In the second half of March, YouTube views of videos with \u201cDalgona\u201d in the title increased 5,000%.&nbsp;</p> <p>I tried it. It\u2019s pretty good.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Power ranking:</strong> 4/10 indignant Indian grandmothers</p> <h2><strong>2. Bolognese (spaghetti and lasagne)</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c14e0fc3f6ec84f5cc8cd9d3c52823ea52cefc19\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c14e0fc3f6ec84f5cc8cd9d3c52823ea52cefc19/0_0_506_339/500.jpg\" alt=\"A plate of pasta with bolognese sauce\" width=\"500\" height=\"335\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A plate of pasta with bolognese sauce.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Pinkney/Getty Images/Flickr RF</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the weeks before lockdown started and in the shadows of the toilet paper wars, our focus shifted momentarily away from our butts and on to actually having food to eat. We hoarded pasta, tinned tomatoes and mince \u2013 everyone decided it was time to get their bolognese on.&nbsp;</p> <p>Did you have spaghetti bolognese during isolation? Yes, you did. Did you make a lasagne because that was the only pasta left that you could buy? You probably did that too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Adam Liaw's lasagne\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

Secret corporate recipes</strong></h2> <p>By April corporations had well and truly leaped on to the isolation cooking bandwagon, releasing official recipes for popular food products. Ikea revealed its \u201ciconic\u201d meatball recipe and, in that same week, Arnott\u2019s cracked open the vault for the <a href=\"https://www.arnotts.com/articles/thevault/big-recipe-release\">Monte Carlo</a>, before dropping the <a href=\"https://www.arnotts.com/articles/thevault/big-recipe-release-scotch-finger\">Scotch Finger</a> like a new Ariana Grande track shortly after.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IKEAUK/status/1252269467515617280\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Missing your IKEA meatball fix?

The only thing required was for the public and media to ignore how these recipes bore no resemblance whatsoever to the products actually on sale \u2013 which by and large, we did.</p> <p><strong>Power ranking: </strong>2/10 free column inches&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>7.

Sure, more people probably made bolognese or sourdough \u2013 but as cultural commentary #thestew had it all.&nbsp;</p> <p>A recipe from one of the global epicentres of the virus, cooked across New York by the young and housebound; <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/foodanddrink/alison-roman-interview-a4302026.html\">a star on the rise</a>; <a href=\"https://newconsumer.com/2020/05/alison-roman-interview/\">an explosive(ish) interview</a>,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/11/chrissy-teigen-alison-roman-food-fight\"> complete with allegations of racism</a>, celebrity feuds, and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/voraciously/wp/2020/05/19/alison-romans-new-york-times-column-on-hiatus-after-flap-with-chrissy-teigen-and-marie-kondo/\">a good ol\u2019 fashioned cancelling</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>I\u2019ll leave the drama for the archivists of the internet to pore over, but I do want to address one point of criticism \u2013 that #thestew drifted casually into cultural appropriation.&nbsp;</p> <p>Did an attractive, middle-class white woman appropriate Indian chana masala for fame and fortune? Of course not.</p> <p>Personally, I don\u2019t think you need to provide a dissertation on the origins of every spice when you decided to put a teaspoon and a half into a recipe. Does putting chickpeas and literally two spices into a stew even make it Indian? If an Indian person puts chilli in a recipe do they need to give a shout out to Christopher Columbus and the new world 500 years after the fact?</p> <p>I can tell you with some degree of certainty that if Alison Roman had dared call #thestew Indian, the rebukes would have been fast and severe. Besides, I\u2019m pretty sure she isn\u2019t trying to convince anyone she invented turmeric.</p> <p>Of course we should be aware of which voices are elevated in food media, and divorcing recipes from their cultural origins <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/feb/23/do-online-recipes-come-with-too-much-backstory-its-all-part-of-the-joy-of-food\">has its problems</a>, but attribution isn\u2019t one of them.&nbsp;</p> <p>It\u2019s not as if the cooks of the subcontinent never published their own recipes for chickpea stews. You could have cooked one of those if you wanted to.</p> <p>When a thing goes viral it\u2019s not because of the person who made the thing. It\u2019s not even because of the media. It\u2019s because of us.&nbsp;</p> <p>If you want to know why chickpea stew took off in a New York minute, or why it took a Korean actor to send Indian beaten coffee around the world, don\u2019t ask Alison Roman or Jung Il-woo. Ask yourself.&nbsp;</p> <p>I think you probably already know the answer.</p> <p><strong>Power ranking:</strong> 10/10 online pitchforks</p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "In isolation, cooking is cool. From Insta-worthy whipped coffees and ego-sourdough to recipes with their own hashtags, food has gone as viral as coronavirus itself. Here are the definitive power rankings for quarantine food trends. 1. Dalgona coffee This was patient zero in the food trend epidemic that has now spread around the globe. Stick with me here, because the origin story is confusing. In January the Korean actor Jung Il-woo was filmed having a coffee at Macau\u2019s Hon Kee Cafe, which is famous for its whipped coffee. The owner, Leong Kam-hon (who lost the use of one arm in a shipping container accident, became a kung fu devotee and opened a cafe) once served it to the Chinese actor Chow Yun-fat while he was filming Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon in the early aughts. I told you it was confusing. Hon says he learned the whipped coffee technique from \u201ca foreign couple\u201d years earlier. It\u2019s unclear if the couple were just explaining the common Indian homestyle \u201cbeaten coffee\u201d (for which the technique is identical), but soon Dalgona coffee (now named for its resemblance to a nostalgic Korean honeycomb candy) was spreading among YouTubers, TikTokkers and Instagrammers. In the second half of March, YouTube views of videos with \u201cDalgona\u201d in the title increased 5,000%. I tried it. It\u2019s pretty good. Power ranking: 4/10 indignant Indian grandmothers 2. Bolognese (spaghetti and lasagne) In the weeks before lockdown started and in the shadows of the toilet paper wars, our focus shifted momentarily away from our butts and on to actually having food to eat. We hoarded pasta, tinned tomatoes and mince \u2013 everyone decided it was time to get their bolognese on. Did you have spaghetti bolognese during isolation? Yes, you did. Did you make a lasagne because that was the only pasta left that you could buy? You probably did that too. There\u2019s nothing wrong with a good plate of pasta, of course, but I really just wish the gyms were still open. Power ranking: 5/10 pairs of elastic-waisted pants 3. Sourdough When the world collapsed, we made sourdough. We made sourdough even though we couldn\u2019t buy flour. We made sourdough even though all the stores were full of bread. Call it cottagecore, if you like, but behind the aesthetic the truth is if you were making sourdough it meant you were one of the luckiest people on Earth \u2013 healthy, safe and secure in every respect. And in a pandemic that\u2019s nothing to be taken for granted. Power ranking: 6/10 $40 loaves of bread 4. Focaccia gardens Beginning life as the less catchy \u201cVanDough Focaccia BreadArt\u201d by the Massachusetts-based baker Teri Culletto more than a year ago, iso-baking thrust focaccia gardens squarely into the spotlight. In a world where everyone was uploading sourdough, these impressionist artworks of colourful vegetables were an obvious pivot for \u201ccontent creators\u201d who wanted to stand out from the crowd. Soon these (literally) half-baked masterpieces were all over the \u2019Gram and, to be honest, I didn\u2019t mind it at all. I\u2019m not even sure if you\u2019re supposed to eat them, but they look really nice, right? Power ranking: 7/10 Instagram likes 5. Ramen at home I\u2019m clearly biased on this one, but I also think it\u2019s telling that of all the isolating cooking trends that took off, this was the only one that hinted at us actually wanting to leave the house. With international travel impossible and restaurants shut worldwide, you might have thought we\u2019d be trying to recreate Michelin-starred meals and farflung fare from foreign lands, but we didn\u2019t. When it comes to cooking, home is where the heart is. The closest we got to pining for the outside was a bowl of noodles. Power ranking: 8/10 empty aeroplanes 6. Secret corporate recipes By April corporations had well and truly leaped on to the isolation cooking bandwagon, releasing official recipes for popular food products. Ikea revealed its \u201ciconic\u201d meatball recipe and, in that same week, Arnott\u2019s cracked open the vault for the Monte Carlo, before dropping the Scotch Finger like a new Ariana Grande track shortly after. From a marketing perspective it was brilliance: recast processed food products as homemade dishes, earn millions in free advertising value, and be seen to be helping out people in isolation at the same time. The only thing required was for the public and media to ignore how these recipes bore no resemblance whatsoever to the products actually on sale \u2013 which by and large, we did. Power ranking: 2/10 free column inches 7. Alison Roman\u2019s #thestew The most powerful trend of isolation cooking has to be #thestew. Sure, more people probably made bolognese or sourdough \u2013 but as cultural commentary #thestew had it all. A recipe from one of the global epicentres of the virus, cooked across New York by the young and housebound; a star on the rise; an explosive(ish) interview, complete with allegations of racism, celebrity feuds, and a good ol\u2019 fashioned cancelling. I\u2019ll leave the drama for the archivists of the internet to pore over, but I do want to address one point of criticism \u2013 that #thestew drifted casually into cultural appropriation. Did an attractive, middle-class white woman appropriate Indian chana masala for fame and fortune? Of course not. Personally, I don\u2019t think you need to provide a dissertation on the origins of every spice when you decided to put a teaspoon and a half into a recipe. Does putting chickpeas and literally two spices into a stew even make it Indian? If an Indian person puts chilli in a recipe do they need to give a shout out to Christopher Columbus and the new world 500 years after the fact? I can tell you with some degree of certainty that if Alison Roman had dared call #thestew Indian, the rebukes would have been fast and severe. Besides, I\u2019m pretty sure she isn\u2019t trying to convince anyone she invented turmeric. Of course we should be aware of which voices are elevated in food media, and divorcing recipes from their cultural origins has its problems, but attribution isn\u2019t one of them. It\u2019s not as if the cooks of the subcontinent never published their own recipes for chickpea stews. You could have cooked one of those if you wanted to. When a thing goes viral it\u2019s not because of the person who made the thing. It\u2019s not even because of the media. It\u2019s because of us. If you want to know why chickpea stew took off in a New York minute, or why it took a Korean actor to send Indian beaten coffee around the world, don\u2019t ask Alison Roman or Jung Il-woo. Ask yourself. I think you probably already know the answer. Power ranking: 10/10 online pitchforks",

potential targets for action</a>, such as wine and dairy.</p> <p>Weihuan Zhou, a trade expert and senior lecturer at the University of New South Wales, said given China\u2019s commitment to purchase vast amounts of American goods, he saw a risk of Australian exporters becoming collateral damage, but hoped Australia could avoid becoming \u201ca casualty in the crossfire\u201d.</p> <p>Kym Anderson, a professor emeritus at the University of Adelaide\u2019s school of economics, said the agreement was \u201cclearly a managed trade deal that is against the spirit of liberal trade in an open multilateral trading system\u201d.</p> <p>Anderson said Australian exporters should be concerned about Beijing\u2019s commitment to purchase an extra US$32bn of agricultural exports from the US over two years, as the current slowdown in China\u2019s income growth \u201cnecessarily means China will import less farm products from other countries including Australia\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe death of many pigs because of swine fever in China reduces the immediate demand for US corn and soybeans, adding to the difficulty for China of importing extra US produce,\u201d Anderson said.</p> <p>Dr John Lee, a senior adviser to the then foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop from 2016 to 2018, said the pandemic had reduced demand in the Chinese market for a number of exports.</p> <p>\u201cThis means that if China is sincere about trying to meet its increased targets of US exports, some US goods might well be a substitution for exports from other countries,\u201d he told the Guardian.</p> <p>Lee, who is a senior fellow at the University of Sydney\u2019s United States Studies Centre, called on the US to share its goals with its allies when it came to reforming the World Trade Organization and China\u2019s engagement with it.</p> <p>\u201cSmaller countries like Australia \u2026 cannot afford to play a never-ending game of chicken with large powers like China,\u201d Lee said at a United States Studies Centre-hosted panel event on trade tensions and economic coercion on Thursday.</p> <p>\u201cThey cannot even really afford to play a game of poker with China when we don\u2019t even know what the prize might be or whether there\u2019s even a prize at the end of the game.\u201d</p> <p>Elizabeth Rosenberg, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, cited the barley issue as an example of \u201cthis sort of push-and-pull by China to try and apply friction to the already tenuous relationship the United States has with many allies and partners\u201d.</p> <p>The deal also obliges China to increase purchases of American energy products \u2013 including coal and liquefied natural gas \u2013 by $US52bn over two years.</p> <p>But the chief executive of the Minerals Council of Australia, Tania Constable, said Australian minerals and metals \u201cremain in demand in China and are helping to build cities and power factories as the country recovers from the

      "bodyText": "The Morrison government has asked China to grant Australia the same reduction in bureaucratic trade barriers that Beijing has promised the United States. The request emerged as experts warned that US allies such as Australia could suffer \u201ccollateral damage\u201d from a deal between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump to massively increase China\u2019s imports of American agricultural goods and energy products. Similarly, a former Australian government foreign affairs adviser argued on Thursday that Canberra could not afford to play \u201ca never-ending game of chicken\u201d with China without greater reassurance from the US on shared end goals. There is increasing concern about the spillover effect on Australia of the agreement that halted the trade war between the US and China, in which Beijing promised to spend an extra US$200bn on American goods and services over two years. China\u2019s decision this month to impose 80% tariffs on barley from Australia \u2013 amid tensions over the call for a coronavirus inquiry \u2013 coincided with a move to allow imports of the same product from the US. Australia\u2019s trade minister, Simon Birmingham, sought to quell fears over potentially wider impacts of the deal, saying the government expected pork, poultry and soybeans to make up a large share of the commodities exported from the US to China. Australia\u2019s key exports \u2013 such as beef and wine \u2013 would \u201ccontinue to maintain tariff differential advantages\u201d in China. But Birmingham acknowledged it may take time for the impacts to become clear.

This includes removing import restrictions, relaxing procedural requirements for safety inspections, and easing product standards and labelling rules. Birmingham told the Guardian that Australia had joined other countries in asking for the promised reduction in bureaucracy to be \u201cextended to all exporters, including Australian exporters, and not just those from the US\u201d. It is unclear whether Beijing will look favourably on the request, given ongoing tensions in the relationship. China has suspended beef imports from four Australian abattoirs on technical grounds and has reportedly drawn up lists of other potential targets for action, such as wine and dairy. Weihuan Zhou, a trade expert and senior lecturer at the University of New South Wales, said given China\u2019s commitment to purchase vast amounts of American goods, he saw a risk of Australian exporters becoming collateral damage, but hoped Australia could avoid becoming \u201ca casualty in the crossfire\u201d. Kym Anderson, a professor emeritus at the University of Adelaide\u2019s school of economics, said the agreement was \u201cclearly a managed trade deal that is against the spirit of liberal trade in an open multilateral trading system\u201d. Anderson said Australian exporters should be concerned about Beijing\u2019s commitment to purchase an extra US$32bn of agricultural exports from the US over two years, as the current slowdown in China\u2019s income growth \u201cnecessarily means China will import less farm products from other countries including Australia\u201d. \u201cThe death of many pigs because of swine fever in China reduces the immediate demand for US corn and soybeans, adding to the difficulty for China of importing extra US produce,\u201d Anderson said. Dr John Lee, a senior adviser to the then foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop from 2016 to 2018, said the pandemic had reduced demand in the Chinese market for a number of exports. \u201cThis means that if China is sincere about trying to meet its increased targets of US exports, some US goods might well be a substitution for exports from other countries,\u201d he told the Guardian. Lee, who is a senior fellow at the University of Sydney\u2019s United States Studies Centre, called on the US to share its goals with its allies when it came to reforming the World Trade Organization and China\u2019s engagement with it. \u201cSmaller countries like Australia \u2026 cannot afford to play a never-ending game of chicken with large powers like China,\u201d Lee said at a United States Studies Centre-hosted panel event on trade tensions and economic coercion on Thursday. \u201cThey cannot even really afford to play a game of poker with China when we don\u2019t even know what the prize might be or whether there\u2019s even a prize at the end of the game.\u201d Elizabeth Rosenberg, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, cited the barley issue as an example of \u201cthis sort of push-and-pull by China to try and apply friction to the already tenuous relationship the United States has with many allies and partners\u201d. The deal also obliges China to increase purchases of American energy products \u2013 including coal and liquefied natural gas \u2013 by $US52bn over two years. But the chief executive of the Minerals Council of Australia, Tania Constable, said Australian minerals and metals \u201cremain in demand in China and are helping to build cities and power factories as the country recovers from the Covid-19 pandemic\u201d. Labor\u2019s foreign affairs spokeswoman, Penny Wong, has urged the prime minister, Scott Morrison, to call Trump to pursue concerns about the deal\u2019s impact. Brett Williams, a trade lawyer at Williams Trade Law in Sydney, said it was plausible Australia could bring a WTO complaint and establish China had discriminated against imports from countries other than the US \u2013 a breach of the \u201cmost-favoured nation\u201d rule in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. But collecting evidence may be difficult and slow \u2013 especially if the actions included informal guidance from the Chinese government to privately owned enterprises. Williams said WTO agreements were intended to bring about trade on the basis of price competition, \u201cnot on the basis of political decisions of powerful governments about the quantities of trade that should flow\u201d. \u201cThat two of the most powerful countries in the WTO system can enter jointly into an arrangement to undermine the WTO rules is a worrying development,\u201d he said.",

Physical distancing including staying 2 metres apart must be observed if those meetings involve members of different households. People are only allowed to be inside the homes of friends and families in order to access gardens.

On 15 June, secondary schools will begin to provide face-to-face contact time for years 10 and 12. Outdoor retail spaces can reopen on Monday, followed by other non-essential retail outlets on 15 June. A government easing of lockdown rules since the middle of May has meant outdoor exercise has been encouraged, as long as physical distancing is respected and activities occur only with a maximum of one other person from another household. Those who can work from home have meanwhile been told to continue to do so, but those who cannot have been told to travel, while avoiding public transport if they can. Scotland Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, confirmed at her daily press briefing on Thursday that she would proceed with phase 1 of the Scottish government\u2019s four-stage plan for moving out of lockdown, while insisting that the stay-at-home message remained core to new guidance. From Friday, Scots will be able to meet with members of one other household.

Sitting or sunbathing in parks will be permitted, as will many outdoor non-contact sports including golf, fishing, tennis and bowls. In terms of business, most outdoor work that has been put on hold can resume. Garden centres and recycling facilities are also allowed to reopen, while takeaway and drive-through food outlets will no longer be discouraged. From Monday, teachers can return to schools to prepare for the start of the new school year on 11 August, when pupils will begin a \u201cblended\u201d model of at home and in school learning. From Wednesday, child minding services and fully outdoor nurseries will begin to reopen. Wales On bank holiday Monday, Welsh beaches were the quietest they had been in years compared with English coastal resorts.

Here is what some have said:</p> <p><strong>Penny Mordaunt, Portsmouth North, Cabinet Office minister and former defence secretary: </strong>\u201cDespite Mr Cummings\u2019 statement, I am personally still not clear of the facts. There are some inconsistencies in his account of events and the reasons behind it.\u201d<br><br><strong>Sajid Javid, Bromsgrove, former chancellor: </strong>\u201cI do not believe Mr Cummings\u2019 journey to County Durham to isolate on his family\u2019s estate was necessary or justified. I remain unconvinced his visit to Barnard Castle could be considered reasonable. I was also deeply concerned by his decision to return to Downing Street directly after coming into contact with a family member who was ill, potentially with coronavirus.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/28/dominic-cummings-potentially-broke-lockdown-rules-say-durham-police\">Dominic Cummings potentially broke lockdown rules, say Durham police</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Douglas Ross, Moray, who resigned as a Scotland Office minister: </strong>\u201cI have constituents who didn\u2019t get to say goodbye to loved ones; families who could not mourn together; people who didn\u2019t visit sick relatives because they followed the guidance of the government. I cannot in good faith tell them they were all wrong and one senior adviser to the government was right.\u201d<br><br><strong>Jeremy Wright, Kenilworth and Southam, former attorney general: </strong>\u201cMr Cummings\u2019 actions and his justification of them will, in my judgment, make it less likely that others will continue to interpret those exceptional circumstances clauses restrictively.

      "bodyText": "Scores of Conservative MPs have criticised Dominic Cummings\u2019 trip to Durham during lockdown. Here is what some have said: Penny Mordaunt, Portsmouth North, Cabinet Office minister and former defence secretary: \u201cDespite Mr Cummings\u2019 statement, I am personally still not clear of the facts. There are some inconsistencies in his account of events and the reasons behind it.\u201d Sajid Javid, Bromsgrove, former chancellor: \u201cI do not believe Mr Cummings\u2019 journey to County Durham to isolate on his family\u2019s estate was necessary or justified. I remain unconvinced his visit to Barnard Castle could be considered reasonable. I was also deeply concerned by his decision to return to Downing Street directly after coming into contact with a family member who was ill, potentially with coronavirus.\u201d Douglas Ross, Moray, who resigned as a Scotland Office minister: \u201cI have constituents who didn\u2019t get to say goodbye to loved ones; families who could not mourn together; people who didn\u2019t visit sick relatives because they followed the guidance of the government. I cannot in good faith tell them they were all wrong and one senior adviser to the government was right.\u201d Jeremy Wright, Kenilworth and Southam, former attorney general: \u201cMr Cummings\u2019 actions and his justification of them will, in my judgment, make it less likely that others will continue to interpret those exceptional circumstances clauses restrictively. This is more important than the position of any individual in Downing Street and therefore, fairly or unfairly, I have concluded that it would be better for Mr Cummings to leave his position at Downing Street.\u201d Karen Bradley, Staffordshire Moorlands, former culture secretary: \u201cI am afraid that I am not convinced by his explanation. I can well understand that any parent wants to protect their child, and have enormous sympathy with acting to do that.

      "bodyText": "The US government is funding a website in Armenia which is spreading disinformation about the coronavirus pandemic, including warnings that Armenians ought to \u201crefuse\u201d future vaccine programmes. The website, Medmedia.am, was launched with the help of a US State Department grant meant to promote democracy, but instead has been used to promote false information about Covid-19, according to an investigation by the British news website openDemocracy. Among Medmedia\u2019s most popular articles are pieces that have called Covid-19 a \u201cfake pandemic\u201d and falsely reported that a morgue offered to pay hundreds of dollars to a dead patient\u2019s family if they claimed the death had been caused by the coronavirus. The grant was awarded by the State Department to a group called the Armenian Association of Young Doctors, which launched the website last year and is led by a controversial doctor called Gevorg Grigoryan. He has been known for his strong criticism of the government\u2019s health ministry and its vaccine programmes, and has a history of anti-LGBT statements, including remarks posted on Facebook in 2014 in which he called for gay people to be burned. Grigoryan, who has claimed that he is not opposed to vaccinations, has teamed up with a prominent journalist and lawyer, both with reported ties to a far-right party called Veto, to create what they called a public fact-finding group on the government\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak. This week, the group\u2019s official Facebook page claimed that the government led by prime minister Nikol Pashinyan, who led a nonviolent reform movement before his election, had \u201ccompletely failed the fight\u201d against coronavirus. Grigoryan said he was not aligned with a specific political party and denied that Medmedia or the fact-finding project were political fronts aimed at opposing the government. \u201cIf we look at everything from a political point of view then we\u2019re not going to go very far,\u201d he said. \u201cBut from an expert point of view, the statistics speak for themselves.\u201d Armenia has reported about 7,100 coronavirus cases and a rising rate of infections. The country has also grappled with a drop in childhood vaccine rates, which the health minister, Arsen Torosyan, has blamed on anti-vaccine propaganda. The State Department declined to comment on questions about the size of the grant or its review process. A post on the US embassy\u2019s website in Armenia said grants under the Democracy Commission Small Grants Program \u2013 which are worth up to $50,000 \u2013 are awarded on a competitive basis to local NGOs and are meant to focus on issues like transparency and accountability in governance, advancing human rights, eliminating corruption, and enhancing economic growth and development. But the openDemocracy investigation found that, while Medmedia had published some news articles, most of its opinion pieces were republished Facebook posts that spread false information. Grigoryan told the Guardian that the US embassy in Armenia had contacted him with \u201cconcerns\u201d about op-eds and articles on the site. But, he said: \u201cI am sure I was able to answer all those questions and those concerns disappeared. The site is not an anti-vaccine forum.\u201d He would not say how much money was given to his Armenian Association for Young Doctors by the US embassy, or how much of that was invested in the website. He called it a \u201csmall amount\u201d and addressed questions on specifics to the US embassy. The grant period is due to end in several days, he said. A disclaimer on the Medmedia website said the site was US-funded but that its articles \u201cdo not necessarily reflect\u201d the views of the US government. Grigoryan defended the articles in an interview with the Guardian, saying the website had been \u201ccreated to make the voice of the public heard\u201d. \u201cIf someone says that Armenia should refuse vaccinations and the government refutes this with weighty proof, it\u2019s already served [the public] good,\u201d he said. Asked specifically about the articles, he said that he didn\u2019t share their opinions but said they would not be taken down. \u201cIt\u2019s not fake news,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the opinion of a specialist, the opinion of a doctor, of the head of an NGO. It\u2019s an opinion. So it\u2019s not fake news.\u201d He denied that posting the articles could pose a public health risk, saying they would \u201cinitiate discussion.\u201d While he denied being personally opposed to vaccines, he claimed the articles on his site were representative of skepticism about vaccines in Armenian society. \u201cThe problem is that due to the government\u2019s incorrect [information] policy these kinds of articles are becoming widespread,\u201d he said. Grigoryan said his past anti-LGBT statements, including one that said he would \u201calways fight against gays,\u201d had been misinterpreted and were prompted by specific cases of \u201canti-social behaviour.\u201d Asked about a Facebook post from 2014 in which he wrote that \u201cgays should be burnt and in a public place\u201d, he said that the post was a reference to the film Pulp Fiction and was meant as a joke.",

At No 10\u2019s daily press conference, the prime minister twice prevented questions from journalists who wanted to know whether Prof Chris Whitty, England\u2019s chief medical officer, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, believed Cummings had stuck to the rules. Johnson said he wanted to \u201cdraw a line\u201d under the Cummings affair, after Durham constabulary said the aide might have committed a \u201cminor breach\u201d of the rules. \u201cI\u2019ve said quite a lot on this matter already and what I also note is that what Durham police said was that they were going to take no action and that the matter was closed,\u201d he said, without mentioning Cummings\u2019 name. The prime minister then said he would not allow Vallance or Whitty to answer questions on the row to \u201cprotect them from what I think would be an unfair and unnecessary attempt to ask any political questions\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very important that our medical officers and scientific advisers do not get dragged into what I think most people would recognise is fundamentally a political argument,\u201d he said. On a third time of asking, Whitty and Vallance said they did not want themselves to get involved in politics. Whitty said: \u201cThe desire to not get pulled into politics is far stronger on the part of Sir Patrick and me than it is in the prime minister.\u201d Vallance added: \u201cI\u2019m a civil servant, I\u2019m politically neutral, I don\u2019t want to get involved in politics at all.\u201d But their silence on the matter will fuel suspicions that they are not willing to back up the prime minister\u2019s assertions that he believes Cummings did not break the lockdown rules. There have been questions over the absence of the UK\u2019s senior experts from the daily press conference since revelations emerged of Cummings\u2019 journey from London to Durham while his wife had suspected coronavirus, and about a 60-mile round-trip to a beauty spot.

      "bodyText": "The French government announced a further loosening of coronavirus restrictions on Thursday, as officials in South Korea reimposed strict lockdown measures in the Seoul area after the country\u2019s biggest rise in infections in almost two months. The announcements came as Donald Trump described the US\u2019s 100,000 coronavirus deaths as a \u201cvery sad milestone\u201d, and the World Health Organization said a significant proportion of the 159,000 excess deaths recorded cross Europe since early March were linked to Covid-19. In France, the prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, said a ban on journeys of more than 100km (62 miles) would end on 2 June, adding that cafes, bars and restaurants in so-called green areas \u2013 where the virus is not circulating widely \u2013 would be able to reopen on the same date. No more than 10 people will be allowed to sit together, tables must be spaced 1 metre from each other, and kitchen and restaurant staff must wear masks. Philippe said establishments in orange areas \u2013 such as Paris \u2013 would only be able to reopen outside terraces. Secondary schools and lyc\u00e9es in green areas will be able to resume all classes from 2 June, but must follow health measures, such a maximum of 15 pupils per class. In orange areas most classes will not begin again until September. The prime minister also said the country\u2019s external borders would remain closed until 15 June, when it is hoped they will be reopen to EU nationals in coordination with other EU27 states. Philippe said tFrance was \u201cin a better place than where we expected to be\u201d, but urged people to continue respecting the rules and remain careful and vigilant. In South Korea, 79 new infections \u2013 67 of them from the Seoul area \u2013 prompted the authorities to reimplement lockdown measures across the metropolitan area of the capital, which is home to half the country\u2019s 52 million population. The health minister, Park Neung-hoo, said museums, parks and art galleries would all be closed again for a fortnight from Friday while companies have been urged to reintroduce flexible working for employees. In the US, Trump, whose stewardship of the health crisis has drawn bitter criticism, reacted to the country passing 100,000 deaths in characteristic fashion. \u201cWe have just reached a very sad milestone with the coronavirus pandemic deaths reaching 100,000,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cTo all of the families &amp; friends of those who have passed, I want to extend my heartfelt sympathy &amp; love for everything that these great people stood for &amp; represent. God be with you!\u201d With fears of a second wave of infections mounting, the WHO warned that the global Covid-19 death toll could be far higher than preliminary figures suggest. It said there had been almost 160,000 excess deaths \u2013 or unexpected fatalities \u2013 across 24 European countries in the past two-and-a-half months. Although the figure for excess deaths takes into account all mortality causes, its timing - recorded as thousands of people were dying in intensive care units in places such as northern Italy, France, Spain and Britain - points to the virus\u2019s deadly impact. \u201cWhat we have seen very clearly is that the peak in excess mortality corresponds in those countries to the peak of the transmission of Covid-19,\u201d said Katie Smallwood, a WHO emergency official. \u201cThis gives us a very good indication that a very significant proportion of this excess deaths is linked and due to Covid-19.\u201d Smallwood said countries looking to ease restrictions needed to have have robust disease detection, testing and tracing systems in place to help contain a potential second wave of the pandemic. In Africa, health experts said that community transmissions \u2013 where patients have no travel history or known contact with infected people \u2013 were on the rise, especially in Ethiopia. \u201cThat means we need to increase our public health measures like distancing, wearing of masks, washing of hands,\u201d said John Nkengasong, the head of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. Nkengasong advised countries to change the way they tested their populations, recommending they conduct surveillance testing of those with flu-like symptoms rather than focusing on testing people arriving at airports. To date, African countries have recorded 123,724 cases of the virus, and 3,668 deaths. Meanwhile, in Germany, unions have accused the online retail giant Amazon of exposing its workers to the virus as it enjoys record profits during the pandemic. Last Tuesday, a parliamentary query from the Green party revealed that at least 53 of the 1,800 employees at an Amazon centre in Winsen, Lower Saxony, were infected with the virus between 16 March and 29 April. A spokesperson for the city of Pforzheim in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg said there had also been at least seven infections that could be traced to an Amazon warehouse in the city. The German services union ver.di accuses Amazon of having been slow to adapt working conditions to social distancing guidelines. The company told German media that it had adjusted its hygiene protocols and there had been no further confirmed infections at the Winsen centre in May. \u201cNothing is more important to us than the health and wellbeing of our workers, said a spokesperson. In other global coronavirus developments: The Philippines reported 17 more coronavirus deaths and 539 new infections, the biggest number of cases reported in a single day since the virus was first detected in the country. The health ministry said infections had risen to 15,588 and 921 people had died. Deaths from the coronavirus in Italy rose by 70 on Thursday, down from 117 on Wednesday, bringing the total to 33,142. There are 47,986 people who are currently have the virus in Italy, down by 2,980 within the last 24 hours. Italy has 231,732 confirmed cases to date, including the deaths and 150, 604 survivors.

Health authorities said five weeks\u2019 worth of data had shown there had been no \u201cnegative effects from the reopening of schools\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Public health officials proposed a radical lockdown of care homes last month to stem surging coronavirus deaths, including staff moving in for four weeks and deploying NHS Nightingale hospitals \u2013 but it was rejected by the government, the Guardian has learned. An 11-point plan proposing \u201ca further lockdown of care homes\u201d was submitted to Downing Street on 28 April by officials at Public Health England (PHE), as fatalities peaked in care homes and the virus spread to half of homes in the worst-affected areas. They urged ministers to \u201cuse NHS facilities and other temporary accommodation to quarantine and isolate residents\u201d, and to \u201cconsider whether staff can move into the care home for the next four weeks\u201d. But neither of the proposals, recommended as \u201chigh impact\u201d, were included in a subsequent action plan on infection control announced by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, last week. Some 16,000 care home residents are confirmed or suspected to have died from Covid-19, according to official UK figures, amid outbreaks in 38% of homes in England and 59% of those in Scotland. Care homes have faced a triple threat of virus spread which the measures sought to address: Covid-19-positive discharges from hospitals; staff coming and going from the wider community and between care homes; and building layouts designed to encourage socialising not isolation. Staff in a few care homes have moved in on a voluntary basis \u2013 one dementia home in Sheffield made the decision in March \u2013 and successfully protected residents, reducing the risk of transmission through care workers coming in and out on shifts who may be carrying the virus asymptomatically. This measure was recommended as \u201chigh impact\u201d by the PHE officials but the government decided that not all care homes had the facilities to offer suitable accommodation to staff who wanted to stay on site. While some care providers had reservations about its feasibility, one care industry source said: \u201cIf there was 24-hour pay, you would have had a flood of applications.\u201d Care staff have been working round the clock to try to help elderly residents who have been dying in far higher numbers than usual, even when their deaths are not attributed to Covid-19. In England, Wales and Scotland, 12,597 more people died in care homes during the pandemic than the five-year average, bringing the number of excess deaths in care homes to 27,591 \u2013 more than half all excess mortality, according to a study released on Thursday by academics at the London School of Economics. The government decided against the live-in plan and issued guidance last week to care operators on infection control that said only staff \u201cwho proactively choose it should be offered accommodation on site or in hotels\u201d. Rather than the recommendation to \u201crequire care home workers to isolate to reduce risk of picking up Covid-19\u201d, possibly with higher pay, the government has told operators to help staff \u201cminimise risk of picking up Covid-19 outside of work\u201d. PHE\u2019s proposal to \u201cuse NHS facilities and other temporary accommodation to quarantine and isolate residents before returning to their care home\u201d was also declined. It suggested \u201cuse [of] the facilities available in the NHS where capacity exists\u201d, making reference to the NHS Nightingale hospitals that were built with military help at the start of the crisis but which have been barely used. But officials concluded many of the Nightingale sites were not suitable for providing care to elderly people and ministers told councils to \u201censure that there is sufficient alternative accommodation as required to quarantine and isolate residents\u201d. Piecemeal attempts to do that have run into some problems. For example, efforts by Somerset county council to create a \u201cpop-up\u201d home in Yeovil to house infected care residents was delayed for weeks because commercial insurers declined to underwrite the risk. The Guardian has revealed that outbreaks in care homes in London from 11-13 April were confirmed to have been spread by temporary staff moving from home to home, but results from the PHE study were not revealed until last week.

The government\u2019s later guidance was that \u201csubject to maintaining safe staffing levels, providers should employ staff to work at a single location\u201d. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: \u201cWe have worked tirelessly with care homes to reduce transmission and save lives, and almost two-thirds have had no outbreaks at all [62% in England to 11 May]. \u201cWe announced \u00a3600m to help tackle the spread of coronavirus, including by limiting staff movement between care homes, as well as \u00a31.3bn to cover alternative accommodation to isolate residents.

More certain was that their presence put others at risk in residential homes designed for communal activity, not isolation. With staffing stretched by absences and a chronic lack of protective equipment, infections spiralled upwards.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/care-home-map-zip/giv-3902GWpOUeoGEyXb/\" data-alt=\"Map of care home deaths\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/care-home-map-zip/giv-3902GWpOUeoGEyXb/\">Map of care home deaths</a> </figure>  <p>Some homes have now alleged that hospitals covered up infections of discharged patients. The Care Quality Commission is investigating claims that \u201ca patient\u2019s positive Covid-19 status was known to the hospital but not disclosed at the point of discharge\u201d \u2013 a potential breach of the Health and Social Care Act. Another risk was Covid-19-negative patients being discharged into infected homes, and subsequently catching coronavirus.</p> <p>\u201cAt the peak of the outbreak we had admissions from hospital,\u201d said a nurse at a residential home where eight people died. The same staff treated everyone so infection spread was inevitable, she said on condition of anonymity, adding that two of the discharged people died from Covid-19. \u201cImagine if that was your relative,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think people know what is happening.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until 16 April that the government <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/879639/covid-19-adult-social-care-action-plan.pdf\">announced</a> NHS patients being discharged into care homes would be first tested for Covid-19 \u2013 by which time almost 1,000 homes in England had suffered outbreaks. The guidance still allows discharges pending test results. By the end of April, 6,500 care home residents in England were dead from Covid-19.</p> <h2><strong>Testing</strong></h2> <p>On 12 March, around the time the pandemic took off, the government decided to reduce testing for Covid-19 in the community. Care homes desperate to know more about infection felt they suddenly knew less.</p> <p>They were spotting puzzling symptoms like loss of appetite and sudden confusion, which differed from the standard advice to watch for coughs and a fever. Testing, though, was limited. After someone in a home tested positive, no more tests would be offered, managers reported.</p> <p>US <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6913e1.htm?s_cid=mm6913e1_w\">research</a> was already showing the importance of testing widely in care homes. Research into an outbreak near Seattle, in Washington state, found that only judging by symptoms may miss half of infected residents.</p> <p>It was <a href=\"https://ltccovid.org/2020/04/09/briefing-note-current-uk-guidance-on-admission-and-care-of-residents-during-covid-19-is-based-on-symptomatic-cases-ignoring-early-international-evidence-and-lessons-from-other-countries/\">highlighted</a> by Comas, who by now was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/half-of-coronavirus-deaths-happen-in-care-homes-data-from-eu-suggests\">attracting national attention</a> for her work. She also observed that South Korea and Singapore, which had successfully protected care homes, tested anyone who may have had contact with carriers, regardless of symptoms.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/report-16-testing/\">Research</a> published in April by Nicholas Grassly, a member of the government\u2019s Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling and a professor at Imperial College, also found weekly screening of healthcare workers, irrespective of symptoms, reduces their contribution to transmission by between a quarter and a third.</p> <p>Yet the current government policy, announced by Matt Hancock on 28 April, is to test care home staff and residents only once unless the person subsequently develops symptoms.</p> <p>Sam Monaghan, chief executive of MHA, the largest charitable provider of care homes, which has lost hundreds of residents to Covid-19, said the current policy was \u201coutrageous in the face of the evidence that is now available\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOne single asymptomatic staff member or resident through no fault of their own can cost lives,\u201d Monaghan said.</p> <p>Last week, MHA reported that tests of nearly 2,700 staff and residents found at least one asymptomatic carrier in every location tested.</p> <p>Sir David Behan, chief executive of the largest provider of care homes in the UK, HC-One, which has lost more than 900 residents, also said testing \u201cwould have reduced the transmission of the virus and would have reduced the death toll\u201d.</p> <p>The early weeks of the new testing regime were mired in \u201ca complete system failure\u201d, care operators complained. \u201cAt one point we got the results after 24 hours, some we never get back and some we get back a week later,\u201d said Astle, the manager at Wren Hall. \u201cThat\u2019s not helpful when they come back positive. In that week they have been happily spreading the virus around.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe testing arrangements remain chaotic,\u201d said Vic Rayner, director of the National Care Forum last week.</p> <p>The DHSC said at the weekend that it has sent tests to at least 6,000 care homes, which means tests have not yet been dispatched to about 9,000 homes<strong>. </strong>All homes for looking after over-65s will be offered tests by \u201cearly June\u201d, it said.</p> <p>The National Care Forum, which represents charitable providers, reckons at least 200,000 tests are needed daily to properly track infections, not the 30,000 promised by the DHSC.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2077fbfe3820647555834fa3f38a61d7b06bc1ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2077fbfe3820647555834fa3f38a61d7b06bc1ad/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Disposable gloves being taken from box\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Care workers were engaged in close-contact nursing, but rarely had the most protective FFP3 masks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Staff and protective equipment</strong></h2> <p>\u201cColleagues have been asked to wear bags over their faces for lack of surgical masks,\u201d one care worker told their trade union helpline in early April. \u201cIt\u2019s getting to the point where I want to quit my job. I feel I\u2019m endangering my own life.\u201d</p> <p>As headlines screamed about shortages of masks, gowns and visors, the NHS became the top priority for PPE. Care homes were left scrambling for supplies.</p> <p>\u201cThe issue we hear most is: \u2018I am desperate for masks. Has anyone got any gloves?\u2019\u201d said Nadra Ahmed, executive chair of the National Care Association in early April. \u201cOnce you run out, it is a question of being down to Marigolds and bin liners.\u201d</p> <p>Care workers were engaged in similarly close-contact nursing as their NHS colleagues, but rarely had the most protective FFP3 masks.</p> <p>PPE deliveries from the national stockpile often consisted of a box of 300 masks. At Wren Hall, staff were using more than 400 per day. During its worst outbreak from 24 March to 13 April, when 10 residents died, the home had no FFP3 masks, no gowns and no visors, Astle said. </p> <p>Forty-eight members of staff contracted the virus. The home has been buying masks through a camping gear company with a contact in China.</p> <p>Infection rates have meant staff absences of up to 20% and, in at least a dozen cases, death. On 1 April, Carol Jamabo, 56, a care worker in Bury, became the first known to have died from the virus. Official data this month showed care workers have been dying from Covid-19 at twice the rate of their NHS colleagues. Absence rates have been high too \u2013 running between 10% and 20%.</p> <p>Sir David Behan said that on several occasions HC-One has come close to breaching its \u201ccritical staffing level\u201d. \u201cWe had to use staff from other homes and we now know that\u2019s a route of transmission,\u201d he said.</p> <p>An unpublished PHE study, conducted at Easter and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/agency-staff-were-spreading-covid-19-between-care-homes-phe-found-in-april\">revealed by the Guardian</a>, found temporary staff had spread the virus between London care homes.

It is sure to ask whether slowness to lock down the most vulnerable, to test them and protect their care workers with better PPE, cost lives.</p> <p>Care homes in the UK remain the engine of the epidemic \u2013 accounting for almost as many deaths as in hospitals. While homes in other countries like Hong Kong and Germany edge back to normality, the crisis continues in Britain.</p> <p>A spokesperson for DHSC stressed that officials have been dealing with an \u201cunprecedented global outbreak, the worst pandemic for a hundred years\u201d. \u201cWe have been working tirelessly with the care sector to reduce transmission and save lives, and have based all our decisions on the latest scientific and clinical advice \u2013 as a result nearly two thirds of care homes have had no outbreak at all.\u201d</p> <p>They highlighted a \u00a3600m fund to help limit staff movement between care homes and \u00a31.3bn for accommodation to isolate residents. \u201cWe are also testing all care workers and residents, regardless of symptoms, and ensuring millions of items of PPE are delivered to the frontline.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Why did so many people die in care homes? That may be the most urgent question of the likely public inquiry into the UK\u2019s Covid-19 response. The NHS wasn\u2019t overwhelmed, but 16,000 residents of care and nursing homes have died so far, compared with fewer than 3,000 in Germany and none in Hong Kong. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, claims the government \u201cthrew a protective ring\u201d around care homes. So, what went wrong? Controlling the infection In late January, as the Covid-19 death toll ticked up in Wuhan, China, care operators in Britain grew nervous. The Care Providers Association asked contacts at the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) if there was any specific action they needed to take. Word came back: there was nothing to advise. A week later, the industry group tried again. How should it isolate infected residents and restrict visits, and who would supply personal protective equipment (PPE)? Government guidance that finally came on 25 February bore a relaxed tone. Face masks \u201cdo not need to be worn by staff\u201d, there was no block on visits and there was \u201cno need to do anything differently in any care setting at present\u201d. It said: \u201cIt remains very unlikely that people receiving care in a care home ... will become infected.\u201d Over the following three months, care homes across the UK have been devastated by Covid-19. Forty per cent of homes have been hit in England, more in Scotland, and at least a dozen care workers are dead. The advice, officials stress now, was \u201crelated to what we knew at the time\u201d. \u201cWe should have been focusing on care homes from the start,\u201d said Prof Martin Green, chief executive of the industry association Care England. \u201cWhat we saw \u2026 was a focus on the NHS and that meant that care homes often had their medical support from the NHS withdrawn.\u201d There were warning signs that care homes would suffer. In early February, the government\u2019s own Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling reported that infections were doubling at least every five days in China. There was probably already sustained transmission in the UK and \u201csevere cases are more common in older age groups\u201d. But there was no rush, continued the message. On 3 March, England\u2019s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, defended a lack of specific measures to protect care homes, saying: \u201cOne of the things we are keen to avoid is doing things too early.\u201d It was already too late for many. The following week, as the NHS pushed to discharge patients into care homes, came the first care home outbreaks in London, Nottingham, Stockport and Tameside. Green is angry. \u201cIn every crisis [the DHSC] go into overdrive about the NHS and forget social care. They should take it off their name,\u201d he said. Thirty-three outbreaks in the first week of March turned into 793 by the end of the month. Data tracking the spread was not made public by Public Health England (PHE) until 29 April. Neither was the government stopping visits to care homes by family and friends, which \u201csurprised\u201d the former Conservative health secretary, Jeremy Hunt. PHE guidance on 13 March asked homes only to keep out unwell visitors and those with suspected Covid-19. This was right for the time, insists the DHSC, which says it \u201cfollowed a science-led action plan\u201d. When an outbreak hit Wren Hall nursing home in Nottinghamshire, Anita Astle, the manager tried to handle it using DHSC guidance to separate symptomatic residents \u201cin a single room with a separate bathroom, where possible\u201d. \u201cWe did that for 10 days and it was still spreading,\u201d she said. \u201cI decided I\u2019m not doing this anymore. If you followed their advice, you could have someone in a bedroom with symptoms, someone next door without symptoms.\u201d Dementia sufferers often like to walk around their homes, and as the homes don\u2019t lock residents in, the virus spreads. Wren Hall created an isolation unit and a \u201cred team\u201d of dedicated care workers, but the virus killed 10 residents in three weeks. \u201cIf [the government] were an employee of mine,\u201d Astle said. \u201cI would have sacked them for gross negligence.\u201d DHSC says it took the right steps at the right time, guided by the best scientific advice. In early April, Adelina Comas, a London School of Economics academic scouring international evidence, warned that the policy of only isolating symptomatic residents \u201cwill not be effective in preventing the spread of infection\u201d. By then, Hong Kong had locked down homes and was quarantining infected cases in hospital, not in homes. Spain responded to care home deaths in late March by isolating \u201cpossible and probable\u201d cases as well as symptomatic residents. Germany kept its care home outbreaks to a minimum by saying that no one was allowed into care homes from hospitals without a negative Covid-19 test, or having undergone quarantine in designated centres or repurposed hotels for at least 14 days. DHSC says it is \u201cnot advisable\u201d to draw international comparisons and that since 2 April it urged the use of PPE with all patients, symptomatic or not. Hospital discharges To protect the NHS from the devastating situation that emerged in Italy \u2013 with the near collapse of hospitals \u2013 UK ministers ordered 15,000 hospital beds to be vacated by 27 March. Making beds available was part of the \u201cnational effort\u201d and \u201cwill help to save thousands of lives\u201d they told care homes. Guidelines said there was no need to test discharged patients because Covid-19 sufferers \u201ccan be safely cared for in a care home\u201d. Whether Covid-19 sufferers could be safely treated in care homes lacking clinical expertise and medical equipment was arguable. More certain was that their presence put others at risk in residential homes designed for communal activity, not isolation. With staffing stretched by absences and a chronic lack of protective equipment, infections spiralled upwards. Some homes have now alleged that hospitals covered up infections of discharged patients. The Care Quality Commission is investigating claims that \u201ca patient\u2019s positive Covid-19 status was known to the hospital but not disclosed at the point of discharge\u201d \u2013 a potential breach of the Health and Social Care Act. Another risk was Covid-19-negative patients being discharged into infected homes, and subsequently catching coronavirus. \u201cAt the peak of the outbreak we had admissions from hospital,\u201d said a nurse at a residential home where eight people died. The same staff treated everyone so infection spread was inevitable, she said on condition of anonymity, adding that two of the discharged people died from Covid-19. \u201cImagine if that was your relative,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think people know what is happening.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until 16 April that the government announced NHS patients being discharged into care homes would be first tested for Covid-19 \u2013 by which time almost 1,000 homes in England had suffered outbreaks. The guidance still allows discharges pending test results. By the end of April, 6,500 care home residents in England were dead from Covid-19. Testing On 12 March, around the time the pandemic took off, the government decided to reduce testing for Covid-19 in the community. Care homes desperate to know more about infection felt they suddenly knew less. They were spotting puzzling symptoms like loss of appetite and sudden confusion, which differed from the standard advice to watch for coughs and a fever. Testing, though, was limited. After someone in a home tested positive, no more tests would be offered, managers reported. US research was already showing the importance of testing widely in care homes. Research into an outbreak near Seattle, in Washington state, found that only judging by symptoms may miss half of infected residents. It was highlighted by Comas, who by now was attracting national attention for her work. She also observed that South Korea and Singapore, which had successfully protected care homes, tested anyone who may have had contact with carriers, regardless of symptoms. Research published in April by Nicholas Grassly, a member of the government\u2019s Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling and a professor at Imperial College, also found weekly screening of healthcare workers, irrespective of symptoms, reduces their contribution to transmission by between a quarter and a third. Yet the current government policy, announced by Matt Hancock on 28 April, is to test care home staff and residents only once unless the person subsequently develops symptoms. Sam Monaghan, chief executive of MHA, the largest charitable provider of care homes, which has lost hundreds of residents to Covid-19, said the current policy was \u201coutrageous in the face of the evidence that is now available\u201d. \u201cOne single asymptomatic staff member or resident through no fault of their own can cost lives,\u201d Monaghan said. Last week, MHA reported that tests of nearly 2,700 staff and residents found at least one asymptomatic carrier in every location tested. Sir David Behan, chief executive of the largest provider of care homes in the UK, HC-One, which has lost more than 900 residents, also said testing \u201cwould have reduced the transmission of the virus and would have reduced the death toll\u201d. The early weeks of the new testing regime were mired in \u201ca complete system failure\u201d, care operators complained. \u201cAt one point we got the results after 24 hours, some we never get back and some we get back a week later,\u201d said Astle, the manager at Wren Hall. \u201cThat\u2019s not helpful when they come back positive. In that week they have been happily spreading the virus around.\u201d \u201cThe testing arrangements remain chaotic,\u201d said Vic Rayner, director of the National Care Forum last week. The DHSC said at the weekend that it has sent tests to at least 6,000 care homes, which means tests have not yet been dispatched to about 9,000 homes. All homes for looking after over-65s will be offered tests by \u201cearly June\u201d, it said. The National Care Forum, which represents charitable providers, reckons at least 200,000 tests are needed daily to properly track infections, not the 30,000 promised by the DHSC. Staff and protective equipment \u201cColleagues have been asked to wear bags over their faces for lack of surgical masks,\u201d one care worker told their trade union helpline in early April. \u201cIt\u2019s getting to the point where I want to quit my job. I feel I\u2019m endangering my own life.\u201d As headlines screamed about shortages of masks, gowns and visors, the NHS became the top priority for PPE. Care homes were left scrambling for supplies. \u201cThe issue we hear most is: \u2018I am desperate for masks. Has anyone got any gloves?\u2019\u201d said Nadra Ahmed, executive chair of the National Care Association in early April. \u201cOnce you run out, it is a question of being down to Marigolds and bin liners.\u201d Care workers were engaged in similarly close-contact nursing as their NHS colleagues, but rarely had the most protective FFP3 masks. PPE deliveries from the national stockpile often consisted of a box of 300 masks. At Wren Hall, staff were using more than 400 per day. During its worst outbreak from 24 March to 13 April, when 10 residents died, the home had no FFP3 masks, no gowns and no visors, Astle said. Forty-eight members of staff contracted the virus. The home has been buying masks through a camping gear company with a contact in China. Infection rates have meant staff absences of up to 20% and, in at least a dozen cases, death. On 1 April, Carol Jamabo, 56, a care worker in Bury, became the first known to have died from the virus. Official data this month showed care workers have been dying from Covid-19 at twice the rate of their NHS colleagues. Absence rates have been high too \u2013 running between 10% and 20%. Sir David Behan said that on several occasions HC-One has come close to breaching its \u201ccritical staffing level\u201d. \u201cWe had to use staff from other homes and we now know that\u2019s a route of transmission,\u201d he said. An unpublished PHE study, conducted at Easter and revealed by the Guardian, found temporary staff had spread the virus between London care homes. On 14 May, the government finally produced new guidelines stipulating that staff and agency workers should work in only one care home \u201cwherever possible\u201d. Conclusion Matt Hancock\u2019s claim to have thrown \u201ca protective ring around care homes\u201d was rhetoric intended to calm a nation shocked by deaths among some of society\u2019s most vulnerable. But a public inquiry is likely to hear claims that government policies lagged behind warnings from care operators and international evidence. It is sure to ask whether slowness to lock down the most vulnerable, to test them and protect their care workers with better PPE, cost lives. Care homes in the UK remain the engine of the epidemic \u2013 accounting for almost as many deaths as in hospitals. While homes in other countries like Hong Kong and Germany edge back to normality, the crisis continues in Britain. A spokesperson for DHSC stressed that officials have been dealing with an \u201cunprecedented global outbreak, the worst pandemic for a hundred years\u201d. \u201cWe have been working tirelessly with the care sector to reduce transmission and save lives, and have based all our decisions on the latest scientific and clinical advice \u2013 as a result nearly two thirds of care homes have had no outbreak at all.\u201d They highlighted a \u00a3600m fund to help limit staff movement between care homes and \u00a31.3bn for accommodation to isolate residents. \u201cWe are also testing all care workers and residents, regardless of symptoms, and ensuring millions of items of PPE are delivered to the frontline.\u201d",

(We are concerned here with breaches of the regulations, not the general Government guidance to \u201cstay at home\u201d.)</p> \n   <p>On April 12 2020, Mr Cummings drove approximately 26 miles from his father\u2019s property to Barnard Castle with his wife and son. He stated on May 25 2020 that the purpose of this drive was to test his resilience to drive to London the following day, including whether his eyesight was sufficiently recovered, his period of self-isolation having ended.</p> \n   <p>Durham Constabulary have examined the circumstances surrounding the journey to Barnard Castle (including ANPR, witness evidence and a review of Mr Cummings\u2019 press conference on May 25 2020) and have concluded that there might have been a minor breach of the regulations that would have warranted police intervention. Durham Constabulary view this as minor because there was no apparent breach of social distancing.</p> \n   <p>Had a Durham Constabulary police officer stopped Mr Cummings driving to or from Barnard Castle, the officer would have spoken to him, and, having established the facts, likely advised Mr Cummings to return to the address in Durham, providing advice on the dangers of travelling during the pandemic crisis.</p> \n   <p>Had this advice been accepted by Mr Cummings, no enforcement action would have been taken.</p> \n   <p>In line with Durham Constabulary\u2019s general approach throughout the pandemic, there is no intention to take retrospective action in respect of the Barnard Castle incident since this would amount to treating Mr Cummings differently from other members of the public. Durham Constabulary has not taken retrospective action against any other person.</p> \n   <p>By way of further context, Durham Constabulary has followed Government guidance on management of alleged breaches of the regulations with the emphasis on the NPCC and College of Policing 4Es: Engage, Explain and Encourage before Enforcement.</p> \n   <p>Finally, commentary in the media has suggested that Mr Cummings was in Durham on April 19 2020. Mr Cummings denies this and Durham Constabulary have seen insufficient evidence to support this allegation.</p> \n   <p>Therefore Durham Constabulary will take no further action in this matter and has informed Mr Cummings of this decision.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T12:29:31.340Z\">at 1.29pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ecfac088f084e882655a5b1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T12:18:26.804Z\">1.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Boris Johnson still backs Cummings despite 'minor breach' of lockdown rules</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A No 10 spokesman said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> The police have made clear they are taking no action against Mr Cummings over his self-isolation and that going to Durham did not breach the regulations.

That trip is about 260 miles and came just over a week after the prime minister\u2019s key aide decided to drive with his wife and child from his London home to his parents\u2019 farm, fearing being struck down by coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>The trip by Cummings has led to no action by police, and its revelation on Friday by the Guardian and Daily Mirror led to calls for Cummings\u2019 resignation, but he has maintained his actions were lawful and not in breach of the lockdown.</p> \n  <p>Cummings also admitted to a trip on 12 April to a beauty spot, Barnard Castle, with his wife and child. He said on Monday he had been testing his eyesight and fitness to drive after being struck down by the virus.</p> \n  <p>Durham police say since the original news stories, they have received further claims and complaints from the public and are examining that information. </p> \n  <p>Cummings said he travelled to ensure childcare in case he and his wife were struck down by the virus, and claims an exemption to the stay at home order issued by his boss, the prime minister, allowed him to make the trip.

<strong tabindex=\"-1\">National Association of Head Teachers</strong> (NAHT), said fewer teachers would be available to support children with remote learning if pupils in reception, year 1 and year 6 are taught in smaller groups from next week.</p> \n  <p>His comments came ahead of the government\u2019s final decision on whether to reopen primary schools in England to more pupils from as early as Monday.</p> \n  <p>On Wednesday, the school standards minister, <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Nick Gibb</strong>, said it was \u201cdifficult to say\u201d whether the government\u2019s aim to get all primary school pupils back in class before the summer break will occur.</p> \n  <p>He told MPs on the education select committee: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Remote education, home education, will continue for the majority of pupils and young people \u2013 probably until the end of the summer term.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Findings from the NAHT suggest nearly three in five (57%) schools are providing home-learning resources for pupils daily and more than a quarter (29%) provide them weekly.</p> \n  <p>The survey of 4,784 school leaders, carried out earlier this month, also found that the majority of schools have been creating their own online resources as well as liaising with parents about home learning.</p> \n  <p>But the NAHT is concerned that the quality of remote learning on offer for the year groups that will not be returning to school in the summer term may suffer amid a wider reopening of schools in England.</p> \n  <p>Whiteman told the PA news agency: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Splitting classes in order to reduce the risk of transmission requires twice the number of staff, leaving fewer teachers to support those other children still at home.</p> \n   <p>I worry that an unintended consequence will be a detrimental impact on home learning.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it from me, Nadeem Badshah. To continue following our coronavirus coverage, check out our global blog. A tribute from the CEO of Fortnum &amp; Mason. A rather unique tribute from Royal Dornoch golf course. Boris Johnson outside 10 Downing Street taking part in the nationwide applause. Sir Keir Starmer has tweeted his thanks to key workers. London mayor Sadiq Khan has tweeted the following tribute. NHS workers in the north-east pay tribute to colleagues across the country. Thousands of people are braced to mark the 10th week of the Clap For Carers in the UK. Five minutes remaining until the nationwide applause and hitting of kitchen utensils to pay homage to NHS and key workers. There are 10 minutes until the nationwide Clap For Carers applause. Founder Annemarie Plas has said the 10th edition would be a good time to end the weekly display and instead make it an annual event. She said the public had \u201cshown our appreciation\u201d and it was now up to ministers to \u201creward\u201d key workers. Dominic Cummings\u2019 trip to Barnard Castle \u201cmight have been a minor breach\u201d of lockdown regulations, an investigation by Durham police concluded. Durham Constabulary said it was taking no retrospective action, to which No 10 said it considered the matter closed. However, lawyers have suggested the police\u2019s use of \u201cmight\u201d could be interpreted as meaning there was enough evidence to suggest he breached the rules, but it was ultimately for a court to decide. Groups of up to six people \u2013 staying 2 metres apart \u2013 can meet outside from Monday in England. The government announced that its five tests for easing the lockdown were being met, though the changes would be \u201ccautious\u201d and \u201climited\u201d. Members of different households can meet in gardens and other private outdoor spaces, providing members of different households observe social distancing, items and surfaces are wiped down and people wash their hands. Schools in England will reopen to some pupils from Monday. Nurseries, reception and years 1 and 6 would be first, followed by \u2013 years 10 and 12 a fortnight later. The R remains close to 1 and is not falling fast. It is currently between 0.7 and 0.9 and in some areas, it could be much closer to 1. The government said lockdown measures in England would be reimposed locally to address local flare-ups if necessary. The high burden of infection reinforces that social distancing and basic hygiene measures are still absolutely key to preventing the spread of the virus. The UK death toll rose by 377 in the last 24 hours, bringing the total to 37,837. Thanks everyone! That\u2019s it from me for today. Please join us later for what might be the final clap for carers. In the meantime, do head to our global live blog for more coronavirus coverage. Although primary schools in England opening their doors to more pupils from 1 June has been widely trailed - not least by Boris Johnson himself last weekend - this afternoon\u2019s official confirmation gives headteachers just three days of half-term holiday to make final preparations and reach out to parents. Most schools have remained open throughout the half-term break this week, as they did during the Easter holidays, for vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers. That means many school leaders will have little chance to have time off from February until the middle of July. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: It is important to understand that many primary schools will not be open to all eligible pupils on Monday morning, and that they will be phasing in these children over a period of time, while putting in place limits on class sizes and implementing other safety measures. Schools are already open to vulnerable and key worker children, and it is now a case of carefully and cautiously expanding these numbers. There are significant logistical issues involved, including constraints on the physical space in schools, and the availability of staff, given that some will be self-isolating or in vulnerable categories. There is also likely to be a great deal of variability in how many parents send their children into schools. Added to this is the fact that local authorities are taking different approaches. All of this means the picture from Monday will vary widely between schools and areas according to local circumstances. We urge everybody to understand this is an extraordinary situation and to respect the decisions that are made by schools. Nurseries and childcare providers in England are also being told they can reopen from 1 June. But Neil Leitch, the chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, warned: Many parents will be understandably hesitant about sending their children to a childcare provider reopening on Monday, and as such it is very likely that nurseries, preschools and childminders will see a significant drop in demand for places in the short-term, which will result in a loss of income. The government must therefore offer more than just a public health solution to the reopening of the early years sector and commit whatever financial support is required to ensure that providers can remain financially sustainable during this period. During that very interesting press conference, the prime minister tried to stop his top medical and scientific advisers from answering reporters\u2019 questions about the behaviour of Dominic Cummings, saying they should not be involved in politics. Chris Whitty, England\u2019s chief medical officer, and Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, were repeatedly asked if the trip by Cummings from London to Durham set a bad example to the general public. Twice Boris Johnson refused to allow them to answer, saying he wanted to \u201cprotect them from ... an unfair and unnecessary attempt to ask a political question\u201d. On a third occasion, when Johnson allowed them to speak, both officials then said they did not want to get involved in politics and declined to address the question. Cummings\u2019 behaviour has been criticised by politicians from all major parties, but Johnson has said he wanted to move on from the affair. Q. In Northern Ireland the R has been increasing and is barely below 1 \u2013 should that cause alarm? Vallance says the R remains below 1 everywhere but may be very close to 1 in some places. We have to be very cautious with these changes, he adds. There will be local outbreaks so we must be prepared for that, he says. The number of cases remains high and we have to get them down by adhering to the measures in place, he says. Q. Given that lives are at stake, if the public health advice becomes bastardised by the actions of Dominic Cummings, can you at least criticise how he has acted given the gravity of what\u2019s happened? This goes unanswered. And that\u2019s the end of the press briefing. Q. Do you really have the capacity to trace all the contacts of infected people? Q. Why is the UK still only listing three symptoms for the disease compared to other countries? Vallance says the number of new cases appears closer to 8,000 a day, but that\u2019s clearly not the whole number \u2013 there are people we\u2019re not picking up. The app and contact tracing will help close this gap and get people to isolate quickly. Whitty says there are many other symptoms of coronavirus as it can affect many parts of the body, but fever, cough and loss of smell/taste were the most specific \u2013 around 95% of people with symptoms will have any one of those three. Q. How long can people stay at another person\u2019s private garden, can you go inside to use the loo and when can we hug loved ones again? Johnson says no to overnight stays as we\u2019re not at that stage. All of these adjustments have to be in socially distanced way, with people continuing to wash their hands and use common sense, he adds. We can\u2019t move freely across the country to stay at other people\u2019s houses, he adds. Whitty says the two metre rule is critical because the virus spreads in air droplets. After using the loo, wipe everything down and wash your hands, he adds. Plus if you\u2019re passing things from one person to another, e.g. when doing a BBQ, you must be washing your hands and wiping everything down, he adds. Q. [To the medics] Would you advise motorists to go on 60-mile round trip to test their eyesight? This goes unanswered. Q. [To Vallance and Whitty] Are you comfortable with the PM telling you that you can\u2019t answer questions about Dominic Cummings? Whitty says he and Vallance don\u2019t want to get involved in politics. Vallance adds that as a civil servant he doesn\u2019t want to be involved at all. Q. Are the instructions from contact tracers instructions that you must follow whatever your childcare arrangements or your job? Johnson says if you get a call from a contact tracer, you must self-isolate. Whitty adds you must do this to protect all of us. Q. A number of scientific advisers to Sage have said Cummings\u2019 behaviour risks more people not complying with social distancing rules. Do Vallance and Whitty fear compliance will be reduced because of this? Q. Is Sage looking at whether the social distancing rule can be reduced from two metres? Johnson again doesn\u2019t let Vallance and Whitty answer the question on Cummings. On the two metre rule, Vallance says the scientific evidence suggests two metres is a distance at which it\u2019s safer and other measures add to this, e.g. wearing face masks. Whitty adds that if, under test and trace, you remained two metres apart from an infected person, you won\u2019t count as a contact and have to isolate. Q. Durham police have said they would have sent Dominic Cummings home if they had stopped him at Bernard Castle, why should anyone else follow the rules if one of your senior team isnt\u2019? Q. [To the medics] Is that the kind of example you want people to follow? Johnson says the police said they would take no action and he intends to draw a line under the matter. Astonishingly, he doesn\u2019t let Sir Patrick Vallance and Prof Chris Whitty answer on the grounds it\u2019s a \u201cpolitical\u201d matter, and he doesn\u2019t allow a follow-up. Carol from Sunderland asks what measures will be put in place for people would could temporarily lose their income if local lockdowns are imposed. Johnson says help such as the furlough scheme and various loan schemes remain in place. Nobody should be penalised in this epidemic for doing the right thing, he adds. Jay from Horsham asks how loosening the lockdown for the shielding community \u2013 the clinically vulnerable \u2013 is going to be approached. Johnson says he sympathises with how tough it\u2019s been and he wants to release them from \u201ccaptivity\u201d as quickly as possible but they must be vigilant in their approach. Whitty says the risk to the shielded and other vulnerable groups is decreasing and they hope to soon get to a stage where the risk is low enough for people to leave shielding in stages. Vallance says the most recent ONS figures suggest: The proportion of people in the last couple of weeks with Covid-19 is 0.24% \u2013 somewhere in the order of 130,000 people have Covid infection, he says. The number of new infections is estimated to be roughly 1 in 1,000 per week, he says. This means 54,000 new cases are estimated to be occurring every week \u2013 that is not a low number, he stresses. There is still a significant burden of infection, there are still new infections every day at quite a significant rate, and the R is close to 1, he says. That means there isn\u2019t a lot of room to do things and things to need to be done cautiously and monitored, and the test and trace system needs to be effective, he says. An estimated 6.78% of people have had Covid-19, he says. Sir Patrick Vallance is speaking now. The R is currently somewhere between 0.7 and 0.9, he says. It remains close to 1, and it could be much closer to 1 in some areas, he says. The numbers are coming down at the moment, but they\u2019re not coming down fast, he says. He hopes in the coming weeks we\u2019ll be able to do more in returning to a more normal way of life, Johnson says. This is all conditional, he adds, based on the scientific data confirming that these actions are safe. There will be further local outbreaks, he says. The brakes will be put on as required and where necessary, measures will be reimposed, he adds. People must continue to minimise contact with others, by staying two metres apart from members of different households, Johnson says. Mixing with several different households in quick succession should be avoided, he says. People should not be inside the homes of their friends and families, unless it is to access the garden, he adds. From Monday, up to six people will be able to meet outside, providing members of different households continue to stay two metres apart. This will be allowed in gardens and other private outdoor spaces, he says. Members of different households must still observe social distancing. This will allow people to see both parents at once or both grandparents at once, he adds. Shops will begin to reopen, he says. Starting with on Monday, outdoor retail and car showrooms, and a fortnight later on 15 June, other non-essential retail \u2013 providing five tests are still being met and shops are Covid-secure. Johnson says changes announced today will be \u201climited\u201d and \u201ccautious\u201d. Schools have the go-ahead to reopen to some pupils from Monday, he says. Nurseries, reception, year 1 and year 6 will be first. A fortnight later on 15 June, secondary schools will begin to provide face-to-face contact time for years 10 and 12. The prime minister is speaking now. He goes through the latest data on tests, positive cases and deaths (see 4.37pm.). Five tests must be met before adjusting the lockdown, Johnson says. Protect the NHS\u2019s ability to cope. The data shows on 26 May 475 people in England were admitted to hospital with coronavirus, down from a peak of 3,121 on 2 April, he says. This test is being met, he says. See a sustained, consistent fall in daily deaths. A seven-day rolling average shows the UK\u2019s daily death rate stands at 256, as of 28 May. The second test is being met, Johnson says. The rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board. As of 28 May, there were 1,887 cases confirmed. The government is satisfied this test has been met, he says. Operational challenges, including testing capacity and PPE, are in supply for future demand. Testing capacity has now reached 161,214 per day and PPE supplies have been boosted. They are satisfied the fourth test is being met, Johnson says. Any adjustments to current measures must not risk a second peak of infections that could overwhelm the NHS. He will set out further details on schools, social contact and retail. He says it is right different parts of the UK are moving at different speeds with this. The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, has accused Boris Johnson of being \u201ctoo weak to act\u201d and of failing to have \u201cdrawn a line under\u201d the Dominic Cummings saga. Starmer, who has said he would have sacked the adviser if he was PM, tweeted: The prime minister Boris Johnson will be lead this afternoon\u2019s news briefing, due to begin shortly. He is expected to provide an update on easing lockdown measures in England. He will be joined by the chief scientific advisor Sir Patrick Vallance and the chief medical officer for England Prof Chris Whitty. In the 24-hour period up to 9am on Thursday, there were 119,587 tests carried out or dispatched, the DHSC said, with 1,887 positive results. The figure for the number of people tested has been \u201ctemporarily paused to ensure consistent reporting\u201d across all methods of testing. And as of 5pm on 27 May, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 37,837 have died. That is an increase of 377 since yesterday. The Conservative MP Peter Gibson has explained why he took a train from London to the north-east of England after displaying coronavirus symptoms. The Darlington MP, who was part of the 2019 intake of so-called red wall Tories, said he travelled 250 miles by train from the capital prior to lockdown to isolate at home. He made the comment on Facebook when posting about the Dominic Cummings affair earlier this week. When he was asked why he had not stayed in London, he replied: It was several weeks before lockdown and at the time I had no London address. Gibson explained he was staying in a spare room of someone else\u2019s flat and did not have a permanent London base. He later told the Northern Echo he began coughing on 11 March and called the MP\u2019s coronavirus helpline. He said: I was advised if my normal mode of transport was the train I should use that but should isolate and keep myself to myself, which is what I did. He said he self-isolated at home for seven days and his illness was short-lived. He also told the Northern Echo that while some might have said he should have stayed in London: Was I meant to move into a hotel? Was I supposed to go back to the flat of another MP when I had nothing apart from a couple of changes of clothes? Did I run the risk of potentially infecting the friend whose flat it was? David McWilliams is a consultant physiotherapist helping ICU patients recover from Covid-19 \u2013 this powerful film follows their recovery from the moment they first open their eyes since arriving to their first steps. His team support patients at Birmingham\u2019s Queen Elizabeth hospital, which has one of the largest critical care units in Europe and recently was treating more than 200 Covid-19 patients at one time. Durham\u2019s former chief constable Mike Barton has said he believes the force statement used the word \u201cmight\u201d in relation to Dominic Cummings breaking the regulations as the police could not be seen to be acting as judge and jury. He said: It seems to me that any reasonable observer would see that Mr Cummings has not only broken the spirit of the rules, but also the letter. This is not Durham in the dock - they are still trying to deal with a national emergency - and this will have been an unwelcome distraction and one they have now dealt with, and they would want the public in the North East to observe the rules, unlike Mr Cummings. Explaining why he believed the force used the word \u201cmight\u201d in its statement, he said: The police do not want to have been the judge and jury in this, not having interviewed him under caution. They make it clear, this is something of a minor matter in the grand scheme of things, which it is, should he not have been at the centre of the legislation. The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, told reporters: I\u2019ve seen what Durham Police have said [see 1.24pm.]. Obviously that, on the face of it, is inconsistent with what the prime minister said. And that presents him with a problem. But, frankly, he\u2019s too weak to do anything about it. He added: I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to do anything because he cannot, it seems, continue without his adviser. A lawyer has said Durham constabulary\u2019s statement that there \u201cmight have been a minor breach of the regulations that would have warranted police intervention\u201d regarding the trip Dominic Cummings took to Barnard Castle could be interpreted as meaning there was enough evidence to suggest he breached the rules but it was ultimately for a court to decide. Raj Chada, head of the criminal defence department and a partner at firm Hodge Jones &amp; Allen, told PA Media: The police should not be there to decide one way or another whether he actually breached the rules - in this case that could be for the courts to decide - so I interpret this statement as them saying that there is enough evidence to say that he breached the rules (but ultimately for court to decide) but that it is not in public interest to prosecute for the reasons that they say. Asked about the latest statement from Durham police on Dominic Cummings at her press briefing, Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said: I think Dominic Cummings should no longer be in post. I certainly continue to think that. That is a matter for the prime minister. I think if the prime minister is putting the integrity of the vital public health message that he and all of us are seeking to communicate first then he will take action that means Dominic Cummings doesn\u2019t continue to distract from that. I think it is wrong that he puts his political interests ahead of those public health interests. The number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 within the prison estate continues to rise, Ministry of Justice figures show. As at 5pm on Wednesday, 452 prisoners across were confirmed to have the coronavirus across 77 prisons, a 1% increase in 24 hours, while there were 897 infected prison staff across 105 prisons, an increase of nearly 2% in the same period. The figures are not live cases and include those who have recovered. To date, there have been 22 prisoners and nine staff known to have contracted Covid-19 and died. There are about 80,200 prisoners in 117 prisons in England and Wales, while there are around 33,000 staff working in public sector prisons. The Prison Service is running a highly restrictive regime to curb the spread of the virus, which includes a ban on visits and increased time in cells. In some prisons, inmates are spending no more than 30 minutes a day outside the cell. On Thursday, the Guardian revealed that there had been five suicides in six days in prisons during the lockdown, fuelling fears the regime is taking its toll on inmates well being. Afternoon everyone. I\u2019m Lucy Campbell, back from lunch. I\u2019ll be bringing you all the latest developments throughout the remainder of the day. Please do continue to get in touch with news tips and stories we should cover. Email: lucy.campbell@theguardian.com Twitter: @lucy_campbell_ The average number of people with coronavirus in community settings in England remains \u201crelatively stable\u201d, though the infection rate among people working outside the home is around three times as high as for those working at home, new figures record. An average of 133,000 people in private households in England had Covid-19 at any given time between 11 and 24 May, according to new estimates the Office for National Statistics. The regular ONS update also included for the first time details of symptoms experienced by those who had tested positive for the virus. Chris Smyth, the Times\u2019 Whitehall editor, also flags this point: A conflict now arises between the police and the attorney general, Suella Braverman, according to the Secret Barrister, a junior barrister whose anonymous writings about the English and Welsh legal system enjoy a popular following. On the one hand, Durham police have expressed the view that Cummings did break the law while Braverman \u201cimmediately endorsed a partisan claim of no legal wrongdoing\u201d. It\u2019s a resigning matter for the Tory MP in the role, the barrister concludes: The number of Conservative MPs calling for Dominic Cummings to resign or criticising his behaviour in recent days has been growing, reports the Guardian\u2019s Rowena Mason. In one latest count, more than 80 MPs have been critical of Cummings\u2019 actions. The list is here NHS England has announced 185 new deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 26,234. Of the 185 new deaths announced on Thursday: \u2022 29 occurred on 27 May \u2022 73 occurred on 26 May \u2022 19 occurred on 25 May The figures also show 54 of the new deaths took place between 2 May and 24 May, and the remaining 10 deaths occurred in April with the earliest on 10 April. NHS England releases updated figures each day showing the dates of every coronavirus-related death in hospitals in England, often including previously uncounted deaths that took place several days or even weeks ago. NHS staff at a hospital which has stopped taking new patients amid a Covid-19 spike have lodged a series of concerns including that they were not routinely being informed of when colleagues test positive for the virus. The concerns were laid in a letter from union representatives to management at Weston General Hospital, which is now testing all staff while carrying out a deep clean. Another concern raised by Unison was that BAME members of staff were not being prioritised for testing. The governing trust for the hospital in Somerset said on Wednesday evening that as many as 40% of staff from a cohort tested after contact with infected patients were found to be positive. The development comes amid heightened concerns about the spread of coronavirus among NHS workers after the trust said there was \u201can emerging picture\u201d of staff with no symptoms testing positive. All staff were now being tested at the hospital, which stopped taking admissions, including into its A&amp;E department, from 8am on Monday \u201cto maintain patient and staff safety\u201d as a result of a high number of infections. Unison\u2019s South West regional secretary, Joanne Kaye, said today that urgent changes were needed to reassure both staff and patients about safety. \u201cThe biggest concern is that staff aren\u2019t routinely being informed when their colleagues test positive for the virus. \u201cThis means they\u2019re unable to make informed decisions about whether they need to be tested. The trust must make sure managers tell staff at the earliest possible opportunity. \u201cMany of those who work at the hospital only heard about the temporary closure through social media, which is a major communications failure. They must be told directly, not pick things up second hand through friends and family. The union expressed concern that BAME members of staff aren\u2019t being prioritised for testing given the high levels of mortality in that grouping of staff over the course of the pandemic. Labour leader Keir Starmer has said that Boris Johnson has \u201cshown himself to be weak\u201d in dealing with the Dominic Cummings situation. In a clip on BBC Radio 4\u2019s the World At One programme, Sir Keir said: \u201cThe most important thing here is not, you know, these technical issues, but the problem is by not dealing with Cummings in a strong way, the Prime Minister has not only shown himself to be weak, and he has shown himself to be weak - I mean he\u2019s so desperate for this adviser he\u2019ll cling on to him through thick and thin.\u201d \u201cMore importantly, what I\u2019m worried about is that people might think \u2018well,\u2019 if Cummings doesn\u2019t have to apply by the rules, why do I have to? Then you\u2019re on a slippery slope.\u201d Starmer was also asked whether Cummings should go during a virtual Call Keir event in Doncaster, and said: \u201cI would\u2019ve sacked him from the outset if I\u2019d been Prime Minister. Commentators continue to scrutinise Durham Police\u2019s statement. Here\u2019s the lawyer and writer David Allen Green picking up on some of the finer detail: The combative health minister, Nadine Dorries, has meanwhile come out to bat for Cummings This is Ben Quinn picking up the blog now while Lucy takes some overdue lunch. Black, Asian or minority ethnic (BAME) nurses are more likely to have problems accessing protective equipment, according to a new poll. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) identified a \u201cstark and deeply worrying\u201d contrast over PPE provision for staff from different backgrounds. The union said it is \u201cunacceptable\u201d that BAME nurses \u201care less protected than other nursing staff\u201d. Data has emerged suggesting that people from BAME backgrounds are being disproportionately adversely affected by Covid-19, and a significant proportion of NHS workers who have died after being diagnosed with Covid-19 have BAME heritage. The RCN conducted a poll on more than 5,000 nurses about the provision of personal protective equipment (PPE), including more than 700 from BAME backgrounds. The union said that although there were some improvements from April, \u201cthere are still shortages of essential PPE in all settings, and health and care staff are still reliant on PPE items being donated or home-made in some cases\u201d. Its report states that it is \u201cunacceptable for health and care staff to be exposed to avoidable risk to their own safety\u201d, adding: Our findings also highlighted a stark and deeply worrying contrast in the experience and safety of BAME respondents. The findings include: 29% of white British nurses who responded to the poll felt pressure to care for confirmed or possible Covid-19 patients without adequate PPE \u2013 this rose to 56% for BAME nurses. Less than half (43%) of BAME nurses said they had enough eye protection compared with 66% of white British nurses. 37% of BAME nurses who took part in the survey said they did not have enough fluid-repellent gowns to use during their shift, with only 19% white British staff reporting the same concerns. More than half of BAME respondents (53%) also said they had been asked to re-use single-use PPE in a \u201chigh risk environment\u201d, compared with 42% of white British respondents to the survey, which was conducted between 7-11 May. RCN chief executive and general secretary Dame Donna Kinnair said: It is simply unacceptable that we are in a situation where BAME nursing staff are less protected than other nursing staff. These results reinforce our call for BAME nursing staff to have specific risk assessments to reflect the risks they face as a result of Covid-19. All of our nursing staff must have the protection they need, and action must be taken urgently to ensure they are all kept safe. We look forward to getting more answers from Public Health England\u2019s investigation into the disproportionate effect of Covid-19 on BAME groups. Boris Johnson\u2019s official spokesman told the lobby briefing that the prime minister would lead this afternoon\u2019s daily press conference. The spokesman said: Subject to the fact that we need to receive the very latest advice from Sage, which I believe is meeting today, I would expect the PM to be able to set out what we are able to do from 1 June later today. The Tory chairman of the health select committee, Jeremy Hunt, has said the government should \u201cdo whatever it takes\u201d to ensure the new test-and-trace system works and that it was time to \u201cmove on\u201d from the Cummings affair. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s The World At One programme, Hunt said: Squeezing that testing turnaround down to 24 hours, which is what happens in Korea and Taiwan, is really, really important. The big picture is that we are now implementing the system which is the best in the world, it has been proven to not just reduce death rates but also help economies to function more normally. But, within that, the tightening of these tests is absolutely critical. Asked whether Dominic Cummings\u2019 actions will impact how compliant people are with the new system, he said: It is not going to help, but I think we\u2019ve got to see the big picture here. The big picture here is that today the government has launched a system which is international best practice, it is what has been proven to work all over the world. So, however angry people might feel about the Dominic Cummings issues, we do now have to move on, we have to make the system work, we have to comply with the advice that we are given. Here is the full statement issued by Durham police to say Dominic Cummings will not face further action. On March 27 2020, Dominic Cummings drove to Durham to self-isolate in a property owned by his father. Durham Constabulary does not consider that by locating himself at his father\u2019s premises, Mr Cummings committed an offence contrary to regulation six of the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020. (We are concerned here with breaches of the regulations, not the general Government guidance to \u201cstay at home\u201d.) On April 12 2020, Mr Cummings drove approximately 26 miles from his father\u2019s property to Barnard Castle with his wife and son. He stated on May 25 2020 that the purpose of this drive was to test his resilience to drive to London the following day, including whether his eyesight was sufficiently recovered, his period of self-isolation having ended. Durham Constabulary have examined the circumstances surrounding the journey to Barnard Castle (including ANPR, witness evidence and a review of Mr Cummings\u2019 press conference on May 25 2020) and have concluded that there might have been a minor breach of the regulations that would have warranted police intervention. Durham Constabulary view this as minor because there was no apparent breach of social distancing. Had a Durham Constabulary police officer stopped Mr Cummings driving to or from Barnard Castle, the officer would have spoken to him, and, having established the facts, likely advised Mr Cummings to return to the address in Durham, providing advice on the dangers of travelling during the pandemic crisis. Had this advice been accepted by Mr Cummings, no enforcement action would have been taken. In line with Durham Constabulary\u2019s general approach throughout the pandemic, there is no intention to take retrospective action in respect of the Barnard Castle incident since this would amount to treating Mr Cummings differently from other members of the public. Durham Constabulary has not taken retrospective action against any other person. By way of further context, Durham Constabulary has followed Government guidance on management of alleged breaches of the regulations with the emphasis on the NPCC and College of Policing 4Es: Engage, Explain and Encourage before Enforcement. Finally, commentary in the media has suggested that Mr Cummings was in Durham on April 19 2020. Mr Cummings denies this and Durham Constabulary have seen insufficient evidence to support this allegation. Therefore Durham Constabulary will take no further action in this matter and has informed Mr Cummings of this decision. A No 10 spokesman said: The police have made clear they are taking no action against Mr Cummings over his self-isolation and that going to Durham did not breach the regulations. The prime minister has said he believes Mr Cummings behaved reasonably and legally given all the circumstances and he regards this issue as closed. Announcing that she would proceed with phase one of the Scottish government\u2019s four-stage plan for moving out of lockdown, Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said at her daily briefing that figures showed a \u201csustained and unmistakable\u201d downward trend in cases. She added, however, that the changes must be \u201ccareful and cautious\u201d and that the R number remains in range of 0.7 to 1. There were 12 deaths from coronavirus in Scotland overnight, taking the total number of deaths under that measure to 2,316. The relaxation comes as the Scottish government\u2019s own test and protect scheme goes live on Thursday across all health board areas. From Friday, Scots will be able to meet with members of one other household at a time. This must happen outdoors, in a park or in private gardens, and while observing social distancing, and the total number of people meeting up should be a maximum of eight. There is also a strong recommendation not to meet more than one other household per day. People will be allowed to travel \u2013 preferably by walking or cycling \u2013 for recreation or visits, with a suggested limit of five miles, although Sturgeon has said that people should \u201cuse their judgement\u201d. Sitting or sunbathing in parks will be permitted, as will many outdoor non-contact sports including golf, fishing, tennis and bowls. In terms of business, most outdoor work that has been put on hold can resume. Garden centres and recycling facilities are also allowed to reopen, while takeaway and drive-through food outlets will no longer be discouraged. From Monday, teachers can return to schools to prepare for the start of the new school year on 11 August, when pupils begin a \u2018blended\u2019 model of at home and in school learning. And from Wednesday, child minding services and fully outdoor nurseries will begin to reopen. The prime minister\u2019s most senior adviser did breach lockdown rules when he made the 50-mile round trip to Barnard Castle, an investigation by Durham police has reportedly found. Dominic Cummings claimed he made the journey on 12 April \u2013 which was Easter Sunday and the day of his wife\u2019s birthday \u2013 with his wife and four-year-old son to check his eyesight was sound before travelling back to London. He has maintained that he acted \u201clawfully and reasonably\u201d when he journeyed 264 miles north to self-isolate on his parent\u2019s farm in County Durham at the end of March, at the height of the pandemic. The Telegraph (paywall) reports that the Durham police investigation has concluded that this was a minor breach of the guidelines that did not warrant any further action. More on this story to follow. This is from the Telegraph\u2019s Martin Evans The Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, has written to MPs regarding the early recall of parliament next week, at 11.30am on Tuesday, to approve a new voting system. In the letter he says the main purpose of the recall is to bring forward a motion on how the house should vote, considering the usual way of voting using division lobbies doesn\u2019t marry up with social distancing and wouldn\u2019t be safe, and there is currently no other method for divisions sanctioned by the house. The government has until Monday morning to table its motion on how it proposes voting take place. The attorney general, Suella Braverman, has dismissed accusations that she has undermined the independence of her office by tweeting her support for Dominic Cummings\u2019 trip to Durham during lockdown. Last Saturday, in the wake of the Guardian\u2019s story about Cummings, the MP for Fareham tweeted: \u201cProtecting one\u2019s family is what any good parent does\u201d. It was attached to the No 10 statement defending Cummings\u2019 travels. Her involvement provoked calls for her to resign on the grounds that the intervention compromised the independence of her office as the government\u2019s chief legal adviser and put her in an impossible position in relation to any subsequent police inquiry. Lord Falconer, Labour\u2019s shadow attorney general, wrote to her stating: The prime minister should not be lending his authority to attacks on the enforcement of the criminal law. He should certainly not be egged on in that by the attorney general. On Thursday, Falconer published her response on Twitter: Braverman replied: Since you wrote Mr Cummings has given a full account of his decisions to address the questions you and others have raised. There is of course no question of my having offered any public legal view (as you know, Law Officers do not publish their legal advice much less tweet about it) nor of seeking to pre-empt any formal investigation. The purpose of my comments, as I think would be obvious to any fair minded observer, was simply to support the decision to clarify events... Nearly half of over-70s could be self-isolating unnecessarily, after new research found widespread misinterpretation of government rules among older people. At least 43% of adults over 65 polled for the charity Independent Age incorrectly believed the government had instructed all over-70s to shield themselves by not leaving the house. In fact, UK government guidance for this group \u2013 classed as clinically vulnerable \u2013 is to stay at home as much as possible and \u201ctake particular care\u201d in physical distancing. Only those with certain conditions, classed as extremely clinically vulnerable \u2013 such as those with specific cancers \u2013 have been advised to stay at home at all times. Less than a third of the 483 older people polled correctly identified the correct guidance for over-70s without underlying health conditions. The results suggest thousands of people in later life around the UK may have completely shielded themselves and lived in isolation, when they could have left the house for physically distanced exercise and shopping for essentials. The polling also showed that 28% of respondents \u2013 well over a quarter \u2013 found the guidance for over-70s unclear or very unclear. Durham police today said they fined two people for travelling hundreds of miles from London to their area during the coronavirus lockdown. The news comes as a fresh statement from Durham police is expected as soon as today, following their examination of claims of sightings of Dominic Cummings in the Durham area, and whether lockdown rules had been broken. A spokesperson for Durham police confirmed the fines were issued on 8 April against two people from different households who travelled together from London to Peterlee, in County Durham. That trip is about 260 miles and came just over a week after the prime minister\u2019s key aide decided to drive with his wife and child from his London home to his parents\u2019 farm, fearing being struck down by coronavirus. The trip by Cummings has led to no action by police, and its revelation on Friday by the Guardian and Daily Mirror led to calls for Cummings\u2019 resignation, but he has maintained his actions were lawful and not in breach of the lockdown. Cummings also admitted to a trip on 12 April to a beauty spot, Barnard Castle, with his wife and child. He said on Monday he had been testing his eyesight and fitness to drive after being struck down by the virus. Durham police say since the original news stories, they have received further claims and complaints from the public and are examining that information. Cummings said he travelled to ensure childcare in case he and his wife were struck down by the virus, and claims an exemption to the stay at home order issued by his boss, the prime minister, allowed him to make the trip. Many disagree and have called for his resignation. The new statement from Durham police is eagerly awaited. The Tory MP Karen Bradley has said she is \u201cnot convinced\u201d by Dominic Cummings\u2019 explanation of his actions and that aspects of his account suggest \u201cthere were breaches of the rules to avoid some of the hardships that many have endured\u201d. In a statement on her website, the Staffordshire Moorlands MP wrote that the PM\u2019s most senior adviser should \u201cconsider his position\u201d. It reads: I can well understand that any parent wants to protect their child, and have enormous sympathy with acting to do that. But so much of the account goes beyond that simple human instinct and suggests that there were breaches of the rules to avoid some of the hardships that many have endured. I want you to know that I have shared your views at the highest level. Mr Cummings is, in my view causing significant damage to the work that the government are doing to get us through the pandemic. I hope that he will recognise this and consider his position. We expect those that lead us to lead by example, especially those with such a significant influence on government. I can reach no other conclusion than that for the sake of this country, Mr Cummings should do the right thing now and stop damaging the work that needs to be done. If the UK government wants to start easing the national lockdown, it needs to get contact tracing right \u2013 that much is clear. But what does that mean? What would successful contact tracing look like? In this explainer, Josh Toussaint-Strauss tries to find out with help from Christophe Fraser, an Oxford professor and infectious disease epidemiologist, and the Guardian\u2019s UK technology editor, Alex Hern. More than 50 of the UK\u2019s leading artistic directors and theatre figures from ethnically diverse backgrounds, including the Young Vic\u2019s Kwame Kwei-Amah, have signed an open letter that calls on the culture secretary Oliver Dowden to ensure that \u201cethnic diversity is protected and celebrated in policy\u201d as Covid-19 threatens to dramatically reshape the UK\u2019s cultural landscape. The signatories point to the recent success of John Boyega, Idris Elba and Gemma Chan, who began their careers on British stages before finding success, and warns that without policies to protect diversity it could be lost as theatres struggle to operate in a post Covid-19 UK. The letter calls on Dowden and the government to \u201censure the progress we have collectively made does not fall by the way-side\u201d because of the impact of the pandemic, which has already caused the closure of several theatres around the country. The letter states: The Covid-19 crisis threatens all aspects of the theatrical ecology, but catalysed by the revelations of the racial disparity in the health crisis, this group of Black, Asian and ethnically diverse artistic leaders call on the government and the sector to ensure the progress we have collectively made does not fall by the way-side. We insist that ethnic diversity is protected and celebrated in policy going forwards and propose that any task-force or group gathering to speak about the future of our industry seeks out consultation from Black, Asian and ethnically diverse leaders to ensure this commitment. Signatories of the letter include Lynette Linton, the artistic director of Bush Theatre and Roy Alexander Weise, the co-artistic director of the Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester, who say the diverse theatremakers they represent are \u201cessential to the arts returning at full strength and playing its part in our nation\u2019s recovery\u201d. Reopening primary schools to some year groups next week could have a \u201cdetrimental impact\u201d on home learning for pupils who are still at home, the leader of the headteachers\u2019 union has warned. Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), said fewer teachers would be available to support children with remote learning if pupils in reception, year 1 and year 6 are taught in smaller groups from next week. His comments came ahead of the government\u2019s final decision on whether to reopen primary schools in England to more pupils from as early as Monday. On Wednesday, the school standards minister, Nick Gibb, said it was \u201cdifficult to say\u201d whether the government\u2019s aim to get all primary school pupils back in class before the summer break will occur. He told MPs on the education select committee: Remote education, home education, will continue for the majority of pupils and young people \u2013 probably until the end of the summer term. Findings from the NAHT suggest nearly three in five (57%) schools are providing home-learning resources for pupils daily and more than a quarter (29%) provide them weekly. The survey of 4,784 school leaders, carried out earlier this month, also found that the majority of schools have been creating their own online resources as well as liaising with parents about home learning. But the NAHT is concerned that the quality of remote learning on offer for the year groups that will not be returning to school in the summer term may suffer amid a wider reopening of schools in England. Whiteman told the PA news agency: Splitting classes in order to reduce the risk of transmission requires twice the number of staff, leaving fewer teachers to support those other children still at home. I worry that an unintended consequence will be a detrimental impact on home learning. I know the profession will continue to do all that it can, there are no easy answers. The Tory MP Rob Butler has said he found Dominic Cummings\u2019 trip to Barnard Castle \u201cvery difficult to justify\u201d, though stopped short of calling for him to go. In a letter to a constituent seen by the Guardian, Butler said he felt \u201cthe guidance [on exceptional circumstances] can be interpreted in the way Mr Cummings has done\u201d. He then added: However, Mr Cummings himself said \u2018there is room for reasonable disagreement\u2019 about whether he should have stayed in London, and I do not criticise anyone who does indeed disagree with him. Personally, I find the trip Mr Cummings took to Barnard Castle very difficult to justify and am disappointed that he did not apologise for it. A tally of more than 60 Conservative MPs, including the cabinet minister Penny Mordaunt, have now either been critical of the PM\u2019s most senior adviser\u2019s actions or called for him to resign or be sacked. These from the Labour MP Ben Bradshaw and Lib Dem MP Daisy Cooper, who say Dido Harding \u2013 the government\u2019s lead for the test and trace programme \u2013 has told them track and trace won\u2019t be fully operational until the end of June. As others have pointed out, that is four weeks after lockdown measures are to be further eased. Good morning everyone. I\u2019m Lucy Campbell, taking over the live blog for the rest of the day. Your input is invaluable so, as ever, please do feel free to get in touch with any news tips and stories you think we should be covering here. Email: lucy.campbell@theguardian.com Twitter: @lucy_campbell_ The Scottish government\u2019s own test and protect scheme is also going live today, across all of Scotland\u2019s health board areas, on the same day as the country\u2019s lockdown restrictions are due to be eased. From today, if people develop coronavirus symptoms they must book a test immediately and isolate themselves \u2013 the aim is for all results to be returned within 24 hours. If the test is positive, the individual will then hear from a tracer who will ask them about recent face-to-face contacts, within their household or less than two metres away for 15 minutes or more. Nicola Sturgeon has emphasised that this data will be secure and only available to NHS Scotland, but also stressed that the scheme should not be looked at as optional but is \u2013 like lockdown itself \u2013 a \u201ccollective national endeavour\u201d. She stressed it should not be looked on as optional, with everyone needing to play their part to ensure it is successful. She has also urged employers to \u201cprotect the income\u201d of their staff who are required to self-isolate, and is in ongoing discussions with the UK government about changes to statutory sick pay to make sure people do not lose income, and has even suggested that the Scottish government could provide hotel rooms free to those who need to isolate away from their families. A London council has welcomed losing a case in the court of appeal because it says the ruling will help protect vulnerable renters during the pandemic. Thousands of renters have been granted a reprieve from eviction during the pandemic following the court ruling on Wednesday (27 May). The housing minister, Robert Jenrick, announced in March that private tenants would not be evicted for at least three months during the pandemic. However, it was unclear whether those who were subject to eviction proceedings not yet concluded, before the outbreak, would be covered by the eviction ban. Three court of appeal judges said they too were protected. Tenant Kevin Okoro brought the case against Hackney council in east London after they commenced eviction proceedings against him for rent arrears on 20 December last year. He was in the process of appealing when the pandemic struck. Okoro\u2019s lawyers argued that in order to prevent the courts from being overwhelmed and to protect public health during the pandemic, the many people in the process of appealing against eviction notices should be included in the protection for renters announced by Jenrick. The judges agreed and said that while the bar on evictions until at least 25 June continues during the pandemic, those in the process of appealing against eviction should also be protected from losing their homes and there should be a freeze on eviction appeal proceedings for the time being. They said that many involved in these appeals were \u201cvulnerable and unrepresented\u201d. In a separate development, Hackney council has written to Jenrick calling for the ban on evictions that he announced in March to be extended beyond June to avoid a surge in homelessness after the ban is lifted. A Hackney council spokesperson said: \u201cWe welcome today\u2019s ruling \u2013 Hackney has been clear that no evictions are to take place during the coronavirus lockdown and the safety of our residents is paramount. This case predates the coronavirus crisis, and while we had no intention of proceeding with the eviction in the current circumstances, we welcome the clarity it provides for similar cases and residents similarly concerned about having somewhere safe to stay at this time.\u201d Tim Baldwin, a housing law barrister at Garden Court Chambers, represented the tenant who brought the legal challenge. He said: \u201cThis ruling will protect thousands more vulnerable tenants from eviction until 25 June 2020.\u201d Tui has extended the suspension of holidays for UK customers until at least the end of June due to coronavirus travel restrictions. The UK\u2019s biggest tour operator had previously cancelled all trips up to 11 June. It has also suspended its Marella Cruises sailings up to 30 July. Tui said in a statement it had extended the suspension of holidays \u201cdue to the ongoing travel restrictions\u201d. A 14-day quarantine for international arrivals is due to begin in the UK on 8 June. The number of passengers arriving in the UK by air fell from around 7.1 million in January to 3.8 million in March, according to a Home Office report. Numbers fell \u201csharply\u201d since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, dropping to 112,300 arrivals in April. This is 99% lower than the number of air passengers coming to the country in April 2019, provisional advance passenger information (API) data showed. The report published on Thursday said the majority (58%) of arrivals since the lockdown was announced on 23 March were British nationals coming back to the UK. The remaining 42% \u201cwill include foreign nationals who are UK residents returning to the UK, dependants of UK residents and other non-British nationals\u201d. While the reduction in air travel was \u201cmost marked\u201d, over this period the number of passengers arriving by sea was 97% fewer and by rail was 98% fewer than at the same time the previous year, according to the report. The National Trust is reopening some of its gardens and parklands on 3 June, although visitors will have to book an appointment in advance to visit. The email to members sent out this morning says its popular stately homes remain shut. Only gardens in England and Northern Ireland are being opened, reflecting the continued lockdown in Scotland and Wales. \u201cFor now, our houses remain closed and we\u2019ll open these as soon as we can. To open these gardens and parklands safely, we\u2019ve had to reduce the number of people we can welcome at one time, so you\u2019ll need to book in advance. New booking timeslots become available on a Friday for visits the following week,\u201d it says. \u201cFrom tomorrow (Friday) you\u2019ll be able to find out what\u2019s opening near you and book a visit. Your visit to us may be different from usual, because there are a few things we need everyone to do to help us keep places open safely.\u201d Hello everyone. I am running the Guardian\u2019s news feed this morning, bringing you all the latest information. Please do share any news tips or information with me as I work. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com The test and trace system will fail to work effectively if statutory sick pay is not increased, the government has been warned. Those self-isolating will be eligible for statutory sick pay but there are fears that many workers will not be able to afford to isolate and will be forced to keep working. NHS test and trace \u2013 seen as key to easing the coronavirus lockdown restrictions \u2013 will be rolled out across England on Thursday and there are concerns that people could be asked to self-isolate for a period of 14 days more than once in the coming weeks. The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: We need a testing and tracing programme up and running as soon as possible. But it will not be effective if workers are pushed into hardship when they are required to self-isolate. Statutory sick pay is just \u00a395 per week \u2013 and two million workers aren\u2019t even eligible for that. If workers can\u2019t afford to self-isolate, then they will be forced to keep working. That will put them, their workmates and their local community at risk, and undermine the entire test and trace programme. Matt Hancock had an exchange with Kay Burley this morning in which she accused him of rushing through the test and trace system. He laughed at this suggestion and said he committed to getting the system in mid-May. She responded by saying he spoke about the app in mid-May and that still had not arrived. \u201cMany of my viewers will think it\u2019s not a laughing matter,\u201d Burley said. The 10th weekly Clap for Carers event may be the last, after the woman behind the idea said she will no longer take part. Millions of people across the UK have lined their thresholds, gathered \u2013 while socially distancing \u2013 on pavements, and stood in their gardens at 8pm every Thursday to demonstrate their support for care staff and frontline workers. But the ritual has been criticised by some for becoming \u201cpoliticised\u201d, while others, including NHS staff, have said some people who take part in the clap then wilfully ignore the plea to stay at home and avoid gatherings in an effort to ease the strain on the healthcare system. The Metropolitan police commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick, was filmed leading dozens of officers in the weekly applause for key workers on a crowded Westminster Bridge. Annemarie Plas, 36, last week told the PA news agency she had no problem with people continuing to gather at 8pm each week to clap, but said she will not be among those taking part in future. She said: \u201cTo have the most impact I think it is good to stop it at its peak. \u201cWithout getting too political, I share some of the opinions that some people have about it becoming politicised. \u201cI think the narrative is starting to change and I don\u2019t want the clap to be negative.\u201d Plas, from Streatham in south London, told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain she will clap on Thursday evening, and will return outside at the same time next week to \u201ccheck in\u201d with her community, without applauding. Matt Hancock said \u201coutside is safer than indoors\u201d. Talking about the possibility of pubs opening, the health secretary told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThe good thing that we\u2019ve learned from the science of this virus in the last few weeks is that the risk of transmission outdoors is much lower \u2013 it\u2019s not zero, but it is much lower than indoors. \u201cSo, during the summer in particular, a lot of the changes that you can expect to see will be based on the principle that outdoors is safer than indoors.\u201d The Guardian has today launched an interactive, to pay tribute to those who lost their lives to coronavirus. Contact tracing could be undermined by continued government support for Dominic Cummings, the shadow health secretary has said. Jonathan Ashworth voiced support for NHS test and trace launched in England on Thursday morning as \u201cthe only way we can safely ease out of this lockdown\u201d. But he added that the health secretary Matt Hancock\u2019s support for Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser could \u201cundermine\u201d public cooperation with the scheme. Under the new system, people who come into close contact with a coronavirus sufferer will be told to self-isolate for 14 days, while an accompanying app is still delayed by several weeks. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Ashworth said: \u201cWe need everybody to cooperate with this because it\u2019s in all of our interests that this works, and I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve got to say it, it\u2019s why I think Matt Hancock\u2019s support of Dominic Cummings is really irresponsible. \u201cMy worry is some people will think \u2018Why should I stay at home for two weeks on my own when I feel fine, while this guy who\u2019s Boris Johnson\u2019s big pal in Downing Street can get away with travelling across the country to Durham?\u201d\u2019 Health secretary Matt Hancock said people will not receive penalties for not abiding by the NHS test and trace self-isolation period \u201cin the first instance\u201d. Pushed on people\u2019s concerns about fraudulent NHS calls, Hancock told LBC: If anybody calls they will be calling from the number 0300 0135 000, if you get a text it will come from NHS and they will never ask you for any form of payment or purchase or details of your bank account, and also you will then be given, if you\u2019re online, a QR code to be able to confirm those details online. Asked whether he himself, having had coronavirus, would have to self-isolate again if told to do so, Hancock said: Unfortunately, yes. It is very frustrating but the reason for that is we don\u2019t yet know whether people like me who have had it still transmit it if they come into contact with it a second time. On employers covering the wages of employees told to self-isolate, Hancock said \u201cit is very important work constructively with their staff\u201d. He added: \u201cIt is better to have this sort of targeted isolation than the blanketed measures we\u2019ve got in place at the moment.\u201d Hello everyone. I am running the Guardian\u2019s news feed this morning, bringing you all the latest information. Please do share any news tips or information with me as I work. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Brian Strutton, general secretary of the pilots\u2019 union Balpa said: EasyJet staff will be shocked at the scale of this announcement. Only two days ago staff got a \u2018good news\u2019 message from their boss with no mention of job losses so this is a real kick in the teeth. Those staff have taken pay cuts to keep the airline afloat and this is the treatment they get in return. EasyJet has not discussed its plans with Balpa so we will wait and see what impact there will be in the UK. But given EasyJet is a British company, the UK is it\u2019s strongest market and it has had hundreds of millions in support from the UK taxpayer I can safely say that we will need a lot of convincing that EasyJet needs to make such dramatic cuts. Indeed, EasyJet\u2019sown projections, though on the pessimistic side, point to recovery by 2023 so this is a temporary problem that doesn\u2019t need this ill-considered knee-jerk reaction. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said tracers will make a \u201cclinical judgment\u201d on who should self-isolate \u201cwith the best aim to be to find the people who you\u2019ve been in contact with under two metres for 15 minutes\u201d. Hancock told BBC Breakfast: \u201cOur goal is that we have the turnaround of the test within 24 hours. We\u2019ve now managed to get the system so that 84% of the tests that you take at a drive-through centre are turned around within 24 hours and the Prime Minister yesterday set us the goal of having every test turned around within 24 hours.\u201d On when the timeframe starts, Hancock said \u201cthe time that really matters is the time from the moment you have symptoms and call up\u201d. He added: \u201cFrom that moment until we can get the positive result back if that is what it is, if it is positive, and get going on the contact tracing - it is that end-to-end time that matters.\u201d Hancock said he is \u201cconfident\u201d that results can be received \u201cfaster\u201d than an academic study which suggested it would take three days. Thousands of easyJet staff are to lose their jobs under plans announced by the airline. The Luton-based carrier said it intends to reduce its workforce by up to 30% as it reduces the size of its fleet due to the coronavirus pandemic. This follows similar moves by other airlines such as British Airways and Ryanair. EasyJet has around 15,000 full-time employees, meaning a maximum of 4,500 jobs are at risk. The low-cost airline\u2019s chief executive Johan Lundgren said: We realise that these are very difficult times and we are having to consider very difficult decisions which will impact our people, but we want to protect as many jobs as we can for the long term. We remain focused on doing what is right for the company and its long-term health and success, following the swift action we have taken over the last three months to meet the challenges of the virus. Although we will restart flying on 15 June, we expect demand to build slowly, only returning to 2019 levels in about three years\u2019 time. Against this backdrop, we are planning to reduce the size of our fleet and to optimise the network and our bases. EasyJet announced that by the end of next year it expects to have reduced its fleet size by around 51 aircraft to approximately 302. This will be achieved through measures such as deferring new aircraft arrivals. Bookings for winter are \u201cwell ahead of the equivalent point last year\u201d, partly due to some customers rebooking flights which were cancelled due to the pandemic. The governor of the Bank of England has warned Britain\u2019s economic recovery from the coronavirus crisis will be tougher than expected, saying a fresh wave of money creation methods will be needed. Andrew Bailey has shied away from idea of cutting official interest rates to below zero for the first time in the Bank\u2019s 326-year history. Instead, he says more economic support is likely to come in the form of quantitative easing (QE) \u2013 in which the Bank buys government bonds from investors, pumping money into the economy in the process. Since the crisis began in March, the Bank has cut official interest rates to 0.1%, announced a 200 billion expansion of QE, made moves to ease the financial pressure on large companies and made it easier for banks to lend. Bailey is wary, however, of going further by taking interest rates negative. \u201cWe have signalled that we stand ready to do more within the framework of policies we have used to date,\u201d he wrote in The Guardian. \u201cAnd, in view of the risks we face, it is of course right that we consider what further options, such as cutting interest rates into unprecedented territory, might be available in the future. But it is also important that we consider very carefully the issues that such choices would give rise to.\u201d Despite support measures already taken, official figures released on Wednesday showed the Government was paying the wages of 8.4 million employees, out of a total labour force of 32 million. A new report by a UK charity has highlighted the plight of the world\u2019s most vulnerable communities amid the coronavirus pandemic, calling it a crisis from which many people will never recover. After studying 13 countries in Africa and Asia, the charity Street Child said one third of people surveyed were unable to take the most basic measures to guard against Covid-19, including washing their hands. More than half of the children in the survey have been unable to take part in learning activities during the pandemic, the group said, while more than half of people surveyed were fearful of hunger and starvation due to rising food prices and their loss of income. Street Child\u2019s chief executive Tom Dannatt said in a statement the results of the survey \u201cclearly demonstrate Covid-19 is having a devastating impact on the world\u2019s most vulnerable communities\u201d. \u201cWith schools closed, a lack of access to basic prevention measures such as soap and water, and a very real risk of extreme hunger and even starvation, children and families are in the midst of a crisis that many will never recover from,\u201d he said. Nicola Sturgeon is expected to announce \u201ccautious\u201d steps out of lockdown for Scotland. The First Minister will reveal on Thursday if the country is moving on to the first phase of a four-part plan for easing the restrictions - which were put in place more than nine weeks ago on March 23. Dozens of travel companies have called on the home secretary to scrap plans to impose a mandatory 14-day quarantine on people arriving in the UK due to the coronavirus. Accusing the government of being \u201cwoefully slow\u201d in its support for the travel industry, more than 70 company heads have co-signed a letter to Priti Patel over her announcement last week surrounding the new measure for arrivals, which starts on June 8. Signatories have urged the government to switch from protection mode in the face of the Covid-19 crisis to economic recovery. \u201cThe very last thing the travel industry needs,\u201d the letter says, \u201cis a mandatory quarantine imposed on all arriving passengers which will deter foreign visitors from coming here, deter UK visitors from travelling abroad and, most likely, cause other countries to impose reciprocal quarantine requirements on British visitors, as France has already announced. \u201c Health secretary Matt Hancock said that people will have to self-isolate for 14 days on more than one occasion if told to do so by the NHS. \u201cEmployment law covers this and we changed the law a couple of months ago so that if you are instructed by the NHS for public health reasons to stay at home, then that is the equivalent in employment law to being ill, and it is very important that employers are flexible around this.\u201d Asked how quickly test results will be received back, Hancock said: \u201c84% of the tests from the drive-through centres are returned within 24 hours, 95% of all tests are returned within 48 hours. \u201cOf course, there are examples of where the process hasn\u2019t worked, because this is now a massive process, so there are individual stray examples. We\u2019re working all the time to make it faster, I want to see every test returned within 24 hours from those drive-through centres and we will do that just as quickly as we can.\u201d Hancock added that he is \u201csure\u201d chief medical officer Chris Whitty and chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance \u201cwill be at the podium soon\u201d. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said he believes \u201cthe vast majority of people\u201d will self-isolate voluntarily under the new NHS Test and Trace system. Asked what people should do if they have childcare issues but are told to self-isolate, Hancock told Sky News: \u201cWell, of course, it is very important that childcare is taken into account. I understand that as well as anybody, so yes it is very important that people deal with childcare and do that in a reasonable way.\u201d Pushed on whether you would still need to stay at home, he added: \u201cThat is what you will be instructed to do, yes, and you should follow those instructions because that is in the best interest of everybody.\u201d Asked how the system could be made mandatory in future, Mr Hancock said: \u201cThere are powers that we took through Parliament at the start of the crisis in the Coronavirus Act to be able to mandate this but I\u2019d far rather not....\u201d He added that it would be \u201cfar better if we didn\u2019t have to make it mandatory\u201d. EasyJet plans to reduce its workforce by up to 30% to enable a \u201crestructure of our business\u201d due to the coronavirus pandemic, the airline said. Chief executive Johan Lundgren said: \u201cWe realise that these are very difficult times and we are having to consider very difficult decisions which will impact our people, but we want to protect as many jobs as we can for the long-term. \u201cWe remain focused on doing what is right for the company and its long-term health and success, following the swift action we have taken over the last three months to meet the challenges of the virus. \u201cAlthough we will restart flying on June 15, we expect demand to build slowly, only returning to 2019 levels in about three years\u2019 time. \u201cAgainst this backdrop, we are planning to reduce the size of our fleet and to optimise the network and our bases.

      "bodyText": "In just four months, Covid-19 has upended life in the US, ravaging cities and businesses and overwhelming hospitals woefully unprepared. What started as a single infection in Washington state ballooned until the US became the global hotspot for Covid-19, with exponentially more confirmed cases than any other nation. Mixed messages from Donald Trump and his administration have caused confusion over when or if Americans will return to life as usual. Squabbles between the president, governors and mayors have inspired headlines as critics assail missed chances to contain the virus. Now, the US has passed another grim milestone, 100,000 Covid-related deaths, while there are more than 1.7 million confirmed cases, according to Johns Hopkins University. More than 40 million are out of work as states begin to reopen amid fears a patchwork response could lead to a second wave of infections. These are the defining moments from the US under Covid-19 so far. 21 January The US confirms its first case of Covid-19, after a 35-year-old man who lives north of Seattle returns from Wuhan, China. A day later, Trump tells CNBC: \u201cIt\u2019s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control.\u201d 29 January The White House announces a taskforce to \u201cmonitor, contain and mitigate the spread of the virus\u201d. 30 January The World Health Organization (WHO) labels the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. But Trump continues to downplay it, telling a crowd in Iowa: \u201cWe only have five people. Hopefully, everything\u2019s going to be great.\u201d 31 January Alex Azar, secretary of health and human services, declares a public health emergency. Trump restricts travel from China, a decision that he later claims, erroneously, saved hundreds of thousands of lives. 5 February After becoming the third president to be impeached, Trump is acquitted by the Republican-controlled Senate. 6 February The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ships coronavirus testing kits to labs, but early tests are contaminated, handicapping the response. The US experiences its first known death from Covid-19, in California, though it will not be identified and reported as such for months. 24 February The economy shows signs of free fall, even as Trump tweets: \u201cStock Market starting to look very good to me!\u201d His administration asks Congress for $2.5bn to pay for vaccine development and protective equipment. 26 February The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces that a patient in California has tested positive for Covid-19, potentially the first US case where the source of infection is unknown. At Life Care Center, a nursing home outside Seattle, two residents contract the virus. Dozens will succumb. Trump taps Mike Pence to lead the coronavirus response. 29 February The US makes public what is then believed to be its first Covid-related death, a man in his 50s. The case is in Washington state, ground zero for the virus. Trump restricts travel from Iran. 6 March Trump signs an $8.3bn aid bill that receives near-unanimous support in Congress. He says: \u201cAnybody that wants a test can get a test,\u201d a claim that confuses Americans and hamstrings healthcare workers. 11 March The WHO redefines the outbreak as a pandemic. Trump restricts travel from Europe, excluding the UK. Days later, he announces a bar on travel from the UK and Ireland. 12 March Broadway closes and the NCAA cancels March Madness. The US has more than 1,600 confirmed coronavirus cases, across almost every state. 13 March Trump declares a national emergency, the same day Washington state orders its schools closed. 18 March Trump signs a second coronavirus relief bill. 19 March Californians must stay at home to curtail the spread of the virus. A day later, New York issues a similar order, beginning a war of words between Trump and a number of governors. 24 March Trump tells Fox News he \u201cwould love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter\u201d, 12 April. He faces immediate criticism. 26 March The US reports its first 1,000 deaths. The next day, Trump signs a $2.2tn stimulus package that includes a $1,200 check for many Americans. Trump later takes heat for making sure the checks, intended to help struggling workers during catastrophic levels of unemployment, bear his signature during an election year. 28 March The US death toll doubles, to more than 2,000, in just two days. 31 March In a significant shift in tone, exactly a week after he floated the idea of reopening the country by Easter, Trump says \u201cour country is in the midst of a great national trial, unlike any we have ever faced before\u201d. 3 April The CDC recommends all Americans wear face coverings in public \u2013 after weeks of suggesting otherwise. New York\u2019s mayor warns that D-Day is looming as hospitals struggle to find personal protective equipment, ventilators, beds and staff. 13 April Trump claims total authority over the states, saying: \u201cThe president of the United States calls the shots.\u201d He is challenged by governors, who say he does not have the constitutional right to reopen the country without their involvement. 17 April Two days after thousands of protesters in Michigan gathered to decry their state\u2019s stay-at-home order, Trump tweets to \u201cLIBERATE MINNESOTA\u201d, \u201cLIBERATE MICHIGAN\u201d and \u201cLIBERATE VIRGINIA\u201d. Protesters in other states follow suit. 23 April The House of Representatives approves another relief bill to help small businesses and hospitals, after previous funds for small businesses fell into the hands of large companies such as Shake Shack and Potbelly. At a press briefing, Trump seems to suggest people might inject disinfectant as a way to fight the virus. 24 April Trump claims he was being sarcastic about the disinfectant. The US surpasses 50,000 Covid-related deaths. 27 April Trump says his administration is conducting \u201cserious investigations\u201d into China\u2019s handling of the disease outbreak, and would most likely seek \u201cvery substantial\u201d damages from Beijing over the pandemic. 28 April The number of Americans who have tested positive for coronavirus is now more than 1 million, while almost 60,000 people are confirmed to have died with the disease in the US. At least 68 people have already died at a veterans\u2019 home in Massachusetts after contracting Covid-19, with dozens more infected. 30 April Amazon announces revenues of $74.5bn in the first quarter of 2020, 26% higher than the same period last year and equivalent to more than $33m an hour. 3 May Trump tells Fox News on Sunday that he\u2019s \u201cvery confident\u201d of a vaccine being developed by the end of 2020. 5 May The White House coronavirus taskforce could be wound down as soon as June with responsibility handed back to federal agencies, the taskforce chief, Mike Pence, says. The US death toll tops 70,000. 6 May Trump says a growing coronavirus death toll is simply the price that must be paid for reopening the economy. \u201cWe have to be warriors,\u201d he tells Fox News. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep our country closed down for years.\u201d He reverses his plan to disband the White House coronavirus taskforce. 7 May The Trump administration shelved a document created by the nation\u2019s top disease investigators, it emerges, with step-by-step advice to local authorities on how and when to reopen restaurants and other public places during the still-raging coronavirus pandemic. 9 May Three members of the White House coronavirus taskforce \u2013 including Dr Anthony Fauci \u2013 place themselves in self-quarantine after contact with someone who tested positive for Covid-19. 13 May Despite Trump\u2019s claims that the spread of coronavirus is dropping around the US, new infection hotspots are cropping up across Republican heartlands, including in Texas and Alabama. 18 May The president says he is taking antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine as a defense against Covid-19, despite FDA warnings about its risks. Trump also threatened to cut US funding to the World Health Organization permanently. 21 May Trump defies requests by going without a face mask in public during his tour of a Ford factory in Michigan, though pictures emerged of him wearing one earlier. Obama administration scientists warn the US must rebuild its emergency medical stockpile before fall. 22 May Churches, mosques and synagogues are \u201cessential services\u201d, Trump declares, and threatens to override governors who refuse to reopen them at the weekend \u2013 a power he does not possess. 27 May The United States records more than 100,000 deaths from Covid-19, moving past a the milestone even as many states relax mitigation measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus.",

But clearly he has flouted the government plea to stay at home.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sir Peter Fahy, a former chief constable of Greater Manchester police, said: \u201cPeople will be puzzled. How is the PM saying the Barnard Castle trip is legal when Durham police say it is not?&nbsp;It is an uncomfortable position the police have been left in.

      "bodyText": "Durham police believe Dominic Cummings probably did break lockdown rules following an investigation into his travels around north-east England during lockdown, the Guardian understands. On Thursday the force released a report saying the prime minister\u2019s special adviser \u201cmight have\u201d breached health protection regulations when he embarked on a 52-mile round trip to the town of Barnard Castle with his wife and son on her birthday. Officers might have intervened to send him home had they caught him on the trip on 12 April, or fined him if he refused, the report said. His 260-mile journey to Durham on 27 March did not break health protection regulations, the report concluded, though it made no finding in relation to \u201cstay at home\u201d government guidance. Cummings has denied any wrongdoing and said the journey on 12 April, Easter Sunday, was to test his eyesight. The prime minister and cabinet continued to stand by him on Thursday. As part of their inquiry, detectives examined the aide\u2019s press conference on Monday, where he repeatedly said that he had done nothing wrong, and concluded he probably did. Police stopped short of a definitive declaration of rule-breaking because lockdown regulations had not been tested in the courts, sources with knowledge of the force\u2019s thinking told the Guardian. They were keen not to appear to act as \u201cjudge and jury\u201d, it is understood. Durham is one of the forces least likely to issue fines, and said it would not act retrospectively against Cummings, whose trips were revealed by a joint Guardian and Daily Mirror investigation. Mike Barton, a former chief constable of Durham police, said of the report: \u201cThis is not an exoneration \u2026 They would have told him to go home [during the Barnard Castle journey] and if he refused they would have fined him.\u201d He said the police statement on Cummings\u2019 journey from London to Durham contained thinly coded criticism: \u201cThey are [in effect] saying he broke the guidance to stay at home, but not the regulations that were put into law. But clearly he has flouted the government plea to stay at home.\u201d Sir Peter Fahy, a former chief constable of Greater Manchester police, said: \u201cPeople will be puzzled. How is the PM saying the Barnard Castle trip is legal when Durham police say it is not? It is an uncomfortable position the police have been left in. The public have to feel that people in positions of power are complying with the law. That\u2019s where there is a danger.\u201d Robin Lees, the retired chemistry teacher who spotted Cummings in Barnard Castle and took a note of his car registration number, said he welcomed the police conclusion. \u201cI did not need to drive 60 miles to test my eyesight \u2013 I knew it was him. Lots of Tory MPs have said he should resign but I guess that is up to him,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t really decide on his motivation but his statement does match mine. They [the police] said he broke the rules, just like the other two \u2013 Scottish chief medical officer Catherine Calderwood and government scientific adviser Neil Ferguson. They did not get fined but they did resign.\u201d The Durham police statement said: \u201cDurham constabulary have examined the circumstances surrounding the journey to Barnard Castle (including ANPR [automatic number plate recognition], witness evidence and a review of Mr Cummings\u2019 press conference on 25 May 2020) and have concluded that there might have been a minor breach of the regulations that would have warranted police intervention. Durham constabulary view this as minor because there was no apparent breach of social distancing. \u201cHad a Durham constabulary police officer stopped Mr Cummings driving to or from Barnard Castle, the officer would have spoken to him, and, having established the facts, likely advised Mr Cummings to return to the address in Durham, providing advice on the dangers of travelling during the pandemic crisis. Had this advice been accepted by Mr Cummings, no enforcement action would have been taken.\u201d Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow home secretary, said: \u201cThe police have confirmed what we all knew, that Dominic Cummings broke the rules he helped to write.

(We are concerned here with breaches of the regulations, not the general government guidance to \u2018stay at home\u2019).\u201d The force had carried out an exercise to establish the facts. It was asked to do so on Monday morning by Steve White, the acting police, crime and victims\u2019 commissioner for Durham, who oversees the force. On Friday the Guardian and the Daily Mirror revealed Cummings had driven from his London home to his parents\u2019 property in Durham on 27 March, at a time when the public were being told to stay at home to stop the spread of the coronavirus. The Durham inquiry said there was \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d to back claims that Cummings was in Durham again on 19 April, and that the prime minister\u2019s top aide had denied it.",

      "bodyText": "The Premier League looks set to resume on 17 June, three months after it was forced into hiatus by the Covid\u201119 pandemic. Clubs agreed the date at a shareholders\u2019 meeting on Thursday, although it remains provisional: the league must wait for, and then implement, government guidance on staging matches safely behind closed doors before any plans can be completed. It must also hope players and staff \u2013 and perhaps the public at large \u2013 hold coronavirus at bay. Should everything go as intended, the restart will begin with the two games left over from March: Aston Villa v Sheffield United and Manchester City v Arsenal. A full fixture list would take place on the weekend of 19-21 June. All of the 92 remaining matches in the season will be screened live on TV including, for the first time, games at 3pm on Saturdays. The majority of games will be on Sky and BT Sport, but Amazon will also stream games and, in another first, the BBC will show four Premier League matches live.

The prime minister was again besieged by questions about his chief adviser as the crisis overshadowed his decision to cautiously ease the lockdown in England, which will require millions of citizens to abide by the letter and spirit of new guidelines. Johnson said the matter was closed after Durham police concluded Cummings may have broken lockdown rules but decided they would take no action against him. The prime minister also blocked journalists from asking his top scientific advisers, Prof Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance, about their expert opinion on the matter. Cummings\u2019 actions remained in the spotlight for a sixth day, however, after the police concluded that his family trip to Barnard Castle, a beauty spot on the River Tees, may have been in breach of \u201cstay at home\u201d guidance and would have led officers to tell him to turn around had he been stopped. A police examination of the facts surrounding Cummings\u2019 time in the north-east, 260 miles from his London home, has concluded that no further action will be taken. The force said it would not issue fines retrospectively. Cummings has denied any wrongdoing following a joint investigation by the Guardian and the Daily Mirror, and has received Johnson\u2019s full backing since the details were published last weekend. Deep discontent among Tory MPs has grown over the course of the week, however, in response to public anger. Ninety-nine have either called for Cummings to be sacked, demanded an apology or otherwise criticised his conduct.

There have been questions over the absence of the UK\u2019s two most senior experts from the daily press conference since news broke of Cummings\u2019 trip from London to Durham while his wife was showing possible coronavirus symptoms. Whitty and Vallance were due to appear at Monday\u2019s press conference but were replaced at the last minute by Prof Pauline Doyle, an expert from Public Health England. The deputy chief medical officer, Jenny Harries, previously answered questions about Cummings actions. \u201cIf you\u2019re symptomatic, you stay at home, take yourself out of society as quickly as you can and stay there, unless there\u2019s extreme risk to life,\u201d she said.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Friday 29 May. Top stories Hong Kong\u2019s future autonomy has been dealt a \u201ckiller blow\u201d after China\u2019s governing legislature approved controversial national security laws aimed at stamping out protests that have racked the territory for the past year. Delegates in Beijing broke into applause after the legislation was passed, prompting a pro-democracy legislator in Hong Kong, Claudia Mo, to proclaim that: \u201cHong Kong as we knew it is finally dead.\u201d The UK\u2019s foreign secretary has said that it will extend visa rights for up to 300,000 British nations from Hong Kong \u2013 allowing them a pathway to UK citizenship \u2013 should China persist in imposing repressive laws over the territory. Australia\u2019s historic decline in jobs and incomes due to the coronavirus has steadied, new research from the Australian National University has determined. Average hours worked increased in May, with the percentage of Australians in work levelling out, after about 600,000 lost their jobs in April. More than half of those surveyed remain anxious about Covid-19, however, with nearly a third believing it very likely they will be infected in the next six months. In part four of our special investigation, Stimulus under scrutiny, we look at the supports provided for small and medium businesses, and the potential minefields awaiting once supports are turned off. Four shortlisted purchasers, due to lodge bids for Virgin Australia on Friday, have expressed anxiety over a lack of governmental support, Guardian Australia has learned. The airline faces a four to six-week period without cash, between any mooted sale next month and a key creditors\u2019 meeting due to be held in August. Further uncertainties over the sale process have fuelled fears it could collapse, which would send the airline into liquidation \u2013 leaving 10,000 people without jobs and handing Qantas a near monopoly over Australian air travel. Australia Australian Jock Palfreeman is a step closer to freedom after Bulgaria\u2019s highest court dismissed an appeal against his release from jail. The Sydney man was released in October after serving nearly 12 years behind bars, but has been prevented from leaving the country by the Bulgarian government. He was found guilty of murder and attempted murder for stabbing two Bulgarian youths in 2007 and has always maintained he acted in self-defence. Irrigators have illegally harvested unregulated and unmeasured water from floodplains for decades, water officials have admitted, a sum accounting for up to a third of all water used by operators in the northern part of the Murray-Darling Basin. The 2018 South Australian royal commission described floodplain harvesting as \u201cone of the most significant threats to water security \u2026 to both licence holders and downstream states\u201d. The federal government has asked China to grant Australia the same reduction in bureaucratic trade barriers that Beijing has promised the United States, amid fears smaller trading nations might suffer \u201ccollateral damage\u201d from a deal between the world\u2019s two largest economies. Lower power prices and more than 100,000 new jobs could be Australia\u2019s rewards for a rapid shift to renewable energy, a new briefing paper suggests, with former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull describing Beyond Zero Emissions\u2019 analysis as \u201ccompellingly right\u201d. Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions dropped only marginally last year \u2013 down 0.9% \u2013 although this was largely driven by a shift towards investment in renewable energy. The world The US department of justice has made its investigation of police involvement in the death of George Floyd a \u201ctop priority\u201d after a second evening of street clashes in Minneapolis. The FBI will investigate whether the officers involved also violated federal laws. The US president, Donald Trump, has signed an executive order that could erode legal protections for social media companies, in an escalation of his ongoing spat after Twitter affixed fact-checking warnings to several of his tweets. A French political power couple have been handed prison sentences for money laundering. Patrick Balkany and his wife, Isabelle, the former mayor and deputy mayor of a Parisian suburb, were convicted of hiding at least \u20ac13m from tax authorities.

So maybe it will sound particularly fitting when the season resumes in a country still tormented by Covid-19. Safety permitting, Neves believes the return of football will help to provide a dose of light relief. \u201cIt\u2019s always good to have back the sensations of football, the emotions, the goals, everything. It\u2019s really important for football to come back.\u201d</p> <p>On Thursday Neves and his teammates took a major step towards that return. \u201cWe are really excited \u2013 even more so after that training session because we could finally play proper football. So far we had only trained individually or in small groups without contact.\u201d</p> <p>The manager, Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo, had to be vigilant to ensure a combination of rustiness and enthusiasm did not lead to clumsy tackles. \u201cThe gaffer made sure everything would go right in the first training session,\u201d Neves said.</p> <p>\u201cPeople were excited but he made sure they just focused on playing football. We still have time to compete and get back that [competitive] feeling.

      "bodyText": "News of the Premier League\u2019s return is music to the ears of R\u00faben Neves, even if it means the guitar lessons he started during lockdown may have to fade into the background. The midfielder had just completed Wolves\u2019 first contact training session in more than two months on Thursday when news broke that his team could return to match action on the weekend starting 19 June. Neves can already envisage repeating his pre-match routine. \u201cColdplay are my favourite band and that\u2019s the kind of music I always listen to before a game,\u201d the 23-year-old said. \u201cNormally the last song I listen to before I take off my headphones is Fix You. I like the words and it helps me to get concentrated for the match.\u201d That seems a rather plaintive tune to use as stimulus for a Premier League showdown, but the lyrics are about resisting despair, carrying on despite heartache. So maybe it will sound particularly fitting when the season resumes in a country still tormented by Covid-19. Safety permitting, Neves believes the return of football will help to provide a dose of light relief. \u201cIt\u2019s always good to have back the sensations of football, the emotions, the goals, everything. It\u2019s really important for football to come back.\u201d On Thursday Neves and his teammates took a major step towards that return. \u201cWe are really excited \u2013 even more so after that training session because we could finally play proper football. So far we had only trained individually or in small groups without contact.\u201d The manager, Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo, had to be vigilant to ensure a combination of rustiness and enthusiasm did not lead to clumsy tackles. \u201cThe gaffer made sure everything would go right in the first training session,\u201d Neves said. \u201cPeople were excited but he made sure they just focused on playing football. We still have time to compete and get back that [competitive] feeling. For now the most important thing is to get back the sensations of the team, the lines of play and the tactics.\u201d Wolves have a lot to play for when the season resumes. They were sixth in the table when play was suspended and were also looking good in the Europa League, having scored an away goal while drawing the first leg of their last-16 tie at Olympiakos. Owing to coronavirus that match was played behind closed doors, offering Wolves an experience of what the atmosphere will be like when the Premier League returns in empty stadiums. \u201cIt is really strange, you don\u2019t have the adrenaline of the fans,\u201d Neves said. \u201cWe are used to playing in loud places, but unfortunately the situation is bad and we don\u2019t know when things will get back to normal so we just have to get used to it. \u201cThe warmup is the most important part for getting used to the [empty] stadium because it is quiet and you need to put your head in the game. We used the warmup to motivate us so that when the game started we didn\u2019t think about [the silence].\u201d Other thoughts Neves says he and his fellow players are good at banishing are the ones about a thrilling Wolves team being picked apart whenever transfer activity is reignited. The one downside of their success as far as their fans are concerned is that many of their players have attracted the attention of more established powers. Neves is said to be coveted by Manchester City and many others. \u201cThere has always been speculation since I\u2019ve got here about our team,\u201d says the player whose arrival at Molineux in 2017 was a big factor in the club\u2019s triumphant drive for promotion from the Championship. \u201cBut we don\u2019t think about it.

But you don\u2019t have a right to then go into that store if that storeowner doesn\u2019t want you to.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>The US has now recorded more than 100,000 deaths from Covid-19, according to Johns Hopkins University, as many states continued to relax mitigation measures. </strong>The US has recorded more deaths from the disease than any other country in the pandemic, and almost three times as many as the second-ranking country, the UK.</li> \n   <li><strong>There have been more than 159,000 excess deaths in Europe since since early March, during the height of the coronavirus epidemic, the head of the World Health Organization\u2019s regional office for the continent said. </strong>Hans Kluge said 2 million people had been confirmed to have caught the coronavirus since it was first detected on the continent four months ago. About 175,000 had died.</li> \n   <li><strong>The number of Covid-19 cases linked to a live export ship which docked in Western Australia doubled from six to 12. </strong>Of these seven new cases recorded in the state on Thursday, six are crew members from the Al-Kuwait ship which docked in Fremantle this week. The only other case was a returned overseas traveller who is already in hotel quarantine.</li> \n   <li><strong>The president of Namibia and several of the country\u2019s top officials have been fined after breaching coronavirus regulations last month by hosting a celebration to mark his party\u2019s 60th anniversary. </strong>The South West <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa\">Africa</a> People\u2019s Organisation (Swapo) birthday party took place in parliament on 19 April, when Namibia was under lockdown and group gatherings were banned to limit the spread of coronavirus. As well as the president, Hage Geingob, himself, the guests included vice-president Nangolo Mbumba, prime minister Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila and SWAPO secretary-general Sophia Shaningwa. All have since been fined N$2,000 (\u00a392.34).</li> \n   <li><strong>In sport, Premier League football is poised to return after a three-month coronavirus shutdown, with top-flight games in England provisionally set to resume in June. </strong>Aston Villa will host Sheffield United and Manchester City face Arsenal on 17 June. Serie A, Italy\u2019s top division, will return on 20 June after a three-month suspension, the sports minister, Vincenzo Spadafora, said on Thursday. Australia\u2019s professional rugby league competition, the NRL, resumed on Thursday night with Parramatta defeating Brisbane.</li> \n   <li><strong>Cancer patients with Covid-19 treated with a drug combination promoted by US President Donald Trump to counter coronavirus were three times more likely to die within 30 days than those who got either drug alone, U.S. researchers said. </strong>The preliminary results suggest doctors may want to refrain from prescribing the decades-old malaria treatment hydroxychloroquine with the antibiotic azithromycin for these patients until more study is done, researchers said. \u201cTreatment with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were strongly associated with increased risk of death,\u201d Dr. Howard Burris, president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology(ASCO), said in a briefing with reporters on the results.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>\u2022 This entry was amended on 29 May 2020.

The US accounts for about 30% of cases, way ahead of Brazil (7.2%), Russia (6.6%), the UK (4.7%), Spain (4.1%) and Italy (4%).</li> \n   <li><strong>Up to six people will be able to meet outside in England from Monday</strong>, providing members of different households continue to stay two metres apart, the prime minister has said.

The rating means Paris is not as free as the majority French regions designated \u201cgreen\u201d. </li> \n   <li><strong>Health officials in Moscow updated their figures on coronavirus deaths to add those who \u201cdied with\u201d the virus</strong>. On top of 636 deaths in April directly caused by Covid-19 reported earlier, the health department added the deaths of 756 people who tested positive for the virus but died of other causes.</li> \n   <li><strong>The number of Americans who have lost their jobs in the past 10 weeks soared to more than 40 million</strong>, with 2.1 million people filing for unemployment last week. The growth in the number of claims has slowed, but millions more have continued to file for unemployment each week, bringing the total number to a rate not seen since the Great Depression. </li> \n   <li><strong>New York governor Andrew Cuomo said he would sign an executive order allowing businesses to deny entry to customers not wearing masks.</strong> He said: \u201cThat store owner has a right to protect himself \u2026 You don\u2019t want to wear a mask, fine. But you don\u2019t have a right to then go into that store if that storeowner doesn\u2019t want you to.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>The US has now recorded more than 100,000 deaths from Covid-19,</strong> according to Johns Hopkins University, as many states continued to relax mitigation measures. The US has recorded more deaths from the disease than any other country in the pandemic, and almost three times as many as the second-ranking country, the UK.</li> \n   <li><strong>There have been more than 159,000 excess deaths in Europe since since early March</strong>, during the height of the coronavirus epidemic, the head of the World Health Organization\u2019s regional office for the continent said. Hans Kluge said 2 million people had been confirmed to have caught the coronavirus since it was first detected on the continent four months ago. About 175,000 had died.</li> \n   <li><strong>The number of Covid-19 cases linked to a live export ship which docked in Western Australia doubled from six to 12</strong>.

Compared to two weeks ago, reported cases have tripled in five countries and doubled in 10 countries.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Overall levels of Covid-19 in Africa compare favourably with other parts of the world, but there are still fears that the true extent of the pandemic on the continent is unknown due to a lack of testing. There are now 125,000 cases and 3,700 deaths.</p> \n  <p>Some observers have raised the possibility that the slow spread of the disease in Africa is due to the relative youth of populations. Moeti said data suggested that, as elsewhere, age and pre-existing conditions appeared important in determining the severity of each case, but countries everywhere on the continent faced significant difficulties accessing test materials and personal protective equipment for health workers.<br></p> \n  <p>A traditional remedy endorsed and distributed by the government of Madagascar will be tested thoroughly, she said. The WHO has previously <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2243669-no-evidence-madagascar-cure-for-covid-19-works-says-who/\">said there is no scientific evidence</a> that the herbal treatment is in any way effective.</p> \n  <p>Governments in Africa moved quickly to impose lockdowns and restrictions which helped slow the spread of the virus, but caused very significant problems to hundreds of millions of people living in poverty.<br></p> \n  <p>These are now being progressively removed, with South Africa, which imposed one of the strictest lockdowns, moving to level three on a scale of five this Monday. There has been controversy in the country - sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s most-developed - over a decision to allow religious services to go ahead if worshippers are restricted to less than 50 and strict social distancing precautions are observed. A ban on alcohol sale and transport will also be lifted.</p> \n  <p>Zweli Mkhize, South Africa\u2019s health minister, told reporters that no lockdown could last for ever and that it was time to provide some social and economic relief. It was hoped that religious leaders could educate congregations about the virus and how to keep safe, Mkhize said, adding that it had become clear that the country would be dealing with the pandemic for one to two years so \u201cthere has to be a degree of easing\u201d.</p> \n  <p>The emerging hotspot for the disease in South Africa - and in Africa overall - has been the Western Cape province, which includes Cape Town, the international tourist destination.<br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ecfe9978f084e882655a8d0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T16:42:18.110Z\">5.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>GSK, the British pharmaceutical company, said on Thursday that its previous flu pandemic <strong>vaccine</strong> was not linked to a rise in cases of the sleep disorder narcolepsy.</p> \n  <p>The claim comes as the company said it planned to produce large volumes of an ingredient used in that vaccine for possible use in Covid-19 vaccines currently being developed.</p> \n  <p>According to <strong>Reuters</strong>, a spokesman for GSK said the \u201cscience has moved on\u201d since concerns were raised about links between narcolepsy and its H1N1 vaccine, called Pandemrix, which was developed during the flu pandemic 10 years ago. He said evidence now suggests the link is to the H1N1 flu virus itself, not the vaccine.</p> \n  <p>Previous studies in several countries, including Britain, Finland, Sweden and Ireland, had suggested Pandemrix was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/feb/09/ministers-lose-fight-to-stop-payouts-in-swine-flu-jab-narcolepsy-cases\">linked to a significant rise in cases of narcolepsy in children</a>.</p> \n  <p>Pandemrix\u2019s ingredients included a booster, or adjuvant, known as AS03, that could potentially be an ingredient in at least seven experimental COVID-19 vaccines, including one being developed by Sanofi, with whom GSK signed a collaboration deal in April.</p> \n  <p>Wendy Barclay, a professor and chair in flu virology at Imperial College London, said that since the link between narcolepsy and the 2009/10 flu pandemic is thought to have been due to cross-reactivity between parts of the H1N1 virus and human proteins that control sleep patterns, the Pandemrix vaccine\u2019s adjuvant may have played a role.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIf the virus/host cross-reactivity is the mechanism or explanation, then using an adjuvant in the vaccine to boost the immune response may have increased the chances that this cross-reactivity was generated,\u201d she told Reuters. \u201cWe still don\u2019t really know if this was the case or not.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ecfd9108f087e3ca0f652e6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T16:27:14.177Z\">5.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Israel</strong> has launched a campaign to test 100,000 people for coronavirus antibodies, in preparation for a potential \u201csecond wave\u201d of cases, a top official said on Thursday, according to <strong>AFP</strong>.</p> \n  <p>The initiative is one of the world\u2019s largest such schemes and aims to test Israel\u2019s \u201ccollective immunity\u201d against the COVID-19 disease by determining how widely the virus has spread and who is most at risk going forward.</p> \n  <p>In parallel to the national campaign, authorities are also running separate surveys of \u201chigh-risk areas\u201d.

early April, when 6.6 million Americans filed for unemployment in a single week.</p> \n  <p>Earlier this month, the department <a

rate to 14.7%, up from 4.4% in March.</p> \n  <p>While the growth of unemployment claims has slowed, millions more have continued to file for unemployment each week, bringing the total number of

      "bodyText": "We are going to close this liveblog now. Thank you for your company and correspondence. If you\u2019d like to continue to follow our live coverage, we have a new blog running here (I\u2019ll be there should you need me): I leave you with a summary of today\u2019s developments in the global fight against the coronavirus pandemic: The number of people infected by Covid-19 has exceeded 5.7 million, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The US accounts for about 30% of cases, way ahead of Brazil (7.2%), Russia (6.6%), the UK (4.7%), Spain (4.1%) and Italy (4%). Up to six people will be able to meet outside in England from Monday, providing members of different households continue to stay two metres apart, the prime minister has said. This will be allowed in gardens and other private outdoor spaces, Boris Johnson added. Paris is no longer a \u201cred\u201d coronavirus danger zone, the risks posed by the virus moving down a notch to \u201corange\u201d, according to France\u2019s prime minister, Edouard Philippe. The rating means Paris is not as free as the majority French regions designated \u201cgreen\u201d. Health officials in Moscow updated their figures on coronavirus deaths to add those who \u201cdied with\u201d the virus. On top of 636 deaths in April directly caused by Covid-19 reported earlier, the health department added the deaths of 756 people who tested positive for the virus but died of other causes. The number of Americans who have lost their jobs in the past 10 weeks soared to more than 40 million, with 2.1 million people filing for unemployment last week. The growth in the number of claims has slowed, but millions more have continued to file for unemployment each week, bringing the total number to a rate not seen since the Great Depression. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said he would sign an executive order allowing businesses to deny entry to customers not wearing masks. He said: \u201cThat store owner has a right to protect himself \u2026 You don\u2019t want to wear a mask, fine. But you don\u2019t have a right to then go into that store if that storeowner doesn\u2019t want you to.\u201d The US has now recorded more than 100,000 deaths from Covid-19, according to Johns Hopkins University, as many states continued to relax mitigation measures. The US has recorded more deaths from the disease than any other country in the pandemic, and almost three times as many as the second-ranking country, the UK. There have been more than 159,000 excess deaths in Europe since since early March, during the height of the coronavirus epidemic, the head of the World Health Organization\u2019s regional office for the continent said. Hans Kluge said 2 million people had been confirmed to have caught the coronavirus since it was first detected on the continent four months ago. About 175,000 had died. The number of Covid-19 cases linked to a live export ship which docked in Western Australia doubled from six to 12. Of these seven new cases recorded in the state on Thursday, six are crew members from the Al-Kuwait ship which docked in Fremantle this week. The only other case was a returned overseas traveller who is already in hotel quarantine. The president of Namibia and several of the country\u2019s top officials have been fined after breaching coronavirus regulations last month by hosting a celebration to mark his party\u2019s 60th anniversary. The South West Africa People\u2019s Organisation (Swapo) birthday party took place in parliament on 19 April, when Namibia was under lockdown and group gatherings were banned to limit the spread of coronavirus. As well as the president, Hage Geingob, himself, the guests included vice-president Nangolo Mbumba, prime minister Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila and SWAPO secretary-general Sophia Shaningwa. All have since been fined N$2,000 (\u00a392.34). In sport, Premier League football is poised to return after a three-month coronavirus shutdown, with top-flight games in England provisionally set to resume in June. Aston Villa will host Sheffield United and Manchester City face Arsenal on 17 June. Serie A, Italy\u2019s top division, will return on 20 June after a three-month suspension, the sports minister, Vincenzo Spadafora, said on Thursday. Australia\u2019s professional rugby league competition, the NRL, resumed on Thursday night with Parramatta defeating Brisbane. Cancer patients with Covid-19 treated with a drug combination promoted by US President Donald Trump to counter coronavirus were three times more likely to die within 30 days than those who got either drug alone, U.S. researchers said. The preliminary results suggest doctors may want to refrain from prescribing the decades-old malaria treatment hydroxychloroquine with the antibiotic azithromycin for these patients until more study is done, researchers said. \u201cTreatment with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were strongly associated with increased risk of death,\u201d Dr. Howard Burris, president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology(ASCO), said in a briefing with reporters on the results. \u2022 This entry was amended on 29 May 2020. An earlier version said that up to six people will be able to meet outside in the UK from Monday, however, that applies only to England. More on hydroxychloroquine, and the US President\u2019s regimen. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany was asked how Donald Trump was feeling and would he take the drug again. Here is the exchange: Reporter: The President has completed his two weeks of hydroxychloroquine. Have you spoken to him what his feeling about? Is he feeling better? What\u2019s his feedback about that? McEnany: I went to him just before coming out here and I asked him that. And he said, quote, he\u2019s \u201cfeeling perfect.\u201d Quote, he\u2019s \u201cfeeling absolutely great\u201d after taking this regimen. And, quote, he \u201cwould take it again\u201d if he thought that he was exposed. So he is feeling very good. Good morning/afternoon/evening wherever this finds you.

The health ministry of Cyprus has advised doctors to curtail the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine on some COVID-19 patients amid renewed concerns that the drugs could trigger heart problems and put lives at risk. This is after Cypriot health authorities bought enough of the drugs to treat a quarter of its population if they became infected in the early days of the pandemic. The ministry urged doctors on Thursday to be particularly vigilant and to even stop administering the two substances to COVID-19 patients with pre-existing heart conditions. The ministry said an advisory body of medical experts is re-evaluating the use of the drugs and may revise its directives. The announcement came after the World Health Organization said it would temporarily drop hydroxychloroquine from its global study into experimental COVID-19 treatments. A paper published last week in the Lancet showed people taking hydroxychloroquine were at higher risk of death and heart problems than those that were not. Cyprus health minister said last month that the country was among the first nations to approve use of the anti-malaria drug to treat COVID-19 patients. Cypriot authorities procured enough chloroquine to treat as many as 240,000 people roughly a quarter of the island nations population if they became infected. It was part of a five-ton consignment of the drug that Cyprus and Israel jointly purchased from India. The global death toll has increased to 358,369, according to data compiled by the Johns Hopkins University, which has tracked the spread of the virus during the pandemic. The number of cases currently stands at 5,768,908 which is about 230,000 lower than the figure Johns Hopkins was reporting a few hours ago. One in 10 diabetics with coronavirus dies within seven days of hospital admission, according to a study of more than 1,300 patients. Two-thirds of the patients were men, and the average age across both sexes was 70, the study published in the journal Diabetologia found. \u201cThe presence of diabetic complications and increased age increase the risk of death,\u201d the researchers said. \u201cIncreased BMI\u201d - body mass index, a ratio of height to weight - \u201cis associated with both increased risk of needing mechanical ventilation and with increased risk of death,\u201d they said. Worse blood sugar control in and of itself, however, did not seem to impact a patient\u2019s outcome. So-called microvascular complications - affecting the eyes, kidney and nerves - were found in nearly half of the patients, who were admitted to 53 French hospitals from March 10 to March 31. Problems related to larger arteries in the heart, brain and legs were reported in more than 40 percent of the patients. The presence of either type of complication doubled the risk of death by the seventh day of hospitalisation. Patients over 75 years old were 14 times more likely to die than those 55 or younger. By the seventh day of hospitalisation, a fifth of patients had been intubated on ventilators, and a tenth had died. Nearly a quarter of patients had been discharged home by this point. The study confirmed that insulin and other treatments modifying blood sugar were not a risk factor for severe forms of COVID-19, and should be continued for persons with diabetes. Other significant risk factors included heart disease, high blood pressure, and a history of lung disease. Stefany Carvallido, her two-year-old daughter and about 200 other Colombians have been camping out inside Brazil\u2019s busiest international airport for days in a desperate attempt to get back to their home country. More than two months after the coronavirus pandemic triggered worldwide lockdowns, much of the world is gradually reopening. But Latin America remains highly isolated by travel restrictions across the region. Colombia has suspended all international flights until at least Aug. 31, preventing its own citizens from returning by air. It has also suspended river and land border crossings with neighbors including Brazil. Carvallido said she and her daughter Maria Jose had spent nearly two weeks at Guarulhos International Airport, located on the outskirts of Sao Paulo, the city with the lion\u2019s share of Brazil\u2019s coronavirus cases so far. The same airport saw a surge in traffic last week, when travelers descended on it hoping to beat a new U.S. ban on foreigners coming from Brazil. \u201cIn this situation, we want to be with our families and my daughter wants it too ... It is very, very difficult,\u201d said Carvallido. Carvallido, 24, and others are eating from lunch boxes and donations and also take turns at an improvised kitchen set up outside the airport. They wash in the airport bathrooms using a small hose. They are demanding humanitarian flights. But Colombia\u2019s foreign ministry said on Thursday no new flights from Brazil were scheduled until next week. Since late April there have been three such flights, taking a total of 346 people back to Colombia. Though called humanitarian, Colombians must pay $350 for the flights, and that is money Carvallido and many others at the airport do not have. Their calls for a free flight home have led nowhere so far. \u201cUnder current regulations, this request is not possible,\u201d the Colombian consulate in Sao Paulo said. A Public Health England (PHE) proposal to enact a stronger lockdown of care homes to prevent spiralling coronavirus deaths was rejected by the UK government. Care homes have increasingly become the epicentres for deaths linked to Covid-19 across the UK, with the toll standing at more than 10,000 in England. Downing Street received an 11-point plan proposing \u201ca further lockdown of care homes\u201d from PHE on April 28, The Guardian reported. A man from Georgia was charged in a fedreral court with trying to swindle a foreign government out of $317 million (\u00a3257 million) by promising to sell it face masks to protect against the coronavirus with a huge shipment that never existed. Paul Penn faces up to 20 years in federal prison if convicted of criminal attempt and conspiracy, according to documents filed by prosecutors in U.S. District Court in Savannah. Prosecutors said Penn and at least two partners negotiated a deal between March and April to sell 50 million N95 respirator masks to a foreign government. Prosecutors did not identity the government involved. The sellers never had the masks, prosecutors said in a court filing, yet they persuaded the foreign government to wire $317 million to a bank account. Prosecutors said the sales price was five times the market value for the masks. The U.S. Secret Service stopped the transaction before it could be completed, according to a news release from the office of U.S. Attorney Bobby Christine of the Southern District of Georgia. Using a worldwide pandemic as an opportunity to take advantage of those searching for badly needed personal protective equipment is reprehensible,\u201d Christine said in a statement. He pledged that federal authorities \u201cwill aggressively seek out any fraudsters who exploit this crisis as a way to make a quick buck. Court records did not list an attorney for Penn. Prosecutors did not identify the two people they said were Penn\u2019s partners in the scheme. Prosecutors said Penn helped negotiate the sale through his company, Spectrum Global Holdings LLC. Georgia incorporation records show Penn formed the company in 2018 in the Atlanta suburb of Norcross. Cancer patients with Covid-19 treated with a drug combination promoted by US President Donald Trump to counter coronavirus were three times more likely to die within 30 days than those who got either drug alone, U.S. researchers said. The preliminary results suggest doctors may want to refrain from prescribing the decades-old malaria treatment hydroxychloroquine with the antibiotic azithromycin for these patients until more study is done, researchers said. \u201cTreatment with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were strongly associated with increased risk of death,\u201d Dr. Howard Burris, president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology(ASCO), said in a briefing with reporters on the results. The drug combination initially was thought to help Covid-19 patients, but recent data has cast doubt. The preliminary findings, to be presented this week at ASCO\u2019s virtual scientific meeting, show that the combination may pose a significant risk to cancer patients. \u201cTaking the combination gives a three times increased risk of dying within 30 days of any cause,\u201d Dr. Jeremy Warner of Vanderbilt University Medical System told reporters. Trump, who has often promoted hydroxychloroquine, in a March 21 tweet called the combination potentially \u201cone of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine.\u201d That was based on a study of fewer than 40 patients in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents. More recent studies have shown little or no benefit and increased risks. Warner and colleagues analysed data on 925 patients with cancer who became infected with the coronavirus between March and April. Thirteen percent of the patients died within 30 days of their diagnosis. Overall, patients whose cancers were actively progressing at the time of infection were five times more likely to die within 30 days than those who were in remission or had no current evidence of cancer. In the trial, 180 patients were taking hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin, and 90 were taking hydroxychloroquine alone. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has allowed healthcare providers to prescribe the drugs for Covid-19 through an emergency-use authorisation, but has not approved the treatment. The governments of France, Italy and Belgium moved on Wednesday to halt the use of hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19 patients following a World Health Organization decision on Monday to pause a large trial of the drug due to safety concerns. Top officials from several UN agencies appealed for urgent international financial support in Yemen with coronavirus spreading in the country. \u201cWe are increasingly alarmed about the situation in Yemen,\u201d officials from the UN Humanitarian Affairs Department, UNICEF, the World Food Programme and the World Health Organization said in a joint statement. \u201cWe are running out of time,\u201d they said. The United Nations says COVID-19 has likely already spread throughout most of Yemen, which was already immersed in the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis because of a war that shows no sign of abating. The UN officials said they currently have enough \u201cskills, staff and capacity.\u201d \u201cWhat we don\u2019t have is the money. We ask donors to pledge generously and pay pledges promptly,\u201d they said, noting that a donors conference has been organized for June 2 by Saudi Arabia and the United Nations. Mark Lowcock, the under secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, said $2.4 billion needed to be raised by the end of the year for Yemen, including $180 million to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. \u201cYemen is in desperate need of assistance,\u201d Muhannad Hadi of the World Food Programme said, while UNICEF\u2019s director, Henriette Fore, warned of a \u201cmajor disaster.\u201d More than 12 million children in Yemen are in need of humanitarian aid, she said. The inaugural flight of the Ariane 6 rocket will be set back until next year because the coronavirus pandemic has led to project delays at development sites, the European Space Agency said. \u201cWe can say for certain that the launch will not happen in 2020,\u201d Daniel Neuenschwander, ESA\u2019s director of space transportation, told AFP. The ESA, which groups 13 European countries, has not indicated when in 2021 a launch from the Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, may now be possible. The number of cases currently stands at around 5.7 million, according to data compiled by the Johns Hopkins University. The US accounts for 1,712,816, the highest of any country, followed by Brazil with 411,821 and Russia with 379,051. A lawyer for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) has admitted in court that the agency is not testing prisoners for Covid-19 before transferring them to other jails unless they are showing symptoms of the illness. Assistant US Attorney Dexter Lee in a video court hearing: \u201cIf the individual is actively ill, if the individual has tested positive or showing symptoms, they are not cleared for travel and they will not be transferred until those issues are resolved. \u201cThe problem is that there are individuals who are asymptomatic and they may be positive for coronavirus,\u201d the Miami Herald reported him as saying. The ongoing case is over a Florida judge\u2019s order that Ice reduce its local prison population to limit the spread of the coronavirus. Immigration advocates argue that Ice found a \u201cloophole\u201d by transferring them to jails in other states. Dubai\u2019s media office has announced the emirate will reopen four beaches, major parks and the Dubai Frame landmark to the general public on Friday. The beaches are JBR, Al Mamzar, Jumeirah and Umm Suqeim. Comedian Chris Rock and actress Rosie Perez made a surprise appearance at New York governor Andrew Cuomo\u2019s daily news conference to underscore his message that the public should wear masks to help curb the coronavirus pandemic. The celebrities said they would take part in public service campaigns urging New Yorkers to take the pandemic seriously, wear masks and take other steps to prevent the spread of the virus. Rock said he was seeing about 40 percent of people in Brooklyn wearing masks. \u201cIt\u2019s the kids who really aren\u2019t wearing a mask, and you know, it\u2019s sad,\u201d he said. \u201cIt*s sad that our health has become, you know, a sort of political issue ... It\u2019s a status symbol, almost, to not wear a mask.\u201d Perez briefly spoke in Spanish. \u201cTo mi gente, wear a mask, please,\u201d she said. \u201cThe numbers in our communities are staggering. This is not a joke. This is not a hoax. This is real.\u201d Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: The number of people infected by Covid-19 has exceeded 5.7 million, according to data compiled by the Johns Hopkins University. The US accounts for about 30% of cases, way ahead of Brazil (7.2%), Russia (6.6%), the UK (4.7%), Spain (4.1%) and Italy (4%). Thousands of people in the UK take part in the tenth week of Clap For Carers in what could be the last time the weekly event takes place. Up to six people will be able to meet outside in England from Monday, providing members of different households continue to stay two metres apart, the prime minister said. Boris Johnson also confirmed primary schools and nurseries can reopen from Monday and from 15 June, some secondary school pupils will be able to return to provide \u201csome face to face contact time\u201d for years 10 and 12. Paris is no longer deemed to be a \u201cred\u201d coronavirus danger zone, the risks posed by the virus moving down a notch to \u201corange\u201d, France\u2019s prime minister, Edouard Philippe, said. The rating means Paris is not as free as the majority French regions designated \u201cgreen\u201d. Health officials in Moscow updated their figures on coronavirus deaths to add those who \u201cdied with\u201d the virus. On top of 636 deaths in April directly caused by Covid-19 reported earlier, the health department added the deaths of 756 people who tested positive for the virus but died of other causes. A travel ban between Turkey\u2019s worst affected cities is being lifted while restaurants, cafes and sports facilities will reopen on June 1, the country\u2019s president said. Recep Tayyip Erdogan also said public sector workers, except for those with chronic illnesses, will return to their workplaces on June 1, while child care facilities will be allowed to resume their services. The number of Americans who have lost their jobs in the past 10 weeks soared to more than 40 million, with 2.1 million people filing for unemployment last week. While the growth of claims has slowed, millions more have continued to file for unemployment each week, bringing the total number to a rate not seen since the Great Depression. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said he would sign an executive order allowing businesses to deny entry to customers not wearing masks. He said: \u201cThat store owner has a right to protect himself \u2026 You don\u2019t want to wear a mask, fine. But you don\u2019t have a right to then go into that store if that storeowner doesn\u2019t want you to.\u201d The US has now recorded more than 100,000 deaths from Covid-19, according to Johns Hopkins University, as many states continued to relax mitigation measures. The US has recorded more deaths from the disease than any other country in the pandemic, and almost three times as many as the second-ranking country, the UK. There have been more than 159,000 excess deaths in Europe since since early March, during the height of the coronavirus epidemic, the head of the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) regional office for the continent said. Hans Kluge said 2 million people had been confirmed to have caught the coronavirus since it was first detected on the continent four months ago. About 175,000 had died of Covid-19. The number of Covid-19 cases linked to a live export ship which docked in Western Australia doubled from six to 12. Of these seven new cases recorded in the state on Thursday, six are crew members from the Al-Kuwait ship which docked in Fremantle this week. The only other case was a returned overseas traveller who is already in hotel quarantine. \u2022 This entry was amended on 29 May 2020. An earlier version said that up to six people will be able to meet outside in the UK from Monday, however, that applies only to England. A travel ban between Turkey\u2019s worst affected cities is being lifted while restaurants, cafes and sports facilities will reopen on June 1, the country\u2019s president said. In a televised address following a weekly Cabinet meeting, Recep Tayyip Erdogan also said public sector workers, except for those with chronic illnesses, will return to their workplaces on June 1, while child care facilities will be allowed to resume their services. Erdogan said parks, beaches and museums will also be opened up while people will be permitted to attend open-air concerts. Bars and hookah bars, will remain shut. The president also said that a stay-at-home order for people aged 65 and over, and for minors will remain for a while longer. Youths aged 19 and 20 will now be allowed outdoors, he said. The announcement comes amid a drop in the number of reported daily COVID-19 deaths and infections in the past weeks, although some experts say the lifting of restrictions may be premature. In his speech, Erdogan called on people to exercise caution, wear masks and stick to social distancing guidelines. Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry announced a new, two-day curfew over the weekend in 15 of the country\u2019s worst-affected provinces, including Ankara and Istanbul. Earlier, intercity train services resumed on a limited basis. Trains will make 16 trips daily, connecting the cities of Ankara, Istanbul, Konya and Eskisehir. The trains are operating at half-capacity, and passengers are being allowed on board only with a government-issued permission to travel and a code certifying they are not being monitored for a suspected COVID-19 infection. Turkish Transportation Minister Adil Karaismailoglu said travelers showing signs of illness would not be allowed onto trains. Any passenger exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms on a train will be taken to a special isolation section and handed over to health officials at the nearest station, he said. The government has also opened shopping malls and hairdressers. Mosques will allow congregations for two daytime prayers starting Friday. Turkey\u2019s total number of confirmed infections has surpassed 160,000, with the Health Ministry announcing 1,182 new cases in the past 24 hours and 30 new deaths, raising the total COVID-19 fatalities to 4,461. White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany defended US states\u2019 decisions to reopen, saying \u201ceverything does not depend on a vaccine\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s therapeutics,\u201d she told a press briefing on Thursday. She also defended President Donald Trump\u2019s tweet commemorating the 100,000 US death toll, which went out the day after the number was passed. McEnany said flags being lowered to half-mast on federal buildings during the previous Memorial Day weekend was an acknowledgment of the death toll. She also accused Google of allowing China \u201cto spread misinformation about the coronavirus\u201d. Trump said he will sign an executive order targeting tech companies and will give a news conference on China on Friday. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in France rose to 149,071 on Thursday compared to 145,746 on Wednesday. There was an increase of 3,325 new confirmed cases due to a systems update, the French health ministry said. From Monday, almost 70% of Spain will be in at least the third and penultimate stage of the country\u2019s staggered lockdown exit, our Madrid correspondent, Sam Jones, writes. The Madrid region and the Barcelona metropolitan area, two of the hardest-hit zones, will remain in the second phase, which they belatedly entered in Monday. Under the rules for the third phase, people can eat inside restaurants and visit shopping centres, but both will operate are reduced capacities. Groups of up to 15 people are allowed to meet, providing their observe physical distancing. Some areas, such as the Balearic island of Formentera and three Canary islands will move into the final phase on Monday. The health minister, Salvador Illa, called on people to behave responsibly and not to squander the advances made during one of Europe\u2019s strictest lockdowns. \u201cThere is a risk of fresh outbreaks and so our best ally is caution,\u201d he said. The country\u2019s health emergency chief, Fernando Sim\u00f3n, also warned again this week that the country\u2019s hard-won progress \u2013 new cases in Spain have fallen to between 400 and 500 a day from more than 7,500 at the peak \u2013 must not be taken for granted. An outbreak caused by \u201ca small, innocent party could be the start of another epidemic,\u201d he said. Sim\u00f3n was speaking after six new cases were discovered in a small town in the south-eastern region of Murcia, apparently linked to an agricultural worker who went to work despite showing symptoms of the disease. Spain also had an earlier spike in Lleida, Catalonia, after 20 people gathered for a birthday party, ignoring phase-one lockdown rules which stipulated gatherings of no more than 10 people. Four had the virus and infected the other 16. Head over to our UK blog for coverage of the weekly Clap For Carers at 8pm The nationwide applause, which has become synonymous with Thursday nights, could come to an end. The founder Annemarie Plas said she had been overwhelmed by the support for the ritual, but that it was better to stop while it was at its peak. Kuwait will ease its full-time curfew to a 12-hour night time one, the interior minister, Khaled Al Jarrah Al Sabah, said. The curfew will be from 6pm to 6am starting on Sunday. Easing the curfew will be part of the first phase in a five-phase plan to return to normal life, each of which will last at least three weeks. Argentina plans to maintain its flight ban until 1 September 1 to slow the spread of the coronavirus, the worldwide airline industry group Iata, which has been lobbying to lift restrictions faster, said. Peter Cerda, IATA\u2019s iice president for the Americas, said they are in constant communication with the Argentine government whose position has not changed. The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has called for debt relief to be offered to all developing and middle-income countries as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. He also urged the International Monetary Fund to consider boosting global liquidity by issuing a new allocation of its Special Drawing Rights (SDR) currency. He said: \u201cAlleviating crushing debt cannot be limited to the least-developed countries. \u201cIt must be extended to all developing and middle-income countries that request forbearance as they lose access to financial markets. \u201cMany developing and middle-income countries are highly vulnerable and already in debt distress \u2014 or will soon become so, due to the global recession.\u201d Premier League football is poised to return after a three-month coronavirus shutdown, with top-flight games in England provisionally set to resume in June. Aston Villa will host Sheffield United and Manchester City face Arsenal on 17 June. Serie A, Italy\u2019s top division, will return on 20 June after a three-month suspension, the sports minister, Vincenzo Spadafora, said on Thursday. The president of Namibia and several of the country\u2019s top officials have been fined after breaching coronavirus regulations last month by hosting a celebration to mark his party\u2019s 60th anniversary, AFP reports. The South West Africa People\u2019s Organisation (Swapo) birthday party took place in parliament on 19 April, when Namibia was under lockdown and group gatherings were banned to limit the spread of coronavirus. As well as the president, Hage Geingob, himself, the guests included vice-president Nangolo Mbumba, prime minister Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila and SWAPO secretary-general Sophia Shaningwa. All have since been fined N$2,000 (\u00a392.34). \u201cWe had a very important occasion of the 60th anniversary of Swapo,\u201d Geingob confessed on Thursday, during a press conference on the country\u2019s Covid-19 response. \u201cAlthough we were as little as ten leaders... we were found not on the right side of the regulations and law. We had to admit guilt and we were punished, we paid.\u201d Geingob raised controversy in March for inviting several African presidents to his swearing-in ceremony, prompting them to breach their own travel bans. Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak on Thursday include: The number of people infected by Covid-19 has exceeded 5.7 million, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The US accounts for about 30% of cases, way ahead of Brazil (7.2%), Russia (6.6%), the UK (4.7%), Spain (4.1%) and Italy (4%). Up to six people will be able to meet outside in England from Monday, providing members of different households continue to stay two metres apart, the prime minister has said. This will be allowed in gardens and other private outdoor spaces, Boris Johnson added. Paris is no longer a \u201cred\u201d coronavirus danger zone, the risks posed by the virus moving down a notch to \u201corange\u201d, according to France\u2019s prime minister, Edouard Philippe. The rating means Paris is not as free as the majority French regions designated \u201cgreen\u201d. Health officials in Moscow updated their figures on coronavirus deaths to add those who \u201cdied with\u201d the virus. On top of 636 deaths in April directly caused by Covid-19 reported earlier, the health department added the deaths of 756 people who tested positive for the virus but died of other causes. The number of Americans who have lost their jobs in the past 10 weeks soared to more than 40 million, with 2.1 million people filing for unemployment last week. The growth in the number of claims has slowed, but millions more have continued to file for unemployment each week, bringing the total number to a rate not seen since the Great Depression. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said he would sign an executive order allowing businesses to deny entry to customers not wearing masks. He said: \u201cThat store owner has a right to protect himself \u2026 You don\u2019t want to wear a mask, fine. But you don\u2019t have a right to then go into that store if that storeowner doesn\u2019t want you to.\u201d The US has now recorded more than 100,000 deaths from Covid-19, according to Johns Hopkins University, as many states continued to relax mitigation measures. The US has recorded more deaths from the disease than any other country in the pandemic, and almost three times as many as the second-ranking country, the UK. There have been more than 159,000 excess deaths in Europe since since early March, during the height of the coronavirus epidemic, the head of the World Health Organization\u2019s regional office for the continent said. Hans Kluge said 2 million people had been confirmed to have caught the coronavirus since it was first detected on the continent four months ago. About 175,000 had died. The number of Covid-19 cases linked to a live export ship which docked in Western Australia doubled from six to 12. Of these seven new cases recorded in the state on Thursday, six are crew members from the Al-Kuwait ship which docked in Fremantle this week. The only other case was a returned overseas traveller who is already in hotel quarantine. That\u2019s it from me, Damien Gayle, for today. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow. \u2022 This entry was amended on 29 May 2020. An earlier version said that up to six people will be able to meet outside in the UK from Monday, however, that applies only to England. The European Commission has put down a marker for the world with its green recovery package, writes Damian Carrington, the Guardian\u2019s environment editor. It sets a high standard for other nations, using the rebuilding of economies ravaged by coronavirus to tackle the even greater threat of the climate emergency, in principle at least. With the world fast approaching the point when climate chaos becomes inevitable, how the trillions of recovery euros are spent is a use-it-or-lose-it moment, so what the EU does really matters. Climate change is a global crisis, meaning all nations must act and some must lead the way. Under Donald Trump, the US is slashing green protections while the biggest polluter, China, is sending mixed messages by backing coal power stations as part of its recovery. The UK, host of the next critical UN summit, has been all but silent. The EU\u2019s plan seeks to pour money into emissions-busting sectors: \u20ac91bn (\u00a381bn) a year for home energy efficiency and green heating, \u20ac25bn of renewable energy, and \u20ac20bn for clean cars over two years, plus 2m charging points in five years. Up to \u20ac60bn will go to zero-emissions trains and the production of 1m tonnes of clean hydrogen is planned. France announced further easing of lockdown restrictions on Thursday, with life slowly returning to normal for much of the country, writes Kim Willsher, the Guardian\u2019s Paris correspondent. However, certain restrictions will remain in the Paris area and the overseas territories Mayotte and Guyane for at least the next three weeks. In a 90-minute press conference, the prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, said the Covid-19 figures in the country were better than expected, but urged the French to continue respecting the rules and remain careful and vigilant. Most of the country was declared \u201cgreen\u201d where the virus is not widely circulating, but the Paris region is \u201corange\u201d. Among the main points announced by Philippe: An end to the maximum 100km for journeys as of 2 June. Cafes, bars and restaurants in most of the country designated green, will reopen on 2 June. No more than 10 people at a table and 1m distance between tables. Kitchen and restaurant staff must wear masks. Establishments in orange areas will only be able to reopen terraces. Secondary schools and lyc\u00e9es in green areas to reopen all classes, but retaining health measures including a maximum 15 pupils per class. In orange areas most classes will remain closed until September. France\u2019s external borders will remain closed until 15 June when it is hoped they can reopen to EU nationals in coordination with other EU27 states. The general opening of borders to non-EU nationals will be decided in coordination with EU27. France will impose a reciprocal quarantine on nationals arriving in France that impose quarantine on French citizens. Parks and gardens as well as lakes and beches to open across France from 2 June. Camping sites, holiday villages, gites and other auberges can open in green areas from 2 June and in orange areas from 22 June. In green areas, theatres, gyms, sports halls, swimming pools, leisure parks. No more than 5,000 people at events. In orange ares, the above an only open on 22 June. You can read an in-depth, blow-by-blow account of Philippe\u2019s briefing, on Kim\u2019s Twitter account. The first tweet is below. The governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, has said he would sign an executive order allowing businesses to deny entry to customers who are not wearing masks, the Guardian US coronavirus blog reports. \u201cThat store owner has a right to protect himself,\u201d Cuomo said of the order. \u201cThat store owner has a right to protect the other patrons in that store.\u201d The Democratic governor has repeatedly said mask usage can limit the spread of the coronavirus, noting that rates of infection among frontline healthcare workers are lower than that of the general population in the region. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to wear a mask, fine,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have a right to then go into that store if that storeowner doesn\u2019t want you to.\u201d If you are interested in more US-focused coronavirus news, head over to our US blog. The leaders of the World Health Organisation\u2019s Africa region have described their continued concern at the accelerating spread of Covid-19 on the continent, writes Jason Burke, the Guardian\u2019s Africa correspondent. Speaking at WHO Africa\u2019s weekly briefing, broadcast earlier on Thursday, the regional director, Matshidiso Moeti, said: It took 36 days to reach 1000 cases, but only 62 cases to reach 100,000. Compared to two weeks ago, reported cases have tripled in five countries and doubled in 10 countries. Overall levels of Covid-19 in Africa compare favourably with other parts of the world, but there are still fears that the true extent of the pandemic on the continent is unknown due to a lack of testing. There are now 125,000 cases and 3,700 deaths. Some observers have raised the possibility that the slow spread of the disease in Africa is due to the relative youth of populations. Moeti said data suggested that, as elsewhere, age and pre-existing conditions appeared important in determining the severity of each case, but countries everywhere on the continent faced significant difficulties accessing test materials and personal protective equipment for health workers. A traditional remedy endorsed and distributed by the government of Madagascar will be tested thoroughly, she said. The WHO has previously said there is no scientific evidence that the herbal treatment is in any way effective. Governments in Africa moved quickly to impose lockdowns and restrictions which helped slow the spread of the virus, but caused very significant problems to hundreds of millions of people living in poverty. These are now being progressively removed, with South Africa, which imposed one of the strictest lockdowns, moving to level three on a scale of five this Monday. There has been controversy in the country - sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s most-developed - over a decision to allow religious services to go ahead if worshippers are restricted to less than 50 and strict social distancing precautions are observed. A ban on alcohol sale and transport will also be lifted. Zweli Mkhize, South Africa\u2019s health minister, told reporters that no lockdown could last for ever and that it was time to provide some social and economic relief. It was hoped that religious leaders could educate congregations about the virus and how to keep safe, Mkhize said, adding that it had become clear that the country would be dealing with the pandemic for one to two years so \u201cthere has to be a degree of easing\u201d. The emerging hotspot for the disease in South Africa - and in Africa overall - has been the Western Cape province, which includes Cape Town, the international tourist destination. GSK, the British pharmaceutical company, said on Thursday that its previous flu pandemic vaccine was not linked to a rise in cases of the sleep disorder narcolepsy. The claim comes as the company said it planned to produce large volumes of an ingredient used in that vaccine for possible use in Covid-19 vaccines currently being developed. According to Reuters, a spokesman for GSK said the \u201cscience has moved on\u201d since concerns were raised about links between narcolepsy and its H1N1 vaccine, called Pandemrix, which was developed during the flu pandemic 10 years ago. He said evidence now suggests the link is to the H1N1 flu virus itself, not the vaccine. Previous studies in several countries, including Britain, Finland, Sweden and Ireland, had suggested Pandemrix was linked to a significant rise in cases of narcolepsy in children. Pandemrix\u2019s ingredients included a booster, or adjuvant, known as AS03, that could potentially be an ingredient in at least seven experimental COVID-19 vaccines, including one being developed by Sanofi, with whom GSK signed a collaboration deal in April. Wendy Barclay, a professor and chair in flu virology at Imperial College London, said that since the link between narcolepsy and the 2009/10 flu pandemic is thought to have been due to cross-reactivity between parts of the H1N1 virus and human proteins that control sleep patterns, the Pandemrix vaccine\u2019s adjuvant may have played a role. \u201cIf the virus/host cross-reactivity is the mechanism or explanation, then using an adjuvant in the vaccine to boost the immune response may have increased the chances that this cross-reactivity was generated,\u201d she told Reuters. \u201cWe still don\u2019t really know if this was the case or not.\u201d Israel has launched a campaign to test 100,000 people for coronavirus antibodies, in preparation for a potential \u201csecond wave\u201d of cases, a top official said on Thursday, according to AFP. The initiative is one of the world\u2019s largest such schemes and aims to test Israel\u2019s \u201ccollective immunity\u201d against the COVID-19 disease by determining how widely the virus has spread and who is most at risk going forward. In parallel to the national campaign, authorities are also running separate surveys of \u201chigh-risk areas\u201d. Israel\u2019s ultra-Orthodox Jewish community has been particularly hard-hit by the pandemic, while other focus groups include hospital staff treating coronavirus patients. Israel has gradually relaxed its anti-coronavirus measures in recent weeks, reopening schools, beaches and restaurants. The country has registered 281 deaths from COVID-19 and more than 16,800 cases in a population of around nine million, according to official figures. Yair Schindel, a senior official on the task force tackling the pandemic, said the government has bought around 2.5 million tests for the antibodies scheme. They are being distributed to the country\u2019s four health insurance companies, before the samples are brought together for analysis. Health officials in Moscow updated their figures on coronavirus deaths on Thursday, seeking to dispel doubts about Russia\u2019s comparatively low Covid-19 death toll, the Associated Press reports. On top of 636 deaths in April directly caused by Covid-19 reported earlier, the Moscow health department added the deaths of 756 people who tested positive for the virus but died of other causes. Un 360 of those cases, it noted, the coronavirus acted as a catalyst, exacerbating the patients conditions and contributing to their deaths. The health department also factored in 169 deaths of people who tested negative but autopsies showed had likely succumbed to the virus. The department previously only counted deaths directly resulting from the virus, leaving an increase in deaths compared to April 2019 as an unexplained excess. That aroused suspicions in Russian and Western health experts, who alleged that the authorities in Moscow and other Russian regions may have under-reported coronavirus deaths for political reasons. Deaths from coronavirus in Italy rose by 70 on Thursday, down from 117 on Wednesday, bringing the total to 33,142, writes Angela Giuffrida, the Guardian\u2019s Rome correspondent New infections increased by 593, slightly up compared to Wednesday, with 382 cases in the Lombardy region. There are 47,986 people who are currently suffering from the virus in Italy, down by 2,980 within the last 24 hours. Italy has 231,732 confirmed cases to date, including the deaths and 150, 604 survivors. Female leaders from around the world came together on Thursday to call for women and girls to be at the forefront of the Covid-19 response and in efforts to rebuild health systems and economies in the wake of the pandemic, writes Liz Ford, the deputy editor of the Guardian\u2019s global development desk. \u201cWe\u2019re coming together because none of us are prepared to standby and see this pandemic erode the significant progress that has been made on the health and rights of women, and children and adolescents,\u201d said Helen Clark, former prime minister of New Zealand. Clark was co-convener of the virtual roundtable meeting, which was attended by female presidents, ministers and leaders of international agencies and NGOs from around the world. She said: We see Covid-19 now for the deadly and disabling disease that it is. And we\u2019re also seeing the many impacts that the global crisis the pandemic has created and how the are magnifying inequalities around our world. So often in addressing past pandemics, the rights of women, children and adolescents haven\u2019t exactly been top of mind, so the services they need haven\u2019t been properly resourced, their voices haven\u2019t been heard, and often we don\u2019t see women at all prominent in decision-making about pandemic responses in many countries. We are now seeing the economic impact and social impact of this crisis unfold in the increasing poverty and increasing hunger. Sexual and reproductive health and rights were \u201csuffering especially\u201d in these circumstances, Clark said, adding that children will suffer \u201clife-long impacts\u201d if they miss out on their immunisations and if they grow up in impoverished families. All of us as stakeholders, whether we\u2019re government, civil society, philanthropy, whoever we are, we have got to work together and commit to engaging women and children and adolescents in decisions about the pandemic response, as the decisions being made are going to profoundly impact on their lives. The former president of Chile and now UN commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, told the meeting: \u201cWe can\u2019t go back to the day before covid ... we have the opportunity to put in place a new way of operating, putting women at the forefront.\u201d She added: We have to strengthen our health systems, prioritise services required by women. The participation of women must be part of the solution. In member states and civil society responses to the crisis, and in recovery, [we] must make sure women\u2019s voices are included in the response, otherwise it won\u2019t be adequate. Sobering projections from the UN population fund (UNFPA) last month predicted an additional 15 million cases of domestic violence this year as a result of lockdowns and restrictions from the pandemic. The agency also calculated tens of millions of women will not be able to access contraceptives, leading to an increase number of unintended pregnancies and unsafe abortions and maternal deaths. \u201cSexual and reproductive health and rights, that is essential care, and it is more essential now than it has ever been before,\u201d said Katja Iversen, president of advocacy group Women Deliver. \u201cWe need a gender lens across all response and recovery efforts,\u201d she said. \u201cWith a gender lens, we can lay down the tracks for a more gender equal world tomorrow.\u201d The high-level meeting was organised by the Every Woman Every Child movement, the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health and Women Deliver to call attention to the disproportionate affect the pandemic is, and is expected to have, on the health and wellbeing of women and children. Health authorities in the UK have reported 377 more deaths from Covid-19, bringing the total death toll in Europe\u2019s worst affected country to 37,837 - still the second highest of any country in the world. So far, the country has recorded 269,127 confirmed cases of coronavirus, with the latest update reporting that another 1,887 had tested positive. Norway is to open its borders to business travellers from its Nordic neighbours next month, in a further easing of its coronavirus restrictions. The new rules mean business travellers arriving from Denmark, Finland, Iceland and Sweden will no longer be subject to a mandatory 10-day quarantine currently enforced for almost all arrivals from abroad, according to Reuters. There had been discussion over whether the relaxation should differentiate between countries because of Sweden\u2019s significantly higher rate of coronavirus infections, but in the end the government decided against such a move. \u201cThis is about bringing back everyday work, slowly and controlled. Not every meeting, negotiation and deal can be done digitally,\u201d the industry minister, Iselin Nyboe, told a news conference Paris is no longer deemed to be a \u201cred\u201d coronavirus danger zone, the risks posed by the virus moving down a notch to \u201corange\u201d, France\u2019s prime minister, Edouard Philippe, said on Thursday, Reuters reports. The orange rating means Paris is not as free of the virus as the majority of regions in France designated \u201cgreen\u201d, however, earlier lockdown measures will be eased in Paris, with parks in the capital due to re-open next week. Health results have been good so far in France, the prime minister, Edouard Philippe, said on Thursday, as the country prepares to enter a second phase in its relaxation of lockdown rules on June 2. \u201cResults are good from a health point of view, even if we remain cautious\u201d, Philippe told a news conference. The road to recovery after a spell in intensive care can be long and arduous. David McWilliams is a consultant physiotherapist helping ICU patients recover from Covid-19 \u2013 from when they first open their eyes since arriving to their first steps. His team support patients at Birmingham\u2019s Queen Elizabeth hospital, which has one of the largest critical care units in Europe and recently was treating more than 200 Covid-19 patients at one time. Watch our video report. As schools prepare to reopen, many wonder how small children are expected to maintain \u201csocial distancing\u201d, writes Steven Poole, for the Guardian\u2019s books section. Some French teachers have been isolating their charges within little plague squares chalked on the playground. But maybe the choice of the phrase \u201csocial distancing\u201d in the first place has been counterproductive. If \u201csocial distancing\u201d sounds to you more like snubbing or ghosting a friend, you are right. It was a 1957 collection of work by sociologist Karl Mannheim that first described it as a way to enforce power hierarchies. \u201cThe inhibition of free expression can also serve as a means of social distancing,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThus, the higher ranks can constrain themselves to preserve a certain kind of deportment or dignity.\u201d In doing so, they distance themselves socially from the plebs. It was only in the mid-2000s that \u201csocial distancing\u201d was adopted for pandemic measures, but it is potentially alienating: after all, we are not actually advised to distance our social selves, only our bodies. So perhaps we should all adopt the clearer alternative preferred by, among others, the Irish government: \u201cphysical distancing\u201d. Physical distancing might lead in some sad cases to social distancing, too, but it\u2019s not the same thing. The number of Americans who have lost their jobs in the past 10 weeks soared to more than 40 million as the number of unemployment claims continued to rise with 2.1 million people filing for unemployment last week, writes Lauren Aratani for the Guardian US. The staggering job losses mark a grim milestone in the economic crisis that has gripped the US since the coronavirus triggered widespread shutdowns and stay-at-home orders in an effort to halt the spread of the deadly pandemic. The latest figures from the Department of Labor show that the rate of new unemployment claims has continued to fall over the last few weeks, down from its peak in early April, when 6.6 million Americans filed for unemployment in a single week. Earlier this month, the department reported that more than 20 million Americans lost their jobs in April, bringing the unemployment rate to 14.7%, up from 4.4% in March. While the growth of unemployment claims has slowed, millions more have continued to file for unemployment each week, bringing the total number of unemployed to a disastrous rate not seen since the Great Depression. The US government is funding a website in Armenia which is spreading disinformation about the coronavirus pandemic, including warnings that Armenians ought to \u201crefuse\u201d future vaccine programmes, write Stephanie Kirchgaessner in Washington and David Roth in Moscow. The website, Medmedia.am, was launched with the help of a US State Department grant meant to promote democracy, but instead has been used to promote false information about Covid-19, according to an investigation by the British news website openDemocracy. Among Medmedia\u2019s most popular articles are pieces that have called Covid-19 a \u201cfake pandemic\u201d and falsely reported that a morgue offered to pay hundreds of dollars to a dead patient\u2019s family if they claimed the death had been caused by the coronavirus. The grant was awarded by the State Department to a group called the Armenian Association of Young Doctors, which launched the website last year and is led by a controversial doctor called Gevorg Grigoryan. He has been known for his strong criticism of the government\u2019s health ministry and its vaccine programmes, and has a history of anti-LGBT statements, including remarks posted on Facebook in 2014 in which he called for gay people to be burned. Sweden has reported 46 more deaths from Covid-19, bringing its total death toll from the coronavirus outbreak to 4,266, according to its public health authority. The Scandinavian country, one of the few in Europe not to have imposed mandatory restrictions to curb the spread of the virus, has now recorded 35,727 cases of coronavirus, with 639 new cases reported on Thursday. Swedish authorities\u2019 decision not to impose the kinds of lockdowns seen elsewhere has been a source of endless controversy, as well as intense interest from observers keen to see whether such restrictive measures have actually made a difference in those countries where they have been implemented, many of which have nonetheless seen high death tolls. Deaths in Sweden from the outbreak continue to fall from a peak reached on 21 April, however the number of infections reported daily have fallen more slowly. As elsewhere in the world, the brunt of the outbreak has been carried by older people. On Thursday, the Swedish register of palliative care said that Stockholm had seen a near tripling of deaths in elderly care homes in April, compared to the same period last year. Nearly 800 deaths were reported to SRPC from the Stockholm region alone last month, Swedish Television reported on Thursday, according to Xinhua. By comparison, in April 2019, 270 deaths were reported to SRPC. President Trump has broken his silence on the grim milestone of more than 100,000 American deaths, commenting on Twitter. Hi. Caroline Davies here just taking over the live blog for a while. You can get in touch via caroline.davies@theguardian.com Three Zimbabwe opposition leaders who accused police of abducting and sexually assaulting them have been charged with breaching lockdown rules by staging an illegal demonstration. Joanna Mamombe, Netsai Marova and Cecilia Chimbiri say they were abducted by police at a Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) party protest in Zimbabwe\u2019s capital Harare on 13 May. The women, who are prominent members of the MDC\u2019s youth wing, were found dumped on the side of a road two days later and taken to hospital, where they are still recovering from multiple injuries. Nelson Chamisa, the MDC leader, said they had been severely beaten and sexually assaulted. On Thursday, at bedside hearings, all three were charged with participating in a gathering with intent to promote public violence, breach of peace, and bigotry. Zimbabwean news site NewsDay reports prosecutors alleged that the trio defied lockdown regulations by staging a demonstration that drew more than 50 people. It was alleged that protesters carried placards saying \u201cunlock us before we revolt,\u201d which prosecutors described as \u201ca visible representation that was threatening, intending to provoke the breach of peace or realising that there was a risk or possibility that a breach of peace may occur.\u201d Patrick Chinamasa, a spokesman for the ruling party, the Zanu PF, said it was up to Mamombe, Marova and Chimbiri to prove they were abducted. \u201cWe find it abhorrent that to date neither the three lady complainants nor their family members or their friends have made a formal report to the police suggesting that they don\u2019t want the truth to come out,\u201d NewsDay quoted him as saying. Coronavirus cases in Zimbabwe more than doubled to 132 over two days, the state broadcaster reported Wednesday, after 76 new infections were detected mainly among citizens returning from neighbouring South Africa and Botswana. Almost 14 million people could go hungry in Latin America and the Caribbean this year, as a result of the socio-economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the World Food Programme has said. According to estimates published by the agency on Thursday, in 11 countries in the region where there are already nearly 4 million people facing food insecurity, an additional 10 million people could be pushed into poverty and hunger. The worst affected country is likely to be Haiti, where the number of people facing severe food insecurity could rise from 700,000 to 1.6 million, WFP said. Also at particular risk are Venezuelan migrants living in Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. Miguel Barreto, WFP regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean, said: It is vital and urgent that we provide food assistance to the growing number of vulnerable people in the region, as well as those who depend on informal work. We still have time to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic from becoming a hunger pandemic. Here are the key lines from our global coronavirus coverage so far on Thursday: South Korea has tightened restrictions in the metropolitan area of Seoul after a spike in infections. Restrictions had been lifted across the country on 6 May after the outbreak appeared to be brought under control. However, officials have recorded the biggest spike in infections in nearly two months, prompting the closure of museums, parks and art galleries in the Seoul area for two weeks from Friday. Half of South Korea\u2019s 51 million people live in the metropolitan area where restrictions are being tightened. \u2022 US deaths pass 100,000. Data from Johns Hopkins University shows that the United States has recorded more than 100,000 deaths from Covid-19, moving past a sombre milestone even as many states relax mitigation measures to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. The US has recorded more deaths from the disease than any other country in the pandemic, and almost three times as many as the second-ranking country, Britain. \u2022 Trump silent on US death toll. Donald Trump remained silent on the death of more than 100,000 Americans from Covid-19 as the US mourned the milestone. The president made no comment on Twitter about the momentous day, but used the platform to attack tech companies for trying to censor him, a day after Twitter put a fact-check warning on one of his claims. \u2022 The number of people infected by the coronavirus has exceeded 5.7 million, according to data compiled by the John Hopkins University. The US is home to to 29.8% of the 5,707,163 people with the disease around the world, the data shows, way ahead of Brazil (7.2%), Russia (6.6%), the UK (4.7%), Spain (4.1%) and Italy (4%). The true number of infections is likely to be much higher, however, given the vast number of unrecorded and asymptomatic cases. \u2022 UN: Virus could push 14 million into hunger in Latin America. The UN World Food Program is warning that at least 14 million people could go hungry in Latin America as the coronavirus pandemic rages on. New projections released late on Wednesday estimate a startling four-fold increase in severe food insecurity. \u2022 European investment slashed. Over a third of European foreign direct investment projects announced in 2019 have been either delayed or cancelled outright because of the coronavirus pandemic, an annual survey by professional services group EY found. Some 65% of the 6,412 projects in question are already in place or continuing \u201calbeit with downgraded capacity and recruitment\u201d, EY said. A further 25% were delayed and 10 percent cancelled, its Europe Attractiveness survey found. \u2022 Ireland faces record recession: think tank. Ireland is facing its deepest ever recession as the coronavirus lockdown devastates jobs and strains the public finances, a think tank said Thursday. A report by Ireland\u2019s Economic and Social Research Institute predicts the nation\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) will decline 12.4% this year. That was the \u201cmost likely\u201d scenario under a government plan to lift the lockdown in August but with the economy struggling to return to pre-pandemic levels owing to physical distancing measures, ESRI said. \u2022 Tory anger at Dominic Cummings builds. 61 Conservative MPs defied British PM Boris Johnson\u2019s calls to \u201cmove on\u201d from the Dominic Cummings crisis as a senior minister broke ranks to accuse the special adviser of inconsistencies in his account of his behaviour during lockdown. Former chancellor Sajid Javid also said the journey was not \u201cnecessary or justified\u201d as the number of backbenchers calling for Cummings to resign or be sacked grew to 44, with more than 60 Tory MPs weighing in to criticise him. Two of those condemning Cummings are government whips. \u2022 Hydroxychloroquine study raises concerns. Questions have been raised about a study published in the Lancet that prompted the World Health Organization to halt global trials of the drug hydroxychloroquine. The Lancet said the authors were \u201cinvestigating urgently\u201d an apparent discrepancy in the data. It comes amid scientists\u2019 concerns that rigorous standards are falling by the wayside in the race to understand the virus. There have been more than 159,000 excess deaths in Europe since since early March, during the height of the coronavirus epidemic, the head of the World Health Organization\u2019s regional office for the continent has said. In his weekly briefing coronavirus briefing, Hans Kluge, director of WHO Europe, said that 2 million people had been confirmed to have caught the coronavirus since it was first detected on the continent four months ago. About 175,000 had died of Covid-19. \u201cPerhaps a less reported, but equally alarming figure is that since early March, more than 159,000 excess deaths, coinciding with the pandemic, have been reported from 24 European countries,\u201d Kluge said. \u201cThese are deaths above and beyond what we would have expected normally at this time of the year.\u201d Kluge said that across Europe, 94% of all Covid-19 deaths were of people aged 60 or over, and nearly six in ten were men. Nearly all - 97% - of those who died had at least one underlying condition, with cardiovascular disease being the most common, he said. Despite the WHO saying that the worst affected region is now the Americas, Europe still accounts for 36% of the world\u2019s confirmed cases of coronavirus, and half of all deaths. With national economies badly affected by coronavirus lockdowns, Kluge called on governments to avoid cutting healthcare spending in the aftermath of the pandemic. Manhunts have begun after hundreds of people, some with the coronavirus, fled quarantine centres in Zimbabwe and Malawi, the Associated Press reports. In Malawi, more than 400 people recently repatriated from South Africa and elsewhere fled a centre at a stadium in Blantyre, jumping over a fence or strolling out the gate while police and health workers watched. Police and health workers told reporters they were unable to stop them as they lacked adequate protective gear. At least 46 escapees had tested positive for the virus. Some of those who fled told reporters they had bribed police. And in Zimbabwe, police spokesman Paul Nyathi said officers were hunting down more than 100 people who escaped from centres where a 21-day quarantine is mandatory for those returning from abroad. \u201cThey escape and sneak into the villages We are warning people to stop sheltering them. These escapees are becoming a serious danger to communities,\u201d Nyathi said. Afghanistan is in immediate need of masks and ventilators, health authorities said, as the number of confirmed infections passed 13,000 despite no tests being carried out in Kandahar for two weeks, Akhtar Mohammad Makoii reports from Herat. The Afghan health ministry announced on Thursday that it has run out of facilities and equipment for Covid-19 patients. Wahid Majroh, deputy health minister said that the ministry had received nothing in the past 30 days. \u201cWe need ventilators and NIV masks immediately, in some provinces we have run out of hospital beds for patients\u201d Majroh said. \u201cIn the last 10 days, as people continue to break the lockdown regulations, the number of transmission has been rising and we are yet to reach the peak of the crisis\u201d. \u201cIn some cases patients wait in doorsteps of ICU for the death of another patient in ICU to go and fill the bed\u201d Majroh said. He warned that tests are not possible for everyone and asked people with symptoms to quarantine themselves at home, and only go to medical centres if their condition worsened. In Kandahar no suspected patient has been tested in nearly a fortnight, due to a problem in the testing process. The problem risks generating a huge backlog, since health officials send samples of suspected patients in nearby provinces such as Helmand to Kandahar. Majroh said he has instructed health services in Kandahar and nearby provinces to send samples to Kabul until the problem is solved. \u201cWe have serious problem in Kandahar, the PCR machine is off and there is no flight toward Kandahar so our engineers can go and fix that,\u201d Majroh said. \u201cThere will be a UN flight to Kandahar in coming days and our team will go with that.\u201d On Thursday the heath ministry reported that it had tested 1,072 suspected patients of whom 580 were positive, taking the total number of confirmed infections to 13,036. Eight patients also died overnight, raising Afghanistan\u2019s Covid-19 death toll to 235. There have been 1,209 recoveries. According to the health ministry 19 patients are in critical condition. Majroh said 40% of confirmed cases were recorded in last 10 days and added that previously he was \u201cwarning that the flood [of coronavirus] will come, but now the flood has arrived and many people are sinking\u201d. The health sector had its worst days during three days of Eid, he said. Most of the new cases wee recorded in the capital, Kabul, where 322 out of 662 tests came back positive. Kabul is the country\u2019s worst affected area by cases, with 5,093 infected patients so far, of whom 29 have died. The western province of Herat recorded two deaths of Covid-19 and 139 new infections. Herat borders Iran and recorded the first case of the virus reported in the country after thousands of Afghan migrants poured back from Iran in February and March. The total number of infections in Herat is 2,105, with its 44 deaths making it region with the highest death toll. Meanwhile, members of local police forces were killed in a Taliban attack in Parwan province, north of Kabul, as a ceasefire among Afghan forces and Taliban fighters ended on Wednesday. A technical delegation of the Taliban is in Kabul \u201cto work with a technical team of the government\u201d on the release of prisoners of both sides, the Office of National Security Council said. The president, Ashraf Ghani, announced Sunday that the government will release up to 2,000 Taliban prisoners as a \u201cgoodwill gesture\u201d in response to the Taliban\u2019s calling for a three-day ceasefire, the president also pledged to take further steps in the peace process. Taliban confirmed the delegation on Thursday and said the team will work on \u201cverification and identification of prisoners\u201d. Millions of women worldwide are facing shortages of sanitary products, price hikes, and worsened stigma while managing periods during the coronavirus pandemic, a charity warned on Thursday, according to Reuters. About three-quarters of health professionals in 30 countries surveyed by Plan International, from Kenya to Australia, reported supply shortages, while 58% complained of rising and prohibitive prices of sanitary products. Around half the respondents cited reduced access to clean water to help manage periods, and a quarter worried about greater stigma or discriminative cultural practices linked to menstruation for women who were trapped at home by lockdowns. \u201cPeriods don\u2019t stop during a pandemic, but managing them safely and with dignity has become a whole lot harder,\u201d Susanne Legena, chief executive officer of Plan International Australia, said in a statement to mark Menstrual Hygiene Day. \u201cIn many countries, period products have become scarce and vulnerable girls and young women, in particular, are going without,\u201d she said, urging governments to include menstrual hygiene in virus response plans and invest in water and sanitation services. A British pilot who was critically ill with Covid-19 in Vietnam has awoken from a coma and is showing signs of improvement, yet his long-term outlook remains ominous, doctors have said, writes Chris Humphrey in Hanoi. The man, 43, who works for Vietnam Airlines, had awoken from a coma and was capable of basic communication after doctors reduced his levels of sedative medication, Vietnamese state media announced on Wednesday. The patient, referred to in Vietnam as Patient 91, developed a fever and cough on 17 March and was later admitted to Ho Chi Minh City Hospital for Tropical Diseases. Since then, he has spent more than two months on life support. Tran Thanh Linh, the deputy head of Ho Chi Minh City-based Cho Ray hospital\u2019s intensive care unit, told local media the man was able to perform simple gestures such as moving fingers and toes, yet breathing issues, organ damage and limb weaknesses remain. The pilot is on an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machine (ECMO), a form of life support used when a person\u2019s heart or lungs are unable to fully function, and is being treated with antibiotics, according to a report posted on the government\u2019s official news portal early in May. Linh added that, by the end of this week, an official decision would be announced on whether or not doctors would gradually wean him off ECMO, or even stop the treatment altogether. His lungs are currently functioning at about 20-30%, an increase from 10% a few weeks ago. Finland has seen no evidence of the coronavirus spreading faster since schools started to reopen in the middle of May, the top health official said on Thursday, Reuters reports. \u201cThe time has been short, but so far we have seen no evidence,\u201d Mika Salminen, director of health security at the Finnish Institute of Health and Welfare, told a news conference. Finland started to reopen schools and daycare centres from 14 May following an almost two-month shutdown. On Thursday, the country\u2019s health authority reported that 51 more people had tested positive for coronavirus. The country has so far recorded 313 deaths from its outbreak. Sixty-three more people have died from coronavirus in Iran in the past 24 hours, the country\u2019s health ministry reports, bringing the country\u2019s total death toll from the disease to 7,627. In his daily update, Kianoush Jahanpour, the health ministry spokesman, said that 2,258 more people had tested positive for the virus, taking the country\u2019s total cumulative caseload to 143,849 since the outbreak began in the country, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported. Of those, 112,988 have survived and recovered, while 2,543 patients were in a critical condition in hospital. The latest figures came as Iran reopened a number of border points with neighbouring countries that had been closed since before the start of spring in an effort to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Seventeen out of 31 border checkpoints had now reopened. The World Health Organization\u2019s regional office for Africa is conducting its weekly coronavirus briefing. You can watch the live broadcast in the player on this tweet. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 353 to 179,717, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Thursday, according to Reuters. The reported death toll rose by 62 to 8,411, the tally showed. Germany reached its peak in new cases at the end of March, according to data collected by the Worldometers website, recording 6,993 new cases on 27 March. Peak death toll was reached in early April. In one of the rare expressions of empathy that Donald Trump has displayed during the course of the coronavirus pandemic, he talked earlier this month about the disease claiming so many lives it was \u201cfilling up Yankee Stadium with death\u201d, writes Ed Pilkington, chief reporter for the Guardian US. Now the death toll from Covid-19 stands at almost twice the capacity of the Yankees\u2019 home stadium, and has reached another booming landmark: 100,000 deaths. A country that prides itself on its exceptionalism can now without ambiguity claim that title for its experience of the virus. The United States stands head and shoulders at the top of the world league table of confirmed cases, as well as the total number of deaths. There will be much to analyse in coming years about how the US responded to this contagion, including how many lives have been lost needlessly as a result of Trump\u2019s maverick response. Already one lesson of the pandemic is clear: America\u2019s deep and brutal fault lines \u2013 of race, partisanship, gender, poverty and misinformation \u2013 rendered the country ill-prepared to meet the challenges of this disease. The ravages of Covid-19 have revealed the deep cracks in the glittering facade of the richest and most powerful nation on Earth. The 52 countries of Africa have reported a total of more than 123,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus, the World Health Organization\u2019s regional office for the continent reported on Thursday. So far more than 50,000 people infected with the virus have recovered, and about 3,600 have died, the UN health agency said. Hi this is Damien Gayle now taking over the live blog, bringing you the latest news from around the world on the coronavirus outbreak. If you have any comments, tips or suggestions for coverage then drop me a line, either via email to damien.gayle@theguardian.com, or via Twitter direct message to @damiengayle. My colleague Damian Gayle points to interesting data from Italy\u2019s national health authority on the characteristics of those who died with Covid-19 in the country. An analysis of more than 3,000 fatalities found the average age of those who died was about 80, and that 96% had previous medical conditions. Nearly 60% had three or more illnesses. This underlines what we already know: those most vulnerable to Covid-19 are the elderly and those with certain co-morbidities. The news recently has been unrelentingly grim, I think we\u2019d all agree. So let\u2019s enjoy this postcard from Denmark, where schools, cafes, restaurants, shops and hairdressers (remember those?) have reopened as the country returns to a semblance of normality. You can read the full lovely piece here, but here\u2019s an extract: Under the shade of umbrellas, pensioners eat cake at a cafe, children slosh cups of juice, and students clink beer bottles, smoking, laughing and talking loudly enough to be heard above the buzz of people who are now \u2026 everywhere. On 18 May, the doors of cafes, restaurants and shops were flung wide in Denmark and the high streets are bustling again. Even hairdressers have reopened (what did we learn during lockdown? How many Danes are natural blondes). There are no face masks in sight, few gloved hands, and little sign of any seismic global interruption. The only visible difference between the throng pre-lockdown and now is that pedestrians walk in \u201clanes\u201d, depending on their direction of traffic, and mobile hand sanitiser stations are parked at intervals along the high streets. Sanitiser pumps grace every shop doorway and smaller retailers display signs instructing customers how many are allowed in at any given time. But Danes are happy to comply for the most part \u2013 if there are already four people buying ice-cream, they\u2019ll just come back later. Indonesia has reported 687 new coronavirus cases over the last 24 hours, down from a peak of 973 a week ago. It also confirmed 23 new deaths from the virus, taking total fatalities to 1,496 and infections to 24,538, according to health ministry official Achmad Yurianto. In Malaysia, authorities reported 10 new coronavirus cases in the past day and no new deaths. Its number of fatalities remains at 115, with cases at 7,629. The number of people infected by the coronavirus has exceeded 5.7 million, according to data compiled by the John Hopkins University. The US is home to to 29.8% of the 5,707,163 people with the disease around the world, the data shows, way ahead of Brazil (7.2%), Russia (6.6%), the UK (4.7%), Spain (4.1%) and Italy (4%). The true number of infections is likely to be much higher, however, given the vast number of unrecorded and asymptomatic cases. Online retailer Amazon has been accused by German unions of enjoying record profits during the Covid-19 pandemic at the cost of exposing its workers to the virus, as details of outbreaks at two of the US company\u2019s logistics centres have emerged. Last Tuesday, a parliamentary query from the Green party revealed that at least 53 out of 1,800 employees at an Amazon centre in Winsen, Lower Saxony, were infected with the virus between 16 March and 29 April. A spokesperson for the city of Pforzheim, in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, said there had also been at least seven infections that could be traced to an Amazon warehouse in the city. German services union ver.di accuses the retail giant of having been slow to adapt working conditions to social distancing guidelines. Amazon told German media that it had adjusted its hygiene protocols and there had been no further confirmed infections at the Winsen centre in May: \u201cNothing is more important to us than the health and wellbeing of our workers\u201d, said a spokesperson. In mid-March, Switzerland launched the biggest mobilisation of its military since World War Two to help combat the growing threat of the coronavirus. More than 8,000 members of the military were brought into active service, protecting borders and carrying out logistical exercises. Today, they were officially stood down. The AFP news agency has video of the moment below. According to the John Hopkins University tracker, its number of daily recorded cases has plummeted from a peak of 1,300 on 23 March to 15 earlier this week. In total, Switzerland (pop: 8.6 million) has suffered 1,917 deaths and recorded 30,776 infections. The UK government wants primary schools in England to reopen in just four days time for some pupils. It looks like most schools will stick to this date but thousands have said it is too soon to reopen, amid concerns about social distancing especially in areas where infection rates are higher than in London. In Finland, schools and daycare centres started to reopen on 14 May for the first time in nearly two months. Today, Finnish officials gave some reassuring news, saying there was no evidence of Covid-19 spreading faster since schools started to reopen. \u201cThe time has been short, but so far we have seen no evidence,\u201d Mika Salminen, director of health security at the Finnish Institute of Health and Welfare, told a news conference. The Philippines\u2019 health ministry has reported 17 more coronavirus deaths and 539 new infections, the biggest number of cases reported in a single day since the virus was first detected in the country. In a bulletin, the ministry said total infections have risen to 15,588 and deaths have reached 921. The number of recovered patients was 3,598. As we reported earlier, the country\u2019s hardline president, Rodrigo Duterte, is due to make a statement later today after being urged to ease one of the toughest and longest lockdowns in the world for resident in the capital Manila. Officials in South Korea have re-implemented lockdown measures in the metropolitan area of Seoul, home to half the country\u2019s 52 million population, following the biggest spike in infections in nearly two months. Museums, parks and art galleries will all be closed again from Friday for two weeks, said health minister Park Neung-hoo, while companies have been urged to reintroduce flexible working among other measures. \u201cWe have decided to strengthen all quarantine measures in the metropolitan area for two weeks from tomorrow to June 14,\u201d he said, reports the AFP news agency. Residents of Seoul have also been advised to avoid social gatherings or going to crowded places, including restaurants and bars, while religious facilities have been asked to be extra vigilant with quarantine measures. There were no new delays, however, to the phased re-opening of schools that is currently underway. \u201cThe next two weeks are crucial to prevent the spread of the infection in the metropolitan area,\u201d Park said, adding: \u201cWe will have to return to social distancing if we fail.\u201d Restrictions had been lifted across the country on 6 May after the outbreak appeared to be brought under control. We have more on the latest cluster of cases here. Staying on China for a moment, Reuters has footage of a pro-democracy lawmaker being forcibly removed from the legislature during a debate over the national security law that has just been passed. China\u2019s legislature has approved a decision to force a controversial national security law on Hong Kong, in an extraordinary and unprecedented move aimed at bringing the semi-autonomous territory further under Beijing\u2019s control. On Thursday, China\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress voted and passed a draft decision that paves the way for anti-sedition laws to be directly enacted in Hong Kong, bypassing the semi-autonomous territory\u2019s legislature. The Legislative Council (LegCo) has been unable to pass similar legislation on its own because of widespread public opposition. Now, a detailed law will be drafted and could be enacted in a matter of weeks, according to Chinese state media. The move by China has prompted widespread condemnation and anxiety inside and outside Hong Kong about Beijing\u2019s plans for the semi-autonomous territory. Riot police were deployed across Hong Kong to stop any potential protests. Read the full story here. Russia has reported 174 new coronavirus deaths, matching its record daily rise for fatalities and taking the overall death toll to 4,142. The country\u2019s coronavirus crisis response centre said the overall number of infections had risen by 8,371 to 379,051. Comparing death rates between countries is notoriously difficult. For one, not all countries report the same data in their death statistics. Secondly, each country is at a different stage in its own epidemic, making comparisons tricky. But the Financial Times reports that it has compiled data from national statistics agencies in 19 countries where \u201csufficient information exists to make robust comparisons\u201d. The figures include all of the European countries hit hard by coronavirus, and the US. The periods for comparison are from when death rates in individual countries climbed above five-year averages. Its conclusions are stark: the UK has suffered the highest rate of deaths from Covid-19 among these countries 19 countries, including the US, Italy, Spain and Belgium. It also found that the UK has had the highest global excess death rate per million, and only Peru has had a higher increase in deaths. Chris Giles, the FT\u2019s economics editor, said the data shows the UK suffered excess deaths across all nations and regions, whereas other countries such as Italy and France had \u201cdefinitive hotspots\u201d but other areas with lower than normal death rates. He adds: Easyjet has announced plans to cut up to 4,500 jobs \u2013 30% of its total global workforce \u2013 as the travel industry continues to be battered by Covid-19. The low-cost airline said it will start flying on 15 June but doesn\u2019t expect demand to return to 19 levels until 2023. Johan Lundgren, its chief executive, said: \u201cWe realise that these are very difficult times and we are having to consider very difficult decisions which will impact our people, but we want to protect as many jobs as we can for the long term. \u201cWe remain focused on doing what is right for the company and its long-term health and success, following the swift action we have taken over the last three months to meet the challenges of the virus. Against this backdrop, we are planning to reduce the size of our fleet and to optimise the network and our bases.\u201d In April EasyJet secured a \u00a3600m loan from the UK Treasury and Bank of England\u2019s emergency coronavirus fund after its founder and biggest shareholder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, claimed it would run out of cash by the year end regardless. Rodrigo Duterte, the hardline president of the Philippines, has been urged to ease one of the toughest and longest lockdowns in the world for resident in the capital Manila. The country\u2019s coronavirus task force has advised Duterte to gradually lift the nearly 11-week lockdown in Manila when he addresses the nation later on Thursday. The metropolitan area\u2019s 12.9 million residents have endured restrictions longer than the 76-day quarantine imposed in Wuhan, China, when the outbreak first emerged. The recommendation came even as daily infections this week were the highest since 6 April, the news agency Reuters reported. Confirmed cases in the past six days comprise nearly 11% of the total 15,049 recorded, of which 904 led to deaths. \u201cThis is really a compromise. The need to reopen the economy and the need to contain the spread of Covid-19,\u201d said presidential spokesman Harry Roque. Update: an earlier version of this post suggested the lockdown only applied to the city of Manila, in fact it applied to the larger metropolitan area. The news that South Korea has seen a spike in new cases will be met with international concern. Government scientists in the UK and beyond are closely watching events in South Korea, a country widely praised for its rapid and expansive efforts to crack down on the disease when the first clusters emerged in February. Scarred by its encounter with Middle East respiratory syndrome in 2015, South Korea implemented a comprehensive test, trace and contain policy that brought the number of daily cases down from a peak of 909 on 29 February to the dozens by late March and single figures a few weeks later. The country of 51 million people started lifting its lockdown earlier this month. It\u2019s worth looking closer at the latest outbreak. Health officials have said at least 69 of the new cases this week have been linked to a cluster of infections at a distribution centre operated by the e-commerce firm Coupang, where workers have been fulfilling the ever-rising demand for online shopping. The new outbreak appears also to be connected to an earlier cluster of infections that emerged in several Seoul nightclubs and bars earlier this month, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). As a result, health officials said they would be conducting on-site inspections of logistics centres across the country \u2013 a huge operation \u2013 while Coupong said it had closed the facility in Bucheon on Monday and closed a separate warehouse in a Seoul suburb after an employee tested there. The new spike in cases will be seen as a warning to scientists across the world \u2013 but South Korea\u2019s apparently swift response will also be seen as instructive. Hello from Manchester, England. It\u2019s Josh Halliday here to guide you through the next few hours. As ever, we\u2019ll bring you the latest developments from around the world on the coronavirus pandemic as some countries, particularly in Europe and the Middle East, begin to cautiously ease out of lockdown while others, in Africa and the Americas, brace for the worst that may yet be to come. Do get in touch to share news tips or insight from where you are. You can contact me on: Twitter: @JoshHalliday Email: josh.halliday@theguardian.com That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan for today. I\u2019ll be back on Sunday. In the meantime, I\u2019ll be learning how to walk optimally: Known global cases near 5.7m. According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 5,693,066 people are known to have contracted the virus since the pandemic began, while at least 355,653 people are known to have died. The true death toll and number of cases are likely to be significantly higher due to differing definitions and testing rates, delays and suspected underreporting. US deaths pass 100,000. Data from Johns Hopkins University shows that the United States has recorded more than 100,000 deaths from Covid-19, moving past a sombre milestone even as many states relax mitigation measures to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. The US has recorded more deaths from the disease than any other country in the pandemic, and almost three times as many as the second-ranking country, Britain. Trump silent on US death toll. Donald Trump remained silent on the death of more than 100,000 Americans from Covid-19 as the US mourned the milestone. The president made no comment on Twitter about the momentous day, but used the platform to attack tech companies for trying to censor him, a day after Twitter put a fact-check warning on one of his claims. WHO launches foundation to put finances in better health. The World Health Organization on Wednesday launched a new foundation for private donations, as US President Donald Trump threatens to pull the plug over its handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, AFP reports. South Korea could face return to coronavirus restrictions. South Korea has reported its biggest daily increase in coronavirus cases in 53 days, triggering warnings it may have to revert to stricter social distancing measures after appearing to have brought the outbreak under control.The Korean Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported 79 new infections on Thursday with 67 of them from the Seoul metropolitan area, home to about half of the country\u2019s population of 51 million. UN: Virus could push 14 million into hunger in Latin America. The UN World Food Program is warning that at least 14 million people could go hungry in Latin America as the coronavirus pandemic rages on. New projections released late on Wednesday estimate a startling four-fold increase in severe food insecurity. European investment slashed. Over a third of European foreign direct investment projects announced in 2019 have been either delayed or cancelled outright because of the coronavirus pandemic, an annual survey by professional services group EY found. Some 65% of the 6,412 projects in question are already in place or continuing \u201calbeit with downgraded capacity and recruitment\u201d, EY said. A further 25% were delayed and 10 percent cancelled, its Europe Attractiveness survey found. Ireland faces record recession: think tank. Ireland is facing its deepest ever recession as the coronavirus lockdown devastates jobs and strains the public finances, a think tank said Thursday. A report by Ireland\u2019s Economic and Social Research Institute predicts the nation\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) will decline 12.4% this year. That was the \u201cmost likely\u201d scenario under a government plan to lift the lockdown in August but with the economy struggling to return to pre-pandemic levels owing to physical distancing measures, ESRI said. Tory anger at Dominic Cummings builds. 61 Conservative MPs defied British PM Boris Johnson\u2019s calls to \u201cmove on\u201d from the Dominic Cummings crisis as a senior minister broke ranks to accuse the special adviser of inconsistencies in his account of his behaviour during lockdown. Former chancellor Sajid Javid also said the journey was not \u201cnecessary or justified\u201d as the number of backbenchers calling for Cummings to resign or be sacked grew to 44, with more than 60 Tory MPs weighing in to criticise him. Two of those condemning Cummings are government whips. Hydroxychloroquine study raises concerns. Questions have been raised about a study published in the Lancet that prompted the World Health Organization to halt global trials of the drug hydroxychloroquine. The Lancet said the authors were \u201cinvestigating urgently\u201d an apparent discrepancy in the data. It comes amid scientists\u2019 concerns that rigorous standards are falling by the wayside in the race to understand the virus.

International arrivals this year could be down by 80% compared with 2019, according to the World Tourism Organization, and more than 100 million jobs are under threat. But as destinations slowly start to emerge from lockdown and borders tentatively reopen, many in the sector are wondering if this is a chance for tourism to rebuild in a greener, more sustainable way. The World Health Organization on Wednesday launched a new foundation for private donations, as US President Donald Trump threatens to pull the plug over its handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, AFP reports. The UN health agency launched the independently-run WHO Foundation, which the organisation hopes will give it greater control to direct philanthropic and public donations towards pressing problems such as the coronavirus crisis. Trump, accusing the WHO of mismanaging the pandemic, has frozen US funding and could pull out of the organisation next month if he does not see what he believes to be satisfactory changes. Trump claims the WHO is too close to Beijing and covered up the initial outbreak in China. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus insisted the new grant-making funding stream was not related to Trump\u2019s threat to freeze its contributions. \u201cIt has nothing to do with the recent funding issues,\u201d he said, detailing that greater financial flexibility had been among his long-term reform plans since taking over the organisation in July 2017. The vast majority of the WHO\u2019s budget is in voluntary contributions which go straight from countries and other donors to their chosen destination. The WHO therefore only has control over the spending of countries\u2019 \u201cassessed contributions\u201d membership fees, which are calculated on their wealth and population. The new foundation will facilitate contributions from the general public, individual major donors and corporate partners to the WHO. Its goal is to help the organisation achieve more sustainable and predictable funding. Given the ongoing coronavirus crisis, the WHO Foundation will focus initially on emergencies and pandemic response. The fallout from Dominic Cummings trip to Durham continues to be splashed across the front pages, including the news that senior ministers are breaking ranks over the beleaguered advisor\u2019s trip. The Guardian says \u201cTories defy PM to pile pressure on Cummings\u201d, including 61 MPs who are refusing to heed Boris Johnson\u2019s calls to \u201cmove on\u201d. It says two of those condemning Cummings are government whips, in addition to Penny Mordaunt, now the paymaster general, who said there were \u201cinconsistencies\u201d in Cummings\u2019 account of the trip. The Guardian also gives prominence to Emily Maitlis, who was replaced as the BBC\u2019s Newsnight presenter on Wednesday after a statement from the broadcaster said she broke impartiality rules on Tuesday\u2019s programme, when she said Cummings broke the rules and: \u201cthe country can see that and is shocked the government cannot\u201d. The programme\u2019s editor, Esme Wren, wrote on Twitter that Maitlis \u201chasn\u2019t been replaced tonight in response to the BBC statement\u201d. A full roundup of the papers at the link below: Donald Trump remained silent on the death of more than 100,000 Americans from Covid-19 as the US mourned the milestone. The president made no comment on Twitter about the momentous day, but used the platform to attack tech companies for trying to censor him, a day after Twitter put a fact-check warning on one of his claims. As US deaths from Covid-19 topped 100,000 and infections neared 1.7 million, White House officials on Wednesday said Trump would sign an executive order that could threaten punishment on social media companies on Thursday, sparking a fall in the share prices of both Twitter and Facebook. \u201cRepublicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices,\u201d Trump tweeted on Wednesday morning. \u201cWe will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen.\u201d Eric Trump, the president\u2019s son, also attracted criticism for ignoring the coronavirus fatalities, instead tweeting about the day\u2019s stock market\u2019s surge. The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross said it has recorded 208 Covid-19-related attacks against health workers and installations in 13 countries since March, a striking contrast to the cheers and clapping in gratitude for their work in many nations, AP reports. Peter Maurer said health workers are being attacked and abused and health systems are being targeted at a time when they are most needed. The Covid-19 crisis is fast threatening to become a protection crisis,\u201d he told the UN Security Council. Maurer told reporters the ICRC compiled data from 13 countries in the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, the Americas and Africa where it operates, and its likely the actual numbers are much higher than what we calculated. He said the incidents range from verbal threats to burning down facilities reportedly housing Covid-19 patients. Maurer said 23% of incidents included physical assaults, 20% were discriminatory-related attacks on health workers, and the rest included the deliberate failure to provide or deny assistance, verbal assaults and threats, and a disregard for health personnel protective measures. Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan or via email: helen.sullivan[at]theguardian.com Here are the latest developments from the last few hours: Known global cases near 5.7m, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. According to their tally of official figures at least 5,693,066 people are known to have contracted the virus since the pandemic began, while at least 355,653 people are known to have died. US deaths pass 100,000. Data from Johns Hopkins University shows that the United States has recorded more than 100,000 deaths from Covid-19, moving past a sombre milestone even as many states relax mitigation measures to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. The US has recorded more deaths from the disease than any other country in the pandemic, and almost three times as many as the second-ranking country, Britain, which has recorded more than 37,000 Covid-19 deaths. The latest count of fatalities is 100,442. Earlier this month, president Donald Trump said 100,000 deaths would be \u201chorrible\u201d, but he claimed that actions by his administration had prevented a much higher toll. Military virus aid could look different if 2nd wave hits, says US defence secretary. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper said that as the US military prepares for another potential wave of the coronavirus, it may do things a bit differently, providing more targeted aid for cities and states and possibly shorter quarantine times for troops, AP reports. South Korea faces return to coronavirus restrictions after spike in new cases. South Korea has reported its biggest daily increase in coronavirus cases in 53 days, triggering warnings it may have to revert to stricter social distancing measures after appearing to have brought the outbreak under control.The Korean Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported 79 new infections on Thursday with 67 of them from the Seoul metropolitan area, home to about half of the country\u2019s population of 51 million. UN: Virus could push 14 million into hunger in Latin America. The UN World Food Program is warning that upward of at least 14 million people could go hungry in Latin America as the coronavirus pandemic rages on, shuttering people in their homes, drying up work and crippling the economy, AP reports. Coronavirus knocks a third of European Foreign Direct Investment \u2013 survey. Over a third of European foreign direct investment projects announced in 2019 have been either delayed or cancelled outright because of the coronavirus pandemic, an annual survey by professional services group EY found.

Britain temporarily closes its embassy in North Korea. Britain has temporarily closed its embassy in North Korea and all its diplomatic staff have left the country, the UK ambassador said on Thursday, the latest foreign delegation to leave amid strict coronavirus restrictions. 61 Conservative MPs continued to defy British PM Boris Johnson\u2019s calls to \u201cmove on\u201d from the Dominic Cummings crisis as a senior minister broke ranks to accuse the special adviser of inconsistencies in his account of his behaviour during lockdown.The intervention of Penny Mordaunt deepened the turmoil within government following revelations by the Guardian and Daily Mirror that Cummings had travelled 260 miles to his family estate in Durham with his wife suffering coronavirus symptoms.The former chancellor Sajid Javid also said the journey was not \u201cnecessary or justified\u201d as the number of backbenchers calling for Cummings to resign or be sacked grew to 44, with more than 60 Tory MPs weighing in to criticise him.Two of those condemning Cummings are government whips. As the coronavirus spreads into indigenous lands in Brazil, killing at least 40 people so far by the government\u2019s count, the first two Covid-19 deaths were registered this week in the Xingu area, one of the biggest reserves in the world, the AP reports. The two fatalities were in the Kayapo indigenous group, which has reported a total of 22 virus cases. The community\u2019s leader, Megaron, told The Associated Press he wants President Jair Bolsonaro and other officials to stop loggers, miners and fishermen from illegally entering the territory, incursions he believes have sped up the spread of the virus. Bolsonaro has encouraged development in the Amazon, regardless of indigenous lands, although the state-run indigenous agency, FUNAI, issued an order in mid-March barring access to those lands because of the virus. Still, reports in Brazilian media have said missionaries, health care agents, loggers and miners carried the virus into those areas. \u201cIt is not us that are leaving and taking (the virus). There are people seizing this disease to invade indigenous land,\u201d Megaron said. Megaron, who is a nephew of acclaimed environmentalist Raoni Metuktire, said his community now lives in fear because of the coronavirus. \u201cIt is the government\u2019s obligation to take care of our land, our community, give us help, care, even more now because this disease is killing a lot of people. Our request is to be isolated in our village until the government or the health ministry say there is no more Covid-19,\u201d he said. South Korea has reported its biggest daily increase in coronavirus cases in 53 days, triggering warnings it may have to revert to stricter social distancing measures after appearing to have brought the outbreak under control. The Korean Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported 79 new infections on Thursday with 67 of them from the Seoul metropolitan area, home to about half of the country\u2019s population of 51 million. Officials said health authorities were finding it increasingly difficult to track the transmission routes for new infections and urged people to remain vigilant amid fears of a second wave of Covid-19 infections. The health minister, Park Neung-hoo, pleaded with residents in and around the capital to avoid unnecessary gatherings and urged companies to allow sick employees to take time off work. \u201cInfection routes are being diversified in workplaces, crammed schools and karaoke rooms in the metropolitan area,\u201d Park said. The recent spike in infections has underlined the risks that come with relaxing social distancing rules, as countries seek to breathe life into their struggling economies. In Australia, empty offices and restaurants in the city of Sydney are driving hungry rats into homes and suburbs, and the loosening of restrictions could create \u201ca new rat plague\u201d, according to a leading rat-catcher. As city centres have closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, suburban rat infestations have spiked, according to Geoff Milton, a Sydney rat-catcher with 35 years\u2019 experience. Prof Peter Banks, a rodent expert from the University of Sydney, said rats had begun eating each other. Banks said that cannibalism would have happened \u201cwithin days\u201d of our restrictions being enacted, as city-dwelling rats ran out of food. A study of New Zealanders working from home during coronavirus lockdown has found many were just as productive as when they were in the office, and a majority were reluctant to return to traditional workplaces. New Zealand went into lockdown for seven weeks from 25 March, and has become a global success story in containing the coronavirus, with fewer than 1,500 people infected and 21 deaths. During lockdown, many workers experimented with working from home for the first time, and a University of Otago study of more than 2,500 people found the arrangement suited many. According to the study 73% of people were \u201cequally or more productive\u201d when working from home, and 89% wanted to continue post-lockdown, at least part-time. Despite 38% of respondents never having worked from home before, 66% of people found it \u201ceasy or somewhat easy\u201d to adapt, with 82% saying they felt they had the right resources to do their job, although only 17% had all of those resources provided by their employer. The UN World Food Program is warning that upward of at least 14 million people could go hungry in Latin America as the coronavirus pandemic rages on, shuttering people in their homes, drying up work and crippling the economy, AP reports. New projections released late Wednesday estimate a startling increase: Whereas 3.4 million experienced severe food insecurity in 2019, that number could more than quadruple this year in one of the worlds most vulnerable regions. \u201cWe are entering a very complicated stage,\u201d said Miguel Barreto, the WFPs regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean. \u201cIt is what we are calling a hunger pandemic.\u201d Signs of mounting hunger are already being felt around the region, where desperate citizens are violating quarantines to go out in search of money and food and hanging red and white flags from their homes in a cry for aid. Many of the hungry are informal workers who make up a sizeable portion of Latin Americas workforce, while others are newly poor who have lost jobs amidst a historic economic downturn. In Europe\u2019s red-light capital Amsterdam, sex work is due to officially resume in September. Prostitution in the Netherlands is legal and regulated, which allows for more support and structure during the coronavirus lockdown, AFP reports. But many sex workers in Britain and beyond are now moving online to make ends meet. Britain counted about 72,000 sex workers - 32,000 of them in London - in 2016, according to a government report. Prostitution is legal in Britain but various related activities such as solicitation are not, so thousands are operating in the shadows and lack access to government support and protections. Although some may have found a way to make money online, many have been left \u201cdoing what they can\u201d during the lockdown, according to Laura Watson, a spokeswoman for the English Collective of Prostitutes. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got three children at home running around, it\u2019s very hard to do online work,\u201d she said. Support groups such as the UK Sex Worker Advocacy and Resistance Movement (SWARM) have set up hardship funds to help \u201csex workers in urgent need\u201d. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be up to us and up to sex workers themselves to organise their own way out of this,\u201d said Watson, who urged the government to do more. Ireland is facing its deepest ever recession as the coronavirus lockdown devastates jobs and strains the public finances, a think tank said Thursday. A report by Ireland\u2019s Economic and Social Research Institute predicts the nation\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) will decline 12.4% this year. That was the \u201cmost likely\u201d scenario under a government plan to lift the lockdown in August but with the economy struggling to return to pre-pandemic levels owing to physical distancing measures, ESRI said. A more modest scenario predicting a vigorous recovery after lockdown would still see GDP shrink 8.6%, whilst a second wave of coronavirus infections could cause output plunge 17.1%. Ireland\u2019s unemployment rate soared to 28% in April, almost double the figure following the 2008 global financial crisis that led to a huge international bailout of the eurozone member state. According to ESRI\u2019s most-likely scenario, unemployment is set to remain above 17% in 2020. Ireland has suffered 1,615 deaths from the coronavirus, according to official figures. Questions raised over hydroxychloroquine study which caused WHO to halt trials for Covid-19 Questions have been raised by Australian infectious disease researchers about a study published in the Lancet which prompted the World Health Organization to halt global trials of the drug hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19. The study published on Friday found Covid-19 patients who received the malaria drug were dying at higher rates and experiencing more heart-related complications than other virus patients. The large observational study analysed data from nearly 15,000 patients with Covid-19 who received the drug alone or in combination with antibiotics, comparing this data with 81,000 controls who did not receive the drug. The findings prompted researchers from around the world to reassess their own clinical trials of the drug for preventing and treating Covid-19. The World Health Organization halted all its trials involving hydroxychloroquine due to the concerns raised in the study about its efficacy and safety. It was once viewed as among the most promising medicines to treat the virus, though no study to date has found this to be the case, and the drug can have toxic side-effects. The Australian Department of Health had been stockpiling millions of doses of the drug in case clinical trials found it proved useful. The study, led by the Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital Center for Advanced Heart Disease in Boston, examined patients in hospitals around the world, including in Australia. It said researchers gained access to data from five hospitals recording 600 Australian Covid-19 patients and 73 Australian deaths as of 21 April. But data from Johns Hopkins University shows only 67 deaths from Covid-19 had been recorded in Australia by 21 April. The number did not rise to 73 until 23 April. The data relied upon by researchers to draw their conclusions in the Lancet is not readily available in Australian clinical databases, leading many to ask where it came from. The Philippines\u2019 coronavirus task force has recommended to President Rodrigo Duterte easing lockdown measures in Manila from 1 June, despite the country still reporting some of its highest daily numbers of Covid-19 cases and missing testing targets. The restrictions, introduced in mid-March and eased slightly in mid-May to jump start the economy, are set to expire on 31 May. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte will address the nation later on Thursday about his decision on the containment measures. Podcast: The scandal of Covid-19 in care homes Why did so many people die in care homes? That may be the most urgent question of the likely public inquiry into the UK\u2019s Covid-19 response. Rob Booth, the Guardian\u2019s social affairs correspondent, on the government failures that led to thousands of care home deaths. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper said that as the US military prepares for another potential wave of the coronavirus, it may do things a bit differently, providing more targeted aid for cities and states and possibly shorter quarantine times for troops, AP reports. Speaking as he flew back from a trip to the Marine Corps recruit base at Parris Island, South Carolina, Esper said the Pentagon is looking at a variety of plans. But he said US forces may not be deployed the same way if or when the virus surges in a second large wave or even, more likely, a series of smaller bursts. The Pentagon, Esper said, is taking a broad look at how best to respond to any future outbreaks. Noting that a lot of the military aid rushed to communities as the pandemic struck ended up going unused or was used much less than anticipated, he said the military may send medical staff rather than entire hospital ships and Army field hospitals. The two US Navy hospital ships that went to New York City and Los Angeles, for example, treated few patients. And Army field hospitals deployed to other cities also got less use than initially anticipated. Instead, they ended up pulling doctors and nurses out of those facilities and sending them to local hospitals, where they could bolster overworked and stressed medical staffs. \u201cI think thats a big lesson learned,\u201d Esper said. In South Africa, where the government imposed a ban on the sale of tobacco and alcohol nearly eight weeks ago as part of its strict lockdown to combat the spread of the coronavirus, a bootlegging culture has sprung up across the country. in response to the government\u2019s nearly 8-week-old ban on the sale of tobacco and alcohol, part of its strict lockdown to combat the spread of the coronavirus. AP has this report: A soccer mom in one of Cape Town\u2019s posh suburbs drops off a cardboard box of blankets to a neighbor. Inside the box are several bottles of red wine. In Johannesburg\u2019s Alexandra township, two men in face masks greet each other on a sunny street. One has surreptitiously sold the other a pack of cigarettes. \u201cThey\u2019ve banned the sale of cigarettes but we\u2019re still able to buy them,\u201d said street vendor Mluleki Mbhele. \u201cWe buy cigarettes in the streets in the black market. The officials know about it because they themselves continue to smoke. Critics describe the prohibitions imposed by President Cyril Ramaphosa as puritanical, hypocritical and unrealistic. Around the world, only Panama and Sri Lanka are reported to be prohibiting the sale of liquor during the pandemic, while India and Thailand temporarily banned it. South African government officials say the number of admissions to hospital emergency rooms from alcohol-related crimes and vehicle accidents have been reduced significantly. Supporters of the ban on cigarette sales say smoking weakens the respiratory system, which is attacked by the virus. South Africa has the continent\u2019s highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases with over 24,000. The virus has spread relatively slowly across Africa, whose 54 countries with a population of 1.3 billion have reported a total of over 115,000 cases. More than 230,000 South Africans have been arrested for breaking the lockdown regulations, including the bans on alcohol and tobacco sales, said national police minister Bheki Cele. Britain has temporarily closed its embassy in North Korea and all its diplomatic staff have left the country, the UK ambassador said on Thursday, the latest foreign delegation to leave amid strict coronavirus restrictions. \u201cThe British Embassy in Pyongyang closed temporarily on 27 May 2020 and all diplomatic staff have left the DPRK for the time being,\u201d ambassador Colin Crooks said in a post on Twitter, using the initials of North Korea\u2019s official name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. The decision was made because \u201crestrictions on entry to the country have made it impossible to rotate our staff and sustain the operation of the embassy,\u201d the Foreign Office said in a statement, adding that the UK would seek to re-establish its presence in Pyongyang as soon as possible. NK News, a Seoul-based website, said the \u201csurprise\u201d move was linked to coronavirus-related restrictions the regime introduced early this year. Foreign residents and diplomats from other countries, including France and Germany, were evacuated in March after the country attempted to prevent the virus from spreading via air routes and its land borders with China and Russia. The British embassy staff reportedly entered China on Wednesday by land, as flights in and out of North Korea remain suspended. North Korea insists that it has not discovered a single case of Covid-19, although experts have questioned those claims. NK News said hundreds of foreigners were still living in Pyongyang, including diplomats from Sweden and Russia and a small number of aid workers. The Swedish ambassador to North Korea, Joachim Bergstrom, tweeted on Thursday that \u201ca new working day begins\u201d in the city. South Korea reported 79 new cases of coronavirus on Thursday, the highest one-day increase in 53 days, the BBC reports. This week, infections continued to creep up in and around Seoul, South Korea, prompting Jeong Eun-kyeong, the director of Korea Centers for Disease control and Prevention, to say social distancing measures eased in April may need to be reimposed. On Wednesday, South Korea reported 40 new cases, its biggest daily rise in nearly 50 days, as officials scrambled to trace hundreds of infections linked to nightclubs, restaurants and a massive e-commerce warehouse near Seoul. Over a third of European foreign direct investment projects announced in 2019 have been either delayed or cancelled outright because of the coronavirus pandemic, an annual survey by professional services group EY found. Some 65% of the 6,412 projects in question are already in place or continuing \u201calbeit with downgraded capacity and recruitment\u201d, EY said. A further 25% were delayed and 10 percent cancelled, its Europe Attractiveness survey found. The data on the impact of the pandemic was gathered last month from a panel of 113 corporate decision-makers and a series of webinars with European investment agencies, Reuters reports. The survey also showed France for the first time overtaking Britain as Europe\u2019s most popular investment destination, attracting 1,197 new projects in 2019 for a 17% rise on the year before. FDI in Britain climbed 5% in the same period. \u201cGrowth of FDI projects in France come as local and global businesses and investors welcome reforms around labour legislation and corporate taxation,\u201d EY EMEIA Area Managing Partner Julie Teigland, said of President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s reform agenda. Colombia will begin easing restrictions put in place to control the spread of the coronavirus starting from June, President Ivan Duque said Wednesday, though he asked the public to continue isolating at home and keep using measures to contain the disease. Colombia has reported more than 24,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19, as well as 803 deaths. The country began a nationwide quarantine in late March. \u201cThe pandemic hasn\u2019t gone away,\u201d Duque said in his televised nightly address. \u201cThis is going to be a very important month for all of us.\u201d Sectors like retail and non-Covid-related medical care can begin normalising gradually once the lockdown ends, but large events, bars and nightclubs will continue to be closed. Restaurants will be open for takeaway orders only, Duque said. \u201cWe are not reviving social life,\u201d Duque said. \u201cWe have to continue protecting health and lives and going forward we have to adapt to a disease that will be around for a long time.\u201d Even as restrictions begin to ease, public transport in cities must not exceed 35% of their capacity and land borders will continue to be closed. International flights, domestic flights and inter-city buses will continue to be suspended. As part of the relaxed rules, children aged 2 to 5 years old will be allowed out three times a week for 30 minutes from the first of June, while those aged 6 to 17 will be permitted outside three times a week for up to an hour. Adults under 70 years old will be allowed out three times a week for up to two hours at a time. People aged 70 and over are considered a high-risk population and should remain at home, though they may go out for 30 minutes three times a week. Since allegations first emerged that Dominic Cummings had flouted lockdown measures while ill with coronavirus symptoms, the prime minister and members of the cabinet have been floundering to defend the adviser from accusations that he broke government guidance he helped devise. Cummings has admitted to, but not apologised for, travelling to his family\u2019s home in Durham on two occasions between 27 March and 13 April, as well as making a separate trip to Barnard Castle, which he said was to test his eyesight: In Australia, Rupert Murdoch\u2019s NewsCorp has announced the end of more than 100 Australian print newspapers in a huge shift to digital. News Corp Australia has confirmed that more than 100 local and regional newspapers will become digital only or disappear entirely, and there will be a significant number of job losses. The executive chairman of News Corp Australasia, Michael Miller, thanked the departing employees for their \u201cprofessionalism, dedication and contribution\u201d. The media union says staff found out through leaks to the press and have not been told personally yet. Numbers have not been confirmed but estimates are as high as several hundred. Three Sydney newspapers in affluent areas \u2013 the Wentworth Courier, the Mosman Daily and the North Shore Times \u2013 will resume print editions as they have healthy real estate advertising revenue. News Corp suspended 60 papers in April when the coronavirus hit the economy but it always seemed unlikely they would ever return to print. China reported two new confirmed coronavirus cases in the mainland on 27 May, up from one a day earlier, the country\u2019s health authority said on Thursday. Both of the cases were imported from abroad, the National Health Commission said in its daily bulletin. China also confirmed 23 new asymptomatic coronavirus cases on 27 May, compared to 28 the day before. Joe Biden released a video Wednesday evening marking the US death toll passing 100,000, saying, \u201cTo all of you hurting so badly, Im so sorry for your loss\u201d and This nation grieves with you. In the video, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee directly addresses those who have lost relatives and friends. Evoking the personal tragedies he\u2019s faced in his own life, Biden said, \u201cI think I know what you\u2019re feeling.\u201d \u201cYou feel like you\u2019re being sucked into a black hole in the middle of your chest, said Biden, who lost his first wife and young daughter in a 1972 car crash and an adult son to cancer in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s suffocating.\u201d Biden was attempting to display compassion in contrast to President Donald Trump, who critics say has shown little empathy and made only passing acknowledgement of the pandemic\u2019s death toll instead focusing on issues like an escalating battle with Twitter for fact-checking a post of his, AP reports.

As the US death toll passed the sombre milestone of 100,000 \u2013 accounting for more than one in four deaths worldwide and far higher than the UK\u2019s toll, which is the next highest at 37,542 \u2013 Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said that Trump had mismanaged the crisis. \u201cSo much of this could have been prevented if we had a president who listened to someone other than himself,\u201d Biden said in a statement. My colleague Tom McCarthy notes that, \u201cThe first confirmed coronavirus case in the United States emerged on 20 January, in Washington state, the same day that a first case was confirmed in South Korea. The United States has increased its testing capacity but has yet to stand up a national plan for the contact tracing of positive cases, a step South Korea took immediately. That country has since recorded 269 deaths from coronavirus.\u201d Here are the key developments from around the world from the last few hours: Known global cases near 5.7m, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. According to their tally of official figures at least 5,682,389 people are known to have contracted the virus since the pandemic began, while at least 354,944 people are known to have died. US deaths pass 100,000. Data from Johns Hopkins University shows that the United States has recorded more than 100,000 deaths from Covid-19, moving past a sombre milestone even as many states relax mitigation measures to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. The US has recorded more deaths from the disease than any other country in the pandemic, and almost three times as many as the second-ranking country, Britain, which has recorded more than 37,000 Covid-19 deaths. The latest count of fatalities is 100,047. Earlier this month, president Donald Trump said 100,000 deaths would be \u201chorrible\u201d, but he claimed that actions by his administration had prevented a much higher toll. Conservative MPs continued to defy British PM Boris Johnson\u2019s calls to \u201cmove on\u201d from the Dominic Cummings crisis as a senior minister broke ranks to accuse the special adviser of inconsistencies in his account of his behaviour during lockdown.The intervention of Penny Mordaunt deepened the turmoil within government following revelations by the Guardian and Daily Mirror that Cummings had travelled 260 miles to his family estate in Durham with his wife suffering coronavirus symptoms. The former chancellor Sajid Javid also said the journey was not \u201cnecessary or justified\u201d as the number of backbenchers calling for Cummings to resign or be sacked grew to 44, with more than 60 Tory MPs weighing in to criticise him.Two of those condemning Cummings are government whips. Argentina \u2018cordons off slums\u2019 after surge in cases. Security forces in Buenos Aires cordoned off one of the city\u2019s largest and poorest slums, stopping inhabitants from entering or leaving Villa Azul, on the outskirts of the Argentinian capital, after a surge of Covid-19 cases.Police officers erected barriers on Monday after widespread testing was launched in Villa Azul. By Wednesday 174 of 301 tests come back positive, and officials feared the 4,000 or so inhabitants of the neighbourhood could spread the virus to other areas. A medical study in France suggests even mild cases of Covid-19 produce antibodies in almost all patients. The research raises hopes that everyone who has had the disease could acquire some degree of immunity, although it is not clear for how long or to what degree. The European commission proposed a \u20ac750bn coronavirus recovery fund, as part of a \u20ac1.85tn budget to help member states whose economies have suffered as a result of the pandemic. The principal beneficiaries will reportedly be Italy and Spain, the hardest-hit EU member states. Greece is preparing to send riot police to its border with Turkey. Greece\u2019s citizens protection minister, Michalis Chrisochoidis, visited the region ahead of the redeployment of some 400 officers, in anticipation of a resumption of people trying to cross. Turkey is home to nearly 4 million Syrian refugees. Restrictions on movement in Moscow are to be eased from 1 Juneafter the rate of new infections began to slow in the city, its mayor said. Sergei Sobyanin also announced plans to reopen non-food stores and services such as laundries, dry cleaners, and repair shops. Qatar\u2019s contact tracing app put the sensitive personal details of more than 1 million people at risk, according to an investigation by Amnesty International. The app, which is mandatory for Qatari residents to install, was configured in a way that would have allowed hackers \u201cto access \u2026 the name, national ID, health status and location data\u201d of users, Amnesty said. Kenya recorded its highest one day rise in cases on Wednesday, hitting a triple-digit figure for new infections for the first time since the outbreak began. The health minister, Mutahi Kagwe, says it is \u201csombre news\u201d.",
