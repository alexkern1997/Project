About one in three Americans are concerned about paying their bills and affording basic necessities over next month, but that number includes 48% of Hispanics and 39% of blacks, in comparison to 23% of whites.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T13:06:29.416Z\">at 2.06pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9edf8d8f08cd080212f82a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/amanda-holpuch\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T12:40:55.504Z\">1.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Mayor: Georgia reopening decision 'reckless, premature and dangerous'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A Georgia mayor has criticized the governor\u2019s decision to re-open the state this week as \u201c<strong>reckless, premature and dangerous</strong>\u201d.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"071949b40ae8f0d6b3c5c0f64b4d5d2cfe26aa4a\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/071949b40ae8f0d6b3c5c0f64b4d5d2cfe26aa4a/543_0_2133_2667/800.jpg\" alt=\"Brian Kemp.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brian Kemp.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ron Harris/AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Governor <strong>Brian Kemp</strong>, a Republican, said businesses including bowling alleys, tattoo studios and hair salons would reopen this week. </p> \n  <p>The Democratic mayor of Savannah, <strong>Van Johnson</strong>, said Kemp\u2019s decision was \u201cnot based in any type of science or best practices\u201d.</p> \n  <p>\u201cPeople can see it for themselves.

      "bodyText": "Live reporting on the coronavirus in the US continues on Wednesday\u2019s blog: Donald Trump announced that he would soon sign an executive order restricting immigration for 60 days. Temporary visa holders would be exempt, he said at the daily coronavirus briefing \u2014 but the policy would apply to those seeking green cards. The Senate passed a nearly $500 billion coronavirus relief bill by unainmous consent. The bill, which provides funding for small businesses, hospitals and testing, will now advance to the House. Trump has said he will sign the bill, but Republican congressman Thomas Massie has threatened to object to the bill, which could force House members to return to Washington to pass it. Attorney general William Barr said the justice department may eventually join lawsuits against stay-at-home orders. \u201cWe\u2019re looking carefully at a number of these rules that are being put into place,\u201d Barr said. \u201cAnd if we think one goes too far, we initially try to jawbone the governors into rolling them back or adjusting them. And if they\u2019re not and people bring lawsuits, we file statement of interest and side with the plaintiffs.\u201d The number of coronavirus cases in the US has surpassed 820,000. The US has confirmed 823,786 cases of the virus, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Nearly 45,000 Americans have died of the virus. New York governor Andrew Cuomo met with Trump at the White House. The meeting came as the Democratic governor has repeatedly called on the federal government to play a more active role in helping states expand testing capacity. During the coronavirus briefing, Donald Trump singled out Harvard University as one of the institutions that the government would ask to return funds recieved as part of the Small Business Administration\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program. \u201cHarvard\u2019s going to pay back the money,\u201d Trump said, adding that the university \u201cshouldn\u2019t have taken it.\u201d But Harvard clarified that it has not received any funds through the program. Rather, the has received funds through the CARES Act Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund. Harvard, which has received nearly $9m in funding under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act per Forbes, has been criticized for accepting the money despite is a multibillion-dollar endowment. Republican lawmakers, including Harvard alumnus Ted Cruz, called on the university to return the funds. \u201cDear Harvard: Thank you for my law degree and an excellent legal education. You\u2019re very rich; many people are hurting. Now give the money back,\u201d Cruz wrote on Twitter. Harvard announced that it will allocate 100% of the CARES Act funding toward student financial assistance. The law requires educational institutions to direct at least 50% of the relief funds to financial assistance grants to students. More on the nearly $500bn coronavirus aid package that Congress passed: The aid package is the second for small business, which have been hit hard by the pandemic and shed millions of jobs. The first proved controversial, with big businesses including Shake Shack and Ruth\u2019s Chris Steakhouse receiving millions while many small businesses missed out. Shake Shack has now handed back the $10m loan it received. Ruth\u2019s Chris \u2013 which had revenues of $468m last year \u2013 received $20m. Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said that larger firms would now be blocked from using the new program. Small businesses in hard-hit New York were skeptical that the new money would get to them in time, having missed out on the first wave of payments. \u201cThis is going to be the end of us all,\u201d said Brian Colgan, who runs ACME, a props and furniture rental business in Brooklyn. He said none of his small business contacts had received funds. Could Trump delay the presidential election? The Guardian\u2019s Adam Gabbatt explains: The briefing has wrapped up. Stay tuned for more news and analysis. Fact check: Testing \u201cWe\u2019ve tested more than any country in the world, even put together,\u201d Trump said. This is false. Overall, the US had administered more than 4.5m coronavirus tests, according to the Covid Tracking Project. From a very slow start, the US, with a population of 329m, had ramped up to a testing rate of one in every 80 people \u2014 a bit better than to South Korea\u2019s rate of 1 in every 90 people. Germany has done even better, testing every 1 in 63 people. In America, despite the recent increase in testing, backlogs are reported in labs across the country, and many people with symptoms \u2014 including health workers \u2014 are still struggling to access tests. Fact checks: A couple of quick ones Trump once again touted the southern border wall, claiming that 27,000 Mexican soldiers are \u201con our border.\u201d We\u2019ve corrected this claim before \u2014 Mexico\u2019s president Andre Lopez Obredor has deployed 27,000 troops in total, but only about 15,000 to the US-Mexico border. Trump once again implied that the Spanish influenza deaths took place in 1917. The disease spread worldwide in 1918 and 1919 according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The president said he doesn\u2019t know the status of Kim Jon Un\u2019s health, amid unconfirmed reports that the North Korean leader is seriously ill. \u201cI\u2019ve had a very good relationship with him,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI can only say I wish him well.\u201d The president was asked about a study that linked hydroxychloroquine \u2014 an anti-malarial drug that the president has repeatedly touted \u2014 to higher death rates for Veterans Affairs patients hospitalized with. Covid-19, Trump said he\u2019s \u201cwilling to take a look\u201d at the evidence. The president\u2019s executive order on immigration is \u201cbeing written right now\u201d Trump said \u2014 he has not provided too much detail on how the policy would work. Here\u2019s what he\u2019s said: A pause on immigration would last 60 days It wouldn\u2019t affect temporary visas More details are forthcoming \u201cThere will be some people coming in... but it\u2019s a strong order,\u201d Trump said. Cases in big cities including Boston, Houston, Philadelphia, Chicago, Atlanta, Baltimore, Detroit, and St. Louis, appear to be mounting more slowly, Dr. Deborah Birx said. These areas \u201cappear to be flattening,\u201d she said. Even so, Americans need to continue adhering to social distancing guidelines and hyginege guidlines, so they don\u2019t spread the disease to elderly people and other vulnerable communities. The federal government will along with New York to help the state secure additional tests, Trump said \u2014 addressing his phone call with the state\u2019s governor Andrew Cuomo. New York state and New York City \u201chave been terrific to work with,\u201d Trump said \u2014 despite his many clashes with Cuomo and Mayor Bill DeBlasio of New York City. The order will only apply to people seeking a green card \u2014 not those who enter on a temporary basis, the president said. Such a policy would \u201cpreserve vital resources for American citizens,\u201d he said. But critics have said that Trump is scapegoating immigrants, and using the coronavirus pandemic to push long-held anti-immigration policies. Fact check: Mortality Rate \u201cOur mortality rate remains roughly half\u201d that of other countries, Trump said, adding that the rate was \u201cone of the lowest in any other country in the world.\u201d The president is half-right \u2014 the US does indeed appear to have a lower case fatality rate than several countries, including Italy, Belgium and the UK, according to the Johns Hopkins tracker. The case fatality rate refers to the number of deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases. Johns Hopkins has calculated that figure for about 130 countries. but the US\u2019s rate is far from the \u201clowest\u201d of any country. The US rate is 5.4% \u2014 more double the rate of Japan and South Korea (2.2%), and several times the rate of Singapore, with a rate. of .1%. A small wrap here on the meeting this afternoon between the president and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo in the Oval Office, per Cuomo. He said, in a quick call to MSNBC afterward, that he had a \u201cfunctional and effective\u201d conversation with Trump and tried to keep the focus on testing and state budget problems, Reuters reports. \u201cWe have a tremendous job that we have to get done and put everything else aside and do the job, and the tone of the conversation was very functional and effective,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cI stayed focused on what we were there to talk about and for me the substantive agenda was testing - \u2018Who does what? How do we get it up the scale?\u2019 - and somebody has to stand up for funding for the states.\u201d Cuomo, a Democrat who has clashed with Trump during the coronavirus outbreak, did not discuss details of their talk, but described the meeting as \u201chonest and open.\u201d \u201cThe president is communicative about his feelings and I\u2019m communicative about what I think,\u201d he said. With social distancing and lockdowns showing some positive results, Cuomo said on Monday he could begin to consider how to reopen a state that ranges from New York City, with more than 8 million people, to farm country and sparsely populated towns upstate. The White House did not immediately provide an account of the meeting. Cuomo said he sought a face-to-face conversation with the Republican president to hash out issues around the need for more testing capability. \u201cWe have to get this ironed out. This is a very big issue,\u201d Cuomo said. He said testing volume needed to increase tenfold and leaders needed to discuss how the federal government can help and what the states can do to make enough tests available. \u201cThat is the issue for the country right now I think,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cIt\u2019s a benchmark - \u2018Where are we? Are we on the increase, are we on the plateau or are we on the descent?\u2019\u201d The relief is for small businesses, Mnuchin said. \u201cI was relieved to see that Shake Shack returned the money,\u201d he said \u2014 referring to the fast-food chain\u2019s decision to return the $10m government loan meant for struggling companies. \u201cThe intent of this was not for big public companies,\u201d he said \u2014 adding that the government will put out an FAQ to clarify who should take advantage of the government funds. Trump added that the government will ask bigger institutions to return relief funds. \u201cHarvard\u2019s going to pay back the money,\u201d Trump said. The university with a multi-billion dollar endowment, \u201cshouldn\u2019t have taken it.\u201d Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, thanked Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer for their work on the latest coronavirus relief bill. There is \u201cunprecedented of money for testing\u201d in the bill, he said The new legislation allocates another $310bn for the payroll protection program for small businesses, and $50bn in disaster loans for small businesses. Stay tuned for live coverage and fact checks. Trump has said he will sign the legislation pending in Congress to bail out the small business loan program that\u2019s been overrun by demand but small business isn\u2019t holding its breath. The last round ended up in the pockets of \u201csmall businesses\u201d including Potbelly, the international sandwich chain, Ruth\u2019s Chris Steakhouse and Shake Shack - which has given its $10m back. In the meantime real small businesses, especially in hard-hit New York, are suffering. Nichelina Mavros, co-owner of Depanneur, a grocery and deli in New York, said: \u201cNinety eight per cent of New York businesses are small businesses. In my network not one of them got the money.\u201d She wasn\u2019t alone, you can read more here. Hi there, it\u2019s Maanvi Singh \u2014 blogging from the West Coast. New York no longer needs the USS Comfort, a Navy hospital ship deployed to help relieve hospitals overwhelmed with coronavirus patients, the state\u2019s governor Andrew Cuomo said on MSNBC. \u201cWe don\u2019t really need the Comfort anymore,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cIt did give us comfort, but we don\u2019t need it anymore.\u201d The ship can be redeployed where it\u2019s needed most, he added. The governor has been frequently at odds with the president. Donald Trump has challenged Cuomo\u2019s dire requests for key medical equipment including ventilators. As the infection and hospitalization rates slowed, the president has derided governors for requesting more supplies than initial, worst-case predictions from scientists would have suggested. Cuomo, who called into MSNBC after a meeting with Trump, said that \u201cfor the president and myself, this is not about anyone\u2019s emotion about anyone else. I mean, who cares what I feel, what he feels.\u201d The president is willing to include money for states in the next round of economic relief legislation, Cuomo reported, adding that he was the one who suggested a face-to-face meeting in DC to further discuss efforts to ramp up testing. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The Senate passed a nearly $500 billion coronavirus relief bill by unainmous consent. The bill, which provides funding for small businesses, hospitals and testing, will now advance to the House. Trump has said he will sign the bill, but Republican congressman Thomas Massie has threatened to object to the bill, which could force House members to return to Washington to pass it. Attorney general William Barr said the justice department may eventually join lawsuits against stay-at-home orders. \u201cWe\u2019re looking carefully at a number of these rules that are being put into place,\u201d Barr said. \u201cAnd if we think one goes too far, we initially try to jawbone the governors into rolling them back or adjusting them. And if they\u2019re not and people bring lawsuits, we file statement of interest and side with the plaintiffs.\u201d The number of coronavirus cases in the US has surpassed 800,000. The US has confirmed 816,240 cases of the virus, and the number of coronavirus cases worldwide has now reached 2,546,527. Nearly 44,000 Americans have died of the virus. New York governor Andrew Cuomo met with Trump at the White House. The meeting came as the Democratic governor has repeatedly called on the federal government to play a more active role in helping states expand testing capacity. Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. The Senate has passed the nearly $500 billion coronavirus relief bill, which will allocate $320 billion to the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses and provide $100 billion for hospitals and testing. The bill will now advance to the House, which will also attempt to pass the proposal by unanimous consent, and Trump has said he will sign the bill. However, Republican congressman Thomas Massie has threatened to raise an objection to the unanimous consent proposal, which would force House members to return to Washington to pass the bill. Two Republican senators, Mike Lee and Rand Paul, raised concerns today about approving the bill by unanimous consent, but they ultimately decided against forcing a recorded vote on the legislation. Republican senator Rand Paul emphasized that some parts of the country with fewer coronavirus cases will be able to reopen more quickly than other, more hard-hit regions. \u201cWe need to get past a one-size-fits-all approach to infectious disease,\u201d Paul said. The Republican senator said he had concerns about both the amount of funding in the relief bill and the plan to pass it by unanimous consent. But Paul said he ultimately decided not to invoke the Senate rules to require a recorded vote on the bill, which would have forced members to return to Washington. Paul said he chose to deliver his floor speech today so that history would record how \u201cnot everyone gave in\u201d to the \u201cmassive accumulation of debt\u201d facing the country. Republican senator Rand Paul has taken the Senate floor to argue that \u201cno amount of money\u201d can save the country from the coronavirus crisis. \u201cOur only hope of rescuing this country is re-opening the economy,\u201d Paul said. The Kentucky Republican acknowledged the virus still poses many risks, but he said lawmakers needed to \u201cput those risks in perspective\u201d when it came to considering whether to reopen the economy. \u201cToday I rise in opposition to spending $500 billion more,\u201d Paul said. Republican senator Mike Lee criticized the Senate\u2019s efforts to pass a nearly $500 billion by unanimous consent, as many members remain away from Washington due to social distancing guidelines. \u201cWe cannot do the job for which we were elected without actually being here,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to return to Washington and get to work.\u201d Lee noted the Senate is not currently scheduled to reconvene until May 4. \u201cWhen we come back on May the 4th ... I hope the Force will be with us,\u201d Lee said, throwing in a \u201cStar Wars\u201d reference at the end of his floor speech. Senator Mike Lee has now taken the floor, and the Utah Republican said he spoke with a \u201cheavy heart\u201d as he considered the trials of his constituents amid the current crisis. Lee referenced the hard work being done by medical professionals, other frontline workers and parents right now. \u201cAnd yet Congress is in recess,\u201d Lee said, calling lawmakers\u2019 absence from Washington due to social distancing guidelines \u201csimply unacceptable.\u201d \u201cIf Covid-19 requires Congress to act, then it requires Congress to convene,\u201d Lee said. If Lee or any other senator raises an objection to passing the relief bill by unanimous consent, then members will be required to return to Washington to approve the proposal. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said the country needed to \u201cdramatically\u201d ramp up its coronavirus testing, which this relief bill would help to do. \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough tests,\u201d Schumer said, promising Americans that \u201chelp is on the way.\u201d The relief bill under consideration allocates $25 billion to expand testing capacity. But Schumer said Democrats were \u201csorely disappointed\u201d that Republicans had refused to meet their other demands, including more funding for state and local governments. The Democratic leader promised to continue working toward those goals with the next coronavirus relief bill. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer accused majority leader Mitch McConnell of having \u201ctried to bypass negotiations\u201d with this coronavirus relief bill. McConnell originally proposed a $250 billion bill that would have allocated additional funds for the small business loan program known as the Paycheck Protection Program, but Democrats pushed for more money for hospitals and state and local governments as well. The final bill under consideration now includes $100 billion for hospitals and testing, but state and local governments were not given additional funding under the legislation. Rand Paul\u2019s office said the Republican senator will soon speak on the Senate floor \u201cregarding the importance of fiscal responsibility.\u201d Because the Senate is trying to pass the bill by unanimous consent, a single member can temporarily derail its approval by demanding a full vote, which would force senators to return to Washington. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said the nearly $500 billion bill will \u201cpotentially\u201d pass in the next few minutes. Speaking on the Senate floor, McConnell said, \u201cNow let\u2019s just get this done.\u201d The Senate will soon gavel in its pro forma session, where the next coronavirus relief bill is expected to pass by unanimous consent. House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer have just released a statement boasting about how the bill includes $100 billion for hospitals and testing, unlike Republicans\u2019 initial proposal. \u201cCongressional Democrats are proud to have secured an agreement on an interim emergency funding package that has been transformed to provide real support for the lives and livelihoods of the American people,\u201d the Democratic leaders\u2019 statement read. \u201cDemocrats flipped this emergency package from an insufficient Republican plan that left behind hospitals and health and frontline workers and did nothing to aid the survival of the most vulnerable small businesses on Main Street.\u201d New York City mayor Bill de Blasio said earlier today that \u201cthe first thing\u201d his city will do when Covid-19 is beaten will be to stage a ticker-tape parade down the Canyon of Heroes at the bottom of Broadway \u2013 just below the Guardian office, as it happens \u2013 to honour the first responders and healthcare workers who have battled against the virus. \u201cThe day is coming where we will overcome this disease,\u201d de Blasio said. \u201cWhen that day comes that we can restart the vibrant, beautiful life of this city, the first thing we will do is have a ticker-tape parade. We will honor those who saved us.\u201d It would, one supposes, be one way to spend precious resources in a city stretched to the limit by the outbreak and where more than 14,600 people have died. But not necessarily the most popular way. All non-essential events in New York City are currently cancelled through June, by order of de Blasio himself, so if a parade does happen, it won\u2019t be soon. The news does provide an excuse, however, to include a picture of the last such ticker-tape parade, which was held for the US women\u2019s football team last year, after they won the World Cup. De Blasio attended: Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell urged fellow senators to support the interim coronavirus relief bill, which was just released and is expected to pass by unanimous consent this afternoon. \u201cI welcome this bipartisan agreement and hope the Senate will quickly pass it once members have reviewed the final text,\u201d the Kentucky Republican said in a statement. In some typical political posturing, McConnell blamed Democrats for delaying the bill\u2019s passage by pushing for more funding for hospitals and state and local governments. \u201cI am just sorry that it took my colleagues in Democratic leadership 12 days to accept the inevitable, and that they shut down emergency support for Main Street in a search for partisan \u2018leverage\u2019 that never materialized,\u201d McConnell said in his statement. But that is not exactly accurate. The original bill that McConnell proposed would have allocated $250 billion in funding to the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses, but the final bill includes nearly twice as much funding, including $75 billion for hospitals and $25 billion for testing. Although Demoocrats could not get funding for state and local governments included in this bill, much to governors\u2019 chagrin, they were able to achieve some of their policy objectives by securing more money for hospitals and testing. The Trump International Hotel in Washington is reportedly seeking rent relief from the federal government as the property suffers financially due to the pandemic. The New York Times reports: In recent weeks, the president\u2019s family business has inquired about changing its lease payments, the company confirmed on Tuesday, which the federal government has reported amount to nearly $268,000 per month. The Trump Organization owns and operates the luxury hotel, but it is in a federally owned building on Pennsylvania Avenue. As part of its deal to open the 263-room hotel, the company signed a 60-year lease in 2013 that requires the monthly payments to the General Services Administration. The Trump Organization is current on its rent, according to Eric Trump, the president\u2019s son, but he confirmed that the company had opened a conversation about possible delays in future monthly payments. The younger Mr. Trump said the company was asking the G.S.A. for any relief that it might be granting other federal tenants. The president still owns the company, but his eldest sons run the day-to-day operations. \u2018Just treat us the same,\u2019 Eric Trump said in a statement on Tuesday. \u2018Whatever that may be is fine.\u2019 Like many other US companies in the hospitality industry, the Trump organization has suffered financial losses and been forced to lay off workers as many hotels across the country remain largely empty. Unlike those other companies, the Trump organization is specifically barred from receiving coronavirus relief funding from the government. According to the text of the $2 trillion stimulus package, businesses owned by the president or the vice president may not receive loans or investments from the treasury department. The US has now confirmed 800,000 cases of coronavirus, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The US has confirmed 804,194 cases, more than any other country in the world. Spain, which has confirmed the second-highest number of cases, has about a quarter of the US total, with 204,178 cases. The global number of confirmed coronavirus cases has also continued to climb and currently stands at 2,531,804. The US has recorded 43,200 deaths from the virus, accounting for about 1 in every 4 coronavirus deaths reported from around the world. The Senate and the White House have finalized the next coronavirus relief bill, which allocates nearly $500 billion in funding for small business loans, hospitals and testing. The largest portion of the funds, more than $320 billion, will go to the small business loan program known as the Paycheck Protection Program. Another $60 billion will go to the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, which was first created to help small businesses deal with natural disasters like hurricanes. Like PPP, the program has run out of money due to a flood of applications amid the current crisis. The bill also allocates $75 billion for hospitals and $25 billion for coronavirus testing, which Democrats had lobbied for. But Democratic lawmakers failed to secure more funding for state and local governments in this bill, despite pleas from governors. The Senate is expected to approve the bill by unanimous consent at 4 pm ET, and Trump has already said he would sign the bill. However, it\u2019s still possible the House will be forced to take a formal vote on the bill if Republican congressman Thomas Massie raises an objection to it, as he has previously threatened to do. That move would force House members to return to Washington to get the bill passed. Nearly half of Americans now say they or someone in their household has lost a job or income due to the coronavirus pandemic. According to a newly released poll from the Pew Research Center, 43% of Americans say their household has suffered a job loss or a cut in pay since the start of the coronavirus crisis, marking a 10-point increase from a month ago. A majority of low-income adults (52%) say their household has been directly impacted, and only 23% of low-income respondents said they had rainy day funds set aside. Latinx Americans are particularly hard hit, with 61% of them saying their households have suffered financial losses because of the crisis, in comparison to 44% of black adults and 38% of whites. Attorney general William Barr raised the possibility that the justice department may eventually join lawsuits against stay-at-home orders if states repeatedly extend them. \u201cWe have to give businesses more freedom to operate in a way that\u2019s reasonably safe,\u201d Barr said on The Hugh Hewitt Show today. \u201cTo the extent that governors don\u2019t and impinge on either civil rights or on the national commerce \u2013 our common market that we have here \u2013 then we\u2019ll have to address that.\u201d Barr went on to add, \u201cWe\u2019re looking carefully at a number of these rules that are being put into place ... And if we think one goes too far, we initially try to jawbone the governors into rolling them back or adjusting them. And if they\u2019re not and people bring lawsuits, we file statement of interest and side with the plaintiffs.\u201d Barr\u2019s comments come days after Trump called on states under stay-at home orders \u2013 specifically Michigan, Minnesota and Virginia \u2013 to be liberated, echoing messaging from right-wing protesters. The Trump campaign has released a statement on the president\u2019s planned executive order banning immigration, even though no one appears to have seen the executive order yet. \u201cPreventing further entrance of people potentially infected with the virus is an additional safety measure for the country,\u201d Tim Murtaugh, the communications director of the Trump campaign, said in a statement. \u201cThe usual suspects are sniping from the sidelines, but they have always cared more about scoring political points against the President than they do about anything else.\u201d The White House also released a statement praising the planned order, but there are very few details on what the exact wording of the order would be or what impact (if any) it would have considering most visa processing has already been halted because of the pandemic. The executive order may be the White House\u2019s attempt to shift focus away from widespread criticism of Trump\u2019s handling of the crisis overall. A new poll released today showed 54% of Americans give Trump a negative review on how he has handled the pandemic so far. Trump has sent a tweet urging members of the Senate and the House to pass the next coronavirus relief bill, which is expected to include money for the small business loan program known as the Paycheck Protection Program, as well as funding for hospitals and testing. The president said after he signed this interim relief bill, discussions would turn toward securing more money for state and local governments, as well as funding infrastructure projects and exploring possible payroll taxes. The National Governors Association has said states need $500 billion to address the current crisis, and state leaders, including New York governor Andrew Cuomo, have criticized Congress for not including state funding in this relief bill. \u201cI think it\u2019s a terrible mistake not to provide funding for the states,\u201d Cuomo said at his briefing today. Nurses protested outside the White House this morning at shortages of personal protective equipment as they continue to confront the rising number of coronavirus cases and deaths in the US. The latest figures are almost 790,000 confirmed cases in the US and more than 42,000 deaths so far. Protests against social, educational and business norms are planned today in North Carolina. As happened in Colorado over the weekend, some health care workers stood in protest against the protest in NC today. The administration\u2019s top public health and infectious disease expert, Anthony Fauci, has warned against a rush to reopen states for anything like normal life. This: And this. The editorial from the Charlotte Observer, NC, headlined \u201cStay home, ReOpenNC protesters\u201d. Donald Trump\u2019s private Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, is temporarily laying off 153 workers because of the new coronavirus, according to a notice posted this week to a state website. The club\u2019s director of human resources, Janine Gill, wrote in a letter to state and local officials that Mar-a-Lago began halting business last month as a result of mandated closures issued in Palm Beach County in response to the virus\u2019s spread in South Florida, The Associated Press writes. The furloughs are temporary but the club doesn\u2019t know when it will resume regular operations, Gill said. None of the workers are unionized. It isn\u2019t the only Trump resort in Florida to furlough workers. The Trump National Doral Miami resort where Trump initially wanted to host this year\u2019s Group of Seven (G7) summit also has temporarily laid off 560 workers. The furloughed workers at Mar-a-Lago include bartenders, cooks, dishwashers, drivers, attendants, housekeepers, servers and valet attendants. Mar-a-Lago serves as Trump\u2019s refuge from Washington, and the president often spends his time there mixing work, business and pleasure in the company of dues-paying members. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Andrew Cuomo said his White House meeting with Trump today would focus on testing. The New York governor promised to \u201ctell the truth\u201d about the role the federal government must play in addressing the current crisis, especially now that states need to substantially expand testing capacity. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer predicted the chamber would approve the next coronavirus relief bill today. The bill is expected to include $350 billion for the small business loan program known as the Paycheck Protection Program, $75 billion for hospitals and $25 billion for testing. Trump signaled interest in a potential bailout for the oil and gas industry amid dropping oil prices. But the president provided no details on the proposal, which would almost certainly require approval from Congress, where it would face heavy resistence in the Democratic-controlled House. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the country would start reopening its economy on May 4, but he warned the reopening process would be slow and cautious to avoid a surge in coronavirus cases. Italy has enacted some of the strictest lockdown orders in the world to prevent further spread of coronavirus. The country has already recorded more than 24,000 deaths from the virus, second only to the United States. \u201cI wish I could say: let\u2019s reopen everything. Immediately. We start tomorrow morning ... But such a decision would be irresponsible,\u201d Conte wrote in a Facebook post. The prime minister did not specify which businesses would be allowed to reopen first, but he noted the reopening plan would require a \u201crethinking of modes of transport\u201d to allow people to safely commute. For more updates from around the world, follow the Guardian\u2019s global coronavirus blog: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told Trump he is \u201cfeeling better and on the road to recovery\u201d after being diagnosed with coronavirus, according to a White House readout from a call between the two leaders. The White House said Johnson and Trump spoke over the phone today about confronting the pandemic and crafting a possible US-UK trade deal. \u201cPresident Trump and Prime Minister Johnson reaffirmed their close cooperation through the G7 and G20 to reopen global economies and ensure medical care and supplies reach all those in need,\u201d the readout said. Johnson is also expected to speak to the Queen this week, even though No 10 has insisted the prime minister is not doing any government work as he continues to recover from coronavirus at Chequers. Joe Biden accused Mike Pence of using Wisconsin as \u201cthe backdrop to a political photo opportunity,\u201d as the vice president visits a GE facility in Madison that is helping to make ventilators. \u201cThe Trump Administration is currently responsible for one of the most significant failures of governance of any administration in modern history,\u201d the presumptive Democratic nominee said in a fiery statement. Biden noted Pence\u2019s visit \u201ccomes as the state is suffering a devastating loss of life to COVID-19, particularly in the African American community, hundreds of thousands of Wisconsin workers have filed for unemployment in recent weeks, and Republicans drive dangerous efforts to prematurely end social distancing efforts.\u201d Biden\u2019s statement concludes, \u201cThe Trump Administration is hoping that Wisconsinites have a short memory.\u201d Wisconsin is seen as a key swing state in the 2020 presidential election, considering Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the state by less than 1 point in 2016. New York governor Andrew Cuomo just wrapped up his daily briefing on the state\u2019s response to coronavirus. Here\u2019s some of what he covered: Cuomo said his White House meeting with Trump today would focus on testing. Cuomo said he agreed with the president that states should take charge on expanding testing capacity, but he emphasized the federal government still needed to be involved to navigate supply-chain issues. \u201cI think in many ways, we\u2019re talking past each other,\u201d Cuomo said. Cuomo applauded Maryland governor Larry Hogan for obtaining 500,000 tests from South Korea. But Cuomo added he did not think it was realistic for the federal government to expect every state to negotiate with foreign governments over needed medical supplies. \u201cIt\u2019s not what states are normally responsible for,\u201d Cuomo said. Some hospitals in New York will be allowed to resume elective outpatient treatments. Regions of the state where the risk of a coronavirus surge is low may resume the treatments, Cuomo said, noting various parts of the state will be impacted differently by the virus. But the governor\u2019s announcement raised questions about how a regional approach would affect New York\u2019s statewide stay-at-home order. Another 481 New Yorkers died of coronavirus yesterday, meaning Monday\u2019s daily death toll was flat from Sunday. \u201cWe have paid a tremendous price to control this beast,\u201d Cuomo said. New York governor Andrew Cuomo criticized local leaders pushing to quickly reopen the state in response to political pressure surrounding the stay-at-home order. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to take the political heat, you shouldn\u2019t be in the political kitchen, which is called being an elected official in the state of New York,\u201d Cuomo said. As he was leaving the brieing, Cuomo also criticized Congress for not including state funding in the next coronavirus relief bill. The National Governors Association has said states need $500 billion to address the current crisis. \u201cI think it\u2019s a terrible mistake not to provide funding for the states,\u201d Cuomo said as he departed the briefing to begin his travel to Washington. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said he would not shy away from the truth when he meets with Trump at the White House later today. \u201cLife is a fine line,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cBeing in government is a fine line ... I tell you how I negotiate the fine line: you tell the truth.\u201d On the subject of testing, Cuomo said he agreed with Trump that expanding capacity should be mostly left up to the states, but he added the federal government stil needed to be involved. \u201cI think in many ways, we\u2019re talking past each other,\u201d Cuomo said. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said his White House meeting today with Trump would focus on testing and the role the federal government can play in expanding capacity. Cuomo said he understood why Trump wanted to be left out of the \u201cblame game\u201d surrounding testing insufficiencies, but he emphasized the federal government had a vital role to play in expanding testing. \u201cI get the instinct to distance yourself from it, but it is a situation where you need everyone to work together,\u201d Cuomo said. He once again applauded Maryland governor Larry Hogan for obtaining 500,000 tests from South Korea, but Cuomo argued it was unrealistic to expect every state to do that. New York governor Andrew Cuomo addressed Maryland governor Larry Hogan\u2019s announcement that the state had obtained 500,000 coronavirus tests from South Korea. Cuomo applauded Hogan for thinking \u201coutside the box\u201d and getting \u201cvery creative\u201d to help his state, but the governor said the federal government should help states manage those kinds of negotiations to expand testing capacity. \u201cIt\u2019s not what states are normally responsible for,\u201d Cuomo said. The governor added the federal government should step in to help manage those overseas supply chains. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said elective outpatient treatments could resume at some hospitals that do not face a high risk of a coronavirus surge. The Democratic governor has been emphasizing today that various parts of the state will be impacted differently by the virus and will hit their peak number of cases at different points. New York governor Andrew Cuomo announced 481 New Yorkers died of coronavirus yesterday, as the daily death toll remained flat from Sunday. \u201cWe have paid a tremendous price to control this beast,\u201d Cuomo said of New York\u2019s death toll, which is higher than that of any other US state. In some promising news, the number of new coronavirus hospitalizations yesterday fell to 1,300, although the overall number of hospitalizations remained unchanged. The number of intubations has also been on a consistent decline in recent days. New York governor Andrew Cuomo is holding his daily briefing on the state\u2019s response to coronavirus in Buffalo, as the city\u2019s home county sees a high level of hospitalizations. Cuomo said much of the state\u2019s coronavirus response so far has focused on downstate New York, particularly New York City, which has seen more than 13,000 deaths from the virus. But Cuomo emphasized the virus \u201cpresents a different problem in different parts of the state,\u201d and various regions are hitting their peak number of cases at different points. Overall, 125 people have died of coronavirus in Buffalo\u2019s Erie County so far. Former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams criticized the state\u2019s Republican governor, Brian Kemp, for allowing a number of businesses to reopen starting Friday. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing about this that makes sense,\u201d Abrams told MSNBC this morning. \u201cThe mayors of Atlanta, Albany and Savannah have all questioned the wisdom of doing this. And the fact is the governor didn\u2019t consult with mayors before making this decision.\u201d The former Democratic legislator warned the move could endanger the employees of businesses looking to reopen later this week. \u201cThe responsibility of a business owner is to first protect your workers,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cThat cannot happen when you have a nail salon, when there\u2019s no possible way for that technician to be distant from their customer, when you are running a restaurant that requires face-to-face service.\u201d Abrams similarly criticized Kemp\u2019s decision in a tweet yesterday after he announced his plan, calling the move \u201cdangerously incompetent.\u201d Abrams also addressed the rampant speculation about whether presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden might select her as his running mate for the November election. \u201cAll I can say is that if asked to serve, I\u2019d be honored,\u201d Abrams said. The White House released a statement on Trump\u2019s tweet about plans to ban all immigration amid the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cPresident Trump is committed to protecting the health and economic well-being of American citizens as we face unprecedented times,\u201d said newly installed White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany. \u201cAs President Trump has said, \u2018Decades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for African-American and Latino workers.\u2019 At a time when Americans are looking to get back to work, action is necessary.\u201d Economists disagree on whether immigration actually depresses wages, with some saying it affects certain groups of workers and others saying it has a very minor (if any) effect. And as the Wall Street Journal has noted, Trump\u2019s proposal to ban all immigration amid the pandemic would have very little impact considering most visa processing has already been halted as a result of the crisis. The Guardian\u2019s Sam Levine reports: At least 7 Milwaukee residents so far have contracted Covid-19 as a result of \u201celection-related\u201d activities, the city\u2019s health commissioner said Monday. Six of the people were voters and one was a poll worker, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. Jeanette Kowalik, the Milwaukee health commissioner, said in an email the city only had 30% of the data from April 7, the date of the election, onward, and hoped to have more information by the end of the week. State health officials said Monday they have not seen evidence linking Covid-19 cases related to the election, according to the Journal Sentinel. Wisconsin Republicans faced heavy criticism for refusing to call off in-person voting for the state\u2019s April 7 election. Many saw that effort as a political calculation -- fewer people would turn out because of the virus, which would benefit a Republican-backed candidate for the state supreme court. That calculation ultimately proved to be incorrect. Daniel Kelly, the Republican-backed candidate, wound up losing his seat on the supreme court to Jill Karofsky, a liberal challenger. Wisconsin officials say 4,499 people have tested positive for Covid-19 in the state so far, and 230 have died because of the virus. Nearly 60% of those deaths have been in Milwaukee, which has accounted for nearly half of the cases in the state. As is often the case, the president provided few details on his latest idea, a potential bailout of the oil and gas industry as oil prices continue to drop. But Trump\u2019s proposal would almost certainly need congressional approval, which would be difficult to secure considering the House is controlled by Democrats. The administration could try to get funding for oil and gas companies included in a follow-up coronavirus relief bill, but that would almost certainly be a deal-breaker for the many congressional Democrats who have called for stricter regulation of the fossil fuel industry to help address climate change. Trump indicated he may push for a bailout of the oil and gas indusrry as oil prices continued their record-breaking slide for a second day. \u201cWe will never let the great U.S. Oil &amp; Gas Industry down,\u201d the president wrote in a tweet. \u201cI have instructed the Secretary of Energy and Secretary of the Treasury to formulate a plan which will make funds available so that these very important companies and jobs will be secured long into the future!\u201d The benchmark price for US oil fell into negative territory for the first time on record yesterday, as demand for oil has plummeted amid the coronavirus pandemic. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said he believed the chamber would be able to approve the next coronavirus relief bill later today. \u201cI think we will be able to pass this today,\u201d Schumer told CNN. \u201cThere are still a few more i\u2019s to dot and t\u2019s to cross, but we have a deal.\u201d The bill is expected to include $350 billion for the small business loan program known as the Paycheck Protection Program, which ran out of money last week, as well as $75 billion for hospitals and $25 billion for testing. Schumer said he, House speaker Nancy Pelosi, treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows had addressed all their outstanding questions about the legislation. \u201cEevery major issue was resolved by the four of us last night, and I know that Mnuchin and Meadows were in good touch with Leader McConnell and the president,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cI believe we will pass it this afternoon at 4 pm.\u201d At least 75 publicly traded companies received loans from the small business loan program established by the stimulus package, known as the Paycheck Protection Program, according to an AP investigation. The AP reports: The Paycheck Protection Program was supposed to infuse small businesses, which typically have less access to quick cash and credit, with $349 billion in emergency loans that could help keep workers on the job and bills paid on time. But at least 75 companies that received the aid were publicly traded, the AP found, and some had market values well over $100 million. And 25% of the companies had warned investors months ago \u2014 while the economy was humming along \u2014 that their ability to remain viable was in question. By combing through thousands of regulatory filings, the AP identified the 75 companies as recipients of a combined $300 million in low-interest, taxpayer-backed loans. Eight companies, or their subsidiaries, received the maximum $10 million possible, including a California software company that settled a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation late last year into accounting errors that overstated its revenue. The burger chain Shake Shack announced yesterday that it would return the $10 million loan it received from the program, amid criticism about larger businesses taking government funding as PPP has run out of money. Congressional Democratic leadership and the White House are currently trying to strike a deal on providing PPP and hospitals with more funds through another coronavirus relief bill, but it\u2019s unclear whether an agreement has been reached. This is Joan Greve in Washington, taking over for Martin Pengelly. A new poll shows a majority of Americans give Trump a negative review when it comes to his handling of the current crisis, and an even larger portion of the country does not expect the country to reopen until the summer. The Washington Post/University of Maryland poll found that 54% of Americans have a negative opinion on Trump\u2019s handling of the crisis, while 72% say the nation\u2019s governments have managed their states well amid the pandemic. In another example of how everything is now political, the question of when Americans expect social distancing guidelines to be relaxed splits along partisan lines. Overall, 65% of Americans say they do not expect gatherings of 10 people or more to be safe until June or later. That number includes 77% of Democrats and 51% of Republicans. Just 10% of Americans say they expect the guidelines to be relaxed by the end of April or earlier, despite recent protests against stay-at-home orders in states like Michigan and Minnesota. However, the most alarming divide in the poll may not be political but racial. About one in three Americans are concerned about paying their bills and affording basic necessities over next month, but that number includes 48% of Hispanics and 39% of blacks, in comparison to 23% of whites. A Georgia mayor has criticized the governor\u2019s decision to re-open the state this week as \u201creckless, premature and dangerous\u201d. Governor Brian Kemp, a Republican, said businesses including bowling alleys, tattoo studios and hair salons would reopen this week. The Democratic mayor of Savannah, Van Johnson, said Kemp\u2019s decision was \u201cnot based in any type of science or best practices\u201d. \u201cPeople can see it for themselves. We want them to keep the faith, but we want them to follow the science,\u201d Johnson told CNN. \u201cThis is still a dangerous time. This is not the time for people to take their feet off the gas.\u201d There were more than 5,700 Covid-19 cases detected in Georgia last week, a 6% decrease from the week before, but still more than the number of cases in early April. Mayors across the state have said the governor did not consult them before announcing the staggered reopening on Monday. Johnson said Covid-19 cases in Savannah were still increasing and testing had not expanded enough to justify an end to stay-at-home orders. \u201cSo this just blows our minds that here in Georgia that we would have these types of rules being lifted in a time when people are still suffering,\u201d Johnson said. The mayor of the state\u2019s biggest city, Atlanta, said she was also concerned. \u201cWe see our numbers are continuing to tick up in this state, we see that our deaths are rising,\u201d said Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, also a Democrat. \u201cWe have some of the highest asthma rates in the country right here in Atlanta.\u201d I can\u2019t really justify making this a key event, so I\u2019ll write a headline here: Brady in a bunch of trouble with Parks and Recreation Bizarre if somehow amusing news from Tampa, where perhaps the greatest NFL quarterback of all time has been ejected from a public park which is closed to the public because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Associated Press reports: Six Super Bowl rings may get you special treatment in a lot of places but former New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady learned Monday that it won\u2019t get you anything when you\u2019re caught working out in a park that is closed to the public due to the coronavirus pandemic. Tampa mayor Jane Castor said the new Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback was spotted working out by himself at a park downtown by staff patrol. The staffer went over to tell him he had to leave and she recognized the man to be the 42-year-old Brady. \u201cHe\u2019s been sighted,\u201d Castor said. The City of Tampa tweeted: \u201cSorry @TomBrady! Our @tampaparksrec team can\u2019t wait to welcome you and our entire community back with even bigger smiles \u2013 until then, stay safe and stay home as much as you can to help flatten the curve.\u201c Brady recently moved his family into a mansion he\u2019s renting from former New York Yankees star Derek Jeter. The four-time Super Bowl MVP left the Patriots and signed a two-year, $50m contract with the Bucs in free agency, joining a team with the worst winning percentage in league history. Apropos of not very much, Donald Trump is a huge fan of Tom Brady. Here\u2019s Politico\u2019s report of a White House meeting with recovered Covid-19 patients last week, at which the quarterback\u2019s name came up a lot. The Wall Street Journal has some interesting context on Trump\u2019s tweeted promise to suspend all immigration to the US: The promised executive order isn\u2019t expected to substantially alter US policy, the paper writes, as \u201cthe administration has already all but ceased nearly every form of immigration. Most visa processing has been halted, meaning almost no one can apply for a visa to visit or move to the US. Visa interviews and citizenship ceremonies have been postponed and the refugee program paused.\u201d Furthermore, the Journal reports that the order \u201cis expected to include exceptions for migrant farmworkers, who make up about a 10th of the workforce on US farms, and healthcare workers, particularly those helping treat coronavirus patients \u2026 It is not expected to address the removal of immigrants already in the US or the visa renewal process.\u201d And another note: \u201cAs with past efforts by the president to curb immigration, the executive order will likely face legal challenges.\u201d So you might say a Trump executive order \u201cbanning all immigration\u201d, if signed, might in an election year be a mostly political exercise\u2026 Here\u2019s David Smith\u2019s report: The president is talking to the television again, and the television is talking back to him. Just another day in Donald Trump\u2019s America, in the middle of a pandemic which has killed more than 42,000 Americans. In the form of a not-quite Socratic dialogue, then: Donald Trump: \u201cWatched the first 5 minutes of poorly rated Morning Psycho on MSDNC* just to see if he is as \u2018nuts\u2019 as people are saying. He\u2019s worse. Such hatred and contempt! I used to do his show all the time before the 2016 election, then cut him off. Wasn\u2019t worth the effort, his mind is shot!\u201d (*Trump calls MSNBC \u201cMSDNC\u201d as a joke on the initials of the Democratic National Committee.) Joe Scarborough, host of MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe: \u201cDonald, thanks for being our most loyal viewer*. Now please get to work. Over 40,000 Americans have died from the pandemic. America has the most gifted scientists, doctors, and technology leaders. Please use them and take charge of testing so we can get America working again! #USA.\u201d (*Trump and Morning Joe\u2019s hosts have a long and \u2026 not particularly dignified \u2026 history.) Donald Trump: \u201cIt is amazing that I became President of the United States with such a totally corrupt and dishonest Lamestream Media going after me all day, and all night. Either I\u2019m really good, far better than the Fake News wants to admit, or they don\u2019t have nearly the power as once thought!\u201d Mica Brzezinski, co-host of MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe and also Mrs Joe: \u201cSince u are watching, can you imagine a president who would allow a pandemic to sweep in on his watch, fail to prepare, tens of thousands die, refuse to do national testing and drive the economy into the ground .. Oh wait...\u201d Donald Trump: \u201cI\u2019ve had great \u2018ratings\u2019 my whole life, there\u2019s nothing unusual about that for me. The White House News Conference ratings are \u2018through the roof\u2019(Monday Night Football, Bachelor Finale , @nytimes) but I don\u2019t care about that. I care about going around the Fake News to the PEOPLE!\u201d \u2026 and there, pausing to notice that Trump\u2019s claim to not care about ratings seems a bit, uh, dubious based on the contents of the sentence in which me made it, you have it. A few other anchors have started addressing Trump personally, hoping to reach the president directly and somehow appeal to his better nature. Doesn\u2019t seem to work. This, by the by, is the New York Times piece about \u201cratings\u201d for Trump\u2019s daily briefings which Trump likes to quote so often. \u201cOn Monday,\u201d Michael Grynbaum wrote on 25 March, \u201cnearly 12.2 million people watched Mr Trump\u2019s briefing on CNN, Fox News and MSNBC, according to Nielsen \u2013 \u2018Monday Night Football\u2019 numbers.\u201d But Grynbaum also wrote: \u201c\u2026the audience is expanding even as Mr Trump has repeatedly delivered information that doctors and public health officials have called ill informed, misleading or downright wrong.\u201d \u2026and welcome to another day of coverage of the coronavirus outbreak in the US. As always, first the figures: US cases: 787,794 US deaths: 42,362 New York cases: 253,311 New York deaths: 18,653 That\u2019s according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. New York is by far the state worst hit, other states are hit badly too: there have been 4,520 deaths in New Jersey, over the Hudson river from New York, there have been 2,468 in Michigan and there have been 1,809 in Massachusetts, now considered a hotspot. Early on Monday, New York governor Andrew Cuomo reported that his state seems to have passed the apex in terms of deaths, though he still said nearly 500 died on Sunday. Throughout Monday, the warnings of Dr Fauci ringing in their ears, or not, governors continued to ponder when to order the reopening of their shuttered economies. In Georgia, Brian Kemp took steps. In Maryland, Larry Hogan bought 500,000 tests from South Korea. And from the White House on Monday evening, after an ordinarily controversial daily briefing, Donald Trump said he would fight Covid-19 by temporarily banning immigration. Of course he did \u2013 and despite saying repeatedly the country is ready to reopen. This is from David Smith\u2019s report: Similar moves by Trump in the past have triggered mayhem at airports in America and beyond as well as legal challenges. Such an order would be a far-reaching use of executive power from a president who last week claimed he had \u201ctotal\u201d authority over states\u2019 efforts to reopen their economies. Trump back-tracked from that claim, of course. And on Monday, all the while, even though Mitch McConnell wore a mask, the Senate failed to agree on an extension of the coronavirus economic stimulus package. More to come.

      "bodyText": "\u201cThus we left Hong Kong to her fate and the hope that Martin Lee, the leader of the Democrats, would not be arrested,\u201d wrote Prince Charles in his journal after Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997. Twenty-three years later, his premonitions unfortunately came true. Lee, the 81-year-old founder of the Democratic party and a senior barrister, was among 15 veteran pro-democracy activists arrested by Hong Kong police on Saturday on charges of illegal assembly, accused of being involved in unapproved protests last year. Just the night before, China\u2019s liaison office in Hong Kong declared it was not bound by a clause in the city\u2019s post-handover mini-constitution, the Basic Law, which bars the Chinese government from interfering in local affairs. Amid accusations of overreach by Beijing into the city\u2019s legislative council and judiciary escalate, the liaison office\u2019s chief, Luo Huining, also called for national security legislation to be urgently passed. China\u2019s high-profile posturing over Hong Kong over the past week signals a turbulent political future for the semi-autonomous city, with mass protests likely to return to the streets, analysts say. Perceived national security threats amid an economic downturn sparked by the coronavirus pandemic and tense relationship with the US has prompted China to prod Hong Kong, roiled by months of anti-government protests since June last year, to speed up legislation of a controversial anti-subversion law which was shelved in 2003, they say. China has long been growing impatient with Hong Kong\u2019s perceived \u201cwaywardness\u201d \u2013 particularly after pro-democracy movements in 2014 and last year. In a policy white paper in June 2014, China asserted that it had \u201ccomprehensive jurisdiction\u201d over Hong Kong and in August that year, ruled that it would allow \u201cuniversal suffrage\u201d so long as it can first vet the leadership candidates.

      "body": "<p>Donald Trump has announced a 60-day ban on immigrants seeking to live and work in America permanently, and said he could extend it depending on the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n<p>The US president framed the executive order, which he expects to sign on Wednesday, as an effort to protect American workers from foreign competition. He said it would apply only to those seeking green cards and not temporary workers, but he did not explain how those whose applications are currently being processed would be affected.</p> \n<p>\u201cBy pausing immigration, we will help put unemployed Americans first in line for jobs as America reopens \u2013 so important,\u201d Trump told reporters at Tuesday\u2019s coronavirus taskforce briefing. \u201cIt would be wrong and unjust for Americans laid off by the virus to be replaced with new immigrant labour flown in from abroad. We must first take care of the American worker.\u201d</p> \n<p>The \u201cpause\u201d would be in effect for 60 days, he added, after which the need for an extension or alternation would be reviewed \u201cbased on economic conditions at the time\u201d. Under questioning, he confirmed that he might then decide to add a further 30 days or more.</p> \n<p>Trump said: \u201cThis order will only apply to individuals seeking a permanent residency. In other words, those receiving green cards. Big factor. It will not apply to those entering on a temporary basis ... We want to protect our US workers and I think, as we move forward, we will become more and more protective of them.\u201d</p> \n<p>The president, who has long campaigned against illegal immigration and again touted his US-Mexico border wall at Tuesday\u2019s briefing, added that the move would help conserve medical resources for US citizens.</p> \n<p>About a million people were granted green cards last year. The biggest share are family-based immigration sponsorships for permanent residency of foreign nationals by their American spouses. Alexander Hunter-Mihali\u0107, a CNN producer, tweeted: \u201cMy wife\u2019s greencard renewal is being \u2013 or was being \u2013 processed. What does that mean for her?\u201d</p> \n<p>The remarks followed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/trump-says-he-will-impose-immigration-ban-in-bid-to-tackle-coronavirus\">an ambiguous tweet on Monday night</a> that caught his own officials by surprise and provoked an angry backlash from immigration rights groups and Democrats.</p> \n<p>Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee to take on Trump in November\u2019s election, said: \u201cRather than execute a swift and aggressive effort to ramp up testing, Donald Trump is tweeting incendiary rhetoric about immigrants in the hopes that he can distract everyone from the core truth: he\u2019s moved too slowly to contain this virus, and we are all paying the price for it.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"928adc644aca22aa6aba9e4cf0a370664efdc6de\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/928adc644aca22aa6aba9e4cf0a370664efdc6de/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A supermarket in Miami, Florida.

How many families would go without health care, food or otherwise if it wasn\u2019t for immigrants working alongside native-born Americans yesterday, today and tomorrow?\u201d</p> \n<p>Immigrants account for 17% of healthcare workers and 24% of direct care workers nationwide, Noorani added, while H-1B visa holders are helping to find a vaccine to Covid-19 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/us-coronavirus-outbreak-california-farm-workers\">agricultural workers continue</a> to be essential in maintaining food chains that re-supply grocery stores.</p> \n<p>Mayra Mac\u00edas, executive director of Latino Victory, said: \u201cTrump is once again using his old playbook of scapegoating immigrants to cover up his failures. But we will not be fooled \u2013 he\u2019s doing it to distract us from his disastrous response to the coronavirus pandemic.\u201d</p> \n<p>In practice, much of the US immigration system has already been paralysed by the pandemic. Travel from China, parts of Europe and Iran is mostly banned and most state department visa services are suspended. The administration has used the crisis to effectively <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/us-asylum-seekers-coronavirus-law-un\">end asylum at US borders</a>, including turning away children who arrive by themselves and putting a hold on refugee resettlement.</p> \n<p>At Tuesday\u2019s briefing Trump was also questioned about a malaria drug that he has been pushing relentlessly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/hydroxychloroquine-trump-coronavirus-drug\">as a therapy for coronavirus</a>, championing a Democratic state representative in Michigan who claimed it benefited her and frequently imploring: \u201cWhat do you have to lose?\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/hydroxychloroquine-trump-coronavirus-drug\">Hydroxychloroquine: how an unproven drug became Trump\u2019s coronavirus 'miracle cure'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>An <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/coronavirus-second-wave-hydroxychloroquine-trial\">analysis showed</a> that nearly a third of military veterans died when treated with hydroxychloroquine, more than patients who received standard treatment. The president appeared to shrug off the finding, saying: \u201cObviously there have been some very good reports. Perhaps this one\u2019s not a good report but we\u2019ll be looking at it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dr Stephen Hahn, the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s commissioner, cautioned against drawing firm conclusions from the 368-patient sample. \u201cThis study is a small retrospective study at the VA [Veterans Affairs],\u201d Hahn said. \u2018This is something that a doctor would need to consider as part of a decision in writing a prescription for hydroxychloroquine.\u201d</p> \n<p>Earlier on Tuesday Trump hosted Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, at the White House, with testing top of the agenda. He said they agreed that the hospital ship USNS Comfort was no longer required by the state. \u201cI\u2019ve asked Andrew if we could bring the Comfort back to its base in Virginia so that we could have it for other locations and he said we would be able to do that.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be bringing the ship back at the earliest time and we\u2019ll get it ready for its next mission, which will I\u2019m sure be a very important one also. But it was an honour.\u201d</p> \n<p>The US has 823,786 confirmed cases of the virus, and 44,999 deaths, according to the Coronavirus Resource Center at <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">Johns Hopkins University</a>. More than 4 million people have been tested.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has announced a 60-day ban on immigrants seeking to live and work in America permanently, and said he could extend it depending on the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. The US president framed the executive order, which he expects to sign on Wednesday, as an effort to protect American workers from foreign competition. He said it would apply only to those seeking green cards and not temporary workers, but he did not explain how those whose applications are currently being processed would be affected. \u201cBy pausing immigration, we will help put unemployed Americans first in line for jobs as America reopens \u2013 so important,\u201d Trump told reporters at Tuesday\u2019s coronavirus taskforce briefing. \u201cIt would be wrong and unjust for Americans laid off by the virus to be replaced with new immigrant labour flown in from abroad. We must first take care of the American worker.\u201d The \u201cpause\u201d would be in effect for 60 days, he added, after which the need for an extension or alternation would be reviewed \u201cbased on economic conditions at the time\u201d. Under questioning, he confirmed that he might then decide to add a further 30 days or more. Trump said: \u201cThis order will only apply to individuals seeking a permanent residency. In other words, those receiving green cards. Big factor. It will not apply to those entering on a temporary basis ... We want to protect our US workers and I think, as we move forward, we will become more and more protective of them.\u201d The president, who has long campaigned against illegal immigration and again touted his US-Mexico border wall at Tuesday\u2019s briefing, added that the move would help conserve medical resources for US citizens. About a million people were granted green cards last year. The biggest share are family-based immigration sponsorships for permanent residency of foreign nationals by their American spouses. Alexander Hunter-Mihali\u0107, a CNN producer, tweeted: \u201cMy wife\u2019s greencard renewal is being \u2013 or was being \u2013 processed. What does that mean for her?\u201d The remarks followed an ambiguous tweet on Monday night that caught his own officials by surprise and provoked an angry backlash from immigration rights groups and Democrats. Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee to take on Trump in November\u2019s election, said: \u201cRather than execute a swift and aggressive effort to ramp up testing, Donald Trump is tweeting incendiary rhetoric about immigrants in the hopes that he can distract everyone from the core truth: he\u2019s moved too slowly to contain this virus, and we are all paying the price for it.\u201d Ali Noorani, president of the National Immigration Forum, said: \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s call to suspend immigration to the US ignores the reality of our situation: the fact is that immigrants are standing shoulder to shoulder with US citizens on the frontlines helping us get through this pandemic. How many families would go without health care, food or otherwise if it wasn\u2019t for immigrants working alongside native-born Americans yesterday, today and tomorrow?\u201d Immigrants account for 17% of healthcare workers and 24% of direct care workers nationwide, Noorani added, while H-1B visa holders are helping to find a vaccine to Covid-19 and agricultural workers continue to be essential in maintaining food chains that re-supply grocery stores. Mayra Mac\u00edas, executive director of Latino Victory, said: \u201cTrump is once again using his old playbook of scapegoating immigrants to cover up his failures. But we will not be fooled \u2013 he\u2019s doing it to distract us from his disastrous response to the coronavirus pandemic.\u201d In practice, much of the US immigration system has already been paralysed by the pandemic. Travel from China, parts of Europe and Iran is mostly banned and most state department visa services are suspended. The administration has used the crisis to effectively end asylum at US borders, including turning away children who arrive by themselves and putting a hold on refugee resettlement. At Tuesday\u2019s briefing Trump was also questioned about a malaria drug that he has been pushing relentlessly as a therapy for coronavirus, championing a Democratic state representative in Michigan who claimed it benefited her and frequently imploring: \u201cWhat do you have to lose?\u201d An analysis showed that nearly a third of military veterans died when treated with hydroxychloroquine, more than patients who received standard treatment. The president appeared to shrug off the finding, saying: \u201cObviously there have been some very good reports. Perhaps this one\u2019s not a good report but we\u2019ll be looking at it.\u201d Dr Stephen Hahn, the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s commissioner, cautioned against drawing firm conclusions from the 368-patient sample. \u201cThis study is a small retrospective study at the VA [Veterans Affairs],\u201d Hahn said. \u2018This is something that a doctor would need to consider as part of a decision in writing a prescription for hydroxychloroquine.\u201d Earlier on Tuesday Trump hosted Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, at the White House, with testing top of the agenda. He said they agreed that the hospital ship USNS Comfort was no longer required by the state. \u201cI\u2019ve asked Andrew if we could bring the Comfort back to its base in Virginia so that we could have it for other locations and he said we would be able to do that. \u201cWe\u2019ll be bringing the ship back at the earliest time and we\u2019ll get it ready for its next mission, which will I\u2019m sure be a very important one also. But it was an honour.\u201d The US has 823,786 confirmed cases of the virus, and 44,999 deaths, according to the Coronavirus Resource Center at Johns Hopkins University. More than 4 million people have been tested.",

      "bodyText": "Republican state leaders in Wisconsin on Tuesday filed a lawsuit against the Democratic governor Tony Evers, challenging his stay-at-home order to contain the coronavirus outbreak. The issue of when to re-open state economies has on occasion put Donald Trump at odds with his own top public health officials and federal guidelines. Trump has pressed for a swift lifting of restrictions put on social and business activities across the US and last week spoke of rightwing backed protesters against stay-home orders as \u201cresponsible people\u201d, in a highly unusual move to encourage civil disobedience in violation of government guidelines amid a national emergency. The lawsuit asks the Wisconsin supreme court to issue a temporary injunction on the state\u2019s order that was extended until 26 May by the Wisconsin department of health services secretary last week at the direction of the governor. Meanwhile, health officials in Wisconsin said they have identified at least seven people who may have contracted the coronavirus from participating in the 7 April primary and supreme court seat election in the state. These are the first such cases following Wisconsin\u2019s controversial decision to go ahead with in-person voting amid a pandemic, despite widespread concern about the public health risks. The infections involve six voters and one poll worker in Milwaukee, where difficulty finding poll workers forced the city to pare nearly 200 voting locations back to just five, and where voters \u2013 some in masks, some with no protection \u2013 were forced to wait in long lines for hours. It is not certain that the seven people contracted the virus at the polls. The possible connection was made because local health officials are now asking newly infected people whether they participated in the election. \u201cIt means they were at the polls, which is a potential exposure, but [we] can\u2019t say they definitely got it at the polls,\u201d said Darren Rauch, the health officer/director for suburban Greenfield, and one of the health officials helping with the coronavirus response in the Milwaukee area. Milwaukee officials are still gathering information from about 70% of people who have tested positive since the election. The election, which included a presidential primary as well as a state supreme court race and local offices, took place after a legal struggle between Democrats and Republicans. Thousands of Wisconsin voters stayed home, unwilling to risk their health and unable to be counted because requested absentee ballots never arrived. Democrats and voting rights groups have filed lawsuits to expand mail and absentee voting options, and pushed for an extra $2bn to help states adjust their election systems. National Republicans are fighting those efforts, while Donald Trump claims without evidence that mail-in voting is vulnerable to fraud.",

That concern was raised in the findings of a Senate inquiry in 2018, which urged Defence to \u201cimprove the consent process\u201d.</p> \n<p>Defence says it has since implemented the recommendations of previous inquiries and taken steps to ensure that the new chloroquine trial is voluntary. The department said the safety of its personnel \u201cis our highest priority\u201d.</p> \n<p>The shadow defence personnel minister, Shayne Neumann, agreed that there was a need for Australia to do everything it could to tackle Covid-19, including conducting clinical trials.</p> \n<p>But he also warned it was critical that the trial program was truly voluntary, saying the safety and health of ADF members was \u201cparamount\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Email:</b>&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email?CMP=cvau_atom\">daily coronavirus newsletter</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>App:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_atom\">download it</a>&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Social:&nbsp;</b>follow us on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://facebook.com/theguardianaustralia\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardianaustralia/\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaus\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Podcast:</b>&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/full-story-coronavirus-updates/id1482061243\">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7GJod4EyoLywB1AW6zrSHh?si=LD1i9SJwRqSAcT3i4ZCI-w\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cIt is important that those defence personnel who participate in any drug trial are properly informed of the nature of the trial and do so voluntarily,\u201d Neumann told Guardian Australia. \u201cAny trials must be conducted safely and ethically, and be completely voluntary.\u201d</p> \n<p>Lambie said the trials had to be conducted with more stringent oversight and accountability than the mefloquine tests.

Instead, it involved the testing of a \u201cwell-known drug for a new purpose\u201d.</p> \n<p>The trial would involve civilian and ADF healthcare workers. It would also be entirely voluntary and require a \u201cdeliberate action\u201d by potential volunteers wanting to take part.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis requires taking action to access and read all online information, watch a video explaining the trial and to make an appointment to attend in-person for evaluation,\u201d Defence said. \u201cThey are then carefully screened against a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria.\u201d</p> \n<p>Participants would be required to fill out daily questionnaires detailing the state of their health and wellbeing, Defence said. Close monitoring would take place and participants could quit at any time.</p> \n<p>\u201cWell conducted clinical trials are needed in the global fight against Covid-19,\u201d Defence said.</p> \n<p>The US Centres for Disease Control <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/resources/pdf/fsp/drugs/chloroquine.pdf\">has described chloroquine</a> as \u201ca relatively well-tolerated medicine\u201d, which has some side-effects, including most commonly stomach pain, nausea, vomiting and headaches.</p> \n<p>Australia\u2019s drug regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, <a href=\"https://www.tga.gov.au/alert/new-restrictions-prescribing-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19\">also says the side-effects of chloroquine</a> can include headaches, skin eruptions, gastrointestinal disturbance, psoriarsis and, in rare cases, psychotic episodes, anxiety, personality change, seizures and blood disorders.</p> \n<p>The actor and singer Rita Wilson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/15/rita-wilson-tells-of-extreme-side-effects-of-experimental-covid-19-drug-chloroquine\">was given chloroquine</a> when she and her husband, Tom Hanks, tested positive for Covid-19 this year in Australia. Wilson claimed to have suffered side-effects including nausea and vertigo.</p> \n<p>Research out of the US tested the similar compound of hydroxychloroquine in veterans\u2019 hospitals. The <a href=\"https://apnews.com/a5077c7227b8eb8b0dc23423c0bbe2b2\">Associated Press reported that the study</a> \u2013 which was not rigorous or peer-reviewed \u2013 showed no benefit for Covid-19 patients. More deaths were recorded for those given hydroxychloroquine compared to those who received standard care, the study said.</p> \n<p>Assoc Prof Jane Quinn, a pharmaceuticals researcher at Charles Sturt University\u2019s school of veterinary sciences, has worked with veterans to study neuropsychiatric conditions arising from quinolone anti-malarials like mefloquine.</p> \n<p>Quinn said she was concerned that Defence\u2019s \u201cmanagement of past trials of these sorts of drugs\u201d was problematic. She said the military had traditionally been poor at obtaining informed consent for clinical trials. The drug itself, she said, was completely unproven.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s an unsubstantiated use at the present in that there has been no suggestion that you can prevent somebody from contracting Covid-19 by giving them hydroxychloroquine,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cThere\u2019s been no proof of that at all.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cSo why we would be saying that we will undertake a first trial to look into that with Defence members, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right population to even be trying to attempt that.\u201d</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Foreign_Affairs_Defence_and_Trade/Mefloquine/Report/b03\">Senate inquiry into the mefloquine and tafenoquine trials</a> said serious side-effects were rare and noted that the Defence inspector general had found some were \u201cconducted ethically and lawfully\u201d.</p> \n<p>Defence, acting on the recommendations of that inquiry, appointed an advocate for trial participants. The advocate role is designed to give ADF personnel a confidential mechanism to seek advice and support about clinical trials.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/21/elective-surgery-restart-will-allow-government-to-wind-back-support-for-private-hospitals\">Elective surgery restart will allow government to wind back support for private hospitals</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This latest trial is being conducted through the ADF\u2019s malaria and infectious diseases institute, in conjunction with the national medical countermeasures initiative at DMTC Ltd.

So often, clinical trials give preliminary results that look promising but in doing the proper larger studies you realise not only that it doesn\u2019t work, but it does more harm than good.\u201d</p>",

The Australian defence force is using its members for a clinical trial of chloroquine, an anti-malarial drug, as a potential \u201cpreventative measure against Covid-19\u201d. Chloroquine and a similar compound, hydroxychloroquine, have been hailed as miracle drugs by the US president, Donald Trump, despite the lack of any comprehensive study backing their efficacy for Covid-19 prevention or treatment. Both have known side-effects and experts say more research is needed to determine whether they are safe and effective in humans. The Doherty Institute is currently leading a separate randomised trial of hydroxychloroquine \u2013 and a separate drug used in Aids treatment \u2013 that involves 2,500 patients at more than 70 hospitals, covering every state and territory of Australia, and 12 hospitals in New Zealand. \u201cWhile the World Health Organization considers both drugs used in this trial to be promising treatments for Covid-19, more research is needed to ensure they are safe and effective in humans,\u201d said associate professor Steven Tong, the co-lead of the Doherty research. Defence, though, has faced sustained criticism for its handling of such trials in the past. The trial of a separate anti-malarial, mefloquine, on soldiers serving in Bougainville and Timor-Leste in the 1990s and 2000s prompted widespread complaints of serious side-effects and unethical conduct. Veterans said they were used as \u201cguinea pigs\u201d and their complaints sparked multiple inquiries, which largely delivered favourable findings to Defence. A key concern is that ADF personnel, who operate in a rigid and hierarchical command structure, do not have the ability to freely consent to taking part in medical trials. That concern was raised in the findings of a Senate inquiry in 2018, which urged Defence to \u201cimprove the consent process\u201d. Defence says it has since implemented the recommendations of previous inquiries and taken steps to ensure that the new chloroquine trial is voluntary. The department said the safety of its personnel \u201cis our highest priority\u201d. The shadow defence personnel minister, Shayne Neumann, agreed that there was a need for Australia to do everything it could to tackle Covid-19, including conducting clinical trials. But he also warned it was critical that the trial program was truly voluntary, saying the safety and health of ADF members was \u201cparamount\u201d. \u201cIt is important that those defence personnel who participate in any drug trial are properly informed of the nature of the trial and do so voluntarily,\u201d Neumann told Guardian Australia. \u201cAny trials must be conducted safely and ethically, and be completely voluntary.\u201d Lambie said the trials had to be conducted with more stringent oversight and accountability than the mefloquine tests. She said she didn\u2019t \u201cwant to see this as another cover-up, like the mefloquine \u2013 it\u2019s as simple as that\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have to go in a lot harder and watch what\u2019s going on than what they did with the mefloquine,\u201d Lambie told Guardian Australia. \u201cWhat safety are they putting in? What reporting procedures? What checks?\u201d \u201cIf they haven\u2019t learnt from the first time they did this, without having all that appropriately put in place \u2026 who\u2019s policing all this?\u201d Defence said the current trial was not an anti-malarial trial like that conducted with mefloquine. Instead, it involved the testing of a \u201cwell-known drug for a new purpose\u201d. The trial would involve civilian and ADF healthcare workers. It would also be entirely voluntary and require a \u201cdeliberate action\u201d by potential volunteers wanting to take part. \u201cThis requires taking action to access and read all online information, watch a video explaining the trial and to make an appointment to attend in-person for evaluation,\u201d Defence said. \u201cThey are then carefully screened against a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria.\u201d Participants would be required to fill out daily questionnaires detailing the state of their health and wellbeing, Defence said. Close monitoring would take place and participants could quit at any time. \u201cWell conducted clinical trials are needed in the global fight against Covid-19,\u201d Defence said. The US Centres for Disease Control has described chloroquine as \u201ca relatively well-tolerated medicine\u201d, which has some side-effects, including most commonly stomach pain, nausea, vomiting and headaches. Australia\u2019s drug regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, also says the side-effects of chloroquine can include headaches, skin eruptions, gastrointestinal disturbance, psoriarsis and, in rare cases, psychotic episodes, anxiety, personality change, seizures and blood disorders. The actor and singer Rita Wilson was given chloroquine when she and her husband, Tom Hanks, tested positive for Covid-19 this year in Australia. Wilson claimed to have suffered side-effects including nausea and vertigo. Research out of the US tested the similar compound of hydroxychloroquine in veterans\u2019 hospitals. The Associated Press reported that the study \u2013 which was not rigorous or peer-reviewed \u2013 showed no benefit for Covid-19 patients. More deaths were recorded for those given hydroxychloroquine compared to those who received standard care, the study said. Assoc Prof Jane Quinn, a pharmaceuticals researcher at Charles Sturt University\u2019s school of veterinary sciences, has worked with veterans to study neuropsychiatric conditions arising from quinolone anti-malarials like mefloquine. Quinn said she was concerned that Defence\u2019s \u201cmanagement of past trials of these sorts of drugs\u201d was problematic. She said the military had traditionally been poor at obtaining informed consent for clinical trials. The drug itself, she said, was completely unproven. \u201cI think it\u2019s an unsubstantiated use at the present in that there has been no suggestion that you can prevent somebody from contracting Covid-19 by giving them hydroxychloroquine,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cThere\u2019s been no proof of that at all.\u201d \u201cSo why we would be saying that we will undertake a first trial to look into that with Defence members, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right population to even be trying to attempt that.\u201d The Senate inquiry into the mefloquine and tafenoquine trials said serious side-effects were rare and noted that the Defence inspector general had found some were \u201cconducted ethically and lawfully\u201d. Defence, acting on the recommendations of that inquiry, appointed an advocate for trial participants. The advocate role is designed to give ADF personnel a confidential mechanism to seek advice and support about clinical trials. This latest trial is being conducted through the ADF\u2019s malaria and infectious diseases institute, in conjunction with the national medical countermeasures initiative at DMTC Ltd. It has received ethics approval and will be subject to the rules and regulations of the TGA, including rules around informed consent. Prof Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases physician, has previously said he would be reluctant to have anti-malarials tested on him. \u201cIf I got Covid-19 tomorrow, I wouldn\u2019t want any of those drugs being tested [on me],\u201d he said. \u201cIt could help with treatment, it could do nothing, or it could be very harmful, and at at the moment we don\u2019t know which of those statements are true.\u201d \u201cHydroxychloroquine is quite a worry for two reasons, including that people are already using it when there are marginal benefits for it, and people can take too high a dose and experience toxicity. So often, clinical trials give preliminary results that look promising but in doing the proper larger studies you realise not only that it doesn\u2019t work, but it does more harm than good.\u201d",

It has been reported that Castle was just a week away from finalising a deal with Optus when the virus forced Super Rugby into shut down last month. In hindsight, if RA had accepted Fox Sport\u2019s improved offer, the game would be in a much stronger position going forward. Presumably, Castle will now go back to Optus to see if they are still interested, but what if they are not? Will Fox Sports negotiate with the current administration? If RA fails to deliver a satisfactory broadcast deal, there will be more than just 11 former Wallabies captains writing nasty letters to them.",

His challenge, lodged in Melbourne late Tuesday by the Human Rights Law Centre, is being seen as a test case for other women and men living in close confines in immigration detention and at risk of a Covid-19 outbreak. Guardian Australia understands his case is likely to be \u201cthe first of many\u201d. Infectious diseases experts, peak medical bodies, and the Australian Human Rights Commissioner have separately called for the numbers of people held in detention to be urgently reduced, with some warning detention centres risk spreading Covid-19 like cruise ships, and pose a risk to the broader community. The government\u2019s own Department of Health identifies people held in detention as among those \u201cmost at risk\u201d of contracting Covid-19, and those with chronic illnesses at highest risk of serious illness if they are infected. The refugee who has launched the high court action arrived in Australia seeking asylum in 2013, and was sent to Manus Island. His well-founded fear of persecution was recognised and he is legally owed protection. He was brought from Papua New Guinea to Australia for medical treatment in early 2019, and has been detained ever since. The man, who is middle-aged, has multiple and complex medical conditions \u2013 including diabetes, asthma and high blood pressure \u2013 that doctors argue put him at greater risk of serious illness or death if he is infected by the coronavirus. He is challenging his detention on the grounds that the Australian government is breaching its duty of care to him by failing to establish conditions that allow him to comply with public health guidelines to practice social distancing and protect himself from Covid-19. Nearly 1,400 women and men are currently held in immigration detention centres in Australia, or \u201calternative places of detention\u201d, usually hotels commandeered by the Department of Home Affairs. People in detention eat in crowded food halls, share bathrooms and communal spaces and are sleeping in rooms with up to six people. They are also exposed to a wider circle of people by guards and other staff who come in and out of the centres daily. Protests are being held daily at places of detention. The case has been lodged in the high court because the man\u2019s detention falls under the Migration Act, but the court may choose to have the case transferred to the federal court for adjudication. Guardian Australia understands there are several further legal challenges being prepared on similar grounds. The man\u2019s case may act as a test for others currently held in detention. David Burke, the legal director at the Human Rights Law Centre, said home affairs minister Peter Dutton had a legal duty to protect the people in the government\u2019s care in immigration detention. \u201cInstead, he is choosing to hold men and women in crammed detention centres that make it impossible to practice physical distancing.\u201d Burke said medical experts had been consistent that people held in detention, especially those with underlying health issues, were at severe risk from Covid-19. \u201cWe are asking minister Dutton to listen to the medical experts \u2013 just like the government is asking all of us to do \u2013 in response to this public health crisis.

Many held in immigration detention have families living in the Australian community. Supporters, friends and advocates have offered to house others. Other countries, including the UK, Belgium, and Spain, have significantly reduced the number of people held in immigration detention out of concerns over potential Covid-19 outbreaks. Fears have previously been raised about a Covid-19 outbreak in detention after a guard at a Brisbane hotel being used to hold detainees tested positive for the illness.

      "bodyText": "The Australian Services Union has complained that Qantas is using $1,500 fortnightly jobkeeper payments to pay workers\u2019 penalty rates. Qantas insists the wage subsidy can be lawfully used to pay penalty rates, but unions argue the move increases the benefit of the federal wage subsidy captured by the airline. Linda White, ASU assistant national secretary, called on Qantas to sit down with unions and come to a \u201cjoint understanding\u201d of how jobkeeper operates, or else the union is \u201cconsidering its options\u201d including litigation. At Qantas, staff including cabin crew and technical crews are paid the base wage in one pay period and two weeks later are paid shift penalties and allowances, in arrears. Qantas believes that in a fortnight an employee did not work it can nevertheless use the $1,500 fortnightly jobkeeper payment to pay for penalty rates from the preceding fortnight. But workers represented by the ASU believe penalties should be paid separately to the minimum $1,500 payment guaranteed by the jobkeeper program. In an email to Qantas members on Monday, the ASU New South Wales secretary, Natalie Lang, claimed the jobkeeper legislation \u201cdoes not support the approach that Qantas has apparently taken in relation to penalties\u201d. \u201cQuite apart from the legal issues, it\u2019s just appalling that Qantas would use taxpayers\u2019 money to exploit its dedicated workforce in such a \u2026 disrespectful way,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are stressed about this and fairly questioning what exactly the advantage of working shift work is if there is no incentive for doing so.\u201d Lang noted Qantas has already benefited from $715m in waived fees and charges and a government promise to subsidise flights between capital cities, arguing taxpayer assistance \u201cmust be tied to properly and fairly remunerating the Qantas workforce\u201d. A Qantas spokesman told Guardian Australia the jobkeeper payment \u201cis a wage subsidy for businesses affected by the coronavirus to cover the costs of their employees\u2019 wages\u201d. \u201cEmployee payments are subsidised by up to $1,500 from the government each fortnight whether they are still working, on annual leave, receiving allowances or penalty rates,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have fast-tracked the payments for our employees even before the government has started paying the subsidy to businesses.\u201d White told Guardian Australia that many Qantas workers are \u201cdealing with unemployment or underemployment for the first time in their life\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019re struggling to cope and they don\u2019t need jobkeeper to be added as another stressor,\u201d she said. The disquiet of Qantas\u2019s move comes as unions are already concerned about the practice of using the jobseeker payment to pay off leave entitlements. Earlier in April, Guardian Australia revealed jobkeeper can be used to pay leave entitlements, a \u201cloophole\u201d which Labor\u2019s shadow industrial relations minister, Tony Burke, warned could mean millions of workers are left without annual leave. Qantas has already confirmed it will use jobkeeper to pay down leave. The industrial relations minister, Christian Porter, amended draft legislation so employees must retain at least two weeks annual leave, but defended the employer practice. Porter said the jobkeeper scheme helps \u201cthe employee stay engaged to their employer [and helps] the employer pay their employee\u201d. \u201cWhether someone is at work doing limited hours because there\u2019s very little business left at the work, or whether they\u2019ve taken leave, what the government has said is we\u2019re going to save that business and help that employee by subsidising their wage \u2013 whether that\u2019s diminished hours at work or on leave with a $1,500 payment,\u201d he said. On Tuesday Scott Morrison was asked about the potential for exploitation of employees, either by employers threatening to sack them if they asked for the jobkeeper payment or unreasonable directions to work to earn the $750 weekly payment. Morrison said he would be \u201cconcerned about any behaviour by employers that was coercive\u201d and suggested a threat could be referred to regulators such as the Fair Work Commission or Ombudsman. Morrison said employers were entitled to direct employees to work to do $750 of work a week at their regular rate of pay. \u201cThat\u2019s what the Act provides for,\u201d he told reporters in Canberra. \u201cThat is not an unreasonable request that someone would work the hours that they are being paid for, that is being paid by the employer but obviously that is being met by the commonwealth through the JobKeeper program.\u201d",

As Roosevelt did during his Great Depression-era fireside chats, the president has given voice to personal suffering and made victims of hardship feel recognized. Even before the coronavirus pandemic, Donald Trump was widely viewed as a weak consoler-in-chief. Sometimes he blamed local leaders for natural disasters, as when California was struck by wildfires in 2018. Sometimes his shows of empathy rang hollow, as when local leaders and victims\u2019 families shunned him on his visit to Pittsburgh following a 2018 synagogue shooting.

And in the current crisis, Trump\u2019s failure to grasp the scale of the American tragedy on a human level could do more than fuel emotional turmoil \u2013 it could cost more lives, according to historians, public affairs experts and political analysts interviewed by the Guardian. Instead of weighing the human costs attached to decisions about whether to reopen the economy or rush medical equipment to certain states, analysts said, Trump seems to be thinking about something else: his own political future and his need for the economy to rebound quickly if he is to be re-elected in November.

      "bodyText": "Mosques will be deserted, daylong fasts will be broken in isolation and in some places the calls to prayer that rally believers together will end with a different exhortation: worship from where you are. Ordinarily during Ramadan, the holy month that commences this week, Muslim community life swells with special prayers at mosques and crowded iftar dinners that can stretch into the early hours. But that kind of socialising now risks spreading coronavirus, and bans on religious and family gatherings will persist across much of the Islamic world even as businesses and government offices start to reopen. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be difficult and depressing,\u201d said Mohammad Faoury, who works for a refugee organisation in Amman, Jordan. \u201cSince I\u2019m single and live alone, Ramadan is the month when I can finally see my family for extended periods of time. It\u2019s a time we strengthen the bond.\u201d The virus has emptied Islam\u2019s holiest sites at the most sacred time of year. The Ka\u2019bah, the gold-embroidered shrine in Mecca\u2019s Grand Mosque, is closed to worshippers along with the Prophet\u2019s Mosque in Medina and Jerusalem\u2019s al-Aqsa mosque. \u201cOur hearts are tortured from pain in the holy month of Ramadan,\u201d said Sheikh Omar al-Kiswami, the imam and director of al-Aqsa, where only guards and mosque employees will be permitted to pray. \u201cIt is a very sad moment in the history of Islam.\u201d Jamia Masjid, one of the oldest and grandest mosques in the disputed south Asian territory of Kashmir, usually overflows in the evenings with people gathering for prayer and discussing religion, politics and life.

      "body": "<p>In the name of freedom, we have been exposed, to a greater extent than any other European nation, to a deadly pandemic. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/feb/03/brexit-news-boris--johnson-speech-barnier-cabinet-ministers-claims-uk-does-not-need-trade-deal-with-eu-ahead-of-pms-speech-live-news?page=with:block-5e382b6f8f0811db2faf0775#block-5e382b6f8f0811db2faf0775\">his speech in Greenwich</a> on 3 February, Boris Johnson lambasted governments that had \u201cpanicked\u201d about the coronavirus, inflicting \u201cunnecessary economic damage\u201d. His government, by contrast, would champion our right to \u201cbuy and sell freely among each other\u201d.</p> <p>But as always, the professed love of freedom among those who represent the interests of the rich in politics is highly selective. If the government valued freedom as much as it says it does, it would do everything in its power to maximise the liberties we can safely exercise, while protecting us from harm.</p> <p>In other words, it would take up the call to open London\u2019s golf courses to public access. As the author and land campaigner Guy Shrubsole has discovered, there are <a href=\"https://whoownsengland.org/2020/04/14/who-owns-londons-golf-courses/\">131 golf courses in Greater London</a>, covering 11,000 acres. But they are open only to those who pay fees to play and to members, while millions of people swelter in tiny flats or edge round each other in minuscule parks, desperate for a sense of space and freedom. The government would also take up the call for private schools to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/private-schools-land-targeted-for-families-without-gardens\">open their playing fields</a> and extensive grounds. And it would open London\u2019s locked green squares, and designate other tracts of private land in and around our cities for public access.</p> <p>But a core purpose of conservatism is to defend private property from public use, and to extend private ownership and exclusive rights into realms previously enjoyed by all. And no form of wealth is more fiercely contested than land.</p> <p>Throughout the history of these isles, exclusion from the land has been a major source of social conflict. It remains so today. Last month, Johnson extolled the \u201c<a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-britain-pubs/ancient-british-rights-to-a-drink-in-the-pub-have-to-be-suspended-johnson-idUKKBN21732B\">ancient, inalienable right</a> of free-born people of the United Kingdom\u201d. But before the pandemic began, his government proposed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/15/tresspass-trap-law-land-travelling-people-rights\">criminalise trespass</a> in England and Wales. This is the opposite policy to Scotland\u2019s, where there is now a comprehensive right to roam.</p> <p>In November last year, Johnson announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/nov/19/johnson-reveals-plans-to-extend-police-stop-and-search-powers\">an expansion of police powers</a> to stop and search people without grounds for suspicion. These powers have long been perceived by people of colour as a form of collective harassment in public places, impinging on their free movement.

      "bodyText": "In the name of freedom, we have been exposed, to a greater extent than any other European nation, to a deadly pandemic. In his speech in Greenwich on 3 February, Boris Johnson lambasted governments that had \u201cpanicked\u201d about the coronavirus, inflicting \u201cunnecessary economic damage\u201d. His government, by contrast, would champion our right to \u201cbuy and sell freely among each other\u201d. But as always, the professed love of freedom among those who represent the interests of the rich in politics is highly selective. If the government valued freedom as much as it says it does, it would do everything in its power to maximise the liberties we can safely exercise, while protecting us from harm. In other words, it would take up the call to open London\u2019s golf courses to public access. As the author and land campaigner Guy Shrubsole has discovered, there are 131 golf courses in Greater London, covering 11,000 acres. But they are open only to those who pay fees to play and to members, while millions of people swelter in tiny flats or edge round each other in minuscule parks, desperate for a sense of space and freedom. The government would also take up the call for private schools to open their playing fields and extensive grounds. And it would open London\u2019s locked green squares, and designate other tracts of private land in and around our cities for public access. But a core purpose of conservatism is to defend private property from public use, and to extend private ownership and exclusive rights into realms previously enjoyed by all. And no form of wealth is more fiercely contested than land. Throughout the history of these isles, exclusion from the land has been a major source of social conflict. It remains so today. Last month, Johnson extolled the \u201cancient, inalienable right of free-born people of the United Kingdom\u201d. But before the pandemic began, his government proposed to criminalise trespass in England and Wales. This is the opposite policy to Scotland\u2019s, where there is now a comprehensive right to roam. In November last year, Johnson announced an expansion of police powers to stop and search people without grounds for suspicion. These powers have long been perceived by people of colour as a form of collective harassment in public places, impinging on their free movement. Black, Asian and minority ethnic people are on average eight times more likely to be stopped and searched by the police than white people. Some young black men have the sense of living in a permanent state of partial lockdown. The government\u2019s own assessment shows that an expansion of stop and search powers has \u201cat best, only minimal effects on violent crime\u201d. In fact, as a primary cause of both the 1981 and 2011 riots, the policy is likely to exacerbate it. Until 1984, police stop and search powers were exercised under the remarkably brutal 1824 Vagrancy Act. Beggars, hawkers, sex workers, Gypsies and Travellers, rough sleepers and anyone \u201cnot giving a good account of himself or herself\u201d could be arrested and summarily sentenced to three months\u2019 hard labour. Astonishingly, large sections of this barbaric law remain in force , and it is still sometimes used by the police against homeless people. Police powers to move people on are necessary during this pandemic. But well into the first half of the 20th century, they were used as a form of social control, securing public space for \u201cthe right sort\u201d, while excluding \u201cundesirables\u201d. They were a source of great resentment in Victorian England, and commemorated in several satirical ballads, various of which had the title Move on There.

The Salvation Army, then an extreme temperance movement, waged its wars against people enjoying themselves in any public places, sparking confrontations that sometimes turned violent.

The developers of one estate had been granted planning permission on the grounds that its playground would be available to all, after which it replaced a gate with an impenetrable hedge to shut out the poorest residents. We might look for freedom in the countryside, but for centuries it has been the scene of extreme exclusion and injustice. Here, enclosure (the seizure of land from commoners) violently deprived many people of their liberties. The labouring poor were forbidden to live in \u201cclose parishes\u201d, where their homes were ripped down by the lords of the manor, to avoid liability for poverty relief.

When the coronavirus shutdown closed all fertility clinics, she had been waiting for \u201covarian drilling\u201d, a surgical treatment that can trigger ovulation in women who have polycystic ovary syndrome. \u201cIf St Mary\u2019s goes private we will be up a creek with no paddle, as finances aren\u2019t great at the moment so we were relying on NHS funding for treatment,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She added: \u201cSt Mary\u2019s is the oldest NHS IVF clinic, they can\u2019t privatise it. What about NHS patients who cannot afford treatment? That\u2019s discriminatory to myself as that\u2019s saying NHS-funded patients shouldn\u2019t be able to get the chance of their rainbows at the end of a long road tackling treatment.\u201d</p> <p>Lyndsey Dudley, who had her daughter, Nora, via IVF at St Mary\u2019s last year after six years of trying to conceive, said: \u201cAnyone who argues against the funding of fertility treatment has never felt the pain and destruction of infertility.

      "bodyText": "Patients at the UK\u2019s oldest NHS fertility clinic have demanded clarity from the hospital after plans for its potential closure were leaked to the Guardian, with some couples worrying about embryos they have in storage and others whether they will ever be able to realise their dreams of having a baby. The department for reproductive medicine at St Mary\u2019s hospital in Manchester is at risk of closure in April next year after hospital bosses told staff they could not fund a \u00a310m upgrade of the dilapidated clinic. If the clinic closes, treatment will probably be outsourced to the private sector, raising fears that publicly funded IVF will be rationed further in England. Staff at St Mary\u2019s worry that its specialist services, such as fertility preservation for cancer patients, and world-class research will not be picked up by private clinics. One patient, who asked not to be named, has been receiving treatment for five years at St Mary\u2019s for serious ovarian cysts. When the coronavirus shutdown closed all fertility clinics, she had been waiting for \u201covarian drilling\u201d, a surgical treatment that can trigger ovulation in women who have polycystic ovary syndrome. \u201cIf St Mary\u2019s goes private we will be up a creek with no paddle, as finances aren\u2019t great at the moment so we were relying on NHS funding for treatment,\u201d she said. She added: \u201cSt Mary\u2019s is the oldest NHS IVF clinic, they can\u2019t privatise it. What about NHS patients who cannot afford treatment? That\u2019s discriminatory to myself as that\u2019s saying NHS-funded patients shouldn\u2019t be able to get the chance of their rainbows at the end of a long road tackling treatment.\u201d Lyndsey Dudley, who had her daughter, Nora, via IVF at St Mary\u2019s last year after six years of trying to conceive, said: \u201cAnyone who argues against the funding of fertility treatment has never felt the pain and destruction of infertility. Maybe it\u2019s not a case of IVF being a life-saving treatment, and the staff at St Mary\u2019s don\u2019t have your life in their hands. But IVF, for those who want to have children but can\u2019t, is life \u2018making\u2019 and the staff at St Mary\u2019s hold your dreams and future in their hands. At our most vulnerable they helped us believe and we trusted them 100%.\u201d She and her husband moved to Stockport in Greater Manchester in order to access two NHS-funded cycles of IVF after discovering that they would only be entitled to one in their native Derbyshire because of the \u201cpostcode lottery\u201d of NHS fertility treatment. \u201cIt kills me to think that others won\u2019t be as lucky as we have been,\u201d she said. \u201cThe staff are incredible, they got us through the darkest times.\u201d Other patients contacted by the Guardian said they wanted clarity on what would happen to their eggs, sperm or embryos currently in storage at St Mary\u2019s. The hospital site has already been promised to Manchester Science Partnerships to be turned into a \u00a360m healthcare business centre called Citylabs 3.0. Manchester University NHS foundation trust, which runs St Mary\u2019s, said no decisions had been made about the future of the clinic and it would not comment pending the outcome of any review into the service. Gwenda Burns, chief executive of the Fertility Network, said patients were rightfully concerned: \u201cThe news of the potential closure of the department of reproductive medicine at St Mary\u2019s is extremely worrying.

Many hospitals across the country now limit visitors to just the mother-to-be and her partner in the delivery room, meaning doulas, who are recognized by hospitals only as visitors, are forced to support births virtually or not at all. Some are organizing and pushing back on hospital policies that exclude them from delivery rooms, but therein lies an ethical question: at what point does advocating for recognition and respect outweigh the risks of exposing others to the virus as non-medical visitors in a hospital? It\u2019s a debate saddled with historical tension between doulas and the western obstetrical healthcare system.</p> <p>For now, doulas are hastily translating their intimate and hands-on work on to impersonal virtual platforms, and preparing their clients for giving birth without them physically present. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to scramble to give support in a different way, and learn a new skill set really quickly,\u201d says Raychel Franzen, a New York-based doula. \u201cI think one of the things that a doula brings to their clients is a calm energy. We can still do that with facial expressions on a video call, but the energy exchange is just a little bit different.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You built this relationship, you fall in love with these people, you get excited about working with them, and then suddenly, you can\u2019t</p> <footer> <cite>Robin Douthit</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Gwynne Knap, an Atlanta-based doula, is also a faculty member of Childbirth and Postpartum Professional Association (Cappa), one of a few organizations nationwide that certifies doulas. Recently, Knap\u2019s work has revolved around teaching fellow doulas how to shift their offerings to reflect the circumstances \u2013 Cappa has developed <a href=\"https://cappa.net/2020/03/17/supporting-labor-clients-during-covid-19-pandemic/\">resources and suggestions</a> for doulas to support their clients virtually, such as having the woman\u2019s partner wear an earbud, the doula coaching through contractions over the phone. But some techniques used by birth workers to calm and comfort women during labor, like hand-holding and eye contact, are impossible to translate. \u201cA labor doula helps the mom a lot with comfort and suggested positions, but she also calms the partner so they can be more emotionally present,\u201d says Knap. \u201cWhen the doula\u2019s not there, it\u2019s very hard to do that.\u201d</p> <p>While some doulas have shifted to virtual support, others are pushing back against the new hospital policies and argue that hospitals shouldn\u2019t lump doulas in as regular \u201cvisitors\u201d, but rather as critical to ensure the mother\u2019s health. These doulas, along with birth advocacy groups, are organizing virtual town halls to strategize a unified pushback, circulating petitions against individual hospital policies, and distributing scripts for doulas to use when speaking to hospital administrators about the potentially harmful implications of restricting doulas from labor units. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B910K_hgUkK/\">In some cases</a>, that advocacy has resulted in hospitals adjusting their visitor policy to allow doulas, in addition to a partner or support person, on the labor floor.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a bonus or a luxury for someone to have care that is safe and respectful,\u201d says Cristen Pascucci, founder of Birth Monopoly, an online advocacy organization that focuses on birthing rights. They argue that for some patients, doulas are an essential part of ensuring a healthy, safe birth \u2013 especially for marginalized populations like women of color, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/26/black-maternal-mortality-babies-san-francisco-crisis\">particularly black women</a>, who bear the brunt of the maternal mortality crisis in America. There is <a href=\"https://www.cochrane.org/CD003766/PREG_continuous-support-women-during-childbirth\">evidence</a> that continuous, one-on-one birthing support, particularly from a doula, reduces the risk of dissatisfying or traumatic birth experiences, unplanned C-sections and low Apgar scores \u2013 the method physicians use to assess a newborn\u2019s health immediately after birth.</p> <p>\u201cThere are people who, I feel comfortable saying, <em>have</em> to have a doula to have a safe birth,\u201d Pascucci says. For women of color and low-income women, who statistically face bias from healthcare workers, and who suffer higher maternal mortality rates and worse birth outcomes as a result, a doula can act as a crucial mediator. Many doulas work closely with their clients to inform them about their rights as patients, and talk through the questions they can ask their providers about interventions before they happen.</p> <p>Some doulas also incorporate trauma-informed practices to mitigate the risk of a traumatic birth for more vulnerable women. \u201cFor a rape survivor who doesn\u2019t have a partner [with her], a doula is like a lifeline,\u201d says Pascucci.</p> <p>She adds: \u201cDoulas have been quietly filling in the gaps of the maternity care system for years and years. Now we have a crisis and the same system that doulas have been making up for, the first chance it got, was like, we still don\u2019t know what you do and we still don\u2019t appreciate you. So all of those gaps that doulas were filling are back.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"divider\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">divider</a> </figure>  <p><strong>In mid-March,</strong> the Association of Women\u2019s Health, Obstetric, and Neonatal Nurses (AWHONN) released a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AWHONN/photos/a.440709733800/10157817317008801/?type=3&amp;theater&amp;hc_location=ufi&amp;comment_id=Y29tbWVudDoyNTU3MDA2NDA0NTUwNjM5XzI1NTcwMDg0Mjc4ODM3NzA%3D\">statement</a> in support of allowing doulas into the delivery room. AWHONN member Shirley Picard, who is both a doula and a nurse in Rhode Island, spearheaded that effort. \u201cI felt it was important as a registered nurse, birth doula and nursing leader that women have their designated labor support companions be at their bedside as planned,\u201d she says. \u201cI also know that it\u2019s been difficult for doulas to advocate for themselves within the hospital infrastructure, hence why I felt it was important for AWHONN to be a leader here.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Doulas have been quietly filling in the gaps of the maternity care system for years and years</p> <footer> <cite>Cristen Pascucci</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For other nurses working on the frontlines, it\u2019s a tough call. One labor and delivery nurse in New Orleans, who asked to remain anonymous out of concern for her job, understands that she can never replace the role of a doula in the delivery room. \u201cDoulas provide an excellent service in that one-on-one care,\u201d she says. \u201cAs a nurse, I can\u2019t be in there to get you through every contraction.\u201d</p> <p>Her hospital\u2019s labor and delivery unit, which previously had minimal restrictions on non-patient visitors, now only allows one support person a patient, and only when they\u2019re actively in labor. (A patient kept overnight for blood pressure monitoring, for example, cannot have any visitors.) She has had to field frantic phone calls from women asking for their doula to be allowed in, only to tell them no. \u201cI think it\u2019s thrown a lot of women \u2013 this is their plan, and everything has been thrown off,\u201d she says. \u201cI think about how scary that must be.\u201d</p> <p>On the other hand, she works in a city <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/26/new-orleans-surviving-katrina-battles-covid-19-coronavirus\">besieged by the virus</a>. Every unit of her hospital, which is full, has been overrun with Covid-19 patients (including some in labor and delivery), and the hospital has run out of personal protective equipment for its staff.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re struggling,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re told to reuse our masks. We\u2019re told to wipe down our plastic gowns between uses. It\u2019s a very somber walk into the hospital each day. Because of what I\u2019ve seen, I think the fewer people in the hospital, the better.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Last month, Robin Douthit comforted an anxious client by breathing with her, demonstrating one long inhalation and an equally steady exhalation. The two women then did it together, breathing slowly and intentionally in sync. Breathwork is one of the tools that Douthit, 56, often reaches for when soothing clients. But this time, instead of sitting in the same room inhaling the same air, the women breathed together on Zoom. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating, right? I mean, you built this relationship, you fall in love with these people, you get excited about working with them, and then suddenly, you can\u2019t,\u201d she told me. As Covid-19 changes the way women experience pregnancy, doulas like Douthit are caught between a calling to guide their clients through childbirth and the limitations caused by the pandemic. Many hospitals across the country now limit visitors to just the mother-to-be and her partner in the delivery room, meaning doulas, who are recognized by hospitals only as visitors, are forced to support births virtually or not at all. Some are organizing and pushing back on hospital policies that exclude them from delivery rooms, but therein lies an ethical question: at what point does advocating for recognition and respect outweigh the risks of exposing others to the virus as non-medical visitors in a hospital? It\u2019s a debate saddled with historical tension between doulas and the western obstetrical healthcare system. For now, doulas are hastily translating their intimate and hands-on work on to impersonal virtual platforms, and preparing their clients for giving birth without them physically present. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to scramble to give support in a different way, and learn a new skill set really quickly,\u201d says Raychel Franzen, a New York-based doula. \u201cI think one of the things that a doula brings to their clients is a calm energy. We can still do that with facial expressions on a video call, but the energy exchange is just a little bit different.\u201d Gwynne Knap, an Atlanta-based doula, is also a faculty member of Childbirth and Postpartum Professional Association (Cappa), one of a few organizations nationwide that certifies doulas. Recently, Knap\u2019s work has revolved around teaching fellow doulas how to shift their offerings to reflect the circumstances \u2013 Cappa has developed resources and suggestions for doulas to support their clients virtually, such as having the woman\u2019s partner wear an earbud, the doula coaching through contractions over the phone. But some techniques used by birth workers to calm and comfort women during labor, like hand-holding and eye contact, are impossible to translate. \u201cA labor doula helps the mom a lot with comfort and suggested positions, but she also calms the partner so they can be more emotionally present,\u201d says Knap. \u201cWhen the doula\u2019s not there, it\u2019s very hard to do that.\u201d While some doulas have shifted to virtual support, others are pushing back against the new hospital policies and argue that hospitals shouldn\u2019t lump doulas in as regular \u201cvisitors\u201d, but rather as critical to ensure the mother\u2019s health. These doulas, along with birth advocacy groups, are organizing virtual town halls to strategize a unified pushback, circulating petitions against individual hospital policies, and distributing scripts for doulas to use when speaking to hospital administrators about the potentially harmful implications of restricting doulas from labor units. In some cases, that advocacy has resulted in hospitals adjusting their visitor policy to allow doulas, in addition to a partner or support person, on the labor floor. \u201cIt\u2019s not a bonus or a luxury for someone to have care that is safe and respectful,\u201d says Cristen Pascucci, founder of Birth Monopoly, an online advocacy organization that focuses on birthing rights. They argue that for some patients, doulas are an essential part of ensuring a healthy, safe birth \u2013 especially for marginalized populations like women of color, particularly black women, who bear the brunt of the maternal mortality crisis in America. There is evidence that continuous, one-on-one birthing support, particularly from a doula, reduces the risk of dissatisfying or traumatic birth experiences, unplanned C-sections and low Apgar scores \u2013 the method physicians use to assess a newborn\u2019s health immediately after birth. \u201cThere are people who, I feel comfortable saying, have to have a doula to have a safe birth,\u201d Pascucci says. For women of color and low-income women, who statistically face bias from healthcare workers, and who suffer higher maternal mortality rates and worse birth outcomes as a result, a doula can act as a crucial mediator. Many doulas work closely with their clients to inform them about their rights as patients, and talk through the questions they can ask their providers about interventions before they happen. Some doulas also incorporate trauma-informed practices to mitigate the risk of a traumatic birth for more vulnerable women. \u201cFor a rape survivor who doesn\u2019t have a partner [with her], a doula is like a lifeline,\u201d says Pascucci. She adds: \u201cDoulas have been quietly filling in the gaps of the maternity care system for years and years. Now we have a crisis and the same system that doulas have been making up for, the first chance it got, was like, we still don\u2019t know what you do and we still don\u2019t appreciate you. So all of those gaps that doulas were filling are back.\u201d In mid-March, the Association of Women\u2019s Health, Obstetric, and Neonatal Nurses (AWHONN) released a statement in support of allowing doulas into the delivery room. AWHONN member Shirley Picard, who is both a doula and a nurse in Rhode Island, spearheaded that effort. \u201cI felt it was important as a registered nurse, birth doula and nursing leader that women have their designated labor support companions be at their bedside as planned,\u201d she says. \u201cI also know that it\u2019s been difficult for doulas to advocate for themselves within the hospital infrastructure, hence why I felt it was important for AWHONN to be a leader here.\u201d For other nurses working on the frontlines, it\u2019s a tough call. One labor and delivery nurse in New Orleans, who asked to remain anonymous out of concern for her job, understands that she can never replace the role of a doula in the delivery room. \u201cDoulas provide an excellent service in that one-on-one care,\u201d she says. \u201cAs a nurse, I can\u2019t be in there to get you through every contraction.\u201d Her hospital\u2019s labor and delivery unit, which previously had minimal restrictions on non-patient visitors, now only allows one support person a patient, and only when they\u2019re actively in labor. (A patient kept overnight for blood pressure monitoring, for example, cannot have any visitors.) She has had to field frantic phone calls from women asking for their doula to be allowed in, only to tell them no. \u201cI think it\u2019s thrown a lot of women \u2013 this is their plan, and everything has been thrown off,\u201d she says. \u201cI think about how scary that must be.\u201d On the other hand, she works in a city besieged by the virus. Every unit of her hospital, which is full, has been overrun with Covid-19 patients (including some in labor and delivery), and the hospital has run out of personal protective equipment for its staff. \u201cWe\u2019re struggling,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re told to reuse our masks. We\u2019re told to wipe down our plastic gowns between uses. It\u2019s a very somber walk into the hospital each day. Because of what I\u2019ve seen, I think the fewer people in the hospital, the better.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>All of the UK\u2019s biggest airlines and most big holiday companies are systematically breaking the law by denying timely refunds to customers for travel cancelled during the pandemic, researchers have found.</p> <p>Consumer groups have warned that the sector risks permanently losing public confidence in booking travel, with Which? finding 20 of the UK\u2019s largest operators are illegally withholding refunds that should be paid within 14 days.</p> <p>Most have instead offered vouchers or credit notes, and customers have complained they have been unable to obtain refunds online or get through to make a claim on the phone.</p> <p>On Monday Ryanair started telling its customers that they will have to wait <a href=\"https://www.ryanair.com/ie/en/useful-info/refund-voucher\">until \u201cthe COVID-19 emergency has passed\u201d</a> if they want a refund for a cancelled flight. Initially, the Dublin-based carrier had said it would process refunds within 20 working days but soon started back-tracking.</p> <p>According to the travel industry\u2019s own estimates, up to \u00a37bn could be owed for cancelled trips. However, industry bodies such as Iata, for airlines, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/31/suspend-refund-rules-or-risk-uk-travel-industry-meltdown-warns-abta\">Abta, for travel firms, </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/31/suspend-refund-rules-or-risk-uk-travel-industry-meltdown-warns-abta\">say firms would be bankrupted</a> by repaying now as they are receiving no booking revenue.</p> <p>Confidence in booking is likely to have plunged further since the transport secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/travel-firms-angry-over-grant-shapps-no-summer-holiday-comment\">Grant Shapps, said on Friday that he would not book</a> a summer holiday now. The Foreign Office has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/apr/09/can-we-claim-travel-insurance-now-foreign-office-advice-indefinite-travel\">advised against non-essential foreign travel indefinitely</a>.</p> <p>Which?, the consumer association, said 20 of the UK\u2019s biggest biggest travel operators and airlines were breaking the law by not repaying money promptly. It has received thousands of complaints and requests for help from people struggling to secure refunds for cancelled trips, and said vouchers or credit notes could prove worthless if firms collapsed.</p> <p>However, it backed travel industry calls for the government to intervene, recognising that firms were under \u201cunprecedented strain\u201d and could go out of business should they process refunds immediately.</p> <p>While Which? said consumers\u2019 legal right to cash refunds should be protected, it recommended extending the processing deadline to 28 days, and for any vouchers to be guaranteed against insolvency and eventually redeemable for cash. It also called for a definitive timescale for Foreign Office travel warnings, and transparent travel insurance terms and conditions, to help restore confidence.</p> <p>Which? researchers found 10 of the UK\u2019s biggest holiday companies, including Love Holidays and Tui, are not offering full refunds within the legal limit of 14 days, with some only offering customers the choice of rebooking or a voucher. Some are withholding the air ticket price until received from the carrier.</p> <p>It also found almost all airlines are failing to refund passengers on time, with many customers unable to reach call centres to process complaints.</p> <p>Some carriers, such as Air France and KLM, have refused to offer refunds before a 12-month period has elapsed, issuing credit notes or allowing rebooking instead. Which? said it was \u201ca fair solution and a reasonable balance between the protection of their passengers and the operational realities that every airline has to face\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/31/suspend-refund-rules-or-risk-uk-travel-industry-meltdown-warns-abta\">Suspend refund rules or risk UK travel industry meltdown, warns Abta</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Passengers booking with carriers including easyJet, Ryanair and British Airways have told the Guardian they have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/apr/10/airlines-law-refunds-voucher-schemes-coronavirus\">unable to obtain refunds</a>. Ryanair has issued vouchers and told customers requesting refunds that they are in queue.

      "bodyText": "All of the UK\u2019s biggest airlines and most big holiday companies are systematically breaking the law by denying timely refunds to customers for travel cancelled during the pandemic, researchers have found. Consumer groups have warned that the sector risks permanently losing public confidence in booking travel, with Which? finding 20 of the UK\u2019s largest operators are illegally withholding refunds that should be paid within 14 days. Most have instead offered vouchers or credit notes, and customers have complained they have been unable to obtain refunds online or get through to make a claim on the phone. On Monday Ryanair started telling its customers that they will have to wait until \u201cthe COVID-19 emergency has passed\u201d if they want a refund for a cancelled flight. Initially, the Dublin-based carrier had said it would process refunds within 20 working days but soon started back-tracking. According to the travel industry\u2019s own estimates, up to \u00a37bn could be owed for cancelled trips. However, industry bodies such as Iata, for airlines, and Abta, for travel firms, say firms would be bankrupted by repaying now as they are receiving no booking revenue. Confidence in booking is likely to have plunged further since the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said on Friday that he would not book a summer holiday now. The Foreign Office has advised against non-essential foreign travel indefinitely. Which?, the consumer association, said 20 of the UK\u2019s biggest biggest travel operators and airlines were breaking the law by not repaying money promptly. It has received thousands of complaints and requests for help from people struggling to secure refunds for cancelled trips, and said vouchers or credit notes could prove worthless if firms collapsed. However, it backed travel industry calls for the government to intervene, recognising that firms were under \u201cunprecedented strain\u201d and could go out of business should they process refunds immediately. While Which? said consumers\u2019 legal right to cash refunds should be protected, it recommended extending the processing deadline to 28 days, and for any vouchers to be guaranteed against insolvency and eventually redeemable for cash. It also called for a definitive timescale for Foreign Office travel warnings, and transparent travel insurance terms and conditions, to help restore confidence. Which? researchers found 10 of the UK\u2019s biggest holiday companies, including Love Holidays and Tui, are not offering full refunds within the legal limit of 14 days, with some only offering customers the choice of rebooking or a voucher. Some are withholding the air ticket price until received from the carrier. It also found almost all airlines are failing to refund passengers on time, with many customers unable to reach call centres to process complaints. Some carriers, such as Air France and KLM, have refused to offer refunds before a 12-month period has elapsed, issuing credit notes or allowing rebooking instead. Which? said it was \u201ca fair solution and a reasonable balance between the protection of their passengers and the operational realities that every airline has to face\u201d. Passengers booking with carriers including easyJet, Ryanair and British Airways have told the Guardian they have been unable to obtain refunds. Ryanair has issued vouchers and told customers requesting refunds that they are in queue. BA and easyJet customers have complained that call centre numbers are not being answered. A spokesperson for Airlines UK said: \u201cAirlines are facing unprecedented challenges keeping vital routes open to repatriate stranded British travellers and transport critical medical supplies and PPE as part of cargo operations. Carriers are facing a far longer than usual volume of refund claims to get through and the current restrictions imposed nationally mean they are not able to bring in additional staff to deal with them. We are thankful to passengers for their continued patience.\u201d Rory Boland, of Which? Travel, said: \u201cWe do not want to see the industry suffer further as a result of this outbreak, but it cannot be on consumers to prop up airlines and travel firms, especially when so many will be in difficult financial situations of their own. \u201cThe government must urgently set out how it will support travel firms and airlines to ensure they can meet their legal obligations to refund customers for cancelled travel plans, and avoid permanent damage to trust and confidence in the travel industry.\u201d Some governments have already amended consumer legislation to allow deferred refunds, after calls from the airline body Iata. The Iata director general, Alexandre de Juniac, said earlier this month that refunding was \u201calmost unbearable, financially speaking\u201d, adding that airlines were \u201cperfectly conscious of the difficulty for the passenger \u2026 but it is a matter of survival\u201d. Abta said tour operators were being squeezed by refund requests for money that had been paid to suppliers, such as airlines and hotels, and not returned. Its chief executive, Mark Tanzer, said: \u201cThe UK government, despite repeated requests, has failed to recognise and respond to this reality, in stark contrast to the clear sensible actions taken by the European commission and many countries throughout Europe. \u201cWe fully understand and sympathise with the frustration that many customers may be feeling.

Senior Navy commanders would be reassigned, he said. \u201cThose who should be punished will be punished,\u201d he said. The itinerary of the ship was not clear. Democratic Progressive party legislator, Wang Ting-yu, wrote on Facebook that the ship took 19 days to return because they stopped for \u201ca confidential mission\u201d. \u201cThey were not on vacation and people shouldn\u2019t be too harsh on the mission and the Navy,\u201d he said.",

These qualities will become especially important when we are through the worst, and \u201cStarmer or Johnson?\u201d becomes the choice of prime minister. They are qualities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/20/boris-johnson-sunday-times-prime-minister-coronavirus\">Boris Johnson proudly lacks</a>, one of the reasons the UK has been so badly hit.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/16/gordon-brown-on-covid-19-recession-and-trump-when-theres-a-crisis-you-have-to-act-quickly\">Gordon Brown</a> has had helpful things to say, based on experience, about managing financial crisis. <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/2020/04/tony-blair-how-government-can-achieve-credible-lockdown-exit-strategy\">Tony Blair</a>, too, has useful things to say about reordering government around the current challenges on issues such as mass testing, contact tracing, PPE, business, vaccine development, schools, use of technology, social distancing and compliance, travel, and communications. He has suggestions on structure too \u2013 an expert task force on each challenge.</p> <p>Whether the government heeds Blair or not, this is not a bad way for the opposition to reorder its approach. There are many experts, academics, business figures, unions, charities and campaign groups that feel they are not being heard by government. There are scientists who feel the experts deployed at No 10 briefings are too establishment, too secretive, and not challenging enough of ministers. Mobilising them around the challenges Blair prioritised would bring greater rigour and effectiveness to the opposition operation.</p> <p>In his leadership acceptance speech, Starmer set a sensible tone \u2013 supportive of government objectives, but questioning and scrutinising in a reasonable manner. Yet when so many are dying, so many targets are unmet, so many NHS and care workers are going to work unprotected, and so many mistakes have been made, Labour should frankly show no mercy on issues such as PPE and testing. I keep thinking what John Smith \u2013 Blair\u2019s predecessor as Labour leader, and like Starmer a QC \u2013 would have made of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/turkish-ppe-flight-only-slim-chance-goods-will-arrive-in-uk-today\">Turkish plane farce</a>. There would be no holding back. In interviews with some of Starmer\u2019s team, there has been too much \u201cnow is not the time for criticism, those questions can wait\u201d for a crisis of this scale.</p> <p>Ministers should be treated with fairness, because they have enormous responsibility and pressure. But they must be challenged. It is not challenging and questioning per se that helps them do their jobs better; it is that it forces them to amass arguments, data and information, so it is all there at their fingertips.</p> <p>Starmer rightly pressed the government for the parameters of a lockdown exit strategy. Even better, Labour must develop its own ideas about the exit, to show not only that it asks the right questions, but has answers. The shadow cabinet must, with proper expert advice, be a credible alternative government.<br></p> <p>Much of the focus will fall on Starmer. But every single shadow minister must be empowered to challenge, cajole, offer alternatives and challenge the government to answer one of the best questions in politics: \u201cWhy not?\u201d In showing diligence and attention to detail, and by making intelligent suggestions and proposals, they will demonstrate their capability.</p> <p>Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds must work to develop a profile as high as her predecessor, John McDonnell, because ultimately the future of the economy, and what kind of values underpin our society in a world of turmoil, is where the main post-crisis arguments are going to fall.<br></p> <p>It is easy to overlook the fact that, Starmer\u2019s role as director of public prosecutions apart, none of the people in the top shadow jobs have senior government experience. But nor did Blair or Brown; nor did John Prescott, or Robin Cook, who ran the Major government ragged before, during and after the Scott inquiry (on Iraq arms sales). What they and others had was real hunger, energy, drive; a determination to ferret out detail the government wanted hidden; an ability to make the media sit up and take notice because of what they were saying and how they were saying it. There can be no soft-pedalling. Oppositions have to win power; governments will do everything they can not to lose it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/21/parliament-returns-covid-19-constructive-politics\">As parliament returns, Covid-19 shows why we need more constructive politics | Rafael Behr</a> </p> </aside>  <p>From my years in opposition working with Blair I remember that, even at the time of the Dunblane school massacre, as sensitive a time as could be imagined, Labour had a different approach on the issue of firearms, and pressed it, sensitively. And in government, when Blair and Brown faced crises \u2013 foot-and-mouth, fuel protests, times of war \u2013 the Tories were never backward in coming forward to attack, so Labour should not fall for the current line from the right that their role is to support the government.</p> <p>It has been noticeable how rarely, at government briefings and interviews, questions have been framed by things Labour has said or done; that must change. Labour needs to be thinktank, policy expert, advocate for real people in difficulty, and campaign organiser all in one. Backbenchers too are vital in this. There are so many causes and campaigns arising from this crisis.<br></p> <p>Up till now, No 10 briefings, at which both government presentation and media questioning have generally been poor, have provided the main focus for questioning ministers. Now that parliament is back, albeit in a highly unusual form, Labour has the chance to show it can do a better job of holding the government to account than the media; and a better job than the government in showing what needs to be done, and how.</p> <p>Seizing that opportunity will go a long way towards the public deciding whether the long, wasted years of unelectability are behind us, and a credible alternative government now exists.</p> <p>\u2022 Alastair Campbell was Tony Blair\u2019s press secretary and director of communications from 1994-2003<br><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "It has been both a curse and a blessing for Keir Starmer that he has become Labour leader amid a global pandemic. A curse because in normal times his arrival would be huge news, an opportunity quickly to establish himself firmly in the national conversation; yet in a crisis the last thing the public wants is politics as usual, so this limits his chance to be heard. A blessing, because the current situation plays to Starmer\u2019s strengths \u2013 he is serious, forensic, consensus-seeking, and has a strong grasp of detail. These qualities will become especially important when we are through the worst, and \u201cStarmer or Johnson?\u201d becomes the choice of prime minister. They are qualities Boris Johnson proudly lacks, one of the reasons the UK has been so badly hit. Gordon Brown has had helpful things to say, based on experience, about managing financial crisis. Tony Blair, too, has useful things to say about reordering government around the current challenges on issues such as mass testing, contact tracing, PPE, business, vaccine development, schools, use of technology, social distancing and compliance, travel, and communications. He has suggestions on structure too \u2013 an expert task force on each challenge. Whether the government heeds Blair or not, this is not a bad way for the opposition to reorder its approach. There are many experts, academics, business figures, unions, charities and campaign groups that feel they are not being heard by government. There are scientists who feel the experts deployed at No 10 briefings are too establishment, too secretive, and not challenging enough of ministers. Mobilising them around the challenges Blair prioritised would bring greater rigour and effectiveness to the opposition operation. In his leadership acceptance speech, Starmer set a sensible tone \u2013 supportive of government objectives, but questioning and scrutinising in a reasonable manner. Yet when so many are dying, so many targets are unmet, so many NHS and care workers are going to work unprotected, and so many mistakes have been made, Labour should frankly show no mercy on issues such as PPE and testing. I keep thinking what John Smith \u2013 Blair\u2019s predecessor as Labour leader, and like Starmer a QC \u2013 would have made of the Turkish plane farce. There would be no holding back. In interviews with some of Starmer\u2019s team, there has been too much \u201cnow is not the time for criticism, those questions can wait\u201d for a crisis of this scale. Ministers should be treated with fairness, because they have enormous responsibility and pressure. But they must be challenged. It is not challenging and questioning per se that helps them do their jobs better; it is that it forces them to amass arguments, data and information, so it is all there at their fingertips. Starmer rightly pressed the government for the parameters of a lockdown exit strategy. Even better, Labour must develop its own ideas about the exit, to show not only that it asks the right questions, but has answers. The shadow cabinet must, with proper expert advice, be a credible alternative government. Much of the focus will fall on Starmer. But every single shadow minister must be empowered to challenge, cajole, offer alternatives and challenge the government to answer one of the best questions in politics: \u201cWhy not?\u201d In showing diligence and attention to detail, and by making intelligent suggestions and proposals, they will demonstrate their capability. Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds must work to develop a profile as high as her predecessor, John McDonnell, because ultimately the future of the economy, and what kind of values underpin our society in a world of turmoil, is where the main post-crisis arguments are going to fall. It is easy to overlook the fact that, Starmer\u2019s role as director of public prosecutions apart, none of the people in the top shadow jobs have senior government experience. But nor did Blair or Brown; nor did John Prescott, or Robin Cook, who ran the Major government ragged before, during and after the Scott inquiry (on Iraq arms sales). What they and others had was real hunger, energy, drive; a determination to ferret out detail the government wanted hidden; an ability to make the media sit up and take notice because of what they were saying and how they were saying it. There can be no soft-pedalling. Oppositions have to win power; governments will do everything they can not to lose it. From my years in opposition working with Blair I remember that, even at the time of the Dunblane school massacre, as sensitive a time as could be imagined, Labour had a different approach on the issue of firearms, and pressed it, sensitively. And in government, when Blair and Brown faced crises \u2013 foot-and-mouth, fuel protests, times of war \u2013 the Tories were never backward in coming forward to attack, so Labour should not fall for the current line from the right that their role is to support the government. It has been noticeable how rarely, at government briefings and interviews, questions have been framed by things Labour has said or done; that must change. Labour needs to be thinktank, policy expert, advocate for real people in difficulty, and campaign organiser all in one. Backbenchers too are vital in this. There are so many causes and campaigns arising from this crisis. Up till now, No 10 briefings, at which both government presentation and media questioning have generally been poor, have provided the main focus for questioning ministers. Now that parliament is back, albeit in a highly unusual form, Labour has the chance to show it can do a better job of holding the government to account than the media; and a better job than the government in showing what needs to be done, and how. Seizing that opportunity will go a long way towards the public deciding whether the long, wasted years of unelectability are behind us, and a credible alternative government now exists. \u2022 Alastair Campbell was Tony Blair\u2019s press secretary and director of communications from 1994-2003",

NatWest no longer automatically replaces chequebooks and its guidance on how to order a new one requires customers either to have an online account or visit a branch or ATM. This is obviously no longer possible for customers who are most likely to need one. A chequebook has now reached you and NatWest says it has set up a dedicated phone line \u2013 0800 0514 177 - for customers over 70, those in extended self isolation and NHS workers.</p> <p><em><strong>If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer.co.uk.

Airbnb says: \u201cWe were concerned to learn about this situation, and provided the guests with our support throughout. The health of the public and our communities is our priority, and we have introduced measures and guidance for hosts and guests that are regularly updated and in line with the latest government advice.\u201d I have to stay in, so how do I get a chequebook? I am 81 and last week I used my last cheque. I\u2019ve tried so many times to get through to NatWest on the phone to ask for a new one. I know they want us to bank online, but I do not want to. In this difficult time, where we have to stay in, I\u2019m stumped. I can\u2019t be the only person in this situation. MJ, London Cheques are, quite literally, a lifeline for older people in self isolation who are relying on neighbours to shop for them and can\u2019t get to an ATM. NatWest no longer automatically replaces chequebooks and its guidance on how to order a new one requires customers either to have an online account or visit a branch or ATM. This is obviously no longer possible for customers who are most likely to need one. A chequebook has now reached you and NatWest says it has set up a dedicated phone line \u2013 0800 0514 177 - for customers over 70, those in extended self isolation and NHS workers.

      "bodyText": "Shortly after the 9/11 attacks in New York City, a museum on the Upper West Side, the New-York Historical Society, began collecting items from the tragedy \u2013 from scraps of the World Trade Center to public signage, letters and firefighter helmets. \u201cThere was little time to collect the debris that was littering downtown streets \u2013 trash to some, but treasure to us,\u201d said the museum\u2019s former president Kenneth T Jackson. Now, they\u2019re turning to the coronavirus pandemic to build on their History Responds collection. The museum is collecting ephemera, photographs and personal items from New Yorkers that detail the current crisis. \u201cThis is a history that everyone will be looking back on,\u201d said Margi Hofer, museum director. \u201cWe hope people will be able to learn from it and be better prepared in an event like this in the future. To be better prepared to cope, as well.\u201d The coronavirus collection follows in the same vein as their 9/11 collection, which includes objects, images and stories connected to the people of New York, and the world. In the case of the coronavirus, there will be a focus on health and medicine, household items, life under quarantine and social distancing. They\u2019re also planning to feature new product design in relation to the virus, as well as public art and community projects. \u201cWe started collecting mid-March,\u201d said Hofer. \u201cWe were already alert to what items might be potential for collecting \u2013 hand sanitizer, masks, gloves \u2013 now evolved to a bigger story than we\u2019ve imagined.\u201d Among the items they have already collected, there is a photo of Alan Balicki, one of the museum\u2019s conservators, seated at a sewing machine making fabric face masks. \u201cIt taps into the variety and creativity of DIY face masks, which will be an interesting angle to explore down the road,\u201d said Hofer.

When it comes to nepotism there\u2019s a pithy response: \u201cAccusations of nepotism?\u201d he asks, rhetorically. \u201cThey\u2019re not accusations \u2013 they\u2019re facts.

At Cape Town in the notorious ball-tampering match of 2018 he was the third umpire and it was his job to inform the on-field umpires what was about to be shown on the screens.

In this exclusive interview with Guardian Australia in the wake of his memoirs, he demonstrates that he hasn\u2019t abandoned his sharp-edged views on Australian politics. 2. Brisbane man pleads guilty to 23-day attack on woman who was beaten, raped and burned Nicholas John Crilley, 34, pleaded guilty to 54 offences, including grievous bodily harm, deprivation of liberty and torture, following the 23-day attack in June 2017. 3. Nova Scotia shooting: death toll rises to 22 as more victims identified The total number of deaths from the attack reached 23, including the gunman. The newly identified victims included a woman out for a walk, a care aide on duty, and a volunteer firefighter. 4. Rafe Spall: \u2018Dieting is the opposite of sex!\u2019 \u2018Spall expects to be asked about two things in interviews: his weight loss and his father. When it comes to nepotism there\u2019s a pithy response: \u201cAccusations of nepotism?\u201d he asks, rhetorically. \u201cThey\u2019re not accusations \u2013 they\u2019re facts. I benefited from nepotism.\u201d On his weight loss (he shifted five stones before the romcom gig), he\u2019s more guarded now.\u2019 5. University Challenge final \u2013 reviewed by last year\u2019s winner \u2018Their dominance on the buzzer continued after the music round, with captain Caleb Rich coming into his own with six stunning starters in the second half that brought his team to an astonishing 275 points at the gong. To put that into perspective, that is more than the combined score of both teams in some finals. And that, ultimately, is what made this final so special.\u2019 6. Here\u2019s to Ian Gould: umpire and cockney who won over cricket\u2019s finest \u2018He gained the reputation of being calm and trustworthy in a crisis. At Cape Town in the notorious ball-tampering match of 2018 he was the third umpire and it was his job to inform the on-field umpires what was about to be shown on the screens. He kept them on an even keel, beginning with: \u201cThey\u2019ve got some pictures for you and they\u2019re not of Table Mountain.\u201d\u2019 7. From Downton to Belgravia: a guide to the posh programmes of Julian Fellowes \u2018\u201cAnd what shall one write about today, hmm?\u201d The question is, of course, rhetorical. Fellowes will write about period-specific toffs and their plucky, plebbish subordinates and he will call it Downton Abbey. Then, following a brief phone call from his agent, Fellowes will grudgingly proceed to cross out the words Downton Abbey and in their place write something like \u201cBelgravia\u201d or \u201cThe English Game\u201d instead.\u2019 8. The Truth About Amazon review \u2013 a punters\u2019 guide to the retail giant\u2019s jungle \u2018Sharon and Ian estimate they spend about \u00a3200 a month at the online store but it\u2019s actually around \u00a3800. The first scales begin to fall from their eyes when they are shown how to buy products more cheaply from Amazon\u2019s sites in other countries and are introduced to price tracker websites that show them how even prices here, which they had assumed were fixed (and by extension fair) actually fluctuate wildly.\u2019 9.

Activists are also using the digital strikes to create Twitter storms, bombarding companies and people in power with tweets at a set time. Last month, FFF Digital and the Polluters Out campaign teamed up to target Shell and the Adani Group, demanding a stop to new fossil fuel projects. This new reliance on social media has created challenges and opportunities. For Leah Namugerwa, a 15-year old striker from Kampala, it has allowed her to better promote her online petition for Uganda to ban plastic bags, but it has also made it difficult for her to reach people. \u201cMy activism and message targets policymakers and people in power, but social media in Uganda isn\u2019t widely used, especially by elder people in positions of power,\u201d she says. Deniz \u00c7evikus, 12, from Istanbul, who usually protests alone, enjoys talking to more people online. \u201cDuring a typical solo strike I can talk to 20 or 30 people at most, but with the same [digital] strike I can reach thousands of people on social media,\u201d she says. \u201cStriking before the virus was more challenging because I skipped school every Friday, missed classes, had to make up for them later and stood for a few hours in cold weather. My persistence to strike at a different location each week made it even harder. This feels a bit like vacation.\u201d Dylan Hamilton, 15, from Linlithgow in Scotland, has dabbled with the video platform TikTok as a means of connecting with other young people. \u201cI think it\u2019s quite a good way of getting people involved. And also, we are just teenagers, so it\u2019s nice to be a normal teenager and communicate with other teenagers that way.\u201d While the activists are embracing the potential for social media to help them get their message across in new ways, most agree they cannot wait to return to traditional on-the-ground campaigning. \u201cWe are more present on the streets, and we know it\u2019s not a social media bubble \u2013 we\u2019re reaching every single person that walks by us, not just the people who are already worried about the climate crisis,\u201d Nielsen says. As the pandemic dominates headlines, the climate movement is trying to strike a difficult balance between continuing to stress the urgency of its cause while allowing space for coronavirus to take priority. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to keep talking about climate change, but we also get that we need to focus on the coronavirus,\u201d says Hamilton. \u201cWe know that you can\u2019t do everything all at once.\u201d There is concern that the climate crisis could be sidelined for months if not longer, and that interest in climate strikes could dwindle \u2013 not least because the rebellious act of striking from school is not as powerful when schools are closed. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost a bit of motivation,\u201d Hamilton adds. \u201cWe don\u2019t know when we\u2019re going to be able to do the big protests again.\u201d But there is still cause for optimism. Many hope a break from continuous campaigning might bring activists back stronger, while among the tragedy of the pandemic the world has shown at least that it can change. \u201cSeeing how things shifted so quickly gives us hope,\u201d says Palmer. \u201cWhen politicians tell us things don\u2019t happen that fast, this is just evidence that it can be done. This was such a rapid response to a crisis. If we also treat the climate crisis like an emergency, like an imminent threat, it is definitely possible for us to achieve the world that we want.\u201d",

The ship\u2019s senior doctor, Dr Ilse von Watzdorf, said this was a symptom of \u201cpotential Covid-19\u201d and she was \u201csurprised\u201d that 2,700 passengers had been allowed to disembark from the virus-hit cruise ship without waiting for coronavirus test results. Nationally, more than 600 people have contracted Covid-19 and 21 people have died after travelling on the Ruby Princess cruise ship, which made two trips between Sydney and New Zealand in March. One hundred and seventy-one crew on board the ship, which is still in Australian waters, have also tested positive. On Monday, a special commission of inquiry, chaired by barrister Bret Walker SC questioned the ship\u2019s senior doctor, via video link, as she is quarantined on board the ship. Von Watzdorf said she would not have allowed passengers off the ship without testing them for Covid-19 and receiving the results. \u201cI was surprised that we were allowed to do that without waiting for the results to come through,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it was my decision I would\u2019ve perhaps waited like the previous time.\u201d The counsel assisting the special commission, Richard Beasley SC, said the ship filled out a \u201chuman health\u201d report on 18 March that said 128 people had become ill in the past 14 days, and 24 had temperatures above 38C. The ship\u2019s log also showed that a crew member registered a temperature of 39.2C and was swabbed, but tested negative for both influenza A and B, on 18 March. \u201cDoes that amount to that crew member showing symptoms of Covid-19?\u201d Walker asked. \u201cYes, those symptoms are potential Covid-19,\u201d Von Watzdorf said. Beasley also told the inquiry that Von Watzdorf had denied there was a potential spread of disease on board while filling out a form for Australian officials. \u201cOne of the questions you are asked in that form is, \u2018Was there any situation on board which may lead to infection or spread of disease\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the answer given is \u2018N\u2019 for no. What is the explanation for no to that question?\u201d Due to technical issues, Von Watzdorf was not able to see a copy of the form on Wednesday, and told the inquiry that the question could have been in a section specifically about gastrointestinal issues. \u201cTypically that question would be linked to an outbreak of gastroenteritis,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel very disadvantaged by answering a question about a sheet I cannot see, and the context.\u201d Commissioner Walker asked: \u201cYou, as a doctor, would not read your human health report as revealing no signs of Covid-19?\u201d Von Watzdorf responded: \u201cLet me put it this way: if somebody asked me was this consistent with Covid-19, I would have said yes.\u201d The inquiry also heard from Sebastiano Azzarelli, the ship\u2019s staff captain, who was effectively second in command. Azzarelli came aboard the Ruby Princess on 18 February in Auckland. He confirmed he was present for a phone call from the ship\u2019s bridge to the Sydney vessel traffic services (VTS) in the early moments of 19 March, as the ship pulled into Sydney harbour.

We have to show you can have a stable environment and your job, too.\u201d The problems in the natural world haven\u2019t suddenly vanished \u2013 this week various researchers found that the Arctic is very likely to be free of sea ice in summers before 2050, that the bushfires that torched Australia earlier this year released more carbon than the country\u2019s annual CO2 output and that the first quarter of 2020 was the second-warmest on record. Donald Trump has signaled that he will try to provide a bailout to the US oil and gas industry, with $25bn already handed out by the US government to prop up airlines. In China, it\u2019s not certain that the wildlife-packed \u201cwet markets\u201d where Covid-19 is believed to have originated will be shut down. Conservationists warn that returning the world to its pre-pandemic settings will quickly wipe out any environmental benefits of the shutdown. \u201cIt\u2019s a serious wake-up call,\u201d said Thomas Lovejoy, an ecologist who coined the term \u201cbiological diversity\u201d. \u201cWe bulldoze into the last remaining places in nature and then are surprised when something like this happens. We have done this to ourselves by our continual intrusion into nature. We have to re-chart our course.\u201d This story is a part of Covering Climate Now\u2019s week of coverage focused on Climate Solutions, to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.

      "bodyText": "The Australian government is to spend $94m to begin building up a stockpile of crude oil \u2013 but will initially store the fuel in the United States. The move is intended to ease longstanding concerns about Australia\u2019s fuel security in the event of a major disruption, such as military conflict, and comes at a time when fuel prices are at historic lows. But the location of the storage on the other side of the Pacific Ocean has drawn ridicule from the federal opposition, which says the \u201cbizarre\u201d plan will not help if sea lanes are closed due to global tensions. Under International Energy Agency rules, each country has an obligation to hold emergency oil stocks equivalent to at least 90 days of net oil imports as part of planning to avoid a hit from any major disruption to oil supplies. But Australia\u2019s stocks were equivalent to just 55 days as of December, according to the latest Australian Petroleum Statistics. The energy minister, Angus Taylor, said the government would \u201ctake advantage of historically low fuel prices across the world right now\u201d to begin building a national oil reserve. Taylor said it would be stored in the US at first because Australia currently did not have the storage space at home, but the government would work with industry to expand local storage capacity in the longer term. Australian government-owned crude oil would be placed in the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which Taylor described as \u201camongst the world\u2019s most cost-effective long-term oil storage facilities\u201d. Under a recent deal with the US, Australia has access to that storage facility for an initial period of 10 years. Taylor characterised the $94m earmarked to buy the oil as \u201ca down payment on a stronger and more secure fuel supply for Australian households, motorists, industry and the national economy\u201d. \u201cWe will be establishing and are establishing a strategic fuel reserve that can ensure, even in the event there is a global disruption that slows fuel supplies moving around the world, we will get access to the fuel we need to keep our country going,\u201d he told reporters in Canberra. The government also flagged temporary changes to fuel standards to provide relief to Australian refineries during the coronavirus pandemic. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said the location of the storage in the US was \u201crather bizarre\u201d and did not protect Australia\u2019s national interest. \u201cThe United States isn\u2019t New Zealand. I mean, it\u2019s not next door,\u201d Albanese told the ABC. \u201cIf there\u2019s the sort of international conflict or issues that provide disruption to sea lanes that may well occur at some stage in the future, then that is why nation states need to have this fuel capacity.\u201d Albanese called on the government to develop a plan for refining capacity and storage at home. Labor went to last year\u2019s election with a pledge to design a government-owned national fuel reserve to boost emergency supplies. Taylor\u2019s statement said that as of the end of February, Australia had 81 days\u2019 worth of oil supplies \u2013 but that tally includes 25 days of stocks in overseas ports and in transit.",

As the at-home boredom grows, Cardi B is turning her streams into Bronx-flavored remakes of Pod Save America, interviewing Senator Bernie Sanders and cutting into mangos with her 4in acrylic nails. Drake\u2019s fragile ego is shining through showy displays of his mansion. And then there is Tekashi 6ix9ine, who has wasted no time returning to social media and buying expensive cars (where is he driving to right now?) after being released from prison early due to coronavirus fears. Their ability to spend hours on Instagram Live is hard to keep up with, but thankfully we\u2019re keeping track. After last month\u2019s first installment featuring shaved eyebrows and isolation nudes, here are some of the latest antics from hip-hop stars under quarantine.

      "body": "<p>As the US grapples with when \u2013 and how \u2013 Americans can return to work about 27,000 Boeing employees are preparing to resume commercial airplane production in Washington state this week. The move is being closely watched.</p> <p>The decision came almost a month after the company halted work at facilities in the state in response to the mounting threat of the virus. Boeing is the US\u2019s largest export manufacturer and its peers are carefully monitoring the company\u2019s decision to get back to work.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/06/boeing-culture-concealment-fatal-737-max-crashes-report\">Boeing's 'culture of concealment' led to fatal 737 Max crashes, report finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But with at least two weeks still to go before Washington governor Jay Inslee\u2019s stay-home mandate is set to expire, which involves the closure of all non-essential companies (Boeing is considered essential), and potentially even longer before comprehensive coronavirus testing is in place, some employees say they are worried for their safety and are questioning why Boeing is rushing to open its doors in the middle of a pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cPart of me feels thankful that we\u2019re still employed, but the other part of me is kind of scared,\u201d said a Boeing employee who works in production support for the 767 airplane and will return to the facility in Everett, Washington, on Tuesday. She asked not to be identified to protect her job.</p> <p>The employee, who has asthma, said she was up until 4am the previous night, worried about being able to stay healthy on the job.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just scary to me, because I know what it feels like to not be able to breathe,\u201d said the employee, who has worked for the company for over a decade. \u201cThe way this disease gets you, you just basically suffocate.\u201d</p> <p>Boeing also restarted work at production facilities in the Philadelphia area this week. Pennsylvania has a stay-at-home order in place for non-essential workers until 8 May that has led to protests by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/20/us-protests-lockdown-coronavirus-cases-surge-warning\">anti-lockdown groups</a>.</p> <p>In a statement released last week, Boeing said it would require face coverings, offer voluntary temperature screening and stagger start times so there will be fewer employees coming and going at the same time.</p> <p>\u201cThis phased approach ensures we have a reliable supply base, our personal protective equipment is readily available and we have all of the necessary safety measures in place to resume essential work for our customers,\u201d Stan Deal, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes and senior executive in the Pacific north-west, said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c841455d564e4d2151ec842157d5d9309bfe1f12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c841455d564e4d2151ec842157d5d9309bfe1f12/0_728_5058_3035/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Workers arrive at the Boeing facility in Renton, Washington, on 21 April.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Workers arrive at the Boeing facility in Renton, Washington, on 21 April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Brashear/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The company also said all employees able to work from home can continue to do so. And if a worker does get coronavirus, officials will conduct contact tracing to limit the risk to other workers.</p> <p>\u201cWe have talked about the prospect of Boeing reopening because they are essential, and I\u2019m glad they\u2019ve committed to a robust use of PPE [personal protective equipment] and workplace hygiene,\u201d Inslee said during a press conference. \u201cWe hope to get more details on that, and our agencies will keep talking with them to ensure workers feel safe going to work.\u201d</p> <p>Washington, which reported the first case of coronavirus in the US and for weeks documented the most cases in the country, has since made progress with flattening the curve of infections thanks to its early and comprehensive response.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/apr/20/coronavirus-map-of-the-us-latest-cases-state-by-state\">as numbers continue to rise</a>, officials have been wary about easing restrictions. As of Saturday, the state has confirmed more than 11,700 cases, including 634 deaths.</p> <p>More than a dozen Boeing employees in the Puget Sound region have been infected with coronavirus, including one worker in Everett who died after getting the virus, according to <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/\">the Seattle Times.</a></p> <p>In a letter sent to members of the International Association of Machinists (IAM) District 751, which represents about 32,000 Boeing machinists in the Puget Sound region, the union clarified that employees do have the option to stay home.</p> <p>If an employee is high-risk, needs to care for children, has a sick family member, or is simply worried about working at the facilities during the pandemic, they can use vacation, sick leave or excused leave without pay (LWOP), the letter explained. Some of these employees may also qualify for unemployment insurance benefits.</p> <p>But for those who will be returning, the letter stressed that they \u201chave a right to a safe work environment and should be provided with all the proper personal protective equipment\u201d.</p> <p>After the news broke that Boeing would be reopening its facilities in Washington, workers and local community members alike took to social media to speak out. While there were some who expressed their relief that the facilities were opening and predicted this could prompt additional businesses to follow suit, many others voiced their concern about what this could mean for their health and that of their loved ones.</p> <p>One woman <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/seattletimes/posts/10158081231056215\">posted on Facebook </a>that she is a pregnant wife of a Boeing employee and wants the facilities to stay closed until it is safe.</p> <p>\u201cPutting your life and possibly a unborn child\u2019s [sic] life in jeopardy isn\u2019t something I\u2019d like to do thank you very much! How are they going to prevent this from spreading,\u201d she wrote.</p> <p>An inspector at Boeing, who works off-site at the company\u2019s supplier partners, told the Guardian that he\u2019s not as concerned for his safety at work, as he believes the threat of the virus has been \u201csomewhat blown out of proportion\u201d. But the employee, who will return to work on Wednesday, questioned Boeing\u2019s classification as essential and the fact that it is reopening before the stay-home order expires.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not anywhere near essential,\u201d said the worker, who asked for his name to not be included to protect his job. \u201cI\u2019m not an emergency responder, I don\u2019t work in the food service industry. How is what I do essential to the economy other than helping to keep those suppliers running?\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "As the US grapples with when \u2013 and how \u2013 Americans can return to work about 27,000 Boeing employees are preparing to resume commercial airplane production in Washington state this week. The move is being closely watched. The decision came almost a month after the company halted work at facilities in the state in response to the mounting threat of the virus. Boeing is the US\u2019s largest export manufacturer and its peers are carefully monitoring the company\u2019s decision to get back to work. But with at least two weeks still to go before Washington governor Jay Inslee\u2019s stay-home mandate is set to expire, which involves the closure of all non-essential companies (Boeing is considered essential), and potentially even longer before comprehensive coronavirus testing is in place, some employees say they are worried for their safety and are questioning why Boeing is rushing to open its doors in the middle of a pandemic. \u201cPart of me feels thankful that we\u2019re still employed, but the other part of me is kind of scared,\u201d said a Boeing employee who works in production support for the 767 airplane and will return to the facility in Everett, Washington, on Tuesday. She asked not to be identified to protect her job. The employee, who has asthma, said she was up until 4am the previous night, worried about being able to stay healthy on the job. \u201cIt\u2019s just scary to me, because I know what it feels like to not be able to breathe,\u201d said the employee, who has worked for the company for over a decade. \u201cThe way this disease gets you, you just basically suffocate.\u201d Boeing also restarted work at production facilities in the Philadelphia area this week. Pennsylvania has a stay-at-home order in place for non-essential workers until 8 May that has led to protests by anti-lockdown groups. In a statement released last week, Boeing said it would require face coverings, offer voluntary temperature screening and stagger start times so there will be fewer employees coming and going at the same time. \u201cThis phased approach ensures we have a reliable supply base, our personal protective equipment is readily available and we have all of the necessary safety measures in place to resume essential work for our customers,\u201d Stan Deal, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes and senior executive in the Pacific north-west, said. The company also said all employees able to work from home can continue to do so. And if a worker does get coronavirus, officials will conduct contact tracing to limit the risk to other workers. \u201cWe have talked about the prospect of Boeing reopening because they are essential, and I\u2019m glad they\u2019ve committed to a robust use of PPE [personal protective equipment] and workplace hygiene,\u201d Inslee said during a press conference. \u201cWe hope to get more details on that, and our agencies will keep talking with them to ensure workers feel safe going to work.\u201d Washington, which reported the first case of coronavirus in the US and for weeks documented the most cases in the country, has since made progress with flattening the curve of infections thanks to its early and comprehensive response. But as numbers continue to rise, officials have been wary about easing restrictions. As of Saturday, the state has confirmed more than 11,700 cases, including 634 deaths. More than a dozen Boeing employees in the Puget Sound region have been infected with coronavirus, including one worker in Everett who died after getting the virus, according to the Seattle Times. In a letter sent to members of the International Association of Machinists (IAM) District 751, which represents about 32,000 Boeing machinists in the Puget Sound region, the union clarified that employees do have the option to stay home. If an employee is high-risk, needs to care for children, has a sick family member, or is simply worried about working at the facilities during the pandemic, they can use vacation, sick leave or excused leave without pay (LWOP), the letter explained. Some of these employees may also qualify for unemployment insurance benefits. But for those who will be returning, the letter stressed that they \u201chave a right to a safe work environment and should be provided with all the proper personal protective equipment\u201d. After the news broke that Boeing would be reopening its facilities in Washington, workers and local community members alike took to social media to speak out. While there were some who expressed their relief that the facilities were opening and predicted this could prompt additional businesses to follow suit, many others voiced their concern about what this could mean for their health and that of their loved ones. One woman posted on Facebook that she is a pregnant wife of a Boeing employee and wants the facilities to stay closed until it is safe. \u201cPutting your life and possibly a unborn child\u2019s [sic] life in jeopardy isn\u2019t something I\u2019d like to do thank you very much! How are they going to prevent this from spreading,\u201d she wrote. An inspector at Boeing, who works off-site at the company\u2019s supplier partners, told the Guardian that he\u2019s not as concerned for his safety at work, as he believes the threat of the virus has been \u201csomewhat blown out of proportion\u201d. But the employee, who will return to work on Wednesday, questioned Boeing\u2019s classification as essential and the fact that it is reopening before the stay-home order expires. \u201cI\u2019m not anywhere near essential,\u201d said the worker, who asked for his name to not be included to protect his job. \u201cI\u2019m not an emergency responder, I don\u2019t work in the food service industry. How is what I do essential to the economy other than helping to keep those suppliers running?\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The warehouse appears unremarkable, except for its size. Just off a motorway on an industrial estate in Merseyside sits a 35,000 sq m (377,000 sq ft) purpose-built warehouse with 20 loading docks to enable the storage and rapid distribution of hundreds of millions of face masks, aprons, gowns, gloves and body bags.</p> <p>For security reasons, the Guardian has been asked not to disclose the precise location of the UK\u2019s stockpile of personal protective equipment (PPE) for use in a pandemic. It is being stored on a site where builders moved the equivalent of more than 90 Olympic\u2013size swimming pools of earth to make way for a vast, climate-controlled warehouse.</p> <p>However, the Guardian can reveal that the management and the distribution of the stockpile has been outsourced to a private company, Movianto, which was sold two weeks ago for $133m (\u00a3107m) by its owner, a large US healthcare group.</p> <p>The fact that Movianto was being sold in the midst of a global pandemic, months after being instructed by the UK government to start mobilising the PPE supply, would be remarkable enough. But the sale is only the latest development in a turbulent 18 months for Movianto, which has included legal disputes with a property developer who built the enormous warehouse in Merseyside.</p> <p>The disputes culminated in Movianto securing a high court injunction in March last year, to thwart threats by the developer, Oliver Morley, to \u201clock the gates\u201d and prevent Movianto employees from accessing the warehoused stock.</p> <p>Morley\u2019s company has since gone into administration and its legal claims against Movianto have been discontinued, but Morley maintains his legal battles with Movianto were not over. He called for an investigation into the firm, alleging there was \u201ca much bigger story that needs to be told\u201d about his former tenant, but declined to provide specific details.</p> <p>For its part, Movianto firmly dismisses all of Morley\u2019s allegations, pointing out that his property firm was defeated last year in court. The company insists the legal disputes and the sale have had no impact on its storage or distribution of PPE in recent months.</p> <p>\u201cMovianto firmly believes that it has and continues to perform to all contractual obligations,\u201d the firm said.</p> <p>But the saga is likely to put a spotlight on the UK government\u2019s decision to outsource the management of the emergency stockpile. In three years, the stockpile appears to have been stored in three different warehouses. Meanwhile, management of the stock has been passed from a German\u2013owned multinational to an American one.</p> <p>In the coming months the custody of the UK\u2019s emergency stockpile of PPE will be passed on to a family-run business based in suburban Paris.</p> <p>A Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) spokesperson said: \u201cThe pandemic influenza stockpile held under this contract has remained safely and securely stored at all times and has supported our Covid-19 response through the distribution of vital personal protective equipment and essential supplies to the NHS and social care sector.\u201d</p> <h2>PPE provision</h2> <p>Widespread shortages of PPE have dominated complaints over the government\u2019s handling of the pandemic in recent weeks, including from NHS workers who say their lives are being endangered by the lack of adequate protection. This week an RAF plane was dispatched to Turkey to secure more supplies.</p> <p>The health secretary, Matt Hancock, insists the government is rising to the challenge, and has repeatedly said the PPE challenge has been \u201cone of distribution rather than one of supply\u201d. In addition to procuring new supplies from China, the DHSC has been drawing on the emergency stockpile, which it has stored since 2006 under its pandemic influenza preparedness programme.</p> <p>That stockpile is made up of around 52,000 pallets of equipment worth an estimated \u00a3500m. While it contains antiviral medicines and flu vaccines which are of limited use against Covid-19, the bulk of stocks are said to be PPE and hygiene products. Much of the stock needs to be frequently monitored, updated and stored in temperature\u2013controlled conditions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc5a97820aa522ff0d6d7e268bbbb7ee2eb3fc26\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc5a97820aa522ff0d6d7e268bbbb7ee2eb3fc26/0_165_2769_1662/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The warehouse where 52,000 pallets of PPE and other flu pandemic supplies are stored.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The warehouse where 52,000 pallets of PPE and other flu pandemic supplies are stored.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Waugh/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The government owns the stock, but outsources its management to private firms. Previously, the contract was held by DHL. Movianto, a subsidiary of the US health company Owens &amp; Minor, won the \u00a355m deal in the summer of 2018.</p> <p>As part of Movianto\u2019s plans, the company entered into business with Morley to build the vast warehouse in Merseyside. In the meantime, the pandemic stockpile was to be temporarily housed in another warehouse, also owned by Morley, in Knowsley.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It got to the point where I said I\u2019m going to lock the gates and refuse you entry to the site.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Movianto\u2019s plans were approved by the Cabinet Office, documents suggest. The company says its decision to enter into business with Morley was \u201cmade by executives no longer associated with Movianto\u201d.</p> <p>A notice for the new NHS contract stipulated that the contractor would be required to maintain \u201ca ready state for deployment in the event of a pandemic event\u201d.</p> <p>In early 2019, Movianto became mired in disputes with Morley\u2019s company, which accused the firm of not paying rent for the warehouse in Knowsley. According to Morley, his tenants became \u201cuncooperative\u201d. \u201cThis went on for weeks,\u201d he said. Movianto strongly rejects the allegation, saying it paid rent \u201cin accordance with the terms of the lease\u201d.</p> <p>Another grievance related to the payment of electricity bills to power the generators to ensure the stock, including medicines, was stored at the right temperature. Morley claims he ended up having to pay for electricity to power the generators, which \u201ckept going on the blink\u201d resulting, he alleges, in \u201ctemperature spikes\u201d.</p> <p>A Movianto source said Morley\u2019s account was inaccurate. In a statement, Movianto said electricity generators were only needed because of \u201cMorley\u2019s own failure to provide a mains supply in accordance with his contractual obligations\u201d.</p> <p>By his own account, Morley\u2019s financial disputes with Movianto culminated in him threatening the firm. \u201cIt got to the point where I said I\u2019m just going to lock the gates and refuse you entry to the site.\u201d When that happened, Movianto rushed to the high court in March 2019 and successfully obtained an injunction to ensure continued access to the warehouse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Covid-19%3A%20help%20us%20investigate&amp;description=The%20Guardian%20is%20investigating%20how%20the%20UK%20government%20prepared%20for%20%E2%80%93%20and%20is%20responding%20to%20%E2%80%93%20the%20coronavirus%20pandemic.%20We%20want%20to%20learn%20more%20about%20recent%20decisions%20taken%20at%20the%20heart%20of%20government.%20If%20you%E2%80%99re%20a%20whistleblower%20or%20source%20and%20with%20new%20information%2C%20you%20can%20email%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22mailto%3Acovid19.investigations%40theguardian.com%22%3Ecovid19.investigations%40theguardian.com%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20or%20(using%20a%20non-work%20phone)%20use%20Signal%20or%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.whatsapp.com%2Fsend%3Fphone%3D447584640566%22%3EWhatsApp%3C%2Fa%3E%20to%20message%20(UK)%20%2B44%207584%20640566.%20(The%20number%20does%20not%20take%20calls.)%20For%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E.%20For%20general%20advice%20on%20confidentially%20contacting%20the%20Guardian%2C%20see%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.%20&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"The Guardian is investigating how the UK government prepared for \u2013 and is responding to \u2013 the coronavirus pandemic.

      "bodyText": "The warehouse appears unremarkable, except for its size. Just off a motorway on an industrial estate in Merseyside sits a 35,000 sq m (377,000 sq ft) purpose-built warehouse with 20 loading docks to enable the storage and rapid distribution of hundreds of millions of face masks, aprons, gowns, gloves and body bags. For security reasons, the Guardian has been asked not to disclose the precise location of the UK\u2019s stockpile of personal protective equipment (PPE) for use in a pandemic. It is being stored on a site where builders moved the equivalent of more than 90 Olympic\u2013size swimming pools of earth to make way for a vast, climate-controlled warehouse. However, the Guardian can reveal that the management and the distribution of the stockpile has been outsourced to a private company, Movianto, which was sold two weeks ago for $133m (\u00a3107m) by its owner, a large US healthcare group. The fact that Movianto was being sold in the midst of a global pandemic, months after being instructed by the UK government to start mobilising the PPE supply, would be remarkable enough. But the sale is only the latest development in a turbulent 18 months for Movianto, which has included legal disputes with a property developer who built the enormous warehouse in Merseyside. The disputes culminated in Movianto securing a high court injunction in March last year, to thwart threats by the developer, Oliver Morley, to \u201clock the gates\u201d and prevent Movianto employees from accessing the warehoused stock. Morley\u2019s company has since gone into administration and its legal claims against Movianto have been discontinued, but Morley maintains his legal battles with Movianto were not over. He called for an investigation into the firm, alleging there was \u201ca much bigger story that needs to be told\u201d about his former tenant, but declined to provide specific details. For its part, Movianto firmly dismisses all of Morley\u2019s allegations, pointing out that his property firm was defeated last year in court. The company insists the legal disputes and the sale have had no impact on its storage or distribution of PPE in recent months. \u201cMovianto firmly believes that it has and continues to perform to all contractual obligations,\u201d the firm said. But the saga is likely to put a spotlight on the UK government\u2019s decision to outsource the management of the emergency stockpile. In three years, the stockpile appears to have been stored in three different warehouses. Meanwhile, management of the stock has been passed from a German\u2013owned multinational to an American one. In the coming months the custody of the UK\u2019s emergency stockpile of PPE will be passed on to a family-run business based in suburban Paris. A Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) spokesperson said: \u201cThe pandemic influenza stockpile held under this contract has remained safely and securely stored at all times and has supported our Covid-19 response through the distribution of vital personal protective equipment and essential supplies to the NHS and social care sector.\u201d PPE provision Widespread shortages of PPE have dominated complaints over the government\u2019s handling of the pandemic in recent weeks, including from NHS workers who say their lives are being endangered by the lack of adequate protection. This week an RAF plane was dispatched to Turkey to secure more supplies. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, insists the government is rising to the challenge, and has repeatedly said the PPE challenge has been \u201cone of distribution rather than one of supply\u201d. In addition to procuring new supplies from China, the DHSC has been drawing on the emergency stockpile, which it has stored since 2006 under its pandemic influenza preparedness programme. That stockpile is made up of around 52,000 pallets of equipment worth an estimated \u00a3500m. While it contains antiviral medicines and flu vaccines which are of limited use against Covid-19, the bulk of stocks are said to be PPE and hygiene products. Much of the stock needs to be frequently monitored, updated and stored in temperature\u2013controlled conditions. The government owns the stock, but outsources its management to private firms. Previously, the contract was held by DHL. Movianto, a subsidiary of the US health company Owens &amp; Minor, won the \u00a355m deal in the summer of 2018. As part of Movianto\u2019s plans, the company entered into business with Morley to build the vast warehouse in Merseyside. In the meantime, the pandemic stockpile was to be temporarily housed in another warehouse, also owned by Morley, in Knowsley. Movianto\u2019s plans were approved by the Cabinet Office, documents suggest. The company says its decision to enter into business with Morley was \u201cmade by executives no longer associated with Movianto\u201d. A notice for the new NHS contract stipulated that the contractor would be required to maintain \u201ca ready state for deployment in the event of a pandemic event\u201d. In early 2019, Movianto became mired in disputes with Morley\u2019s company, which accused the firm of not paying rent for the warehouse in Knowsley. According to Morley, his tenants became \u201cuncooperative\u201d. \u201cThis went on for weeks,\u201d he said. Movianto strongly rejects the allegation, saying it paid rent \u201cin accordance with the terms of the lease\u201d. Another grievance related to the payment of electricity bills to power the generators to ensure the stock, including medicines, was stored at the right temperature. Morley claims he ended up having to pay for electricity to power the generators, which \u201ckept going on the blink\u201d resulting, he alleges, in \u201ctemperature spikes\u201d. A Movianto source said Morley\u2019s account was inaccurate. In a statement, Movianto said electricity generators were only needed because of \u201cMorley\u2019s own failure to provide a mains supply in accordance with his contractual obligations\u201d. By his own account, Morley\u2019s financial disputes with Movianto culminated in him threatening the firm. \u201cIt got to the point where I said I\u2019m just going to lock the gates and refuse you entry to the site.\u201d When that happened, Movianto rushed to the high court in March 2019 and successfully obtained an injunction to ensure continued access to the warehouse. Movianto said the injunction was required as \u201ca result of Morley\u2019s conduct and repeated threats to interfere with Movianto\u2019s operations\u201d. It said Morley\u2019s allegations over rent and generators were undermined by \u201cvarious court proceedings\u201d that ruled in Movianto\u2019s favour. In July 2019, under the control of administrators, Morley\u2019s property company Industrial North West LLP discontinued its legal claims against Movianto. More challenges ahead Morley insists he will continue to seek legal action against Movianto \u2013 and he is used to high-profile disputes. In January, he lost a prominent lawsuit against RBS in which he claimed the bank\u2019s controversial restructuring group placed him under duress by seizing his assets after struggling to repay a \u00a375m loan. A high court judge noted Morley used the \u201cborrowed personal wealth\u201d to spend on \u201cSouth African mining investments, property, cars, a yacht and a jet\u201d. Morley told the Guardian his lifestyle was the result of hard work and \u201chad nothing to do with being a good landlord\u201d. He insists previous business disputes are irrelevant to his grievances against Movianto, which came to a head in May 2019. As works were completed at the Merseyside warehouse and Movianto prepared to transfer the stockpile from Knowsley, Industrial North West was forced into administration. Documents state the firm \u201cfailed to comply\u201d with the conditions of a \u00a361m loan facility. Morley lost control of his warehouses and administrators stepped in.

      "body": "<p>Brandon Blackwell, from Queens in New York, had never left his home country when he decided he wanted to win a British quiz show. An enthusiastic quizzer since he was a child, he knew Britain had \u201cthe greatest quiz infrastructure in the world\u201d, but had only heard of one programme: Mastermind.</p> <p>On trying to apply, however, he realised that he would need to be a UK resident, and since he was planning to study for a master\u2019s anyway, he decided to look for courses in Britain. \u201cBut it turns out, if you Google [quizzes] and university, a show called University Challenge comes up. So I watched a couple of episodes on YouTube and thought: oh, this is way easier to prepare for.\u201d</p> <p>On Monday, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000hjnm/university-challenge-201920-episode-37\">TV viewers saw Blackwell</a> and his team from Imperial College London <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/20/imperial-college-wins-university-challenge-after-early-lead\">lift this year\u2019s University Challenge trophy</a>, following a thrilling and highly impressive romp through the competition\u2019s rounds during which the American, dressed in a series of statement sweatshirts, emerged as the charismatic star.</p> <p>The final was no exception. Answering questions on subjects as diverse (and devilish) as the Polish journalist Ryszard Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski, doric architecture and languages of the Afro-Asiatic family, the Imperial team swept aside their opponents from Corpus Christi College, Cambridge.</p> <p>Blackwell greeted the win not with air punches and hugs but with a satisfied little smile and nod, as he had marked correct answers throughout the series. In a programme where even this counts as wildly demonstrative celebration, however, it has earned him inevitable flak on social media, with some viewers interpreting his grimaces and eye rolls as disrespect or arrogance.</p> <p>Speaking on the phone from back home in Queens, however, where he lives with his mother and grandmother, Blackwell, now 26, is charming, funny and eager, above all, to pay tribute to his three teammates, who he insists would have \u201ckilled it\u201d on the programme even without him.</p> <p>The misapprehensions are due to cultural differences, he says, pointing out that his own friends and family back in New York have had the opposite reaction. \u201cPeople I know have been like: \u2018How can you watch this show? It\u2019s so boring, they are all robots.\u2019 And I\u2019m like: \u2018It\u2019s the other way round.

      "bodyText": "Brandon Blackwell, from Queens in New York, had never left his home country when he decided he wanted to win a British quiz show. An enthusiastic quizzer since he was a child, he knew Britain had \u201cthe greatest quiz infrastructure in the world\u201d, but had only heard of one programme: Mastermind. On trying to apply, however, he realised that he would need to be a UK resident, and since he was planning to study for a master\u2019s anyway, he decided to look for courses in Britain. \u201cBut it turns out, if you Google [quizzes] and university, a show called University Challenge comes up. So I watched a couple of episodes on YouTube and thought: oh, this is way easier to prepare for.\u201d On Monday, TV viewers saw Blackwell and his team from Imperial College London lift this year\u2019s University Challenge trophy, following a thrilling and highly impressive romp through the competition\u2019s rounds during which the American, dressed in a series of statement sweatshirts, emerged as the charismatic star. The final was no exception. Answering questions on subjects as diverse (and devilish) as the Polish journalist Ryszard Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski, doric architecture and languages of the Afro-Asiatic family, the Imperial team swept aside their opponents from Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. Blackwell greeted the win not with air punches and hugs but with a satisfied little smile and nod, as he had marked correct answers throughout the series. In a programme where even this counts as wildly demonstrative celebration, however, it has earned him inevitable flak on social media, with some viewers interpreting his grimaces and eye rolls as disrespect or arrogance. Speaking on the phone from back home in Queens, however, where he lives with his mother and grandmother, Blackwell, now 26, is charming, funny and eager, above all, to pay tribute to his three teammates, who he insists would have \u201ckilled it\u201d on the programme even without him. The misapprehensions are due to cultural differences, he says, pointing out that his own friends and family back in New York have had the opposite reaction. \u201cPeople I know have been like: \u2018How can you watch this show? It\u2019s so boring, they are all robots.\u2019 And I\u2019m like: \u2018It\u2019s the other way round.

      "body": "<p>The British government is coming under fire for failing to join the EU\u2019s procurement scheme for medical equipment, including masks, gloves, goggles, gowns, testing kits and ventilators, at a time when NHS health workers across the country are crying out for more supplies. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/uk-refusal-of-eu-ventilator-offer-was-political-decision\">In the latest twist</a>, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, was forced to deny claims, later retracted, by the government\u2019s senior diplomat that it had been a \u201cpolitical decision\u201d to opt out of the scheme.</p> <h2>What is the EU joint procurement programme?</h2> <p>The British government signed the EU\u2019s joint procurement agreement in 2014 after the H1N1 pandemic had highlighted weaknesses in the access and purchasing power of EU countries to obtain pandemic vaccines and medicines.</p> <p>Under the terms of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, the government has the right to take part until 31 December 2020. The purpose of the scheme is to allow participants to act together as a big block purchaser, securing the best prices and forcing the way to the front of the queue at a time of shortage.</p> <h2>What bulk buys have been made this time?</h2> <p>Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the EU has launched four calls for tender for medical equipment and supplies. It invited companies to supply gloves and surgical gowns on 28 February, personal protective equipment (PPE) for eye and respiratory protection on 15 March and medical ventilators and respiratory equipment on the same day. A final call to companies to supply laboratory equipment, including testing kits, was made on 19 March. The total value of PPE being purchased is about \u20ac1.5bn (\u00a31.3bn). The EU ceiling for purchases of ventilators is \u20ac790m. The first call for tender of PPE on 28 February failed because of a lack of suitable suppliers. It was relaunched on 12 March. Since then all four calls for tender have successfully found companies willing to supply the goods to the scale and quality required. The timeline for delivery varies. Some of the PPE is expected imminently. There is a longer time-frame for deliveries of ventilators with the EU warning member states that it could take as long as a year for the all the machines to arrive.</p> <h2>Why has the UK not been involved?</h2> <p>When it emerged last month that the UK was not involved in the EU\u2019s bulk purchase of ventilators despite being aware of its existence and purpose, a Downing Street spokesman said the UK had not joined as the country was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/uk-discussed-joint-eu-plan-to-buy-covid-19-medical-supplies-say-officials\">\u201cnot in the EU\u201d</a>. That line changed within 24 hours and a communications error was blamed. An email from the European commission inviting the UK to join had been sent to an out-of-date and defunct address. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/uk-missed-three-chances-to-join-eu-scheme-to-bulk-buy-ppe\">When the Guardian reported last week</a> that there had been multiple opportunities to be involved with the purchase of PPE, as well as ventilators, further details had emerged of the communications error. The UK, it was said, had only received an invitation to sit on the the EU\u2019s joint procurement agreement steering group on the 19 March. By then all four of the procurements had been organised.</p> <h2>What has happened in the last 24 hours?</h2> <p>The Foreign Office\u2019s permanent secretary, Sir Simon McDonald, flatly contradicted the explanation of the UK\u2019s opt-out during an appearance in front of a House of Commons select committee. \u201cIt was a political decision,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cThe UK mission in Brussels briefed ministers about what was available, what was on offer, and the decision is known.\u201d The comments raised concerns that Brexit ideology had been put before the practicalities of saving lives.</p> <p>Within an hour, Hancock denied the decision had been politically motivated\u201d. Shortly afterwards, McDonald issued a formal correction in a letter to the chair of the foreign affairs select committee, Tom Tugendhat. \u201cMinisters were not briefed by our mission in Brussels about the scheme and a political decision was not taken whether or not to participate,\u201d McDonald wrote.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2>Has the UK lost out?</h2> <p>Hancock and Helen Whately, the care minister, pointed out on Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning that the EU\u2019s scheme has yet to deliver any medical supplies. It has also been suggested by anonymous government officials to various media outlets that the UK is now part of a procurement of therapeutics and products required for vaccines.</p> <p>In reality, no such new procurements have yet been launched. As for the ongoing procurements, eight suppliers have offered PPE products in excess of that being ordered by the participating member states, and deliveries are expected to European healthcare workers shortly.</p>",

The British government signed the EU\u2019s joint procurement agreement in 2014 after the H1N1 pandemic had highlighted weaknesses in the access and purchasing power of EU countries to obtain pandemic vaccines and medicines. Under the terms of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, the government has the right to take part until 31 December 2020. The purpose of the scheme is to allow participants to act together as a big block purchaser, securing the best prices and forcing the way to the front of the queue at a time of shortage. What bulk buys have been made this time? Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the EU has launched four calls for tender for medical equipment and supplies. It invited companies to supply gloves and surgical gowns on 28 February, personal protective equipment (PPE) for eye and respiratory protection on 15 March and medical ventilators and respiratory equipment on the same day. A final call to companies to supply laboratory equipment, including testing kits, was made on 19 March. The total value of PPE being purchased is about \u20ac1.5bn (\u00a31.3bn). The EU ceiling for purchases of ventilators is \u20ac790m. The first call for tender of PPE on 28 February failed because of a lack of suitable suppliers. It was relaunched on 12 March. Since then all four calls for tender have successfully found companies willing to supply the goods to the scale and quality required. The timeline for delivery varies. Some of the PPE is expected imminently. There is a longer time-frame for deliveries of ventilators with the EU warning member states that it could take as long as a year for the all the machines to arrive. Why has the UK not been involved? When it emerged last month that the UK was not involved in the EU\u2019s bulk purchase of ventilators despite being aware of its existence and purpose, a Downing Street spokesman said the UK had not joined as the country was \u201cnot in the EU\u201d. That line changed within 24 hours and a communications error was blamed. An email from the European commission inviting the UK to join had been sent to an out-of-date and defunct address. When the Guardian reported last week that there had been multiple opportunities to be involved with the purchase of PPE, as well as ventilators, further details had emerged of the communications error. The UK, it was said, had only received an invitation to sit on the the EU\u2019s joint procurement agreement steering group on the 19 March. By then all four of the procurements had been organised. What has happened in the last 24 hours? The Foreign Office\u2019s permanent secretary, Sir Simon McDonald, flatly contradicted the explanation of the UK\u2019s opt-out during an appearance in front of a House of Commons select committee. \u201cIt was a political decision,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cThe UK mission in Brussels briefed ministers about what was available, what was on offer, and the decision is known.\u201d The comments raised concerns that Brexit ideology had been put before the practicalities of saving lives. Within an hour, Hancock denied the decision had been politically motivated\u201d. Shortly afterwards, McDonald issued a formal correction in a letter to the chair of the foreign affairs select committee, Tom Tugendhat. \u201cMinisters were not briefed by our mission in Brussels about the scheme and a political decision was not taken whether or not to participate,\u201d McDonald wrote. Has the UK lost out? Hancock and Helen Whately, the care minister, pointed out on Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning that the EU\u2019s scheme has yet to deliver any medical supplies. It has also been suggested by anonymous government officials to various media outlets that the UK is now part of a procurement of therapeutics and products required for vaccines. In reality, no such new procurements have yet been launched. As for the ongoing procurements, eight suppliers have offered PPE products in excess of that being ordered by the participating member states, and deliveries are expected to European healthcare workers shortly.",

In case you were beginning to feel optimistic about the flattening of the coronavirus curve, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a stark warning: the second wave of Covid-19 infections could prove \u201ceven more difficult\u201d for the US than the first. If such a surge comes during the winter months, Robert Redfield told the Washington Post on Tuesday, it would coincide with the regular annual flu season, when the healthcare system is already strained. The coronavirus has now killed more than 44,000 people in the US and 175,000 worldwide. Trump\u2019s favourite malaria drug is not a miracle cure \u2026 The president has touted hydroxychloroquine as a potential treatment for Covid-19. But an analysis of its use in US veterans hospitals found more deaths among those who were given the drug than those who received standard care. \u2026 and nor is bleach. The US government is taking legal action against pseudoscience groups peddling a potentially dangerous quack cure for coronavirus: bleach solution. Trump says his immigration ban protects American workers The president has framed his latest plan to tackle the pandemic \u2013 a 60-day ban on immigration to the US \u2013 as an effort to protect US workers from foreign competition. His executive order, which could be extended beyond two months, \u201cwill help put unemployed Americans first in line for jobs as America reopens\u201d, he said. On Tuesday Trump also pledged to prop up the oil and gas industry, as the price of US crude again fell below zero. In times of national tragedy, the president traditionally acts as America\u2019s consoler-in-chief, writes David Smith. But Trump is less concerned with the human cost of the crisis than he is with its economic cost \u2013 and the threat to his own political future: The message Trump delivers each day in press briefings seems to be motivated more by his quest for re-election than any fellow feeling for beleaguered Americans. \u2018Some household names will not survive\u2019 the coming recession Most business leaders now expect a lengthy global recession to result from the coronavirus crisis, according to a survey of more than 3,000 chief executives in 109 countries by the business leadership network YPO. The boss of one Singapore-based health services firm said: \u201cWe have not seen a crisis like this for over 100 years, and some household names will not survive.\u201d At last, a lifeline for small businesses. The US Senate has passed a new $500bn aid package for small firms, after the first congressional coronavirus bailout was criticised for appearing to favour big business. Netflix enjoys a subscriber boom. The streaming service is a rare lockdown success story, adding 15.77 million new customers over the past three months \u2013 more than double the number it had forecast. Stay-at-home orders are causing heated debates in the states Almost 20,000 Georgians have tested positive for the coronavirus, at least 86 died on Sunday and Monday alone, and the state still has no way to conduct widespread testing. But the governor, Brian Kemp, has joined the governors of Florida and South Carolina in planning to reopen parts of their states\u2019 economies over the weekend, a decision decried by the mayor of Savannah as \u201creckless, premature and dangerous\u201d. The situation pits Kemp, a white Republican, against Georgia\u2019s mostly black Democratic mayors. In Wisconsin, by contrast, the Democratic governor, Tony Evers, is facing a legal challenge to his stay-at-home order from GOP state leaders, as the question of coronavirus lockdowns across the US becomes increasingly political and partisan. South Dakota won\u2019t stay at home. Some governors refused to issue stay-at-home orders in the first place, including South Dakota, whose governor, Kristi Noem, told Fox News: \u201cSo many people give up their liberties for just a little bit of security, and they don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d Missouri sues China. The Republican-led state of Missouri is suing China over the coronavirus, claiming the Chinese government is to blame for the pandemic. In other news \u2026 An IVF toad offers hope in an age of extinction. Olaf, from an endangered species of Puerto Rican toad, recently hatched at Fort Worth zoo in Texas. As the first amphibian to be born from frozen sperm, his example shows that scientists could bank frozen sperm and eggs to protect the genetic lineage of threatened species. The death toll from a shooting in Nova Scotia is now 22. Police in Canada revised up the number of victims of the weekend rampage, the country\u2019s worst mass shooting of modern times, after more were publicly identified. How many US troops are in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria? The Pentagon stopped publishing the numbers two years ago, but the Trump administration may now be forced to reveal them following a Freedom of Information Act request. Great reads Ramadan in a time of plague Under normal circumstances, the holy month of Ramadan would be a time when mosques are crowded and iftar dinners stretch into the early hours. But in the Covid-19 era, Muslim places of worship will be deserted and day-long fasts broken in isolation, as Guardian journalists report from across the Islamic world. How historians are documenting the pandemic The New-York Historical Society has started accumulating photos and ephemera related to the coronavirus, for a collection aimed at teaching future generations about the crisis. \u201cWe hope people will be able to learn from it and be better prepared in an event like this in the future,\u201d the museum\u2019s director tells Nadja Sayej.

      "body": "<p>1970 was a simpler time. (February was a simpler time too, but for a moment let\u2019s think outside the pandemic bubble.)</p> <p>Simpler because our environmental troubles could be easily seen. The air above our cities was filthy, and the water in our lakes and streams was gross. There was nothing subtle about it. In New York City, the environmental lawyer Albert Butzel<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/28/nyregion/new-york-city-smog.html\"> described</a> a permanently yellow horizon: \u201cI not only saw the pollution, I wiped it off my windowsills.\u201d Or consider the testimony of a city medical examiner: \u201cThe person who spent his life in the Adirondacks has nice pink lungs. The city dweller\u2019s are black as coal.\u201d You\u2019ve probably heard of Cleveland\u2019s Cuyahoga River <a href=\"https://clevelandhistorical.org/items/show/63\">catching fire</a>, but here\u2019s how the former New York governor Nelson Rockefeller <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/28/nyregion/new-york-city-smog.html\">described</a> the Hudson south of Albany: \u201cOne great septic tank that has been rendered nearly useless for water supply, for swimming, or to support the rich fish life that once abounded there.\u201d Everything that people say about the air and water in China and India right now was said of America\u2019s cities then.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/archive-zip/giv-3902biaigqdp2WsL/index.html\" data-alt=\"series box\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/archive-zip/giv-3902biaigqdp2WsL/index.html\">series box</a> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s no wonder that people mobilized: 20 million Americans took to the streets for the <a href=\"https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/the-first-earth-day\">first Earth Day</a> in 1970 \u2013 10% of America\u2019s population at the time, perhaps the single greatest day of political protest in the country\u2019s history. And it worked. Worked politically because Congress quickly passed the <a href=\"https://archive.epa.gov/epa/aboutepa/epa-history-clean-air-act-1970.html\">Clean Air Act</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-clean-water-act\">Clean Water Act</a> and scientifically because those laws had the desired effect. In essence, they stuck enough filters on smokestacks, car exhausts and factory effluent pipes that, before long, the air and water were unmistakably cleaner. The nascent Environmental Protection Agency commissioned a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-us-cities-looked-like-before-epa-regulated-pollution-2019-8#barges-filled-with-new-yorks-waste-are-pulled-down-the-east-river-to-staten-island-landfill-in-the-1970s-new-york-produced-26000-tons-of-solid-waste-every-day-22\">series of photos</a> that showed just how filthy things were. Even for those of us who were alive then, it\u2019s hard to imagine that we tolerated this.</p> <p>But we should believe it, because now we face even greater challenges that we\u2019re doing next to nothing about. And one reason is you can\u2019t see them.</p> <p>The carbon dioxide molecule is invisible; at today\u2019s levels you can\u2019t see it or smell it, and it doesn\u2019t do anything to you. Carbon with one oxygen molecule? That\u2019s what kills you in a closed garage if you leave the car running. But two oxygen molecules? All that does is trap heat in the atmosphere. Melt ice caps. Raise seas. Change weather patterns. But slowly enough that most of the time, we don\u2019t quite see it.</p> <p>And it\u2019s a more complex moment for another reason. You can filter carbon monoxide easily. It\u2019s a trace gas, a tiny percentage of what comes from a power plant. But carbon dioxide is the exact opposite. It\u2019s most of what comes pouring out when you burn coal or gas or oil. There\u2019s no catalytic converter for CO<sub>2</sub>,<em><strong> </strong></em>which means you have to take down the fossil fuel industry.</p> <p>That in turn means you have to take on not just the oil companies but also the banks, asset managers and insurance companies that invest in them (and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-banks-energy-assets-exclusive/exclusive-us-banks-prepare-to-seize-energy-assets-as-shale-boom-goes-bust-idUSKCN21R3JI\">may even own them</a>, in the wake of the current economic crash). You have to take on, that is, the heart of global capital.</p> <p>And so we are. <a href=\"https://stopthemoneypipeline.com/\">Stop the Money Pipeline</a>, a coalition of environmental and climate justice groups running from the small and specialized to the Sierra Club and Greenpeace, formed last fall to try to tackle the biggest money on earth. Banks like Chase \u2013 the planet\u2019s largest by market capitalization \u2013 which has funneled a <a href=\"https://www.sierraclub.org/press-releases/2020/03/new-report-reveals-global-banks-funneled-27-trillion-fossil-fuels-paris\">quarter-trillion dollars</a> to the fossil fuel industry since the Paris agreement of 2015. Insurers like <a href=\"https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/news/environmental/liberty-mutual-facing-mounting-pressure-to-exit-fossil-fuels-219312.aspx\">Liberty Mutual</a>, still insuring tar sands projects even as pipeline builders endanger Native communities by trying to build the Keystone XL <a href=\"https://www.ecowatch.com/keystone-xl-pipeline-construction-2645607020.html?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1\">during a pandemic</a>.</p> <p>This campaign sounds quixotic, but it seemed to be getting traction until the coronavirus pandemic hit. In January, BlackRock <a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-ceo-letter\">announced</a> that it was going to put climate at the heart of its investment analyses. Liberty Mutual, under similar pressure from activists, began to <a href=\"https://www.ran.org/press-releases/liberty-mutual-adopts-coal-policy-in-response-to-public-pressure/\">edge away</a> from coal. And Chase \u2013 well, Earth Day would have seen activists engaging in civil disobedience in several thousand bank lobbies across America, sort of like the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3MKcYUUHxw\">protest in January</a> that helped launch the campaign (and sent me, among others, off in handcuffs). But we called that off; there\u2019s no way we were going to risk carrying the microbe into jails, where the people already locked inside have little chance of social distancing.</p> <p>Still, the pandemic may be causing as much trouble for the fossil fuel industry as our campaign hoped to. With the demand for oil cratering, it\u2019s clear that these companies have no future. The divestment campaign that, over a decade, has enlisted $14tn in endowments and portfolios in the climate fight has a new head of steam.</p> <p>Our job \u2013 a more complex one than faced our Earth Day predecessors 50 years ago \u2013 is to force the spring. We need to speed the transition to the solar panels and wind turbines that engineers have worked so mightily to improve and are now the cheapest way to generate power. The only thing standing in the way is the political power of the fossil fuel companies, on clear display as <a href=\"https://psmag.com/news/trump-seeks-to-speed-up-oil-and-gas-projects\">Donald Trump</a> does everything in his power to preserve their dominance. That\u2019s hard to overcome. Hard but simple. Just as in 1970, it demands unrelenting pressure from citizens. That pressure is coming. Indigenous nations, frontline communities, faith groups, climate scientists and savvy investors are joining together, and their voices are getting louder. Seven million of us were in the streets <a href=\"https://www.ecowatch.com/global-climate-strikes-week-2640790405.html?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1\">last September</a>. That\u2019s not 20 million, but it\u2019s on the way.</p> <p>We can\u2019t be on the streets right now. So we\u2019ll do what we can on the boulevards of the Internet.

      "bodyText": "The mayor of the Latin American city hardest hit by the coronavirus has urged regional governments to take drastic steps to slow its spread and avoid the devastation she said had left Guayaquil looking like a war zone. Cynthia Viteri told the Guardian she believed thousands had probably lost their lives in the Ecuadorian port city in recent weeks and compared Covid-19\u2019s deadly impact there to \u201can unexpected bomb falling on a peaceful town\u201d. \u201cIt was as if we were attacked from the air like in Hiroshima,\u201d said Viteri, a 54-year-old lawyer and former presidential candidate who sent desperate tweets as the scale of the dystopia unfolding there became clear. \u201cIt was the horror of a war \u2013 there were dead in the streets, dead in homes, there were dead outside the hospitals,\u201d remembered Viteri, who was infected and placed in quarantine but has recovered. The precise scale of Guayaquil\u2019s tragedy remains unclear although few doubt the number of deaths far exceeds Ecuador\u2019s official nationwide death toll of 507. Viteri said independently gathered figures from cemeteries and graveyards suggested the death toll in Guayaquil alone could be more than 8,000. She claimed the figures showed that in the first two weeks of April alone, more than 5,000 people had died of Covid-19 in Ecuador\u2019s main commercial hub, which has close to 3 million inhabitants. Last week, official data suggested the number of deaths in Guayas province \u2013 of which Guayaquil is the capital \u2013 leapt from a normal average of 3,000 to nearly 11,000 in the six weeks between the beginning of March and mid-April. Viteri said she hoped the political leaders of other Latin American countries and cities could learn from Guayaquil\u2019s calamity. Last week, Brazil\u2019s former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva told the Guardian he feared some parts of his country could witness similar scenes to the \u201chorrific, monstrous images we saw in Guayaquil\u201d in the coming weeks and months. Lula accused Brazil\u2019s current leader, Jair Bolsonaro, of leading Brazilians \u201cto the slaughterhouse\u201d by deliberately undermining social distancing measures and efforts to lock down major cities such as Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo, which have been partially paralysed by their governors. Viteri said such shutdowns were essential. \u201cIf we have learned a lesson that Guayaquil can leave for the world, and it\u2019s a painful lesson, it is: \u2018Don\u2019t run from the disease; pursue it, knock on doors and save people before [the virus] gets in their lungs,\u2019\u201d she said. Viteri said any country that had so far failed to lock down should \u201clook in our mirror and apply preventive measures straight away\u201d. Three weeks after the collapse of Guayaquil\u2019s health and mortuary services shocked the world, Viteri claimed authorities were regaining control and said officials had \u201cresisted [the virus] like Spartans\u201d. Soldiers and police have cordoned off often poorer virus-hit neighbourhoods, enforcing strict lockdowns, and a municipal taskforce made up of medics, firefighters and city workers has gone house to house looking for potential cases while sanitary workers have disinfected and fumigated public areas. Authorities have also created a corpse-collecting taskforce and distributed cardboard coffins to bereaved families. Viteri said Guayaquil was building two cemeteries for victims in addition to two others being built by the central government but she admitted hospitals continued to be overwhelmed by the number of coronavirus patients. Experts say one possible reason for the number of cases in Guayaquil is the high level of air traffic between Ecuador and Spain, which has the world\u2019s third-highest number of deaths, after the United States and Italy. Spain, where more than 21,000 people have died, is home to more than 400,000 Ecuadorian migrants and the first Covid-19 case recorded in Ecuador was of a 71-year-old woman who flew into Guayaquil from Madrid in mid-February. She died there on 13 March. A failure to properly enforce social distancing in the weeks after coronavirus arrived is also suspected to have played a role.",

The league says teams will start training from 4 May. But there are lots of unanswered questions over the announcement.</p> \n  <p>In a press conference, <strong>Wayne Pearce</strong>, the Balmain legend tasked with heading up the league\u2019s grandly titled \u201cProject Apollo\u201d to get the season running again, said the NRL had achieved \u201ca lot more clarity around the medical process and what those protocols are\u201d and that \u201cgovernment authorities\u201d were \u201cvery supportive\u201d of their plans.</p> \n  <p>What he didn\u2019t say was what those protocols were, and which government authorities the league has been talking to. Basically, who in the government has given the league sign-off to begin playing again?</p> \n  <p>I\u2019ve been trying to find out this afternoon, with little joy.</p> \n  <p>We know that the NSW police commissioner, <strong>Mick Fuller</strong>, who is in charge of the state\u2019s response to Covid-19, previously wrote to the NRL chairman Peter V\u2019landys saying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/17/nrl-forge-ahead-with-resumption-plan-despite-no-approval-from-nsw-government\">there was no legal obstacle for the NRL\u2019s plans to resume playing despite strict public health orders</a>. </p> \n  <p>That\u2019s because the league was given an exemption under the original PHOs issued last month, and stopped playing matches voluntarily. </p> \n  <p>However in the letter Fuller also said the league would have to develop protocols to demonstrate it could resume safely. The premier, <strong>Gladys Berejiklian</strong>, said something similar when she was asked about it last week. </p> \n  <p>So who has signed off on the protocols? NSW Health still hasn\u2019t responded to my queries, and the NSW police seems to think there\u2019s nothing to be signed off on. </p> \n  <p>Here\u2019s what a spokeswoman told me:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>As far as we are aware, there is nothing to be \u2018signed-off\u2019. The commissioner has stated previously that the letter was advice in response to their inquiry. I don\u2019t have anything further to provide you.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Perhaps we\u2019ll hear more from the NSW government later tonight or tomorrow, but it seems odd that neither the NRL nor the state government has explained who is in charge of making this decision.</p> \n  <p>The NRL is also still awaiting clearance from the federal and New Zealand governments for the New Zealand Warriors to arrive in Australia on May 3, a day before the rest of the competition resumes training. </p> \n  <p>The Queensland premier, <strong>Annastacia Palaszczuk</strong>, has also previously said she would not look kindly on the three teams from her state travelling back and forth to NSW for matches.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T09:25:50.482Z\">at 10.25am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea005078f085a072d3bced8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T09:06:05.348Z\">10.06am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Need a distraction from Covid-19?

That includes private hospitals, but the state government paid private hospitals to provide capacity to the public system in the event it is needed as a result of coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>In any case, it sounds now like people on the public wait list for elective surgeries could get preferential treatment over people waiting for surgery in the private hospital system because the state government bought capacity in the private system.</p> \n  <p>It will depend on the surgery, however. Mikakos noted that some of the procedures that will now be allowed, eg IVF or dental work, could still largely be happening in the private system.</p> \n  <p>When she was asked what the point was, then, of having private health insurance at a time like this when you\u2019re not getting any benefit out of it, she said part of the government funding for the private sector was to keep the private hospitals running at this time. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JennyMikakos/status/1252840162414874628\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A slowdown in new <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19</a> cases has allowed our public &amp; private \ud83c\udfe5 to carefully resume more category 2 &amp; some category 3 elective surgeries from next week. \ud83d\udc69\u200d\u2695\ufe0f \ud83d\udc68\u200d\u2695\ufe0f We thank Victorians for their patience &amp; helping save lives by staying \ud83c\udfe0 to slow the spread of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19</a>. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/springst?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#springst</a></p>\u2014 Jenny Mikakos MP #StayHomeSaveLives (@JennyMikakos) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JennyMikakos/status/1252840162414874628?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 22, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T09:05:48.157Z\">at 10.05am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9ffc9c8f085a072d3bce9a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T08:20:30.138Z\">9.20am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Good evening. <strong>Graham Readfearn</strong> here taking you through the final hours of our live coronavirus coverage.</p> \n  <p>A quick check around the updates from states and territories today shows very low numbers of new cases of Covid-19 being reported. </p> \n  <p>There were no new cases reported by Queensland, Western Australia, Northern Territory or the ACT.

the community about how their privacy will be protected and how the app will be working.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Importantly, she said Victoria \u201cwon\u2019t be setting any preconditions\u201d on uptake of the app, but preconditions would be set up around other factors, such as more testing, more tracing, and response activity if there is an outbreak in a particular area.</p> \n  <p>\u201cBut that

It\u2019s business investment that drives productivity which drives higher wages. So that\u2019s the problem, let\u2019s frame that up first. Look I think it is important for us to put it back on the table but along with other tax reform. It\u2019s not the only thing that needs to be done. It\u2019s important that we look at the state taxes, the productivity sapping stamp duty taxes, payroll tax. It is interesting how much payroll tax has been deferred. <br></p> \n   <p>The whole question of the right configuration of the state taxes. Whether or not we bring forward those other income tax cuts. So it\u2019s not just company taxes but it is important we have a competitive company tax rate. To the treasurer\u2019s point, we\u2019re not asking, in the Business Council, for us to have the lowest rate, we\u2019re simply asking for a competitive rate, so that we can be a magnet for investment in this country. <br></p> \n   <p>Because we already have so many advantages, but we have one disadvantage which is a tax rate that is so much higher than everywhere else in the world. As you and I have talked about many times, at the height of this debate, 63% of Australians supported lowering the corporate tax rate. It was people in this building, in Parliament House, who didn\u2019t see this as something that was in the national interest. <br></p> \n   <p>And we would be in a much better starting position on recovery if we had that 25% rate. So I think we have to put it back on the table. I think we have to stop the ideological wars about it. I think we have to be willing to have a conversation not just about that tax but about the whole tax system or as much of the tax system as we have the stomach to do reform on to make us a country that rewards innovation and incentive. <br></p> \n   <p>And obviously puts money into the pockets of Australians.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T01:04:58.836Z\">at 2.04am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9f96ab8f087a826b68acae\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T00:58:59.369Z\">1.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In case you haven\u2019t seen this as yet, or cried today, I am giving this another run, because we all need a bit of heartbreakingly lovely in our lives. <br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheMancUK/status/1252235035379265538\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">After noticing that Ken slept with a photo of his late wife every night, one of the carers at Thistleton Lodge presented him with this incredible gift... <a href=\"https://t.co/Q1v8V8HUFS\">pic.twitter.com/Q1v8V8HUFS</a></p>\u2014 The Manc (@TheMancUK) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheMancUK/status/1252235035379265538?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 20, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T01:00:26.069Z\">at 2.00am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9f93e58f087a826b68ac95\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/calla-wahlquist\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T00:46:55.340Z\">1.46am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A group of friends who gathered at one of their homes to play video games are <strong>among 95 people to be issued with a $1,600 on-the-spot fine for allegedly breaching Victoria\u2019s social distancing laws in the past 24 hours</strong>.</p> \n  <p>Police in Victoria said they also fined three people who, they claim, \u201cbooked a short stay accommodation so they could hand out and take drugs\u201d, as well as two people who were stopped in a car in Box Hill. <br></p> \n  <p>As we have seen in a number of these cases in recent weeks, police allege another offence was being committed at the same time \u2013 the driver of that car in Box Hill was unlicensed, the passenger was apparently brandishing a weapon.</p> \n  <p>The social distancing laws give police another reason to stop people and question their movements. <br></p> \n  <p>As <strong>Michael McGowan </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/21/victorians-describe-feeling-intimidated-by-police-enforcing-lockdown-laws\">reported yesterday</a>, a number of people fined in Victoria say the<strong> police were \u201cintimidating\u201d or \u201caggressive\u201d and the laws were confusing.</strong> <br></p> \n  <p> But police have the discretionary power to issue on-the-spot fines and question people\u2019s movements, and they are using that power. <br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T00:49:12.451Z\">at 1.49am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9f93878f087a826b68ac93\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T00:45:35.408Z\">1.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JennyMikakos/status/1252753358336581632\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">There are 1,336 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19</a> cases in Victoria (2 added, 2 removed as interstate). 135 cases may indicate community transmission. 29 people are in hospital, inc 12 in ICU. 1,243 people have recovered &amp; &gt; 90K Victorians have been tested.

Is that you can either fork out the money and pay for 10,000 or 15,000 people on the dole, or you could see an underwriting of a convertible note or a loan, which provides some equity, which then eventually the gGovernment can recoup. <br></p> \n   <p>So, really when you stop to think about it and get beyond the simple headlines of saying, \u201cIs it a foreign airline?\u201d <br></p> \n   <p>Even though there are tens of thousands of local jobs, is it something that government should be just providing money for? <br></p> \n   <p>There\u2019s a big difference between paying people unemployment benefits and providing support which allows investors the certainty to make sure that we have two major airlines \u2013 Qantas and Virgin \u2013 with sustainable jobs, high-skilled jobs, here in Australia. <br></p> \n   <p>Because if we don\u2019t rescue Virgin in some form, what will happen is that, sooner or later, a foreign airline will come in. And who knows, there could be foreign crews flying over Australian air and sky, with foreign pay and conditions. <br></p> \n   <p>So at the end of the day, this is about keeping skilled jobs, this is about making investments where perhaps the taxpayer doesn\u2019t ultimately foot the entire bill. <br></p> \n   <p>So I think there\u2019s a deal to be done in voluntary administration, but I tell you what, for the regions, for our tourism, for low fares, and for the taxpayer not having to pay the massive costs if tens of thousands of people just lose their jobs, I think a deal should be done.

So there are exceptional circumstances where further restrictions might be placed on people living in residential aged care facilities in terms of access to visitors. <br></p> \n   <p>But those additional restrictions are the exception, they are not the rule, and we think it is a good thing for people to have those visits in accordance with those screening procedures and other things that are necessary to protect elderly residents in those situations. <br></p> \n   <p>It shouldn\u2019t be done out of the convenience of isolation in terms of how these facilities are run, it should always be done always only in the interests of the care of those who are living in those facilities. <br></p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T23:50:18.282Z\">at 12.50am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9f799b8f08b5c61713e4ef\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T22:54:59.712Z\">11.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Queensland reports no new infections</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Queensland has recorded no new cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours.</p> \n  <p>Great news.<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T23:59:07.627Z\">at 12.59am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9f772f8f087a826b68ac18\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T22:47:56.213Z\">11.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Australia has undertaken the suppression method in response this pandemic.

That\u2019s an honest view. If, in the process of suppressing, we get to the point of eradication, then that would be a magnificent outcome.

Thanks from me, Graham Readfearn, and from my colleagues Calla Wahlquist, Josh Taylor and Amy Remeikis who have been delivering live coverage here over the past 13 hours. You can follow the Guardian\u2019s global live coverage of the pandemic here. Here\u2019s a summary of today\u2019s main stories: Australia\u2019s death toll from Covid-19 rose by two to 74. NSW health authorities confirmed this morning a man, 75, had died in St George hospital, and a woman, 80, had died in Gosford hospital. By 3pm this afternoon, Australia had a total of 6,649 confirmed cases of Covid-19, with 4,761 people recovered. Wednesday was another day of very low cases numbers reported by states and territories. NSW reported the highest with five. Queensland had a second day with no new cases. The energy minister, Angus Taylor, said Australia would stockpile $100m of fuel to take advantage of the plummeting global oil price. The NRL said its season would restart on 28 May and teams would start training on 4 May. The competition regulator gave retailers permission to collectively negotiate with landlords about rent during the coronavirus crisis. The Australian Bureau of Statistics said retail turnover had gone up by 8.2% in March with strong sales across supermarkets and liquor retailing. Sydney\u2019s Bondi, Bronte and Tamarama beaches will reopen from next Tuesday. Thanks for being with us. We\u2019ll be back with more live coverage tomorrow. Stay safe and stay sensible. Terrible news on the crash on Melbourne\u2019s Eastern Freeway. Four on-duty police officers have died. Read the full report here: It\u2019s Jimmy Barnes time again. The rock legend has been releasing sweet musical treats from his lounge room. However, tonight he is playing the bagpipes (I\u2019m joking, I love bagpipes). South Australia is encouraging children to return to school for term 2, starting on Monday 27 April. There\u2019s been a major multi-vehicle crash on Melbourne\u2019s Eastern Freeway. The road is closed in both directions and police are telling people to avoid the route. Police vehicles are reportedly involved, and there are unconfirmed reports the crash may have been fatal. A little earlier this afternoon the NRL announced it would \u201cdefinitely\u201d resume its season on 28 May. The league says teams will start training from 4 May. But there are lots of unanswered questions over the announcement. In a press conference, Wayne Pearce, the Balmain legend tasked with heading up the league\u2019s grandly titled \u201cProject Apollo\u201d to get the season running again, said the NRL had achieved \u201ca lot more clarity around the medical process and what those protocols are\u201d and that \u201cgovernment authorities\u201d were \u201cvery supportive\u201d of their plans. What he didn\u2019t say was what those protocols were, and which government authorities the league has been talking to. Basically, who in the government has given the league sign-off to begin playing again? I\u2019ve been trying to find out this afternoon, with little joy. We know that the NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, who is in charge of the state\u2019s response to Covid-19, previously wrote to the NRL chairman Peter V\u2019landys saying there was no legal obstacle for the NRL\u2019s plans to resume playing despite strict public health orders. That\u2019s because the league was given an exemption under the original PHOs issued last month, and stopped playing matches voluntarily. However in the letter Fuller also said the league would have to develop protocols to demonstrate it could resume safely. The premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said something similar when she was asked about it last week. So who has signed off on the protocols? NSW Health still hasn\u2019t responded to my queries, and the NSW police seems to think there\u2019s nothing to be signed off on. Here\u2019s what a spokeswoman told me: As far as we are aware, there is nothing to be \u2018signed-off\u2019. The commissioner has stated previously that the letter was advice in response to their inquiry. I don\u2019t have anything further to provide you. Perhaps we\u2019ll hear more from the NSW government later tonight or tomorrow, but it seems odd that neither the NRL nor the state government has explained who is in charge of making this decision. The NRL is also still awaiting clearance from the federal and New Zealand governments for the New Zealand Warriors to arrive in Australia on May 3, a day before the rest of the competition resumes training. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, has also previously said she would not look kindly on the three teams from her state travelling back and forth to NSW for matches. Need a distraction from Covid-19? Bit of a night owl? Like shooting stars? Well, if you\u2019re still up at midnight and you can get a view of the skies to the northeast, you might catch the Lyrids meteor shower. People have been seeing the Lyrids \u2013 debris from Comet Thatcher \u2013 for more than 2,700 years. The further north you are in Australia, the better your chances are of seeing them. But you can look here to find out if you\u2019ll be able to see them where you are. Don\u2019t go anywhere or do anything that the current movement restrictions wouldn\u2019t allow you to do. Give your eyes a chance to get used to the dark and stare at the northeast sky. Another interesting discussion arising from Victorian health minister Jenny Mikakos\u2019 press conference is the split between public and private health for elective surgery. They\u2019ve agreed to allow around 25% of elective surgeries to now take place from next week. That includes private hospitals, but the state government paid private hospitals to provide capacity to the public system in the event it is needed as a result of coronavirus. In any case, it sounds now like people on the public wait list for elective surgeries could get preferential treatment over people waiting for surgery in the private hospital system because the state government bought capacity in the private system. It will depend on the surgery, however. Mikakos noted that some of the procedures that will now be allowed, eg IVF or dental work, could still largely be happening in the private system. When she was asked what the point was, then, of having private health insurance at a time like this when you\u2019re not getting any benefit out of it, she said part of the government funding for the private sector was to keep the private hospitals running at this time. Good evening. Graham Readfearn here taking you through the final hours of our live coronavirus coverage. A quick check around the updates from states and territories today shows very low numbers of new cases of Covid-19 being reported. There were no new cases reported by Queensland, Western Australia, Northern Territory or the ACT. New South Wales had five and South Australia and Tasmania both reported one new case each. Victoria did record two new cases, but took two cases off as they were reclassified to other states. So that\u2019s no net gain for Victoria. Coronavirus has also affected the live cattle export trade out of northern Australia, with the two biggest markets, Indonesia and Vietnam, reporting the biggest price crash since 2011. That crash was caused by the Four Corners expos\u00e9. This is from ABC Rural: The Indonesian feeder steer price out of Darwin, is sitting at around $2.60 a kilogram, which is well down on the record $4 a kilo that was paid just last month. It means a 350-kilogram steer which last month was worth up to $1,400, is now valued at just over $900. And with that, I\u2019ll hand over to my colleague Graham Readfearn. Stay well, and if you buy a new bike remember to only accelerate going out of a corner and not into one. More than 40 Aboriginal people in Western Australia have tested positive to Covid-19, according to Prof Fiona Stanley from the Telethon Kids Institute. Speaking to the Australian Academy of science, Stanley said: At the moment there are probably over 40 cases of Aboriginal people that have been identified\u2026 all of them are either in cities or urban centres\u2026 Stanley said Aboriginal people who test positive in remote communities have a lower chance of survival, because \u201cthere aren\u2019t any respirators out there, no intensive care.\u201d It\u2019s a long way. And to actually take someone by Royal Flying Doctor Service from a remote community to a centre when they\u2019re very, very ill, may be a death sentence. So I think it would be devastating and the people who would die are the people who they want not to die most, the Elders, the older ones with the morbidities and so on. Stanley said the lack of available health services for Aboriginal people would be \u201calmost a joke if it wasn\u2019t so very serious.\u201d There are about 850,0000 Aboriginal people in Australia, of whom about 90,000 live in WA. So the challenge is then, to really get the Aboriginal-controlled health services, who are all around the country, to get together and empower them so that we\u2019ve got all the capacity to both prevent, monitor and then treat Aboriginal people who may develop COVID-19. Stanley said the pandemic had \u201cexposed our appalling inability to actually improve Aboriginal health outcomes\u201d but she hoped it would lead to more Aboriginal people being trained as health professionals. Aboriginal people, when given this training and education, have the capacity to implement it very effectively. It might actually end up that we have much better ways of working with Aboriginal people than we have in the past \u2026 And I do think if we can give them a national voice, this is about the best example I can think of. If we can do this with Covid-19 guys, we could do this forever, you know? So the most important thing is to really give Aboriginal people a voice, and I mean power. I mean funding. I mean partnerships that give them the power and we\u2019re the sort of people who just help along.\u201d Delighted, and slightly worried, that the Greens have agreed with my driving advice. A mural of Ai Fen, one of the first doctors to raise the alarm about a novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China, has been painted in Melbourne by artist Amanda Newman. You may have noticed I misattributed an earlier press release from the office of Greens leader Adam Bandt to former Greens leader Richard Di Natale. Apologies, Adam. Have you bought a bicycle since lockdown began? You would not be alone. Bikes are, according to one bike retailer, \u201cthe new toilet paper\u201d. Grant Kaplan, manager of Giant Sydney, a bike store in Sydney, told Guardian Australia\u2019s Justine Landis-Hanley: We can\u2019t keep up with sales. Literally the phone is ringing nonstop. I have not panic bought a bike but I am monitoring an online horse auction so probably can\u2019t talk. The manager of a south Melbourne bike store told Justine: Families are sick of walking everywhere as their form of exercise. The kids are home from school or being home-schooled. If you go to a football oval and there are lots of people already there, you can\u2019t go on [due to social distancing measures]. But on your bike you are exercising and practicing social distancing. Read the full story here. ACCC allows retailers to collectively negotiate rents The competition regulator has given retailers permission to collectively negotiate with landlords about rent during the coronavirus crisis. With many shops closed, and those that do remain open hit by a dramatic fall in revenue as shoppers stay home, how much rent should \u2014 or can \u2014 be paid has become a major battleground between retailers and landlords. Some retailers, including Solomon Lew\u2019s Premier Investments group, have unilaterally stopped paying rent while their shops are closed. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said it has authorised the Australian Retail Association and its members to negotiate rents collectively and to: ...share information relevant to the negotiations including in relation to requests by landlords for certain information as part of considering and negotiating support to be provided in the context of Covid-19. Said ACCC chairman Rod Sims: We see a clear public benefit in allowing retailers to work together in the negotiations with landlords as it will help those tenants who are experiencing financial hardship during this pandemic to reach a fair outcome. It\u2019s the latest in a series of authorisations issued by the ACCC allowing conduct that would normally be against the law because it was anti-competitive. The NRL has confirmed it will resume its 2020 season on 28 May. Australian Rugby League commissioner Wayne Pearce said the league had the green light from government (presumably the NSW government) to restart its season on 28 May, with training to begin from 4 May. That\u2019s Monday week \u2014 one week before the four week deadline, set by the national cabinet as the date at which social distancing laws will be reviewed. Pearce said: What we achieved today was a lot more clarity around the medical process and what those protocols are. We clarified that May 28 is a definite and also confirmed that May 4 is the resumption date for training. He says that \u201ceveryone is supportive of what we\u2019re doing. Everyone is unified into getting back on the field.\u201d It\u2019s still not exactly clear how this would work. The New Zealand Warriors, for example, might not be able to participate, and teams based outside of NSW \u201cwould have to come into camp in NSW,\u201d Pearce said. We are working with the government authorities to get them over here and get them [the Warriors] through a quarantine period and have them ready with the other teams for the start of the competition. Pearce said governments were \u201cvery supportive\u201d. The government authorities that we are speaking to are very supportive of what we\u2019re looking to do because we are actually looking to hold ourselves to very high standards, and that will certainly exceed what community expectations are. The Greens have put their support behind the RBA\u2019s call for tax reform. In a statement, Adam Bandt says major tax reform should be geared at creating a carbon-free economy. So: no tax breaks for polluters, tax incentives for research and development. This ties back to the party\u2019s rhetoric around the Green New Deal, which I continue to dislike as a slogan because it feels very American. Anyway. Bandt says: You don\u2019t accelerate out of a corner. [Editor\u2019s note: you can, just wait until you can see your trailer in both mirrors.] The government is flagging an era of aggressive deregulation, but that will only prolong the pain and leave us poorly-equipped to deal with future economic shocks. Bandt says the recession following the coronavirus will disproportionately affect young people, and that needs to be kept in mind when designing the reforms. The Greens will block any attempts to drive through massive tax cuts and further strip away protections for workers and the environment. We hope the government will instead accept the Greens\u2019 call for targeted measures to support R&amp;D, help manufacturing and lift wages. On the matter of Scott Morrison speaking to Donald Trump, Albanese says it is \u201cnot a bad thing that people talk\u201d but that he hopes Morrison did not take the advice given to and by Trump about how to manage the coronavirus. Albanese: I think that here in Australia we\u2019re doing much better than the US, and that\u2019s because people are taking \u2014 are NOT taking an opportunistic view of this crisis. People are listening to the health experts. I hope that leaders around the world do that. I think Morrison would probably agree with that. What about Morrison\u2019s push that the World Health Organization be allowed to enter a country without invitation, to trace the origin of an outbreak? Well, I support what Scott Morrison has said \u2026 the World Health Organization is the only body that you could foresee being in a position to do this, which is why the decision by the United States \u2013 and I wonder whether Scott Morrison raised this with Donald Trump \u2013 to withdraw funding is a very short-sighted decision indeed. We understand the WHO would have been discussed in that phone call. Labor leader Anthony Albanese has been on ABC News speaking to Patricia Karvelas. Firstly, he says that having an additional fuel supply stored in the United States, as Angus Taylor set out earlier, is not useful because \u201cthe United States isn\u2019t New Zealand\u201d. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s not next-door,\u201d Albanese says. Fair enough, no dispute there. Next topic: what about the suggestion from RBA governor Philip Lowe that Australia would need tax and industrial relations reform to get the economy moving again, is that something Labor would support? Albanese says this is \u201chypothetical\u201d. It is a hypothetical, Parliament is not even sitting. We will work on specific proposals. What I have said is theGovernment has doubled the debt prior to the current crisis and now we have substantial levels of debt and that that is an issue that the Government has to come to terms wit and has to come up with some plans. Could that include corporate tax cuts? Albanese says a lot of companies \u201caren\u2019t going to be paying a whole lot of corporate tax cut in the coming year,\u201d presumably because they won\u2019t be making a profit. What about franking credits? We\u2019ve said we won\u2019t go to the election with the same policy we took to the last election. We have not changed that view. What if the government introduces that policy? That would be a matter for the Government. Hello, it\u2019s Calla Wahlquist taking over from Josh Taylor. In case you were ticking these events off on your apocalyptic bingo card, there is a locust plague in western New South Wales. It\u2019s only a low-density plague at the moment but Robynne Wells-Budde, a senior biosecurity officer at the NSW Department of Primary Industries, told the ABC: \u201cEven a low-density swarm has the potential to grow into something much bigger\u201d. So that\u2019s drought, fire, flood, a pandemic, and a plague of locusts, all in the past 12 months. SA premier Steven Marshall says there have been 10,000 tests for coronavirus in the state in the past two weeks. People who test negative are now being informed via text message. But still, no restrictions being eased, Marshall says. \u201cThere will be no lifting of restrictions today in South Australia. We will still be sticking to the time frame put in place by the prime minister. There is another national cabinet meeting, which will meet on Friday, but I don\u2019t envisage there will be any further changes to the restrictions in South Australia.\u201d New South Wales has also told me that opt-in for the app is their preference. \u201cThe NSW government is supportive of a national approach to contract tracing technology that is opt-in and subject to rigorous security and privacy settings,\u201d minister for customer service Victor Dominello said. \u201cThe development and rollout of the app is the federal government\u2019s responsibility. Decisions around easing of restrictions will be made based on advice and evidence from experts.\u201d The NSW inquiry into the Ruby Princess fiasco has just adjourned for the day. Just before it finished, we heard from Sebastiano Azzarelli, the ship\u2019s staff captain, who was effectively second in command. Azzarelli came aboard the Ruby Princess on February 18 in Auckland. He confirmed he was present for a phone call from the ship\u2019s bridge to the Sydney vessel traffic services (VTS) in the early moments of 19 March, as the ship pulled into Sydney harbour. The call was used to explain the medical disembarkations that had been ordered. \u201cI remember VTS called the bridge looking for [the Maritime Arrivals Reporting System] declaration, which we do not have that information,\u201d Azzarelli said. The ship\u2019s doctor, Dr Ilse Von Watzdorf, was also present for the call. Earlier in the inquiry, von Watzdorf said the disembarkations were for two patients with a heart condition and nerve damage. They had no clear and obvious signs of Covid-19, she said. Azzarelli told the inquiry he could not remember what reasons were given to VTS for the medical disembarkation. On arrival, other passengers were allowed to disembark before their Covid-19 tests were returned. The inquiry will resume tomorrow morning. Kelly reveals the government has undertaken research via surveys and focus groups that show \u201cquite a lot of support\u201d for the contact tracing app. \u201cAs I said, there\u2019s essentially three groups. There are people quite reasonably concerned about privacy concerns and other matters. For some people that, is a complete gamebreaker and they are not going to consider downloading it. Others when explained what the limitations of the app are and the privacy and data security and so forth, element which is are absolutely crucial to it, are persuaded towards the other group who are happy to do their part. He wouldn\u2019t say whether their research showed 40% of people will use the app. \u201cAnything more than zero is going to be useful. Obviously, the higher the number, the better. Whether we get to 40% or higher or lower, that remains to be seen. I think this is completely voluntary. It will depend on how many people take up the app. He again reiterates it will be key to contact tracing and easing restrictions even though Victoria has said it won\u2019t be. \u201cIt\u2019s important because if we can really get on top of that, it will allow us much more leeway to change the social distancing measures, which I\u2019m sure we all want to see happen.\u201d He said more information about the app would be released later this week. Was the advice to stop cruise ships too slow? Kelly says it\u2019s easy to judge in hindsight, and there are so many ships and thousands of people on them. \u201cWe made a decision very early in the epidemic in Australia about limiting cruise ship arrivals into Australia. We have allowed cruise ships to come for two main reasons. One, to allow Australians to come home, but also for ships that have demonstrated that they are in distress from Covid-19 or other reasons have docked. And we\u2019ve seen what that has led to. So, in terms of cruise ships, we said very early on \u2013 and there was very specific advice given to Australians about cruise ships as early as mid-March \u2013 that people should reconsider whether they should go on cruise ships as part of the advice that came from the prime minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, as I recall. So, we\u2019ve been clear in our advice. Most people have taken that on board. There are only two cruise ships still in Australian waters, and none of those have passengers on them.\u201d Given there are fewer cases there, could regional and remote areas open up sooner and act as test cases for the rest of the country? Best to wait and see, Kelly says. \u201cWe do know that remote areas, regional areas, and rural areas of Australia have less capability to cope with a large outbreak in terms of health facilities, for example, or even public health facilities to investigate such outbreaks. So, I think it\u2019s reasonable for us to wait a bit longer to really protect those healthcare assets in those places and to protect the communities in our rural, remote and regional areas.\u201d Aged care minister Richard Colbeck has put out this information on what the federal government is doing for the Newmarch aged care centre in Sydney, given the large number of cases of coronavirus at the facility: The department has activated and is funding a surge workforce to support Anglicare, including: \u2022 Access to staff through the Mable platform; \u2022 Deployment of an emergency response team through Aspen, including a First Nurse Responder to assess the staffing requirements, registered Nurses, allied health professionals and personal care workers. \u2022 Commonwealth facilitation of a roster of general practitioners to provide continuity of care for all residents. \u201cThe government has provided and is fast-tracking access to personal protective equipment (PPE) to ensure the safety of residents and staff,\u201d Colbeck said. The federal government has also provided a suite of training for all aged care workers covering outbreak management procedures, when and how to use PPE and infection control and provider Anglicare is ensuring all their staff at Newmarch have completed this training. Deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly is holding a press conference. Since 3pm yesterday afternoon, there are only four new confirmed cases of coronavirus, bringing the total to 6,649 across Australia. \u201cWe\u2019re doing well in terms of flattening the curve.\u201d He says that is key to easing restrictions. I just got back from a press conference held by Victorian health minister Jenny Mikakos. I\u2019ve been trying to establish whether state and territory governments will require people to be downloading and using the federal government\u2019s contact tracing app in order for restrictions to be eased. Mikakos told me that no, Victoria will not make it a requirement for easing restrictions, nor will Victoria need a proportion of the population using the app before it will consider easing restrictions. \u201cWe won\u2019t be compelling people to use that app,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a proposal that the federal government has taken to the national cabinet to encourage Australians to utilise the contact tracing app. I think it has some merit, personally I will download the app. I have no qualms about using the app but I do think it is important that reassurances are given to the community about how their privacy will be protected and how the app will be working.\u201d Importantly, she said Victoria \u201cwon\u2019t be setting any preconditions\u201d on uptake of the app, but preconditions would be set up around other factors, such as more testing, more tracing, and response activity if there is an outbreak in a particular area. \u201cBut that work will be done regardless of the success or otherwise of this new application,\u201d she said. That is in contrast to prime minister Scott Morrison who indicated 40% of the population would need to be using the app as we begin to ease restrictions. Deputy chief medical officer professor Paul Kelly is about to give the national update, but from the numbers we have heard so far today, it is looking good. Josh Taylor will take you through that. Thank you so much for joining us once again, and for welcoming me back. Winter lurgies will find a way to get you, if they can, so keep washing your hands and stay safe. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow. In the meantime, as always, take care of you. Reinforcing just how non-existent retail trade outside supermarkets is going to be for the next month or so, department store Myer has just extended the closure of its outlets to at least 11 May. They were closed on 29 March. Myer said the vast majority of its staff remained stood down but it has applied for the jobkeeper scheme. AAP has some NRL news: The NSW Rugby League plans to resume its grassroots competition seasons in July, but the NRL\u2019s reserve grade competition will remain cancelled due to the coronavirus. NSWRL boss Dave Trodden confirmed on Wednesday it was working towards resuming the Ron Massey Cup, Sydney Shield and women\u2019s premiership on July 18. Players will be able to return to training from the start of July, with the comeback to be rubber stamped on June 1, depending on state government approval. The development will also include all park football, ranging from under-6s to open age with 100,000 participants involved. But the top-tier competitions, including NSW Cup, Jersey Flegg, Harold Matthews, SG Ball and Tarsha Gale Cup will not come back. It\u2019s thought the cost of running what effectively would have been a 10-week season was far too great. The decision will also take a strain off NRL clubs, who had already accounted for the reserve grade competitions not returning in 2020. Waverley Mayor Paula Masselos has addressed media this afternoon to discuss plans to open the water at Bondi, Bronte and Tamarama beach. She has emphasised that people will not be allowed to exercise on the sand. There will be fences erected on the beach, tunnelling swimmers and surfers into and out of the water. \u201cIf people are not going to be respecting the current rules, and they\u2019re not going to be taking instruction ... they will be asked to leave,\u201d she said. \u201cI really wanted to ensure that we don\u2019t have to close this down. I\u2019m asking people, please abide by the social distancing requirements. If you do come and see that the corridors are really busy or there is a line, please, leave and come back another time.\u201d Bondi and Bronte beaches will be opened to surfers and ocean swimmers, while Tamarama will only be open to surfers due to dangerous conditions. The water will be opened next Tuesday after the NSW school holidays have ended. You\u2019ll be hearing these words a lot more often: A new hotline has been set up for older Australians, who might need some extra advice, or just have some questions, about Covid-19 and their care: Council on the Ageing (Cota) Australia, National Seniors Australia, Older Persons Advocacy Network (Opan) and Dementia Australia have banded together, supported by the commonwealth government, to create the National Covid Older Persons Information Line. Older people and carers are encouraged to call 1800 171 866 to speak to friendly, specially trained staff from a senior\u2019s advocacy organisation. Opan CEO Craig Gear said the hotline will provide particular support to those accessing aged care services who are disproportionately impacted by health precautions and restrictions. And then on the flip side, Citibank reports: But we suspect there were large falls in other areas of retails sales. The ABS reported declines but not the magnitude in cafes, restaurants and take away food services, clothing, footwear and personal accessory retailing and department stores. We calculated an average 16% decline across all these categories in March. There will be serious payback in April. April will be the first month where retail trade was fully covered by the closure or rapid scaling down of non-essential businesses and social distancing. We expect to see the largest decline ever recorded in the monthly retail trade data. We expect final household consumption to fall by 14% in real terms in Q2, contributing -7.4pps to Q2 GDP growth. This forecast is roughly consistent with analysis provided by the RBA governor yesterday. Yesterday, he talked of a 20% decline in aggregate hours worked in the first half of 2020. Using his 20% estimate, our modelling coefficients on hours worked to wages and nominal consumption imply a 15% decline in national accounts based household spending by mid-year. Citibank\u2019s economists have taken a look at the ABS\u2019s retail spending figures for March. They have some thoughts: In dollar terms, the increase in spending in March is equivalent to the previous 42 months combined. Total spending in March exceeded $AU30bn, $AU2.3bn higher than total spending in February. Adding up all the previous monthly changes shows that household effectively spent the sum total of the previous 42 months\u2019 gain in retail trade in March. It is therefore no wonder that supermarkets were running out of stock of some items. Not surprisingly, food and toiletry retailing led the charge in the month \u2026 up by 24%. Supermarkets reported a 22% increase in perishable groceries and a 36% increase in all other grocery items. Turnover for toilet paper, flour, rice and pasta doubled. Turnover for canned food, medicinal products and cleaning goods increased by more than 50%. The ABS also reported that the peak in supermarket spending was mid-month, before levelling off at the end of the month. But electrical products also jumped as people rushed to set up home offices. Although the preliminary retail trade release did not provide the numbers, the ABS reported that electrical, hardware and other retailing sales increased in March. This would likely have been from workers quickly requiring home office set-ups to comply with work from home directives from various employers and government-mandated physical distancing requirements. WA premier Mark McGowan: We now have 451 people who have recovered. This is an increase of eight recoveries since yesterday, and that means we now have only 88 active cases in Western Australia of Covid-19. That means 88 people, who are currently infected with Covid-19, who are either quarantined in a hotel, at home, or for those who are in a hospital bed. In total, 25 people are in hospital across the state after one person was discharged yesterday. Of that 25 people, five are in intensive care. These are all very encouraging numbers for Western Australia, but, in particular, a zero result again is just a great piece of news for our state and shows what we have been doing has been working. Western Australia has also recorded no new cases of Covid-19 in the last 24 hours. The ATO has deferred payments and lodgements, as part of the Covid response. From Michael Sukkar: The Morrison government welcomes the decision of the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) to ease the burden on tax professionals during this difficult time by providing a short-term blanket deferral for a number of lodgement and payment obligations. These lodgement deferrals will be automatically applied, and tax professionals with clients in bushfire-affected areas will continue to have the benefit of deferrals already in place as announced by the ATO on 20 January 2020. Bushfire-affected clients will have their payment due date aligned with the same due date as the blanket deferral giving these taxpayers additional time to pay. The ATO has also indicated that tax professionals will not be adversely affected if their lodgement performance does not meet the 85% performance benchmark during this time. I thank the ATO for providing this assistance to tax practitioners and for taking commonsense steps that will ease the burden on them at this time. Further information can be found on the ATO\u2019s webpage at: www.ato.gov.au/General/COVID-19/Support-for-tax-professionals/ A crew member on the Ruby Princess had a temperature of 39.2C, but had tested negative for influenza A and B, on the day that 2,700 passengers disembarked in Sydney, the special commission into the cruise ship has heard. According to the ship\u2019s internal \u201chuman health\u201d report and logs, revealed in the special commission, 128 people had also become ill in the 14 days before it docked on March 18, and 24 had temperatures above 38C. The commissioner, Bret Walker SC, is questioning the ship\u2019s senior doctor, Dr Ilse Von Watzdorf today. He asks, of that crew member with a 39.2C fever, \u201cdoes that amount to that crew member showing symptoms of Covid-19?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d says Von Watzdorf. \u201cThose symptoms are potential Covid-19.\u201d Strangely, Christian Porter has also discovered that talking with the union movement, instead of treating employee representatives as organisations which need to be crushed, can actually lead to better outcomes for everyone. Who. Knew. From that same interview, on the subject of industrial reform: ... I think we\u2019ve established a more cooperative approach with the ACTU, certainly not to say that we agree on everything, far from it. But I think that what we have is an opportunity to actually sit down with the leadership of the union movement in the near future and talk about the things that they think are going to produce the most jobs and the most wages growth and upward pressure on employment. And for us to nominate the things that we think will achieve that and to try and sort through where there\u2019s agreement and compromises can be reached. So, you know, so the only thing that we can safely say is that there are, you know, they\u2019re going to be changes in a whole range of areas and if we don\u2019t make the most of the potential for change, then we won\u2019t make the most of what our economy can be. For the record, there were \u2018massive pressures\u2019 on wage growth in Australia, BEFORE the pandemic. And by massive pressure, I mean wages had no growth. But here is Christian Porter speaking to Perth radio 6PR this morning on the economy on the other side of these most recent restrictions: Without committing to any particular changes in any particular areas, it\u2019s quite clear that the post Covid-19 economy is going to be a very different structural beast to the pre Covid-19 economy and we\u2019re going to have to look at what are rationally the best ways to move out of this period of shutdown and reanimate the economy as quickly as possible and to try and take advantages for our country and our economy and our construction and mining and manufacturing and retail sectors that might be presented by virtue of the fact that we have handled the health response as well as any country on earth. So there will be challenges and difficulties but there will also be opportunities and it would make sense for any government to consider how to make the most of those opportunities. I mean, you know, one of the things that has been said at the Reserve Bank Governor Board is that there will be certain things like wages growth which are going to have real pressures on it because of this terrible experience we\u2019ve had with Covid-19. But given the fuel won\u2019t be kept in Australia, and, in the case of a conflict, or a supply chain break (which is the point of having an emergency strategic fuel reserve in the first place) what is the point? If something happened, Australia\u2019s emergency fuel supply would be sitting in the US. Not exactly handy. Angus Taylor says its a step-by-step process: The point I have been making all along is now is the time to start building the reserve, because we can do that in a way \u2013 let me finish. We can do that in a way which is attractive to taxpayers. That\u2019s the point. Now, over time, do we want more of that to be onshore? Of course we do. Of course we do. It is better to have it located in Australia than anywhere else in the world. But let\u2019s take the opportunity as it arises. That\u2019s exactly what we are doing. Right here and now. And, of course, there are many, many scenarios \u2013 many possible disruptions \u2013 where having fuel in your supply chain will help enormously. There are some extreme scenarios you have described where it\u2019s important to have enough fuel locally as well. And we\u2019re conscious of that, which is why those discussions with the refiners, with the local industry to make sure we have enough storage here in Australia are an important part of the work we\u2019re doing right now. It\u2019s not just commuters who are buying up if you are lucky enough to live somewhere the fuel price drop has been passed along to the bowser \u2013 the Australian government is using the price war to finally do something about Australia\u2019s own fuel reserve. It just won\u2019t be kept in Australia as yet, because Angus Taylor says we have no where to keep it. Taylor: Now is the time to buy fuel. We are doing that. Now it is true, as I have already said, that we want to make sure there\u2019s enough storage in Australia to keep enough fuel domestically, as well as across the international supply chain, and we are beginning those discussions - began those discussions some time back and they will \u2013 they will \u2013 continue. But the important point here is just as it is a great time for consumers to be out buying fuel, at less than $1 a litre in many locations, so too the Australian government is taking advantage of these historically low prices. China\u2019s northeastern border province of Heilongjiang on Tuesday reported seven new locally transmitted coronavirus cases and one imported case \u2013 a Chinese national returning from Russia \u2013 prompting authorities to issue more restrictions. In Harbin, the capital of the province and where the seven new cases were reported, authorities said only local residents may enter their residential compounds. More screenings would be implemented at airports, train stations and highways. Those living in residential buildings where there have been confirmed or suspicious cases must also quarantine for 14 days. Anyone arriving from outside the city must be quarantined. While the number of imported infections has levelled off in China, the border region has become a risk to the country\u2019s recovery. The province of Heilongjiang has reported a total of 537 locally transmitted cases and 119 imported cases, mostly Chinese nationals returning from Russia. In the border town of Suifenhe, residents have been ordered to stay at home, with only one person from each household permitted to leave every three days to get supplies. Neighbouring provinces, including Jilin and Liaoning, have started to require quarantines and several rounds of tests for anyone travelling from the cities of Harbin or Mudanjiang in Heilongjjiang. The select Senate committee, chaired by Labor\u2019s Katy Gallagher with the Liberal senator James Paterson as deputy, which has been established to check the government\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic (which will hopefully include how those on a disability support pension have been left off the Covid relief payments) will hold its first public hearing on Thursday: The Committee has resolved to focus on the Australian government\u2019s health and economic response in the initial hearings. The chief medical officer, Dr Brendan Murphy has agreed to appear before the Committee this week along with key representatives of the Department of Health. The hearing will be held between 10am and 1pm on and will be broadcast publicly. Chair, Senator Katy Gallagher will attend the hearing in Parliament House along with Dr Murphy while other committee members will attend via either video conference or teleconference. The committee has also agreed to hold hearings twice a week during the initial stages of the inquiry, beginning next week. The ACT joins the jurisdictions with another day of no new cases: There have been no new cases of Covid-19 recorded in the ACT in the past 24 hours. The ACT\u2019s total is still 104. A total of 93 cases have recovered from Covid-19 and have been released from self-isolation. There is currently one (1) Covid-19 patient in the Canberra Hospital. The remainder are isolating at home with ACT Health support. The ACT has recorded three (3) deaths. The number of negative tests in the ACT is now 7152. Malcolm Turnbull finishes his virtual address. Malcolm Turnbull finishes his virtual press club appearance by repeating his call for teachers to be both paid, and respected more. He writes in his book about the great teachers he had growing up, and how they influenced him. His daughter Daisy is a very passionate teacher, who has written at length about some of the challenges in modern teaching, including the rewards, most recently, how teachers pivoted to online teaching \u2013 and all the extra work being done to keep worried and stressed students connected with their school community. Turnbull, the prime minister, says the pandemic has revealed a lot about who keeps our communities standing \u2013 and its not the millionaires or (not that they should exist) billionaires: You know, teachers, we don\u2019t esteem them enough. And, you know, frankly, I think they are, just like the nurses and doctors in the frontline in the health care system, teachers are on the frontline in the course of this pandemic, too, because they\u2019re, [supporting the frontline] even in the jurisdictions where the classrooms are diminished. Teachers are still there in front of classes, obviously, making sure that kids get the attention they need. And, you know, I think they ... I think they\u2019ve provided huge agility. ... It\u2019s not an easy thing to do. And they\u2019ve pivoted to do that and adapted very, very quickly. So, you know, I\u2019m very happy to give a shout out to Australia\u2019s teachers. How should Australia handle China, following the pandemic? Malcolm Turnbull: The question of what should be the reaction to the coronavirus vis-a-vis China, really depends on what the facts are and the extent to which China has been transparent. There are obviously very big concerns about that. It is hardly in the nature of an authoritarian regime to be open and transparent. And there are big issues about how long it was before this virus was, you know, was jumped on and recognised by the authorities in China. But that will all depend on the facts. But it\u2019s certainly, you know ... What we ... a global community, all of us, all of us human beings on this planet, we have a vested interest in this area of viruses in a globalised world. We have a vested interest in all countries being rigorously transparent about information of every ... whether it is scientific, medical, epidemiological about these viruses, because the sooner you know what\u2019s going on, the sooner you know what treatments work, what don\u2019t, you know, sooner you have the biological information on the particular, you know, virus or pathogen, the better you are. So this is where we\u2019ve got to ... this is where secrecy, lack of transparency, lack of accountability, which is obviously second nature to all governments, but most of all to authoritarian governments, is actually a big threat. So, you know, this is one area where you may want to keep your missiles secret, but as far as viruses are concerned and pandemics and, you know, the more open, the earlier, more open and more accountable and transparent you are, the better for all of our sakes. We know that the election promises and the economic settings the Coalition had in place before the pandemic won\u2019t be around for much longer. But what should they do? First and foremost, Malcolm Turnbull says, don\u2019t test out any of their ideas in the media (something his government struggled with and obviously a lesson Turnbull believes to have been hard learned). Well, what I\u2019d advise them to do is to look at options very carefully and do so without frontrunning them in the media, because if you start thought bubbling these things in the media, they\u2019ll get picked off one by one. You\u2019ve got to really ... you\u2019ve got to assess, you know, how you\u2019re going to generate the additional revenue you need. The problem with increasing taxes generally is that they are a brake on the economy. So you\u2019ve got to find, as I discuss in my book ... there\u2019s a lot in my book about tax reform and tax measures. Hopefully it\u2019s reasonably lively. It\u2019s aimed to be. But, you know, the goal should be to reduce or eliminate inefficient taxes and replace them with more efficient taxes. And I think, yeah... This is a crisis, right? And, you know, it was Rahm Emanuel the mayor of Chicago, former Obama chief of staff, who said, \u201cYou should never waste a crisis.\u201d Well, this is it. This is a crisis of unprecedented scale. And I think governments everywhere are going to have to look at it and take the opportunity to say to their public, their voters, \u201cWe have to do some extraordinary things here in order to meet this, \u2018the economic consequences of this pandemic\u2019. And that will involve, no doubt, tax reforms, which you\u2019ve got to make sure, particularly for an open economy like Australia in a very competitive world, which will become more competitive, you\u2019ve got to make sure that your tax reforms do not stifle economic activity and investment, because otherwise, you know, it becomes counterproductive. Why do we hear \u201clisten to the experts\u201d when it comes to the pandemic, but not climate change? Malcolm Turnbull thinks it is because people getting sick is something very immediate and very visible: I think it\u2019s because of the immediacy. You know, there\u2019s nothing so real and confronting as people getting sick right in the here and now before your eyes and dying right here and now before your eyes. This is, you know, this is a very harsh, immediate reality. There\u2019s always been the sense with climate change that it\u2019s something for others to worry about. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s been such a moral issue, because the, you know, the proposition has been that this generation, my generation, for example, should pay a price to reduce emissions, to ensure that future generations do not suffer the worst consequences of global warming. Well, it\u2019s kind of caught up with us now. We\u2019re starting to see terrible consequences of global warming right now, you know, more fires, more droughts, more unpredictable rainfall, erratic rainfall and so forth. Sabra Lane, who is the president of the national press club, asks about his points on the Ruby Princess: I think it\u2019ll be very interesting to find out what actually happened. You know, Bret Walker, QC, is doing an inquiry into it that the state government here in Sydney has set up. I think it\u2019s bizarre or, you know, difficult to understand how that ship ... you know, how those events occurred, Sabra. I think everyone knows that. But actually, how it happened, why it happened, who said what to whom remains to be seen. And on Donald Trump\u2019s response: I think I have stopped being surprised by President Trump. He is ... a very unorthodox operator. There\u2019s never been a president like him. And the response to the crisis in the United States has been very controversial. It\u2019s been ... it appears to have been inconsistent. And they\u2019re facing some terrible challenges there. But, you know, Donald Trump is a ... very, very unorthodox president. And you have to expect the unexpected from him. What does Malcolm Turnbull think about Scott Morrison\u2019s response to the pandemic? I think Scott Morrison as PM and working with the premiers and chief ministers has done very well in managing the Covid-19 pandemic. Look, there\u2019s obviously been ... people were concerned about mixed messaging earlier, but this is an unprecedented event. It is uncharted waters. You know, you\u2019ve got to hold the government accountable. And that\u2019s your job as journalists in particular. But equally, you\u2019ve got to recognise that there isn\u2019t a rulebook there that tells you exactly what to do. There isn\u2019t a book of precedence. The only sort of glaring mistake that was made and it was not made exclusively by the Australian government, or Australian governments, was made around the world, was I think there should have been a shut down of the cruise ship industry from early February when the Diamond Princess contagion was detected off Tokyo. But, you know, there was no ... I\u2019m not aware of any country in the world that moved on that. So that\u2019s not a specific criticism of the Australian governments. But, you know, when you look back at it, you look back at the particular vectors of contagion, those cruise ships were, you know, they were in a league of their own because they combined an ideal environment for contagion, plus a very vulnerable demographic in terms of the typical age of their passengers. For the record, Paul Kelly disputed Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s recollection of their conversation, which he called \u201ccolourful\u201d but unbalanced: Does Malcolm Turnbull have a solution to what he (and Kevin Rudd) have described as News Corp\u2019s influence over Australia\u2019s politics? Look, one doesn\u2019t readily come to hand. It is a reality that News Corporation ... you know, News Corporation, Murdoch\u2019s company, is really more like a political organisation that employs a lot of journalists than a conventional news operation. They defend their friends. They attack their enemies. They attack their friends\u2019 enemies. They don\u2019t hold their friends to account. It is ... it\u2019s very partisan and has become more and more and more so. I mean, you look ... Well, you can see the criticism that Paul Kelly made of news that I\u2019ve recounted in the book, one of our most distinguished journalists and historians. There are other criticisms there. David Crowe made similar points about why he left the Australian. But you\u2019ve got Murdoch himself, Rupert Murdoch himself in discussion with me, acknowledging that Paul Whittaker, who was then the editor of the Australian, now in charge of Sky News, subscribed to the Abbott agenda, which was to bring down my government ... and with a view to ... with the expectation that we would lose office and that Abbott would come back in opposition as leader. Now, that\u2019s crazy stuff. You know, just describing it seems crazy, but you have Rupert Murdoch himself acknowledging that Whittaker was on that agenda. And you don\u2019t have to... I mean, I don\u2019t think Rupert was mistaken. You\u2019ve only got to see the lines that were being taken in the NewsCorp newspapers. Has Australia\u2019s 29th prime minister heard from anyone who he talks about in his book, who are not happy with having their messages shared? I haven\u2019t heard from them, no. But I haven\u2019t heard from many of them for a long time. Would Malcolm Turnbull still recommend people get into politics, given his experience? He says if it is a calling, then you do what you have to to answer it. But he says it has obviously changed: People used to talk about the 24-hour news cycle as though that was indecently hasty. Nowadays, what is it? A 24-second news cycle, a 60-second news cycle? So, you know, it\u2019s a different world. And there\u2019s a pursuit. You know, there\u2019s a passage in my book where I was ... Lucy and I were chased down a flight of stairs by a press gallery pack of journalists and cameramen. And I was seeing, you know, familiar faces seeming to be transformed. They were like wild animals, you know, baying for blood, jostling each other, they nearly knocked Lucy down the stairs. Like, I caught her, literally. So, you know, it\u2019s become a very aggressive environment, I think, the media environment. And that\u2019s ... You know, the rise of social media, of course, hasn\u2019t helped that. Malcolm Turnbull is the guest of a special virtual national press club. Asked about the legacy of writing his memoir, A Bigger Picture, the former PM says he was telling his story, including his experience with depression, and believes it is an important story to tell: It\u2019s part of my story, Sabra [Lane]. It\u2019s part of my story. So it is a reality. It was a very big, significant episode in my life. And I think there is a benefit in writing about it, because I think if people of high profile that, you know, lots of people go through ... through the media and politics, they see someone like me who says, \u2018Right, I had this depressive episode. I was able to deal with it and overcome it,\u2019 that gives a lot of other people encouragement, both to acknowledge the problems they may have and also to deal with them. I\u2019ve had a lot of very positive feedback and thanks for being so open about this. The G20 chats continue. Scott Morrison has also spoken to Angela Merkel. The German leader and PM obviously had a lot to say about each country\u2019s response to Covid-19 when it came to both health and the economy. The pair also discussed the impact on other EU members. The need for caution in easing movement and physical restrictions was discussed, as well as what each nation could do when it came to repatriations (there are still citizens stranded all over the world, who are unable to get home because of travel restrictions). Of course trade was also discussed, as both leaders eye life after the immediate lockdowns and Australia is still in free trade agreements negotiations with a post-Brexit EU. Following Merkel was a conversation with Emmanuel Macron over much the same things, but the Pacific was also spoken about, given France\u2019s interests in the region. Deputy chief medical officer, professor Paul Kelly will give the national update at 3.15pm today. The crew from the Ruby Princess are being repatriated, but the debate over who is to blame for the cruise ship passengers being allowed to disperse into the community, without forced quarantine, given there were reportedly Covid-19 symptoms onboard, continues. Queensland is releasing its Covid-19 information on a new site, which will include: Total Queensland cases Total samples tested New Covid-19 cases recorded in Queenslander over the past 24 hours Active cases Recovered cases Age and gender of confirmed cases Cases by local government area and source of infection Covid-19 mapping and cumulative graphs Self-quarantine statistics You\u2019ll find all that information, here. So much of Australia\u2019s political \u201ctactics\u201d are grounded in what operatives thought was groundbreaking while at university. We just see the same guff played out time and time and time again. Except now, they actually have positions of power. Malcolm Farr has the latest in the most recent round of ridiculousness: There is a reason most jurisdictions are looking to reopen schools in the next six weeks or so. And the official report on the latest bilateral chat is out: A little more on the ABS analysis of the March retail figures Cricket Australia is the latest sporting body to have holes in its finances exposed by the pandemic. As Sam Perry reports the sport has already lost $20m despite having all but completed the southern hemisphere season, and if India don\u2019t tour this coming summer, it could lose $100m. The restrictions may be relaxed, but we know the economy is not going to \u201csnap back\u201d, something the prime minister admitted last week. And as Paul Karp has previously pointed out, employers are not going to want to deal with the applications \u2013 given their business won\u2019t be \u201cback on track\u201d either. As Paul Karp reports: The Greens\u2019 Rachel Siewert had asked the government to suspend mutual obligation requirements for jobseekers for six months. After Michaelia Cash and Anne Ruston extended the suspension to 22 May, they have written back to the Greens, linking the new date to the prime minister suggesting on 16 April that a further four weeks of Covid-19 restrictions will be required. All this tends to suggest that the rolling suspension of mutual obligation seems designed so that obligations to apply for jobs and work for the dole will \u201csnap back\u201d as soon as movement restrictions are lifted and businesses are back open. This is very welcome news Further to the Donald Trump chat this morning with Scott Morrison, John Hopkins has updated the US cases: The Actuaries Institute has prepared an exit strategy report, on what its researchers think needs to happen to as restrictions relax, but a vaccine remains elusive. You can find the whole report here, but the conclusions are: \u00b7 Recognition that there are no risk-free options, and that one-dimensional strategies which fight the virus without reference to the economic implications will kill more people from poverty and mental health issues than they save from the virus. The approach needs a careful balance between expanding economic activity and preventing the virus spreading exponentially. \u00b7 Phased introduction \u2013 perhaps by geographical region; starting with schools due to the low levels of health risk to younger people and the double-whammy of disrupted education for children and disrupted work for parents if schools are closed or only notionally open. \u00b7 A plan to deal rapidly with localised outbreaks by identifying, quarantining and testing people who may have been exposed to infection. \u00b7 A plan to lockdown again (perhaps by region) if the strategy does not work. Acknowledgement that some people will not follow the rules \u2013 so some high-risk people will be exposed by having contact with (say) family members. \u00b7 Acknowledgement that mild or asymptomatic cases could lead to further breakouts. \u00b7 Full testing within regions to ensure local elimination \u2013 as done in the north Italian town of Vo. While this could be viewed as intrusive, it is far less intrusive than requiring people to give up their livelihoods. \u00b7 Recognition that frequent heavy exposure kills healthy people \u2013 so we need to minimise people needing hospital care. We will maintain: Closed borders \u2013 we could have travel between cleared countries in time, perhaps starting with New Zealand. Limited travel between regions until they are all clear or reliable tests can be carried out before travel and at points of entry. The risk of going early is still large but it could be managed progressively \u2013 but the risk of staying out longer will be crippling for the economy. The further risk of staying out longer once community-transmitted cases have reduced to very low levels is that the community will simply stop complying. All of that toilet paper hoarding had to have some impact. The ABS has the receipts \u2013 we spent more in March then we did before the GST came into effect: Australian retail turnover rose 8.2% in March 2020, seasonally adjusted, according to preliminary retail trade figures released today by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. This is the strongest seasonally adjusted rise ever published in the Retail Trade publication, surpassing an increase of 8.1% in June 2000 when households brought forward expenditure ahead of the GST implementation. These preliminary figures, which will be subject to revision with the final monthly estimate published 6 May, 2020 in Retail Trade, Australia (Cat no 8501.0), indicate unprecedented demand in March in the food retailing industry, with strong sales across supermarkets, liquor retailing and other specialised food. The prime minister has had a chat to the United States president this morning. As you would expect, coronavirus dominated the talks, which included the health response, and how to get each country\u2019s economy back up and running. Transparency is also understood to have been on the agenda, which would have included the World Health Organisation response and communication on the pandemic. The talks are part of the regular check-in the G20 leaders are having with each other, which also includes the more vulnerable nations around them, which, in Australia\u2019s case, includes the Pacific. Queensland Greens MP for Maiwar, Michael Berkman, took to Twitter to warn that new residential tenancy laws being voted on in state parliament tonight will incidentally create new grounds for a landlord to evict a tenant. Instead of passing a moratorium on all evictions, the legislation will only outlaw evictions for tenants that can prove their income has been affected by Covid-19. But Berkman says the laws will also make it legal to evict a tenant on a fixed-term lease if they want to sell that property with vacant possession, something landlords can\u2019t do at the moment. The Tasmanian premier Peter Gutwein was just talking about the temporary visa holders which have largely been left without help during this crisis. They are not the only group who have been left stranded by this in Australia though. Asylum seekers, many of whom have no option to return home for fear of their lives, are stuck in Australia with no jobs, no government safety net and no family. The lockdown in Tasmania\u2019s north-west coast, which was put in place after an outbreak in two hospitals in the region, will be relaxed on Sunday, which is the end of the two-week quarantine period. There has been one new case of Covid-19 in the last 24 hours. On tenancy agreements, Peter Gutwein says: For clarity, today, we\u2019ll also be issuing a notice to freeze residential rent increases as well for this period through to June 30, and this will mean that rent increases can\u2019t occur. The orders will be reviewed prior to June 30, and will be extended in line with the emergency period if required at that time. But I want to, again, remind all tenants, both commercial and residential, that rents should be paid unless your financial circumstances have been severely impacted by Covid-19. This is not a passport not to pay rent. And I\u2019d also, again, remind you that your lease can still be terminated for criminal damage or other breaches of the lease. The Tasmanian premier, Peter Gutwein says a lot of temporary visa holders have been left out of the federal government assistance measures, which he wants to address: Firstly, we\u2019re going to immediately extend the eligibility for the isolation pandemic support, which is there for people who are placed into temporary self-isolation or quarantine. If a temporary visa holder can demonstrate genuine financial hardship, they\u2019ll be provided with an immediate payment of $250, and up to $1,000 for their family. Secondly, we\u2019ll also be increasing the funding available to non-government organisations to provide additional emergency relief and assistance targeted at this cohort in our community. Thirdly, whilst many of these visa holders will be unable to return to their home country due to border restrictions, and I want to make that point. There are many people that have been living and working in Tasmania that are not in a position where they can return to Italy or to Spain or to New York, or to other parts of Europe, or to the UK because of the travel restrictions. And therefore, we need to ensure that we can provide some support. But for those that can return, the third part of our step will be that we\u2019ll work with them to provide travel advice, but also if necessary, to provide some financial support to help them get home. Fourthly, we\u2019ll work with industry sectors, for employers who want to retain their employees because of their specialist skills in the state. Importantly for when their business is able to start up again in coming months, and be able to ensure that we have those skills that we need here in the state for when that startup may occur. It has been floating around again for a while, but this morning Josh Frydenberg put company tax cuts firmly back on the table. Business Council of Australia chief executive, Jennifer Westacott told Sky News\u2019s Laura Jayes they were absolutely needed (but she would say that, wouldn\u2019t she). We\u2019re trying to solve business investment, which was low before this terrible crisis. It\u2019s business investment that drives productivity which drives higher wages. So that\u2019s the problem, let\u2019s frame that up first. Look I think it is important for us to put it back on the table but along with other tax reform. It\u2019s not the only thing that needs to be done. It\u2019s important that we look at the state taxes, the productivity sapping stamp duty taxes, payroll tax. It is interesting how much payroll tax has been deferred. The whole question of the right configuration of the state taxes. Whether or not we bring forward those other income tax cuts. So it\u2019s not just company taxes but it is important we have a competitive company tax rate. To the treasurer\u2019s point, we\u2019re not asking, in the Business Council, for us to have the lowest rate, we\u2019re simply asking for a competitive rate, so that we can be a magnet for investment in this country. Because we already have so many advantages, but we have one disadvantage which is a tax rate that is so much higher than everywhere else in the world. As you and I have talked about many times, at the height of this debate, 63% of Australians supported lowering the corporate tax rate. It was people in this building, in Parliament House, who didn\u2019t see this as something that was in the national interest. And we would be in a much better starting position on recovery if we had that 25% rate. So I think we have to put it back on the table. I think we have to stop the ideological wars about it. I think we have to be willing to have a conversation not just about that tax but about the whole tax system or as much of the tax system as we have the stomach to do reform on to make us a country that rewards innovation and incentive. And obviously puts money into the pockets of Australians. In case you haven\u2019t seen this as yet, or cried today, I am giving this another run, because we all need a bit of heartbreakingly lovely in our lives. A group of friends who gathered at one of their homes to play video games are among 95 people to be issued with a $1,600 on-the-spot fine for allegedly breaching Victoria\u2019s social distancing laws in the past 24 hours. Police in Victoria said they also fined three people who, they claim, \u201cbooked a short stay accommodation so they could hand out and take drugs\u201d, as well as two people who were stopped in a car in Box Hill. As we have seen in a number of these cases in recent weeks, police allege another offence was being committed at the same time \u2013 the driver of that car in Box Hill was unlicensed, the passenger was apparently brandishing a weapon. The social distancing laws give police another reason to stop people and question their movements. As Michael McGowan reported yesterday, a number of people fined in Victoria say the police were \u201cintimidating\u201d or \u201caggressive\u201d and the laws were confusing. But police have the discretionary power to issue on-the-spot fines and question people\u2019s movements, and they are using that power. The first suspension was always going to be too short: The lifting of mutual obligations will continue until 22 May 2020 as a result of the impact of Covid-19. During this time employment services remain open and available to support jobseekers to prepare for and find available jobs. The government has a strong expectation that jobseekers will continue to work positively with their employment service provider and take advantage of all the support that is available. To further assist jobseekers to prepare for and move quickly back into work, the Morrison government is also bringing forward the Employment Fund credit for the most job-ready jobseekers to be available immediately, rather than after 13 weeks, which is currently the case. This change will apply to jobseekers who commence in jobactive from 4 May 2020. The Employment Fund can be used by employment service providers to purchase work-related items including licences, equipment, training or qualifications to ensure workers are prepared and able to take up critical roles in the economy. These arrangements by the Morrison government continue to support Australians through the challenges presented by Covid-19 and will be continually reviewed. A few people have asked about the Newmarch House employee. She was asymptomatic, meaning she was not showing any symptoms, when she went to work. She felt fine, but was tested after learning a contact of hers had been diagnosed with the virus. The NSW Department of Health have been in contact with the woman and have reported she is \u201cunderstandably distraught\u201d over the situation. Aged care workers in NSW are encouraged to get tested for the virus, given the danger it poses for the elderly. Anglicare Sydney CEO Grant Millard has told the ABC the aged care sector has been in the eye of the storm of Covid-19. It\u2019s Newmarch centre, in western Sydney, has more than 40 cases of the virus after an employee unknowingly went to work while infected. Three residents, who had been diagnosed with Covid-19, have died. Millard: We have a number of seriously ill people with Covid-19 at the moment. We feel well-supported by NSW Health. We have an infectious diseases specialist who\u2019s actually there on site helping us. It\u2019s been a massive challenge to deal with the workforce requirements, to have adequate RNs and carers in this situation. We\u2019ve had, I guess, the tragic results of having not only deaths of residents, but a number of our carers have been taken offline because they\u2019ve been either in close contact or they have had positive results themselves. So, over 55 staff at the moment of ours are just totally taken out of the equation. And we\u2019re really scratching around to have adequate staff there. Today we\u2019re happy we\u2019ve got a good number of RNs, a little short on carers. We have been reaching out to agencies locally. And the federal government has been seeking to assist us as well. It\u2019s been late to sort of get some of those resources to play, but speaking with the Aged Care Quality Safety Commission and the minister, Richard Colbeck, we\u2019re confident, but it\u2019s incredibly challenging at the moment. It\u2019s a tough environment, some seriously ill people. And just doing the normal things of caring for people\u2019s needs on a day-to-day basis, it\u2019s a particular demand for us at this time. Tim Pallas, the Victorian treasurer, has released some details on Victoria\u2019s economic modelling: What we have been able to do is produce data that shows that something like 270,000 jobs will be lost, peaking at a height in the September quarter of about 11% unemployment. Now, that is essentially twice the level of the unemployment that we\u2019re currently experiencing. What we will also see is that gross state product, the size of the Victorian economy will not be as big as we\u2019d anticipated it would be. Victoria\u2019s economy is about a $455bn proposition. For the first six months of this year, we had anticipated to see the economy be about the size of $226bn. Now that number will be $194bn. So, we\u2019ve seen a very substantial reduction in terms of the size of the Victorian economy as a consequence of the measures that are necessary to preserve public wellbeing. Property prices also will fall by about 9% by the end of this calendar year. Queensland \u2013 0 NSW - five Victoria - 2 The Victorian premier has once again warned that there will be no quick rush to remove the restrictions: In too many places around the world, where they thought they had this under control, they eased off restrictions only to then have to employ even tougher lockdowns after that. If we keep this performance going, though, if people keep doing the right thing, if people have that same sense of urgency and give this the importance that it absolutely deserves, and demands, then we will have options in a few weeks\u2019 time, and we will be able to look very carefully at those options. Let\u2019s not give back all the progress we\u2019ve made. Let\u2019s certainly not close off those options by thinking that this is over. And that relative stability in our case numbers means we can go back to normal. We simply can\u2019t. We\u2019ve all gotta keep following the rules so that in a few weeks\u2019 time we\u2019ve got some options to ease some of these measures. But I do again \u2013 I\u2019m happy to try and give people that very real sense of hope, because there is hope here, but at the same time I don\u2019t want to be making promises that can\u2019t be kept. And I certainly don\u2019t want to be sending a message to any Victorian that is over. This is going to run for months. And the recovery will take years. Dan Andrews is giving Victoria\u2019s update: I can confirm that there are 1,336 cases of coronavirus in Victoria. That is the same total as yesterday, but there are, in fact, two new cases. Two have been removed on the basis that they have been added to interstate tallies. That\u2019s where they tested positive. As you know, these numbers do jump around a little bit from day to day, and there are sometimes a few little corrections that are made. There are 29 people in hospital, including 12 in intensive care. There have been 88,000 tests completed over this global pandemic here in Victoria, which is a really significant increase in the total amount of testing that we have been doing. And that is why there\u2019s reason for such confidence in these numbers. More testing, yet very, very stable results. If we continue to see these results, then we would have options that would be denied to us if we didn\u2019t have this virus fundamentally under control. This has been an issue which has been bubbling along since the childcare subsidy was announced. There have been reports of childcare centres struggling to stay open under the plan, because of cut incomes. Amanda Rishworth has released this statement: Labor is deeply concerned by reports that the Morrison government\u2019s childcare changes have resulted in many families being forced to give up work or reduce hours as they are unable to access the care they require. Examples are emerging where, as a result of government changes, early learning providers are having to reduce staff, cut opening hours, deny care to new families or cancel existing enrolments to remain financially viable. The government\u2019s changes restrict providers to 50% of their revenue as of the beginning of March and, if eligible, jobkeeper payments. As a result many providers no longer have the financial capacity to take new enrolments or allow parents to increase their hours. Canberra has still not seen much flow-on effect on petrol prices, despite the falling price of oil. It\u2019s not alone, and the ACCC wants Australian retailers to address it: Petrol retailers should not use the current pandemic to further increase profits, which the latest ACCC petrol industry report shows have risen in recent years, and should pass on the full benefit of falling oil prices to motorists, the ACCC has said. Weekly average international crude oil prices have decreased by around US$ 50 per barrel since the beginning of the year and this has largely flowed through to Australian wholesale petrol prices, which have decreased by around 50 cents per litre (cpl) in the same period. Over the same period, seven-day rolling average petrol prices across the five largest cities (i.e. Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth) have decreased by around 45 cpl. These cities have regular petrol price cycles, which makes it difficult to assess the exact flow through of falls in international crude oil and refined petrol prices in the short term. \u201cThe drop in the crude oil price is good news for the Australian motorists. At this time the Australian economy needs all the assistance it can get, and lower world crude oil prices are one of the few positives from current world events,\u201d ACCC Chair Rod Sims said. \u201cIn the larger Australian capital cities, petrol retailers took too long to pass on the savings from the rapid drop in international oil prices, and this did not reflect well on them.\u201d In Hobart, Canberra and Darwin as well as many regional locations, retail prices have been much slower to come down and the extent of the falls has varied widely. The future of Virgin airlines in Australia continues to stoke a pre-Covid tit for tat between the major parties. Bill Shorten was happy to stand in Melbourne\u2019s cold pre-winter dark morning to chat about it with the ABC: At the end of the day, it\u2019s about the taxpayer, and it\u2019s about Australians. Is that you can either fork out the money and pay for 10,000 or 15,000 people on the dole, or you could see an underwriting of a convertible note or a loan, which provides some equity, which then eventually the gGovernment can recoup. So, really when you stop to think about it and get beyond the simple headlines of saying, \u201cIs it a foreign airline?\u201d Even though there are tens of thousands of local jobs, is it something that government should be just providing money for? There\u2019s a big difference between paying people unemployment benefits and providing support which allows investors the certainty to make sure that we have two major airlines \u2013 Qantas and Virgin \u2013 with sustainable jobs, high-skilled jobs, here in Australia. Because if we don\u2019t rescue Virgin in some form, what will happen is that, sooner or later, a foreign airline will come in. And who knows, there could be foreign crews flying over Australian air and sky, with foreign pay and conditions. So at the end of the day, this is about keeping skilled jobs, this is about making investments where perhaps the taxpayer doesn\u2019t ultimately foot the entire bill. So I think there\u2019s a deal to be done in voluntary administration, but I tell you what, for the regions, for our tourism, for low fares, and for the taxpayer not having to pay the massive costs if tens of thousands of people just lose their jobs, I think a deal should be done. And I think it\u2019s possible to be done. Josh Frydenberg then weighed in. If you visit Coles or Woolworths online, you will probably find that many of the delivery restrictions have been loosened. The community shopping hour is still in place though. Also, there no longer seems to be a problem finding toilet paper*. *A sentence I could never have predicted I\u2019d be writing in a news blog And Josh Taylor has had a chat to the podcast team about the tracing app the government wants you to download. Our very clever colleagues, Nick Evershed and Andy Ball have created this explainer of how coronavirus spreads across a population: While Australia has been focused on the Ruby Princess and its crew, it\u2019s been easy to forget there are a bunch of Australians stranded on other cruise ships, which they helped crew, all over the world. AAP has an update on the efforts to repatriate some of those Australians, who are sitting off the US: The more than 100 Australian crew members stranded for weeks on cruise ships off the US coast following tough Trump administration coronavirus restrictions may finally be rescued. The Australian government announced on Tuesday Australian crew may be allowed to join UK and European crew and be flown or take a cruise ship to England. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is currently aware of 128 Australian crew on 57 ships. Australian officials are \u201coptimistic\u201d a good number of Australian crew will be able to disembark before the end of this month. Queensland\u2019s chief medical officer, Dr Jeanette Young, told a press conference this morning that as long as physical distancing restrictions were maintained, and unwell people stayed away, there was no reason to stop visits to aged care homes. In NSW, the chief medical officer, Dr Kerry Chant, who is dealing with another outbreak at an aged care home after an employee unknowingly worked while ill, is once again encouraging all aged care workers to get tested. This morning the deputy chief medical officer Dr Nick Coatsworth said people could keep their loved ones, and those around them safe, while also ensuring they remained in contact: I have some personal experience in this, having had my father in an aged care facility up until he passed away. And it\u2019s so critical to be able to visit people for mental health reasons. And, you know, elderly Australians will get depressed and they will have all sorts of mental health effects and health effects from not having visitors. So, the medical advice has always been that visitors are allowed, in limited numbers. But please, if you are visiting someone in an elderly \u2013 an elderly relative, do not go if you have any hint of respiratory symptoms \u2013 coughs, sore throat, unwell, \u201cI\u2019m feeling a bit like I\u2019ve got a lurgy\u201d \u2013 do not go into an aged care facility. But if you are well, I would urge all aged care providers to allow visitors because it\u2019s so important for the health of your residents. With the transmission rate in Australia sitting at about 1% and while testing rates have stayed high, authorities are stepping away from blocking visits to aged care homes. Yesterday Scott Morrison said: There is great concern that the isolation of elderly people in residential care facilities where they have been prevented from having any visits, from loved ones and support people, is not good for their wellbeing, is not good for their health and so the national cabinet agreed that there needs to be a strong reminder that the national cabinet decision was to not shut people off or to lock them away in their rooms. That was never the recommendation or the advice of the national cabinet. The advice, I think, was very clear about ensuring that there could be visits of two a day \u2013 close relatives and support people \u2013 this would be undertaken in the resident\u2019s rooms but otherwise residents would be able to be in other parts of the facility, they could sit in common rooms, they could sit in outdoor areas of these facilities and we would like as many freedoms to be extended to residents in aged care facilities as is possible and there is no recommendation from the medical expert panel that they should be confined in that way. Where further restrictions should be put in place in aged care facilities is where you may have an outbreak in that facility or indeed an outbreak in the area in which the facility is located. So there are exceptional circumstances where further restrictions might be placed on people living in residential aged care facilities in terms of access to visitors. But those additional restrictions are the exception, they are not the rule, and we think it is a good thing for people to have those visits in accordance with those screening procedures and other things that are necessary to protect elderly residents in those situations. It shouldn\u2019t be done out of the convenience of isolation in terms of how these facilities are run, it should always be done always only in the interests of the care of those who are living in those facilities. Queensland has recorded no new cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours. Great news. Australia has undertaken the suppression method in response this pandemic. Lately though, as cases continue to drop, the word \u201celimination\u201d has started to drip into press conferences. Scott Morrison has said elimination may be one of the side-effects of the suppression strategy. Dr Nick Coatsworth says he is sticking with \u201csuppression\u201d. I\u2019m using the word \u201csuppression\u201d and I\u2019ll tell you why I\u2019m doing that. The problem with using words like \u201celimination\u201d and \u201ceradication\u201d is that we are a non-immune population. So, you have to be so sure that you\u2019ve got to that point that you would need to extend your restrictions for so long to get to that point, that I think that that would, you know, lead to Australians having to be under social restrictions for too long to get there. That\u2019s an honest view. If, in the process of suppressing, we get to the point of eradication, then that would be a magnificent outcome. But we must continue to build capacity and we must continue to contain the virus, and remember that we\u2019re not immune from it. So, the word that \u2013 the strategy that we\u2019re using is to \u201csuppress\u201d Covid-19 until there\u2019s a vaccine. The deputy chief medical officer Dr Nick Coatsworth has had a chat to the ABC this morning about loosening restrictions around Australia. 11 May is the date circled in the calendar at the moment. If the rate of infection stays at where it is (about 1%), then restrictions will be stepped back. What does that look like? DCoatsworth isn\u2019t entirely sure as yet: All sorts of considerations are on the table. Easing social restrictions would, by definition, mean that some of those numbers could change. It does depend, of course, as you have said in your questions, what happens in the next three weeks. But all range of options are on the table. Businesses and individuals need to prepare, though, that physical distance from one another will need to keep going. Great hand hygiene and cough etiquette will need to keep going, because we won\u2019t have a vaccine. So, whilst some restrictions may be lifted, the way we behave has to stay the same. Last night the Waverly council voted to open the water at Bondi, Bronte and Tamarama beaches from Tuesday next week, but congregating on the sand or sunbathing will still be strictly off limits. There will also be restrictions on when Sydneysiders can access the water. The beach will only open on weekdays between certain times and fences will be erected to guide swimmers and surfers in and out of the water. The council may also limit numbers during busier times. The move comes after the council area to the south, Randwick, opened its water and sand to allow people to exercise on the beach. Waverley\u2019s mayor, Paula Masselos, previously said previous that allowing people on the sand at Bondi wasn\u2019t an option as the area remains the most heavily infected in NSW. Josh Frydenberg has also, for about the third time this month, ruled out raising the GST to address Australia\u2019s coming economic grief as part of his ABC interview this morning: What we do have a plan for is obviously lower taxes and that\u2019s been our track record.\u201d The NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, offers this update on the Ruby Princess cruise ship, which is still docked off Port Kembla: Yesterday 57 crew members were escorted off the ship and a number have already flown home. Over the next three days, the balance of that 57 will be repatriated back to their home countries. The commissioner of Border Force has written to Carnival and directed that the Ruby Princess leaves Australian waters from this Thursday. So, from NSW police perspective, we are still working to that date. There are a number of other potential crew members who may be repatriated. We are waiting for information from either Carnival or other consulates in terms of absolutely fixed travel arrangements for those individuals. There\u2019s around 40 crew members who are corona-positive that Health are monitoring closely, and we\u2019ll continue to work with Health between now and Thursday to bring any crew members off the ship who require urgent medical treatment. Five people have been diagnosed with Covid-19 in the last 24 hours in NSW. Gladys Berejiklian has also spoken about the changes to Anzac Day this year under physical distancing rules: As many of you know, the dawn service from Canberra, which the prime minister is leading, will occur and will be televised. New South Wales will also have our own service at 10am, and we do encourage families to participate together, to use that time to watch the livestream service, but also to take the opportunity to reflect, to contemplate, to thank. And, more than ever, to put ourselves in the situation of those who have sacrificed for the freedom and liberty of all of us. And I think this Anzac Day more than others we\u2019ll be able to really, really soak the significance of this momentous day. And I want to thank the RSL community, especially those communities in rural and regional areas, who are used to going to their local memorial park or the memorial place of respect and worship, but unfortunately this year all of us have to do things differently. We can\u2019t turn up to the dawn service, we can\u2019t turn up to marches, we can\u2019t turn up to those regular things we do. But what we can do is still honour our servicemen and women, past and present, we can still acknowledge those in our family who have served, and, of course, support the RSL in their efforts in making sure everybody appreciates the significance of Anzac Day this year, although it will be done in different circumstances. Australia\u2019s death toll now stands at 74. The NSW chief medical officer, Dr Kerry Chant, says two more people have died after contracting Covid-19 in the last 24 hours. That is on top of the Newmarch House resident who died late yesterday. She said: There have been 33 deaths in New South Wales up until 8pm on the 21st, with three deaths in that 24-hour reporting period. There are currently 231 Covid cases being treated by NSW Health, and this includes 20 people being treated in intensive care units, with 16 of those requiring ventilators. The three further deaths relate to a 75-year-old gentleman who passed away in St George hospital and was a household contact of a known case. An 80-year-old woman, who passed away in Gosford hospital with pre-existing medical conditions, who was part of a Gosford hospital cluster. And a 92-year-old woman who was a resident of the Anglicare Newmarch House at Caddens, and who is the third death in that facility. Malcolm Turnbull is the guest at the National Press Club today \u2013 a special, socially distant edition. He has recorded his address and reporters have recorded their questions to ask him. You\u2019ll not only hear more from his book (which is a good read, for those wondering) but you\u2019ll also get his views on what\u2019s coming for Australia as it navigates public health and an economy through a pandemic, without a vaccine. Last week, speaking to Neil Mitchell on Melbourne radio 3AW, Scott Morrison was asked if it was \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d with China. The prime minister answered: Well, look, we\u2019ve always been vigilant about these things, but at the same time, we\u2019ve continued to pursue a productive, comprehensive strategic partnership with China. But we have an eyes-wide-open relationship. Back on that interview with Josh Frydenberg on ABC Breakfast, it ended with him being asked if he trusted China. That\u2019s going to be a question that pops up time and time again. Frydenberg deliberately didn\u2019t answer it: Well, I happily engage with China constructively ... Host: That wasn\u2019t the question. Do you trust China, Josh Frydenberg? Frydenberg: Well, it\u2019s not a question of trusting them. It\u2019s a question of can we work with them, and we do, and we do so constructively. And we do so in Australia\u2019s national interest. They\u2019re a country of more than a billion people. They\u2019re in our region, they\u2019re our No 1 trading partner. Many Australian livelihoods and many Australian jobs rely on those strong trading relationships with China. We don\u2019t want to move away from that. What we want to do is obviously defend Australia\u2019s national interest in whatever realm that is, and we\u2019ll continue to do so. Bondi is back. Almost. In the first stage of whatever the new normal is that we are all walking into, Waverley council last night voted to reopen Sydney\u2019s most famous beach, along with Bronte and Tamarama. The beaches were closed as part of strict physical distancing rules, after people kept flocking to the ocean. From next Tuesday people will be allowed back into the water. But only on weekdays and there is to be no chilling on the sand. Council rangers will manage \u201csurf and go\u201d and \u201cswim and go\u201d entrances, and the council has vowed to close the beaches again if the rules aren\u2019t adhered to. Still. It is something. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization has once again had to announce that it has found no evidence coronavirus came from a lab, pointing to its origins as most likely starting from animals. It hasn\u2019t worked out how it came to be transmitted to humans as yet, but is pushing back, again, against the neverending speculation it was created. Closer to home, and Josh Frydenberg has defended Peter Dutton against the Chinese embassy\u2019s criticisms. Dutton returned to work after a month off, after he contracted Covid-19 in the States, by calling for greater transparency from China about the coronavirus. Beijing, through its embassy, claimed Dutton was receiving instructions from Washington. Scott Morrison has since suggested a global inquiry needs to be held into the origins of coronavirus. Speaking to the ABC this morning, Frydenberg said Australia would defend its national interest. I think they\u2019re unwanted and unjustified comments. And what is clear is that we maintain a good relationship at the commercial level with China. They\u2019re our largest trading partner and we want that to continue. We obviously have some differences from time to time on the political and strategic levels. But, like with many countries, we make those points clear. But ultimately Peter Dutton\u2019s role, the prime minister\u2019s role, my role, and all our colleagues\u2019 roles, is to defend the Australian national interest, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll continue to do, and we\u2019ll speak up about it as required. We\u2019ll have all of that and more as the day unfolds. You have Amy Remeikis with you for most of the day. Ready?",

It is like a third world country. The public social safety net is not working.\u201d</p> <p>Stiglitz, a long-term critic of Trump, said 14% of the population was dependent on food stamps and predicted the social infrastructure could not cope with an unemployment rate that could hit 30% in the coming months.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a safety net that is inadequate. The inequality in the US is so large. This disease has targeted those with the poorest health. In the advanced world, the US is one of the countries with the poorest health overall and the greatest health inequality.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/apr/20/coronavirus-map-of-the-us-latest-cases-state-by-state\">Coronavirus map of the US: latest cases state by state</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Stiglitz said Republicans had opposed proposals to give those affected by coronavirus 10 days\u2019 sick leave, meaning many employees were going to work even while infected. \u201cThe Republicans said no because they said it would set a bad precedent. It is literally unbelievable.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cThe safety net is not adequate and is propagating the disease. There is very weak unemployment insurance and people don\u2019t think they can rely on it.\u201d</p> <p>During an interview with the Guardian to mark the paperback publication of his book People, Power, and Profits, Stiglitz was asked whether the US might be heading for a second <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/21/100-years-on-another-great-depression-coronavirus-fiscal-response\">Great Depression.</a></p> <p>\u201cYes is the answer in short,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you leave it to Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell [the Republican Senate majority leader] we will have a Great Depression.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s botched handling of the Covid-19 crisis has left the US looking like a \u201cthird world\u201d country and on course for a second Great Depression, one of the world\u2019s leading economists has warned. In a withering attack on the president, Joseph Stiglitz said millions of people were turning to food banks, turning up for work due to a lack of sick pay and dying because of health inequalities. The Nobel prize-winning economist said: \u201cThe numbers turning to food banks are just enormous and beyond the capacity of them to supply. It is like a third world country. The public social safety net is not working.\u201d Stiglitz, a long-term critic of Trump, said 14% of the population was dependent on food stamps and predicted the social infrastructure could not cope with an unemployment rate that could hit 30% in the coming months. \u201cWe have a safety net that is inadequate. The inequality in the US is so large. This disease has targeted those with the poorest health. In the advanced world, the US is one of the countries with the poorest health overall and the greatest health inequality.\u201d Stiglitz said Republicans had opposed proposals to give those affected by coronavirus 10 days\u2019 sick leave, meaning many employees were going to work even while infected. \u201cThe Republicans said no because they said it would set a bad precedent. It is literally unbelievable.\u201d He added: \u201cThe safety net is not adequate and is propagating the disease. There is very weak unemployment insurance and people don\u2019t think they can rely on it.\u201d During an interview with the Guardian to mark the paperback publication of his book People, Power, and Profits, Stiglitz was asked whether the US might be heading for a second Great Depression. \u201cYes is the answer in short,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you leave it to Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell [the Republican Senate majority leader] we will have a Great Depression. If we had the right policy structure in place we could avoid it easily.\u201d Stiglitz said that as a result of Trump\u2019s mismanagement, the White House office responsible for pandemics had been closed, funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had been cut, and the US had gone into the crisis without enough testing kits, masks and protective gear. Encouraged by Trump, some parts of the US were determined to reopen in a way that would facilitate the transmission of the disease and lead to a fresh outbreak, he added. \u201cIn those circumstances it won\u2019t be the government enforcing the lockdown, it will be fear. The concern is that people are not going to be spending on anything other than food and that\u2019s the definition of a Great Depression. \u201cWe were unprepared but, even given the degree of unpreparedness, Trump\u2019s decision to make this about politics rather than about science has meant we have responded far more poorly.\u201d Stiglitz said that if Trump were defeated in the presidential contest in November and the Democrats took control of both houses of Congress there was a chance of the US moving in a more progressive direction, but he warned Republicans would fight dirty in order to cling on to power. \u201cThere is voter suppression and gerrymandering. The Republican party knows it\u2019s a minority party and there is a no-holds-barred struggle going on to make sure a minority party rules America.\u201d Stiglitz said the current crisis would force countries to make themselves less vulnerable, and this would lead to shorter supply chains and a greater emphasis on self-sufficiency in food and energy. He added that the complexity of modern production methods meant autarky was not feasible but added: \u201cFighting global pandemics and climate change require global cooperation. It\u2019s just that the president of the United States doesn\u2019t understand that. \u201cI hope we emerge from this with the perspective that multilateralism is even more important than we thought.

As to why it did not participate, this is obviously something on which we cannot comment.\u201d</p> \n<p>On Wednesday, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, speaking in the Commons, announced that 69 people working within the NHS had died from the coronavirus. There are growing fears about the shortages of personal protective equipment within the healthcare system.</p> \n<p>Raab confirmed, in response to questions from the new Labour leader, Keir Starmer, that the government needed to \u201cstrive even harder in this incredibly difficult and competitive international environment\u201d to source protective equipment.</p> \n<p>As the Guardian has previously revealed, UK health officials <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/uk-discussed-joint-eu-plan-to-buy-covid-19-medical-supplies-say-officials\">attended meetings on 31 January, 4 February, 2 March and 13 March</a>, where joint procurement rounds for protective gear, ventilators and medical supplies were discussed.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday, the health secretary was forced to deny claims, since retracted, by the UK\u2019s most senior diplomat, Sir Simon McDonald, that ministers had made a \u201cpolitical decision\u201d in not getting involved.</p> \n<p>Speaking at Downing Street\u2019s daily press briefing on Tuesday evening, Hancock said: \u201cI have spoken to the foreign secretary. As far as I\u2019m aware there was no political decision not to participate.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe did receive an invitation in the Department of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/health\">Health</a> and it was put up to me to be asked and we joined so we are now members of that scheme.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/doctors-nurses-porters-volunteers-the-uk-health-workers-who-have-died-from-covid-19\">Doctors, nurses, porters, volunteers: the UK health workers who have died from Covid-19</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>A spokesman for the European commission rebutted any suggestion that the UK was currently involved in any of the EU\u2019s efforts to buy masks, gowns, ventilators or laboratory supplies. \u201cThey are most welcome to participate in future rounds,\u201d the spokesman said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"134c6037-2f86-41ab-a672-1986189fb60e\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/closed-borders-and-black-weddings-what-the-1918-flu-teaches-us-about-coronavirus\">1918 influenza pandemic</a>&nbsp;that killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first.

After a day of confusion in Westminster over the UK\u2019s lack of involvement in the EU\u2019s joint procurement of equipment, a spokesman for the commission appeared to bolster the claim that ministers had taken a \u201cpolitical decision\u201d to opt out. The commission spokesman said UK representatives had been briefed on the EU plans throughout February and March when they could have signed up for the huge purchases of ventilators, laboratory supplies and personal protective equipment. UK officials and ministers have repeatedly said the government only failed to take part in the schemes because \u201cowing to an initial communication problem, the UK did not receive an invitation in time\u201d. The commission spokesman told reporters in Brussels: \u201cThe EU commission already announced on 31 January that it could help member states with organisation of such joint procurement schemes and this idea of joint procurement and reporting on the state of the medical supplies of the member states was a recurring topic of the agenda of the health and security committee meetings. \u201cThe UK was, as all other members of the health security committee meetings, aware of the work that was ongoing and had ample opportunity to express its wish to participate in a joint procurement if it wanted to do so. As to why it did not participate, this is obviously something on which we cannot comment.\u201d On Wednesday, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, speaking in the Commons, announced that 69 people working within the NHS had died from the coronavirus. There are growing fears about the shortages of personal protective equipment within the healthcare system. Raab confirmed, in response to questions from the new Labour leader, Keir Starmer, that the government needed to \u201cstrive even harder in this incredibly difficult and competitive international environment\u201d to source protective equipment. As the Guardian has previously revealed, UK health officials attended meetings on 31 January, 4 February, 2 March and 13 March, where joint procurement rounds for protective gear, ventilators and medical supplies were discussed. On Tuesday, the health secretary was forced to deny claims, since retracted, by the UK\u2019s most senior diplomat, Sir Simon McDonald, that ministers had made a \u201cpolitical decision\u201d in not getting involved. Speaking at Downing Street\u2019s daily press briefing on Tuesday evening, Hancock said: \u201cI have spoken to the foreign secretary. As far as I\u2019m aware there was no political decision not to participate. \u201cWe did receive an invitation in the Department of Health and it was put up to me to be asked and we joined so we are now members of that scheme.\u201d A spokesman for the European commission rebutted any suggestion that the UK was currently involved in any of the EU\u2019s efforts to buy masks, gowns, ventilators or laboratory supplies. \u201cThey are most welcome to participate in future rounds,\u201d the spokesman said. The EU launched four rounds of procurement of personal protective equipment, ventilators and laboratory supplies in late February and March. The Guardian revealed last week that UK officials failed to take up an invitation to join the steering committee of participating countries that issues orders for medical equipment until 19 March \u2013 after the bulk purchases had been made. The UK\u2019s involvement in the EU\u2019s scheme would not have precluded independent efforts to source equipment. Deliveries of protective equipment to European health workers are expected within days.",

      "bodyText": "Survivors of the Manchester Arena bombing have been denied legal representation at the hearings after it was ruled they are not considered core participants. A group of 56 survivors had wanted to play a central part at the inquiry, which is due to examine the intelligence background and emergency response on the day. They include a father who was left in a wheelchair and another who was blinded in one eye. The inquiry was due to begin on 15 June but has been delayed until September because of the coronavirus pandemic. Brenda Campbell QC told a video-link hearing this month that holding an inquiry without their participation would be an \u201caffront to the confidence of the public\u201d. She argued that those injured in the attack should be granted core participant status and be legally represented, including doctors, retired police officers and members of the public who \u201cplugged a gap\u201d in the emergency response as they waited hours for help to arrive. In total, 93 people were either seriously or very seriously injured in the suicide bombing in May 2017, along with the 22 fatalities. Some remained in hospital for months, many were discharged to round-the-clock care and others were \u201clearning to cope in a world they never previously conceived of\u201d, said Campbell. However, Sir John Saunders, the chairman of the public inquiry, has ruled they can participate as witnesses but cannot have legal representation. In making his ruling, he issued a separate statement justifying his decision. He accepted the attack had had a \u201cterrible and lasting impact\u201d on the survivors and added: \u201cThe injuries, trauma and personal tragedy that the survivors have suffered cannot be overstated.\u201d He said: \u201cI fully appreciate that this application is born of the desire of the survivors to ensure that the reasons for the attack are fully understood, the adequacy of the emergency response is examined, and that lessons are learned.\u201d But he went on to say: \u201cAfter a great deal of anxious thought, I have decided to refuse this application.\u201d The former high court judge said the survivors would still have a \u201cvoice in this inquiry\u201d, adding: \u201cI have concluded that they will be able to contribute to the inquiry without core participant status and I strongly encourage them to do so.\u201d He promised the survivors would be able to raise any concerns with the legal team running the inquiry and help \u201cidentify lines of inquiry that they would wish to have pursued\u201d. Some bereaved families agreed with Saunders\u2019 decision, saying he was correct to exclude survivors from core participation because they might \u201cdilute the focus\u201d. Following the ruling, Saoirse de Bont, a solicitor at Irwin Mitchell representing the survivors, said some of her clients had been \u201cclose to death\u201d and they believed the inquiry would now be \u201climited\u201d as a result of the ruling. She added: \u201cThe survivor victim families we represent are very disappointed with today\u2019s decision. They will not have the same rights and access to the inquiry as other core participants such as the police and government. \u201cThey will not be able to play a core participant role in the inquiry and they believe that the investigation to learn lessons will be limited as a result.\u201d",

Hiscox sold policies before coronavirus hit the headlines, stating it would pay out when a business was forced to shut owing to a notifiable disease. Business owners have filed claims to Hiscox and other commercial insurers only to be told their business interruption policies do not cover the pandemic. Michael Kill, the chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA), which is coordinating the action, said: \u201cBusinesses are being denied legitimate insurance claims, many claims are being disputed by insurers based on contrived arguments to avoid sharing the financial burden during the Covid-19 crisis.\u201d Paul Daly, the owner of Roadtrip &amp; The Workshop bars, housed in one building in Shoreditch, in London, and a member of the NTIA group, said he paid \u00a318,000 a year for his business interruption insurance policy with Hiscox, which he believed included cover for government-imposed shutdowns during a pandemic. Daly\u2019s takings plunged to zero when his venue closed on 17 March but his claim with Hiscox has been turned down. \u201cPeople\u2019s livelihoods are at stake here. I\u2019m worried.

It\u2019s like someone came into my bar and bought a drink and then I don\u2019t give it to them.\u201d The group, which is being advised by the licensing industry barrister Philip Kolvin QC, is calling on more businesses to join its move against the insurer. On Wednesday, Hiscox said it had about 10,000 companies which had purchased cover for business interruption and had been directly impacted by the government-imposed closures. It said its core small commercial package policies did not provide cover for business interruption as a result of the \u201cgeneral measures\u201d taken by the government in response to the pandemic. It said in a statement: \u201cA number of UK policyholders have disputed the application of their policy in relation to business interruption. Hiscox recognises these are extremely difficult times for businesses and is determined to help provide greater certainty for customers. As a priority it will therefore work with the UK insurance industry, its regulators and its customers to seek means of expediting resolution through the range of independent mechanisms available.\u201d The NTIA action comes as two separate Hiscox action groups, together involving about 200 more claimants, also consider legal action. The chef Raymond Blanc has also reportedly signed up lawyers after being denied a payout by Hiscox. One action group backed by the insurance brokers advisory firm CEC, representing more than 30 businesses including gyms, restaurants and golf professionals, said at least some of Hiscox\u2019s policies clearly state it would pay up where the interruption to the business was \u201cdue to restrictions imposed by a public authority during the period of insurance following an occurrence of a notifiable human disease\u201d. Roger Topping, of the action group, said some of the policies stated payouts would reflect how the business would have traded if the restrictions had not been imposed. Business interruption policies typically pay up to \u00a3100,000 to cover the cost of keeping a company going if it is forced to close for reasons beyond its control. These include flood, fire, or even when a murder prevents the site from opening. Simon Ager, who runs the Pinnacle climbing centre in Northampton, started an action group that now has more than 100 members after being told his policy with Hiscox, including cover for losses up to \u00a3100,000, would not pay out on coronavirus pandemic claims. On Wednesday, Hiscox said it had about 10,000 companies which had purchased cover for business interruption and had been directly impacted by the government-imposed closures. Hiscox added it was \u201cactively settling claims\u201d for event cancellation and abandonment, media and entertainment and other industries including travel. It expects to pay out $150m (\u00a3120m) to settle claims if restrictions on travel and mass gatherings continue for six months.",

      "bodyText": "The amount of money migrant workers send back to their home countries is expected to decrease by almost $110bn this year as the Covid 19 pandemic increases unemployment across the world. Remittances to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are projected to fall by nearly 20% to $445bn (\u00a3360bn), \u201crepresenting the loss of a crucial financial lifeline for many vulnerable households\u201d, the World Bank said. Describing the decrease as the worst in recent history, including the 2008 financial crisis, the Washington-based development bank said migrant workers were especially vulnerable to losing their jobs during coronavirus lockdowns which are still largely in place across the developed world. Remittances total aabout three times the amount of aid received by low-income countries and have become a cornerstone of living standards across the developing world. Migrants typically send money to their families to boost living standards in some of the poorest parts of the world, including south Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and South America. Eastern Europe is expected to be one of the worst-hit regions as migrant workers in western Europe and Russia are forced to cut back the amounts they send back to families in Romania, Bulgaria, Ukraine and other former Soviet bloc countries. The World Bank said studies showed that remittances alleviated poverty in lower- and middle-income countries, improved nutrition, were linked to higher spending on education, and reduced child labour in disadvantaged households. \u201cA fall in remittances affect families\u2019 ability to spend on these areas as more of their finances will be directed to solve food shortages and immediate livelihoods needs,\u201d it said. Countries that are large recipients of remittances, such as India, have also imposed lockdowns, causing widespread unemployment and hardship, often making the situation even worse for families that suffer a decline in money being sent home. Oil-dependent countries, which have seen crude prices tumble from more than $60 a barrel in January to less than $20 a barrel this week, have also been hit by the economic impact of the pandemic, limiting the amount of help they can offer poor families. Dilip Ratha, chief economist for migration and remittances at the World Bank, said migrants often worked in insecure jobs and were among the first to be let go in a crisis. \u201cBut it is not just that they lose their jobs, the stores they use to send cash home have also shut down,\u201d he said. \u201cMigrants typically send small amounts of cash via stores and these have closed.\u201d Ratha said the developed world has come to depend on migrant workers for cheap and skilled labour, and should do more to alleviate their situation. They need access to healthcare for themselves and their families and cut-price banking facilities, which would allow them to send money home without paying high fees and commissions. Last year, remittances reached an all-time high of $554bn. Next year, the World Bank expects a 5.6% recovery from the $445bn predicted this year to $470bn. It said: \u201cThe outlook for remittance remains as uncertain as the impact of Covid-19 on the outlook for global growth and on the measures to restrain the spread of the disease. \u201cIn the past, remittances have been countercyclical, where workers send more money home in times of crisis and hardship back home.

      "bodyText": "Airlines in Europe have applied for \u20ac12.8bn (\u00a311.3bn) government support since the start of the coronavirus pandemic with no binding environmental conditions attached, according to an analysis of the sector\u2019s bailout pleas. By Tuesday this week, airlines including easyJet, Scandinavian Airlines and Tui had secured loans and other financial support amounting to \u20ac3.36bn. A further \u20ac9.47bn is being sought by other airlines, data tracking by Transport &amp; Environment, Greenpeace and Carbon Watch reveals. By the time air travel came to a near halt in March, greenhouse gas emissions from the sector had reached record levels. But there are no binding environmental conditions being attached to any of the already agreed bailouts or future loans being sought. The exception is in Austria, where the transport minister, Leonore Gewessler, responded to a request for public support by Austrian Airlines (part of the Lufthansa group) by saying any bailout should be linked to climate targets. The amounts being negotiated for bailout plans and recapitalisation are likely to increase as talks continue with some of the biggest European airlines, including Air France, KLM, Lufthansa, British Airways and Alitalia. In the UK, Virgin\u2019s Richard Branson has come under fire for seeking a \u00a3565m bailout from the government. He has been told to explore other ways of getting cash before seeking state aid but environmental conditions have not been at the forefront of government comments on the bailout plea. EasyJet, which has secured a \u00a3600m emergency loan from the UK government, emitted 4.1% more CO2 in 2019 than in 2018. Andrew Murphy, the aviation manager for Transport &amp; Environment, said: \u201cAirlines are seeking public money so they can get back to the business-as-usual of soaring emissions enabled by light-touch pollution laws and tax exemptions. \u201cIt\u2019s time to ensure that aviation makes a green transition by linking aid to taxes and greener fuels which will reverse the sector\u2019s rapid emissions growth.\u201d Aviation is one of the fastest growing contributors to greenhouse gas emissions over the past 20 years. In the last five years there has been a 26% rise in GHG emissions from aviation. Last year, Ryanair joined coal plants as one of Europe\u2019s top 10 polluters after increasing its emissions on flights within the continent by 5.9%. A global scheme run by the UN to offset aviation emissions that grow above 2020 levels, known as Corsia, began this year, but airlines are seeking delays and changes to it as a result of the coronavirus crisis. The analysis published on Wednesday reveals that five of the airlines seeking or receiving state aid as a result of the Covid 19 pandemic have earned more than \u20ac1bn in net profits in the past five years. These include IAG, which owns British Airways (\u20ac9.37bn profit), Lufthansa group (\u20ac8.17bn), Tui group (\u20ac3.09bn), easyJet (\u20ac2.39bn) and Air France-KLM (\u20ac1.05bn). Airlines do not pay fuel taxes or VAT on flights. Faiza Oulahsen, from Greenpeace EU, said: \u201cPublic bailouts must come with strict conditions to protect jobs and slash the aviation sector\u2019s soaring contribution to climate breakdown. \u201cAny public funding should lay the foundation for a just and green transition for people and planet, with widespread investment in transport alternatives like trains. Governments must address both the economic impacts of the Covid-19 crisis and the crisis we face in climate change.\u201d",

He added that this made Britain\u2019s overall tax system highly regressive because the gains from rising wealth tended to be concentrated among the better off while council tax, VAT, the BBC licence fee and duties on alcohol and tobacco took up a bigger slice of the incomes of the poorest households. The effective tax rate for the wealthiest 10% of the population \u2013 once income and wealth were combined \u2013 was 18%, less than half the 42% effective tax rate for the bottom 10%. \u201cWhat the data shows is that if we treat all sources of financial gain to a household, whether from income or from increases in the value of assets, as being of equal value then we have a very regressive tax system in the UK.

Players have been given training schedules and even equipment to keep them in shape, but the referees have far fewer resources at their disposal.</p> <p>\u201cWhen they get furloughed, it means we can\u2019t send them training programmes,\u201d says Ganson, a former high-profile official. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to adapt, use their own initiative and be professional. They know we\u2019re going to need them on form when they come back because it\u2019s going to be chaotic, but I\u2019m confident in the commitment they show that they will return from this strongly.\u201d</p> <p>Some referees have been busier than others during lockdown.

      "bodyText": "When the Rugby Football League furloughed its refereeing department shortly after the suspension of the domestic league season last month, its nine full-time officials and numerous support staff suddenly found themselves stood down. While the players\u2019 welfare has been in the spotlight during the pandemic, the men in the middle will be no different but face an arguably more daunting task to be ready when the time comes to start up again. \u201cI guess it\u2019s easy to think these lads aren\u2019t human at times when they\u2019re getting horrendous abuse from the terraces, but they need supporting as much as the players do,\u201d says the RFL\u2019s head of match officials, Steve Ganson. A full-time referee earns considerably less than an average Super League player, but is still subject to a gruelling conditioning to meet the demands of officiating an often relentless sport. Players have been given training schedules and even equipment to keep them in shape, but the referees have far fewer resources at their disposal. \u201cWhen they get furloughed, it means we can\u2019t send them training programmes,\u201d says Ganson, a former high-profile official. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to adapt, use their own initiative and be professional. They know we\u2019re going to need them on form when they come back because it\u2019s going to be chaotic, but I\u2019m confident in the commitment they show that they will return from this strongly.\u201d Some referees have been busier than others during lockdown. Chris Kendall, who officiated the Super League Grand Final last year, has filled his impromptu off-season with running, cycling and, perhaps most importantly, community spirit aplenty in his hometown of Huddersfield. \u201cMyself and my girlfriend have both signed up for the NHS volunteer scheme and our local council are wanting volunteers, too,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some elderly neighbours who we\u2019re delivering food and daily essentials to. I just want to keep people going throughout these difficult times; what I\u2019m doing is pretty insignificant compared to the frontline workers.\u201d With rugby league likely to play multiple games each week when the season eventually returns, officials will see their workload doubled, plus there is added mental pressure. \u201cThey run around six or seven miles a game on average, but they will have hundreds of rucks and plays to rule over too, plus the abuse and pressure which comes with the territory,\u201d Ganson says. \u201cThe mental toll officiating takes on you is enormous.

      "body": "<p>Over the past few years, sustainable fashion has been inching towards the mainstream. Now, given the pandemic crisis, discussion of how to create a more ethical and less environmentally damaging model for an industry that is responsible for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/apr/07/fast-fashion-speeding-toward-environmental-disaster-report-warns\">10% of global carbon dioxide emissions every year</a> is more relevant than ever.</p> <p>With much of the usual churn on pause because of coronavirus and many of the cracks of the industry coming to the fore \u2013 not least in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/19/garment-workers-face-destitution-as-covid-19-closes-factories\">Bangladesh, where garment workers are facing destitution as big-name brands cancel their orders</a> \u2013 some people in the industry are taking this hiatus as an opportunity to reassess fashion\u2019s direction of travel.</p> <p>From a change in consumer attitudes to a slowing down of the seasonal model or an uptick in respect for the garment workers that power it, we asked some of the most respected names in the world of sustainable fashion what they hope the industry of the future will look like.</p> <h2>Aditi Mayer, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/aditimayer/?hl=en\">sustainable fashion advocate and journalist</a>: \u2018It\u2019s a unique moment because consumers are paying attention\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd5d366b31d5eb0ac145aede50635a914847146c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd5d366b31d5eb0ac145aede50635a914847146c/0_5_3200_1921/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aditi Mayer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aditi Mayer: \u2018Our business is screeching to a halt.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Provided by Aditi Mayer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Coronavirus is exposing the cracks in our system. As business is screeching to a halt, garment workers where I\u2019m based in Los Angeles are facing unique circumstances. \u2063\u2063Many earn an average of $6 an hour and face food insecurity, as well as inability to pay their rent, utilities and other bills due to loss of income.\u2063\u2063 Yet the continued demand for PPE orders means that many factories remain open.</p> <p>Many workers are navigating the sweatshop conditions they would face on any other day \u2013 except now, the risks of poor ventilation, dirty conditions and no social-distancing practices are exacerbating the risk of disease.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the world, we are seeing major brands pull out of orders using the contractual terms of force majeure. But if you look at who some of these brands are \u2013 H&amp;M, Target, Zara, C&amp;A \u2013 they have huge bottom lines.</p> <p>My hope for a post-coronavirus future is one that values those in the supply chain. Garment workers are the heart of the fashion industry but are treated the worst and often come from the most marginalised communities.</p> <p>Am I hopeful? On the one hand, many of us have been saying the same thing for years. But there is a shifting tide. It is a unique moment because consumers are paying attention and reorienting our relationship with consumption. Governments and corporations are being called out and garment workers are continuing to resist, as they always have.</p> <p>Now is the time to reimagine new systems. I am challenging myself and others \u2013 beyond these systems that we are critiquing, let\u2019s propose alternatives. There is a meaningful transnational solidarity that can be done right now, from Los Angeles, from Bangladesh.</p> <h2>Dana Thomas, <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/554229/fashionopolis-by-dana-thomas/\">author of Fashionopolis: The Price of Fast Fashion and the Future of Clothes</a>: \u2018Brands need to become more truly global\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a3d7bf4970ff1f4319afd161507f959be4bd965d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3d7bf4970ff1f4319afd161507f959be4bd965d/0_25_2841_3550/800.jpg\" alt=\"Dana Thomas\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dana Thomas: \u2018Now is the time to be replacing old machines with cleaner and safer systems.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Gregan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My hope for the future is that fashion brands can put together better, more transparent supply chains. Many brands have long put forth that the reason they contract to factories in places such as Bangladesh, Vietnam and Cambodia is to lift workers out of poverty and bring jobs to those regions. Yet the majority of these brands have cancelled their orders and threatened to withhold payments even for finished clothing, even though they have the money. They are thus throwing these countries into economic meltdown.</p> <p>With the factory closed and workers furloughed, now is the time to be replacing old machines with new, state-of-the-art, cleaner and safer systems. I hope brands will streamline and I hope there will be some near-shoring and re-shoring and right-shoring, because we are going to keep having crises like this and supply chains are such delicately balanced systems; like dominoes, if one goes down, it all goes down.</p> <p>Brands need to not be so vulnerable by becoming more independent and, in a sense, more truly global. You have one third of your manufacturing in one part of the world, one third in another, another third in another; some of it\u2019s far, some of it\u2019s close. Bring some manufacturing home instead \u2013 there is such great advantage to localising. But more than that, companies should take on the responsibility of looking after workers and making sure everything is sourced cleanly and leftovers are disposed of correctly.</p> <h2>Rahemur Rahman, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/rahemurrahman/?hl=en\">sustainable menswear designer</a>: \u2018Two collections a year is enough\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ebc290a2efaab9f1adb60b0259e60dbdb4543cf6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebc290a2efaab9f1adb60b0259e60dbdb4543cf6/2_0_635_794/400.jpg\" alt=\"Rahemur Rahman\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rahemur Rahman: \u2018I hope young and emerging designers might have more of a voice.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lily Vetch</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before coronavirus we were already discussing the need to stop and reevaluate. But nobody was voluntarily going to stop, because it\u2019s business. This has forced us to stop and even big conglomerates like LVMH are thinking: \u201cWhat does fashion actually mean now?\u201d This is going to make designers look introspectively and think: \u201cHow much am I going to make?\u201d</p> <p>I am hopeful that it is going to allow us to redefine the fashion schedule. I was talking to Patrick McDowell, Bethany Williams and other young designers in London about getting tired of all the stuff we had to produce. Two collections a year is enough, without all the pre-collections. The BFC could put out a statement, setting out all the reasons why it makes sense \u2013 but it would need to be an international effort.</p> <p>I hope that because of this young and emerging designers might have more of a voice in the room when big decisions are being made about the industry. Coronavirus is pushing everything online and online platforms are giving people who potentially wouldn\u2019t have had much of a say before, a massive say. Nobody is going to fashion week but Ahluwalia Studio just dropped the Matches collection through Instagram \u2013 it\u2019s so much more powerful because it\u2019s coming straight from the brand.</p> <h2><strong>Celine Semaan, </strong>designer, advocate, writer and founder of <a href=\"https://slowfactory.com/\">Slow Factory</a> and <a href=\"https://studyhall.earth/\">The Library Study Hall</a><strong>: \u2018T</strong>he systems that are thriving are those that were built around community\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ed461134a61bd3964fcd32299754294e8da04ef4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed461134a61bd3964fcd32299754294e8da04ef4/0_0_1556_1945/800.jpg\" alt=\"Celine Semaan\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Celine Semaan: \u2018I don\u2019t think the public or the employees will allow a return to business as usual.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Callaway</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unfortunately it took a shock like this for companies to open their eyes and see that the systems they have built around profit and growth can crumble easily; there isn\u2019t any resilience and retail is being hit really hard. It feels like everything is opening up so it can be scrutinised and redesigned. We need to put the health of our ecosystems at the heart of our business systems. That means designing systems from a human, community-centred perspective rather than one that is profit-centred, like we have now with capitalism.</p> <p>Everyone can learn a lot from adopting a more resilient business model; for example, businesses already built around a slow fashion mentality and sustainable growth, such as Eileen Fisher, are not being affected tremendously by this storm. The systems that are thriving are those that were built around community, planet, kindness, and ecosystems.</p> <p>We need to design a production model that doesn\u2019t overproduce and over-manufacture because a system that yields over-consumption cannot last. I don\u2019t think the public or the employees will allow a return to business as usual.

      "bodyText": "Over the past few years, sustainable fashion has been inching towards the mainstream. Now, given the pandemic crisis, discussion of how to create a more ethical and less environmentally damaging model for an industry that is responsible for 10% of global carbon dioxide emissions every year is more relevant than ever. With much of the usual churn on pause because of coronavirus and many of the cracks of the industry coming to the fore \u2013 not least in Bangladesh, where garment workers are facing destitution as big-name brands cancel their orders \u2013 some people in the industry are taking this hiatus as an opportunity to reassess fashion\u2019s direction of travel. From a change in consumer attitudes to a slowing down of the seasonal model or an uptick in respect for the garment workers that power it, we asked some of the most respected names in the world of sustainable fashion what they hope the industry of the future will look like. Aditi Mayer, sustainable fashion advocate and journalist: \u2018It\u2019s a unique moment because consumers are paying attention\u2019 Coronavirus is exposing the cracks in our system. As business is screeching to a halt, garment workers where I\u2019m based in Los Angeles are facing unique circumstances. \u2063\u2063Many earn an average of $6 an hour and face food insecurity, as well as inability to pay their rent, utilities and other bills due to loss of income.\u2063\u2063 Yet the continued demand for PPE orders means that many factories remain open. Many workers are navigating the sweatshop conditions they would face on any other day \u2013 except now, the risks of poor ventilation, dirty conditions and no social-distancing practices are exacerbating the risk of disease. Elsewhere in the world, we are seeing major brands pull out of orders using the contractual terms of force majeure. But if you look at who some of these brands are \u2013 H&amp;M, Target, Zara, C&amp;A \u2013 they have huge bottom lines. My hope for a post-coronavirus future is one that values those in the supply chain. Garment workers are the heart of the fashion industry but are treated the worst and often come from the most marginalised communities. Am I hopeful? On the one hand, many of us have been saying the same thing for years. But there is a shifting tide. It is a unique moment because consumers are paying attention and reorienting our relationship with consumption. Governments and corporations are being called out and garment workers are continuing to resist, as they always have. Now is the time to reimagine new systems. I am challenging myself and others \u2013 beyond these systems that we are critiquing, let\u2019s propose alternatives. There is a meaningful transnational solidarity that can be done right now, from Los Angeles, from Bangladesh. Dana Thomas, author of Fashionopolis: The Price of Fast Fashion and the Future of Clothes: \u2018Brands need to become more truly global\u2019 My hope for the future is that fashion brands can put together better, more transparent supply chains. Many brands have long put forth that the reason they contract to factories in places such as Bangladesh, Vietnam and Cambodia is to lift workers out of poverty and bring jobs to those regions. Yet the majority of these brands have cancelled their orders and threatened to withhold payments even for finished clothing, even though they have the money. They are thus throwing these countries into economic meltdown. With the factory closed and workers furloughed, now is the time to be replacing old machines with new, state-of-the-art, cleaner and safer systems. I hope brands will streamline and I hope there will be some near-shoring and re-shoring and right-shoring, because we are going to keep having crises like this and supply chains are such delicately balanced systems; like dominoes, if one goes down, it all goes down. Brands need to not be so vulnerable by becoming more independent and, in a sense, more truly global. You have one third of your manufacturing in one part of the world, one third in another, another third in another; some of it\u2019s far, some of it\u2019s close. Bring some manufacturing home instead \u2013 there is such great advantage to localising. But more than that, companies should take on the responsibility of looking after workers and making sure everything is sourced cleanly and leftovers are disposed of correctly. Rahemur Rahman, sustainable menswear designer: \u2018Two collections a year is enough\u2019 Before coronavirus we were already discussing the need to stop and reevaluate. But nobody was voluntarily going to stop, because it\u2019s business. This has forced us to stop and even big conglomerates like LVMH are thinking: \u201cWhat does fashion actually mean now?\u201d This is going to make designers look introspectively and think: \u201cHow much am I going to make?\u201d I am hopeful that it is going to allow us to redefine the fashion schedule. I was talking to Patrick McDowell, Bethany Williams and other young designers in London about getting tired of all the stuff we had to produce. Two collections a year is enough, without all the pre-collections. The BFC could put out a statement, setting out all the reasons why it makes sense \u2013 but it would need to be an international effort. I hope that because of this young and emerging designers might have more of a voice in the room when big decisions are being made about the industry. Coronavirus is pushing everything online and online platforms are giving people who potentially wouldn\u2019t have had much of a say before, a massive say. Nobody is going to fashion week but Ahluwalia Studio just dropped the Matches collection through Instagram \u2013 it\u2019s so much more powerful because it\u2019s coming straight from the brand. Celine Semaan, designer, advocate, writer and founder of Slow Factory and The Library Study Hall: \u2018The systems that are thriving are those that were built around community\u2019 Unfortunately it took a shock like this for companies to open their eyes and see that the systems they have built around profit and growth can crumble easily; there isn\u2019t any resilience and retail is being hit really hard. It feels like everything is opening up so it can be scrutinised and redesigned. We need to put the health of our ecosystems at the heart of our business systems. That means designing systems from a human, community-centred perspective rather than one that is profit-centred, like we have now with capitalism. Everyone can learn a lot from adopting a more resilient business model; for example, businesses already built around a slow fashion mentality and sustainable growth, such as Eileen Fisher, are not being affected tremendously by this storm. The systems that are thriving are those that were built around community, planet, kindness, and ecosystems. We need to design a production model that doesn\u2019t overproduce and over-manufacture because a system that yields over-consumption cannot last. I don\u2019t think the public or the employees will allow a return to business as usual. There are a lot of unions being formed, such as at Everlane, and there is growing solidarity among employees across companies. Right now we are seeing that collective action is not actually that difficult. There is only one way from here: up. Orsola de Castro, co-founder of Fashion Revolution: \u2018It\u2019s a good opportunity to break the hegemony\u2019 The fashion industry is facing a massive crisis, but after a period of restriction we tend to fall back into excess.

But I also hope that we pause and realise we don\u2019t necessarily need 12 pairs of jeans and God knows how many sweatpants.

The centrifugal force caused him to black out at regular intervals, which at least momentarily stopped the screaming. An unfortunate business, all told, especially as The Fiver now faces a workplace tribunal and possible police charges, but at least it got us two-thirds of the way through the top story on yet another quiet news day, so every cloud and all that.</p> <p>It does however mean that it\u2019s left to The Fiver to explain the latest development in this big Toon deal.

That\u2019s because they hold the TV rights for the Middle East, and angrily claim that Saudi Arabia is allowing a pirate firm, the provocatively titled beoutQ, to illegally broadcast matches in the country. In other words, don\u2019t bite the hand that feeds. The Saudis vigorously deny the charge, leaving the Premier League to make an unenviable choice: annoy the people who put hundreds of millions into the game \u2026 or the people who are promising to put hundreds of millions into the game. Po\u2019 Premier League! It\u2019s tough when the buck stops with you, as The Fiver fears it will soon find out. And that\u2019s before we foot the bill for BS Fiver\u2019s replacement shoes and therapy.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cWe need to stand up together and for each other and support each other.

Back in the mid-90s, a few friends and I made the trip to see Wimbledon v Southampton at Selhurst Park. That evening, extremely refreshed from the day\u2019s pre- and post-match activities, we were stumbling home past an old, derelict house, which we immediately decided must be haunted and warranted further investigation. Walking through an unlocked door into a pitch-black room, myself and one other chap dropped suddenly into a gaping hole in the floor. My mate landed badly, catching his arm across a beam of wood, which required immediate medical attention (the arm, not the wood) and subsequent operation to fix a shattered elbow \u2013 pins, screws, the whole shooting match. To this day he cannot straighten that arm. Days after the event I noticed that a button on the shirt I had been wearing had broken in half and was barely attached to the garment. I was otherwise entirely unscathed. He remains understandably unhappy that he required emergency corrective surgery and subsequent physiotherapy as a result of that ill-advised excursion, while I required a trip to the haberdashery.

Hours after the head of the foreign office had called Britain\u2019s refusal to join the European Union\u2019s procurement efforts during the Covid-19 pandemic a \u201cpolitical decision\u201d, McDonald retracted his words. Whitehall-watchers are fascinated. The wider world has bigger things to worry about.</p> <p>But on another level, this week\u2019s row is political dynamite \u2013 and for two main reasons.</p> <p>First, and more immediately, the McDonald affair is another challenge, this time from the Whitehall high command itself, to the government\u2019s increasingly desperate attempts to show that ministers have successfully gripped the effort to secure life-saving medical equipment and protective kit for the fight against the virus. At its most serious, it comes down to an admission that ministers who previously said that the UK did not take part in the ventilator procurement programme because of \u201ccommunication\u201d errors were actually in a position, early on in the pandemic, to save more lives by joining the scheme, and yet deliberately chose not to.</p> <p>Second, Tuesday\u2019s furore shoots a beam of light into the dark and tangled argument at the heart of British politics about the longer term strategy and objectives of Boris Johnson\u2019s government. It is a reminder that, in this government, power still rests with those who believe the overriding objective of this administration, even now, is a hard Brexit. It implies that in Johnson\u2019s government the fight against Covid-19 is, of course, massively important \u2013 but only up to a point.</p> <p>McDonald\u2019s session with the foreign affairs committee was not, at the outset, about participation in the EU procurement programme at all. Most of the first hour was about efforts to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/16/uk-flies-home-1000-britons-but-65000-left-in-limbo-by-covid-19\">repatriate UK nationals</a> from around the globe. But when, later on, the committee chair, Tom Tugendhat, asked whether Britain\u2019s failure to take part in the EU programme was a political decision, the head of the foreign office confirmed that it was.</p> <p>The hasty retraction letter on Tuesday evening was extraordinary. If nothing else, it confirms the incredible sensitivities in government at the moment about its handling of the pandemic. The letter also needs to be read carefully. The key sentence nevertheless appears to be this one: \u201cMinisters were not briefed by our mission in Brussels about the scheme and a political decision was not taken on whether or not to participate.\u201d</p> <p>The more you read the letter, the more questions it raises. The key point is that, in early February, while the UK\u2019s Brussels mission did not brief ministers \u2013 the denial in the letter \u2013 about the EU scheme, the Brussels mission clearly did brief departmental civil servants. In practice, that means that Brussels briefed the Foreign Office and the Department of Health and Social Care about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/coronavirus-what-is-eu-medical-equipment-scheme-why-did-uk-opt-out\">ventilator procurement scheme</a>, presumably at a senior level, in detail and as an issue requiring priority attention. Those civil servants will then have briefed their ministers, including the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, and the health secretary, Matt Hancock. So ministers were indeed briefed, only not by \u201cour mission in Brussels\u201d. In other words, the ministers knew about the scheme and knew they could take part in it.</p> <p>What exactly happened next depends in part on what is meant by a \u201cpolitical decision\u201d. That phrase has now been denied. But it is hard to take the retraction too seriously, other than as a means of removing ministerial fingerprints. It can mean what many people would assume, that the decision was political rather than practical or commercial. But in civil service-speak, a political decision can also mean a decision taken by ministers, who are political, rather than officials or expert specialists, who advise them about it.</p> <p>In this context, that would most probably mean the decision, even in the shape of a \u201cnon-decision\u201d to let the issue lie on the table, was taken by or on behalf of Boris Johnson in No 10, but it would be essentially political in both senses. That seems to fit with other evidence suggesting that the question was indeed discussed at Cobra meetings, which always report to the prime minister. It would also be valuable to clarify how and in what terms that initial decision in London was then communicated in a response to the EU in Brussels. If London chose to write itself out of the EU process in February, that may help explain why the UK claims not to have been informed about other joint schemes later.</p> <p>Even without the full details, there is no way of reading these events as anything except another, and early, example of the government\u2019s failure to take Covid-19 seriously enough soon enough. More than two months later, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/22/covid-19-starmer-grills-raab-over-care-home-deaths-in-first-virtual-pmqs\">Raab\u2019s words in the Commons</a> today, it is now the government\u2019s official policy to take \u201cthe right measures at the right time, guided by the science and the medical experts\u201d. But this was not true in February, when the science and the experts were ignored at Cobra. Instead, the decision not to join the EU efforts has contributed to the shortages and failings on which Keir Starmer began his parliamentary career as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/22/an-impressive-debut-readers-on-keir-starmers-first-pmqs\">Labour leader today</a>.</p> <p>But the importance of the decision goes further, and in a direction that Starmer chose not to follow, perhaps wisely on his debut. The political decision not to join the EU procurement process reflected what was uppermost in Johnson\u2019s and other minds in February. Britain, as McDonald stressed this week, had left the EU on 31 January. The Brexiters had done what they promised at the election. The national ship was being set on a course that turned its back on Europe. They weren\u2019t interested in new post-Brexit links with EU schemes any more than they were interested in establishing such links during the transition period.</p> <p>Any suggestion, at this of all moments, that the UK should opt into an EU scheme on anything will have been dismissed with contempt. It was in every way a political decision. A month or so later, things \u2013 including politics \u2013 were different. When Hancock was offered a renewed chance to join <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/21/government-misses-out-on-14m-facemasks-for-nhs-in-four-weeks\">another EU-wide scheme</a>, the offer was taken up. But by then Covid-19 was a far larger reality, the UK was facing lockdown, and ministers were playing catch-up, just as they still are today.</p> <p>McDonald\u2019s retraction on Tuesday shows that, even in the face of Covid-19, not as much has changed as some might assume. The retraction is not just a partisan correction of the record. It is a statement that the Johnson government will maintain its ideological opposition to anything except a hard Brexit. Those who say, as <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-ex-deputy-pm-david-lidington-calls-for-brexit-transition-period-extension-11976818\">David Lidington did this week</a>, that a Brexit extension is now inevitable because of Covid-19, may be deceiving themselves.</p> <p>In this government, especially as it struggles to control the coronavirus outbreak in the face of shortages and deaths, the pandemic remains an all-consuming but still essentially temporary concern. Johnson\u2019s essential project is not to save and rebuild the nation. It is Brexit. Always was. Still is.</p> <p>\u2022 Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Still, \u201cthis shouldn\u2019t shock me, but the United States of America has a president who just ordered a sweeping change in our national immigration policy via tweet\u201d, said Colbert. \u201cThat would be like Obama announcing the death of Bin Laden on TikTok.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/21/jimmy-kimmel-donald-trump-trevor-noah-stephen-colbert\">Jimmy Kimmel on Trump's protest praise: 'Irresponsible to the most unbelievable degree'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The tweet, Colbert noted, had absolutely no detail on how this ban would work, which reportedly caught some homeland security officials off-guard \u2013 and \u201cyou don\u2019t ever want to catch homeland security off-guard\u201d, he added. \u201cThat\u2019s like your doctor holding up your chest X-ray and going, \u2018Oh, I did not see that coming.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s really only one logic that explains this late-night policy drop: \u201cTrump\u2019s tweet is less about information and more about promoting today\u2019s press briefing, reality show-style,\u201d Colbert concluded, then imitated the president: \u201cHere\u2019s a teaser of my new executive order \u2013 am I really going to ban all immigrants?

      "bodyText": "The coronavirus was killing Americans in the US weeks before health officials, doctors or the government realized, it emerged early on Wednesday. Health officials now say two people died from Covid-19 in California in early February before the first reported death from the disease in the United States. Santa Clara county officials, in northern California, said they now know a 57-year-old woman died in her home on 6 February and and a 69-year-old man died in his home on 17 February. The woman, Patricia Dowd, was a San Jose resident, according to public death records. The first official recorded death in the nation from the virus was reported on 29 February in Kirkland, in the state of Washington. Before the results from the three deaths, officials believed the first case of community-transmitted coronavirus in Santa Clara county had not occurred before 28 February. The medical examiner-coroner of Santa Clara county, received confirmation on Tuesday that tissue samples obtained during autopsies and sent to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tested positive for the virus, officials said. A third such death \u2013 a 70-year-old man \u2013 had occurred on 6 March. Santa Clara county is south of San Francisco and includes San Jose. \u201cWhat these deaths tell us is that we had community transmission, probably to a significant degree, far earlier than we had known and that indicates that the virus was probably introduced and circulating in our community far earlier than we had known,\u201d said Dr Sara Cody, health director in Santa Clara county. The first officially confirmed case of coronavirus in the US was on 21 January, in Washington state. The latest news from California indicates to officials that coronavirus was spreading in the community by early to mid-January, much earlier than thought. Cody called the three deaths \u201ciceberg tips\u201d \u2013 indicators that spread had been much worse than what experts originally thought. She noted that since testing at the time was limited by the federal government\u2019s guidance on who should be tested, health officials were unable to act sooner. \u201cWhen we identified our first travel-associated cases in late January, we had a very narrow case definition,\u201d Cody said. \u201cWe were only looking among people who had traveled. We were wondering, how do we detect community transmission if we\u2019re not testing people who haven\u2019t traveled? I think this answers the question in that we didn\u2019t detect community transmission.\u201d None of the three early deaths had significant travel history, Cody said. She suspects that the region\u2019s \u201crobust influenza season\u201d this year may have included some cases of coronavirus. The announcement came after the California governor, Gavin Newsom, promised a \u201cdeep dive\u201d update on Wednesday of the state\u2019s ability to test for the coronavirus and to track and isolate people who have it, one of the six indicators he says is key to lifting a \u201cstay-at-home\u201d order that has slowed the spread of the disease while forcing millions of people to file for unemployment benefits. \u201cThis will go to the obvious questions and queries that all of us are asking: When? \u2026 When do you see a little bit of a release in the valve so that we can let out a little of this pressure,\u201d Newsom said. Newsom said the state was testing an average of 14,500 people a day, up from just 2,000 tests a day at the beginning of April. Still, in a state of nearly 40 million people, that\u2019s not enough for public health officials to know for sure the reach of the highly contagious virus that is still causing outbreaks across the state in nursing homes and homeless shelters. Newsom said he wants the state to test at least 25,000 people a day by the end of April. California has more than 35,600 confirmed coronavirus cases and 1,300 deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. California has been under a mandatory, statewide stay-at-home order for more than a month. Last week, Newsom said he will not consider loosening that order until hospitalizations, particularly those in intensive care units, flatten and start to decline for at least two weeks. On Tuesday, Newsom announced intensive care hospitalizations rose 3.8%. Agencies contributed reporting",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/mia\">MIA</a> has claimed that British <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/vogue\">Vogue</a> magazine has cancelled a feature about her because of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/08/influencers-being-key-distributors-of-coronavirus-fake-news\">comments she made on vaccination in the coronavirus pandemic</a>.</p> <p>Last month, the British-Sri Lankan musician, whose real name is Maya Arulpragasam, said she would \u201cchoose death\u201d over a vaccine for the coronavirus.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the 44-year-old <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B_R5ezxj63W/\">posted on her Instagram page screenshots of a text conversation</a> with an unidentified person who said that the editor of British Vogue, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/sep/21/edward-enninful-vogue-meghan-markle-criticism-racist\">Edward Enninful</a>, had withdrawn his offer for a feature. She has since removed the post.</p> <p>The message quoted a Vogue editor as saying: \u201cConsidering our August is an issue where we\u2019re chronicling the struggles of the NHS to cope while a vaccine is tried to be made we don\u2019t feel we can have her involved. It just wouldn\u2019t be right. All of our issues July-September will be supporting the frontline healthcare workers and we need to be respectful of them and all they are doing until a vaccine exists.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for British Vogue told the Guardian: \u201cBritish Vogue supports the NHS and everyone on the frontline who are protecting people from the virus and saving lives every day.\u201d They offered no comment on MIA\u2019s allegations.</p> <p>The Guardian has contacted representatives for MIA.</p> <p>Beneath the screenshot on her Instagram account, MIA accused British Vogue of overlooking her activism regarding healthcare, including \u201chelping Jeremy Corbyn fight for the NHS, when everyone voted Boris\u201d, and standing \u201cwith Tamils when the Sri Lankan government was bombing UN civilian hospitals, taking financial/career hit\u201d.</p> <p>She sarcastically thanked the magazine for \u201cacknowledging that choice is a liberty I choose to exercise and fight for\u201d and for \u201cgiving me the time to research how many people\u2019s lives have been affected by enforced vaccines across many African countries\u201d.</p> <p>She went on: \u201cAnti vaxer [sic] is your term. It didn\u2019t exist before this binary addiction everyone has to separate everything into this and that. Anti this anti that. I prefer to not make everything so black and white.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s [sic] variety of doctors researchers and labs and counties [sic] who understand what\u2019s happening, I\u2019m sure there are good drugs and bad drugs out there. Just doing research isn\u2019t anti anything but pro respecting the process. Btw how many vaccines are you prepared to have? One a year? 10 a month? 2 a year? Lack of discussion is censorship.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/mar/06/sign-up-for-the-sleeve-notes-email\">Sign up for the Sleeve Notes email: music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the end of March, MIA tweeted: \u201cAll the vaccines you\u2019ve already had is enough to see you through [the coronavirus pandemic].\u201d Early in April, she clarified: \u201cI\u2019m not against vaccines. I\u2019m against companies who care more for profit then humans. I care for better track record that proves this. I care that African countries are not always the testing ground. I don\u2019t want it coming from banks / tech / hedge fund sector and I want a choice.\u201d</p> <p>She has also stoked the baseless conspiracy theories linking 5G to the coronavirus outbreak.

      "bodyText": "MIA has claimed that British Vogue magazine has cancelled a feature about her because of comments she made on vaccination in the coronavirus pandemic. Last month, the British-Sri Lankan musician, whose real name is Maya Arulpragasam, said she would \u201cchoose death\u201d over a vaccine for the coronavirus. On Wednesday, the 44-year-old posted on her Instagram page screenshots of a text conversation with an unidentified person who said that the editor of British Vogue, Edward Enninful, had withdrawn his offer for a feature. She has since removed the post. The message quoted a Vogue editor as saying: \u201cConsidering our August is an issue where we\u2019re chronicling the struggles of the NHS to cope while a vaccine is tried to be made we don\u2019t feel we can have her involved. It just wouldn\u2019t be right. All of our issues July-September will be supporting the frontline healthcare workers and we need to be respectful of them and all they are doing until a vaccine exists.\u201d A spokesperson for British Vogue told the Guardian: \u201cBritish Vogue supports the NHS and everyone on the frontline who are protecting people from the virus and saving lives every day.\u201d They offered no comment on MIA\u2019s allegations. The Guardian has contacted representatives for MIA. Beneath the screenshot on her Instagram account, MIA accused British Vogue of overlooking her activism regarding healthcare, including \u201chelping Jeremy Corbyn fight for the NHS, when everyone voted Boris\u201d, and standing \u201cwith Tamils when the Sri Lankan government was bombing UN civilian hospitals, taking financial/career hit\u201d. She sarcastically thanked the magazine for \u201cacknowledging that choice is a liberty I choose to exercise and fight for\u201d and for \u201cgiving me the time to research how many people\u2019s lives have been affected by enforced vaccines across many African countries\u201d. She went on: \u201cAnti vaxer [sic] is your term. It didn\u2019t exist before this binary addiction everyone has to separate everything into this and that. Anti this anti that. I prefer to not make everything so black and white. \u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s [sic] variety of doctors researchers and labs and counties [sic] who understand what\u2019s happening, I\u2019m sure there are good drugs and bad drugs out there. Just doing research isn\u2019t anti anything but pro respecting the process. Btw how many vaccines are you prepared to have? One a year? 10 a month? 2 a year? Lack of discussion is censorship.\u201d At the end of March, MIA tweeted: \u201cAll the vaccines you\u2019ve already had is enough to see you through [the coronavirus pandemic].\u201d Early in April, she clarified: \u201cI\u2019m not against vaccines. I\u2019m against companies who care more for profit then humans. I care for better track record that proves this. I care that African countries are not always the testing ground. I don\u2019t want it coming from banks / tech / hedge fund sector and I want a choice.\u201d She has also stoked the baseless conspiracy theories linking 5G to the coronavirus outbreak. While she has said she doesn\u2019t think the two things are related, she has claimed: \u201cI think [5G] can confuse or slow the body down in healing process as body is learning to cope with new singles wavelength s [sic] frequency etc @ same time as Cov\u201d. Members of the public have set fire to 5G masts around the country, despite there being no scientific basis or credible evidence for such claims.",

It promised: \u201cNurses will be deployed to support social care.\u201d \u201cWe need to get nursing staff into these care environments,\u201d said Vic Rayner, the executive director of the National Care Forum. \u201c[Care homes] might normally deal with one or two people at a time needing end-of-life care, so anything on top of that will require additional support.\u201d Dr Anna Down, a GP in Ealing, west London, who looks after residents of 15 nursing homes, more than 100 of whom have died from suspected or confirmed Covid-19 in the past month, said \u201can army of staff\u201d was needed to effectively isolate infected residents and halt virus transmission. \u201cI have had nurses say to me this is like running a critical care unit with only one oxygen saturation probe,\u201d she said. \u201cThey need support. It is manpower-intensive to look after sick patients.\u201d A spokesperson for the department of health in Northern Ireland said: \u201cTrust employed or bank staff have been working on the rotas in care homes for the last two to three weeks. This is happening in all trust areas, with significant number of trust staff in at least one care home. We expect the number of staff working in this way to grow.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Finally. Finally we have a fully functioning opposition: one united behind a leader in whom they \u2013 almost \u2013 all believe. Keir Starmer might not have imagined a near-empty and silent chamber for his first outing at prime minister\u2019s questions, but in a way it played to his strengths. For 45 minutes the usual Commons bear pit was transformed into a quiet courtroom drama, with a top QC up against the government\u2019s junior barrister. A no contest, master versus pupil.</p> <p>Starmer is never going to set the world alight with grand gestures or the passion of his oratory. But what he does bring to the job is intelligence and a forensic attention to detail. He doesn\u2019t just read his six prepared questions, he listens to the answers and adapts his follow-ups accordingly. Neither does he raise his voice or get rattled: rather he adapts his tone to the occasion. And he was near enough note perfect.</p> <p>After a brief reassurance that he would be seeking to support the government wherever possible during the coronavirus emergency, Starmer got to the heart of most of the country\u2019s concerns.

Unfortunately the beta blockers he had taken to make him appear even-tempered had rather dulled his mind. We have the capacity to do 40,000 tests, Dom replied, and in any case the UK was going to ramp up its testing regime exponentially in the next eight days. If true, that would be remarkable, as Raab would have committed the government to a target of more like 400,000 tests a day.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t need correcting,\u201d Starmer observed, nearly managing to keep the irritation out of his voice. Matt Hancock had promised 100,000 tests, not the capacity to do 100,000 tests. So the government was well behind its own targets. There was no point in setting up testing centres in places where NHS and care workers who suspected they were ill could not get to without travelling on public transport, risking infecting other people.</p> <p>Starmer then asked if Raab could give the exact number of NHS staff and care workers who had died in the pandemic so far. He couldn\u2019t. But then neither could Helen Whately, the social care minister who is actually paid to know these things, in yet another disastrous media round earlier in the morning. Quite why No 10 insists on repeatedly sending out ministers whose only discernible ability is to know nothing about anything is one of the least investigated side-effects of the pandemic. \u201cI\u2019m putting you on notice that I\u2019ll be asking the same question next week,\u201d said Starmer. \u201cHopefully you will be able to answer it by then.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t count on it.</p> <p>Instead, Raab wittered on about how brilliantly the government had been doing, given the circumstances. You\u2019d hate to think what the death rates would have been if the government hadn\u2019t been quite so brilliant, given we are on target to overtake the Italians and the Spanish. Starmer merely ended with a warning. The UK had been slow to react in almost every respect. He made it sound like the opening address for the prosecution in the judge-led public inquiry that will inevitably follow when the pandemic is over.

And given that it was only the first day, the technology worked more or less OK, with only David Mundell failing to connect.

      "bodyText": "Finally. Finally we have a fully functioning opposition: one united behind a leader in whom they \u2013 almost \u2013 all believe. Keir Starmer might not have imagined a near-empty and silent chamber for his first outing at prime minister\u2019s questions, but in a way it played to his strengths. For 45 minutes the usual Commons bear pit was transformed into a quiet courtroom drama, with a top QC up against the government\u2019s junior barrister. A no contest, master versus pupil. Starmer is never going to set the world alight with grand gestures or the passion of his oratory. But what he does bring to the job is intelligence and a forensic attention to detail. He doesn\u2019t just read his six prepared questions, he listens to the answers and adapts his follow-ups accordingly. Neither does he raise his voice or get rattled: rather he adapts his tone to the occasion. And he was near enough note perfect. After a brief reassurance that he would be seeking to support the government wherever possible during the coronavirus emergency, Starmer got to the heart of most of the country\u2019s concerns. The health secretary had promised 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month and as of yesterday had managed just 18,000.

That tournament was originally scheduled for the summer of 2021, with Neville\u2019s contract due to end after its conclusion, but the coronavirus pandemic meant it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/01/womens-euro-2021-in-england-postponed-by-a-year-says-danish-fa\">postponed by a year</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/22/ada-hegerberg-lyon-training-gives-me-a-voice-injury-ballon-dor\">Lyon's Ada Hegerberg: 'I train every day to perform \u2013 and to give me a voice' | Suzanne Wrack</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is unclear whether Neville will take charge of Team GB as planned at the Olympic Games, which have also been delayed by a year until the summer of 2021.</p> <p>The 43-year-old conceded in March that it was fair for people to criticise his tenure, which began in January 2018, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/11/england-spain-shebelieves-cup-match-report\">labelling England\u2019s SheBelieves Cup campaign that month as \u201cunacceptable\u201d</a>. Defeats by USA and Spain, sandwiching a scrappy 1-0 win against Japan, took England to seven losses in 11 games, a run that began with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/02/usa-england-womens-world-cup-match-report\">a 2-1 defeat by USA</a> in their World Cup semi-final last summer.</p> <p>After the defeat against Spain, Neville said he needed a period of \u201cself-reflection\u201d, adding: \u201cI went through five managers in Valencia for better records than I\u2019ve got at this moment in time. David Moyes lost his job at Manchester United with probably a better record than I\u2019ve got so I take responsibility.\u201d</p> <p>The pressure has mounted on Neville who, despite a first SheBelieves Cup title in 2019 and having reached the last four of the World Cup, has struggled to get the Lionesses producing consistent performances across 90 minutes. Defensive fragilities have also blighted the former Manchester United and England defender\u2019s tenure.</p> <p>The Football Association stuck by its man, though, including when critics pointed to the run of five games without a win that led to the sacking of Hope Powell as manager in 2013. Neville insisted after defeat against Norway in a friendly: \u201cI have a vision that no one else has. I\u2019ve got bravery that no other coach has. So thank your lucky stars. I think with the players we\u2019ve got we can go far.\u201d</p> <p>Yet there is a feeling that while the best teams in the world have pushed on since last summer, England have at best stood still, with Neville having previously cited a lack of competitive action (with the team having qualified for the European Championship as hosts) as the reason for a \u201cWorld Cup hangover\u201d.</p> <p>An 86th-minute winner from Leah Williamson in England\u2019s laboured <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/12/england-women-czech-republic-international-friendly-match-report\">3-2 victory against the Czech Republic</a>, a team ranked 21 places below them, in November threw the manager a lifeline just as the narrow window for the FA to make a leadership change before the Olympics looked to be closing. The postponement of the Tokyo Games and Euro 2021, though, has given the governing body the opportunity to afford a new manager the time to mould and prepare a team capable of competing through back-to-back tournaments.</p> <p>When outlining its Gameplan for Growth strategy in 2017 the FA targeted the 2023 World Cup as the tournament when the structures and support systems around the national team would be strong enough for it to challenge. That left the FA with a dilemma: extend Neville\u2019s contract until 2022 to take account of the coronavirus delay, or give his replacement the time they need to build for a critical tournament.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Football Association is to announce that Phil Neville will step down as manager of England Women at the end of his contract in the summer of 2021. A new head coach will take the reins for the European Championship in England in 2022. That tournament was originally scheduled for the summer of 2021, with Neville\u2019s contract due to end after its conclusion, but the coronavirus pandemic meant it was postponed by a year. It is unclear whether Neville will take charge of Team GB as planned at the Olympic Games, which have also been delayed by a year until the summer of 2021. The 43-year-old conceded in March that it was fair for people to criticise his tenure, which began in January 2018, labelling England\u2019s SheBelieves Cup campaign that month as \u201cunacceptable\u201d. Defeats by USA and Spain, sandwiching a scrappy 1-0 win against Japan, took England to seven losses in 11 games, a run that began with a 2-1 defeat by USA in their World Cup semi-final last summer. After the defeat against Spain, Neville said he needed a period of \u201cself-reflection\u201d, adding: \u201cI went through five managers in Valencia for better records than I\u2019ve got at this moment in time. David Moyes lost his job at Manchester United with probably a better record than I\u2019ve got so I take responsibility.\u201d The pressure has mounted on Neville who, despite a first SheBelieves Cup title in 2019 and having reached the last four of the World Cup, has struggled to get the Lionesses producing consistent performances across 90 minutes. Defensive fragilities have also blighted the former Manchester United and England defender\u2019s tenure. The Football Association stuck by its man, though, including when critics pointed to the run of five games without a win that led to the sacking of Hope Powell as manager in 2013. Neville insisted after defeat against Norway in a friendly: \u201cI have a vision that no one else has. I\u2019ve got bravery that no other coach has. So thank your lucky stars. I think with the players we\u2019ve got we can go far.\u201d Yet there is a feeling that while the best teams in the world have pushed on since last summer, England have at best stood still, with Neville having previously cited a lack of competitive action (with the team having qualified for the European Championship as hosts) as the reason for a \u201cWorld Cup hangover\u201d. An 86th-minute winner from Leah Williamson in England\u2019s laboured 3-2 victory against the Czech Republic, a team ranked 21 places below them, in November threw the manager a lifeline just as the narrow window for the FA to make a leadership change before the Olympics looked to be closing. The postponement of the Tokyo Games and Euro 2021, though, has given the governing body the opportunity to afford a new manager the time to mould and prepare a team capable of competing through back-to-back tournaments. When outlining its Gameplan for Growth strategy in 2017 the FA targeted the 2023 World Cup as the tournament when the structures and support systems around the national team would be strong enough for it to challenge. That left the FA with a dilemma: extend Neville\u2019s contract until 2022 to take account of the coronavirus delay, or give his replacement the time they need to build for a critical tournament.",

      "bodyText": "In these challenging times, joy can be found in the most unusual places. From powerful paintings to curious sheep, here\u2019s a round-up of today\u2019s uplifting stories to brighten your day. Artists create gallery of NHS portraits Instagram has been flooded with portraits of NHS workers as artists use their skills to pay tribute to those working on the frontline of the coronavirus crisis. The #PortraitsforNHSHeroes project was started on Instagram by Tom Croft, an artist, early in April when he offered a free oil portrait to the first NHS frontline worker to message him. Since then, more than 500 artists have contributed portraits in all shapes and styles. Adrian Hill, an artist in Pontefract, created an oil painting of his wife, Shelley, who works for the Yorkshire ambulance service. Meanwhile Barry Miller created a series of vivid oil paintings depicting NHS workers in scrubs and protective gear, as well as a picture of a police officer. Croft said: \u201cIt\u2019s grown quicker than I could have imagined. It\u2019s been amazing. It\u2019s been moving to read all of the messages from NHS key workers about how this is brightening up their day, or at least giving them something positive to look forward to in these incredibly tough and challenging times. \u201cI knew the art community would respond in this way but it\u2019s still wonderful to see it happen in reality.\u201d Croft originally paired up artists with key workers but after a \u201cwonderfully overwhelming\u201d response created a facility for artists to advertise their services and pair up themselves. He said he wanted the project to be \u201cas big as we can go, giving as many thank you [messages] through the form of portraiture as we can\u201d. When the lockdown restrictions are lifted, Croft said, he hoped to hold an exhibition of all the portraits in one place. He is in talks with galleries. Neighbours surprise couple with wedding celebration A couple in Wetherby, West Yorkshire, who had to postpone their wedding due to the coronavirus outbreak were treated to a surprise from neighbours who created a \u201cbig day\u201d for them. Phil Richmond, 27, and Allie Lawton, 25, decorated their lounge with balloons, confetti and fairy lights, while their children Lily, four, and Ben, two, became the attendees along with some soft toys. \u201cI did try and make Phil sleep on the sofa [the night before] so we slept apart but he refused,\u201d Lawton told the BBC. She got ready with her bridesmaids via a Zoom (online) call and pretended to walk down the aisle in the living room. \u201cAs far as we were aware, that was all we were doing on our wedding day,\u201d she said. Then Lawton\u2019s mother said she had left a bottle of champagne at the end of their drive, and when the couple went to retrieve it they found their neighbours dressed up and outside ready to celebrate. A song for the couple\u2019s first dance was played, and the family were showered with confetti as they walked down a makeshift aisle. \u201cIt just gave me the most heartwarming feeling, I was welling up the whole way round,\u201d said Lawton. \u201cWe just want to say thank you to everyone on our lovely street [\u2026] we never want to move house now.\u201d The window of one house was decorated with an A&amp;P sign surrounded by hearts, while a \u201cJust married\u201d sign was corrected to read \u201cMarried soon\u201d. \u201cIt will be a day that we remember for ever really,\u201d said Richmond. London marathon in a living room A man in Northern Ireland is planning to run the equivalent of the London marathon in his living room this weekend, after the world-famous event was postponed until October. Col Bignell, 26, a retail worker from County Down, was disappointed at missing his first marathon, but instead will be running the length of his living room thousands of times to cover the miles. Bignell, originally from London, dared his Facebook friends to \u201cgive him the push\u201d by giving his post 260 likes. He said he intended to raise money for the NHS with the run. \u201cI\u2019ve marked out the space and it\u2019s around 12ft, so I\u2019ve worked out I\u2019ll be running laps of my front room around 11,500 times,\u201d he told the PA Media news agency. \u201cI\u2019ve seen Tom Moore [the 99-year-old who walked 100 laps in his garden to fundraise for the NHS] and the lady who did the stairs, and thought if they can do it why not do something myself?\u201d Bignell aims to raise \u00a3260.20 for the NHS to correspond with the 26.2 miles he will run, and has already raised \u00a3140 towards that goal. Sheep investigate empty McDonald\u2019s in Wales A flock of sheep were spotted exploring an empty McDonald\u2019s restaurant in Ebbw Vale, Wales. \u201cEven the sheep in Ebbw Vale are having McDonald\u2019s withdrawals,\u201d joked Andrew Thomas, who photographed the animals. Thomas said he came across the curious flock on Saturday afternoon as he left the Aldi store next door where he had been shopping for food for his mother who was isolating. The sheep are not the only animals to have been spotted in unusual places in the lockdown. A group of playful lambs was spotted spinning on a roundabout in a children\u2019s playground in Monmouthshire. \u201cEven though the park is shut it was great to see these lambs enjoying themselves this morning,\u201d said Gareth Williams, owner of the flock kept at Raglan Farm Park. \u201cIt would normally be too busy for the lambs to get a chance. Just hope they don\u2019t get too dizzy.\u201d And who could forget the mountain goats of Great Orme who took over the seaside town of Llandudno last month? And finally \u2026 Banksy mural gets face mask A famous Banksy work in Bristol has been modified with the addition of a face mask. Girl with a Pierced Eardrum, which appeared in the street artist\u2019s home city in 2014, is a parody of the painting Girl with a Pearl Earring, by Johannes Vermeer. The mural, at Hanover Place, acquired a face mask in a nod to the coronavirus pandemic. Banksy has been contacted for comment.",

      "bodyText": "Time for a recap. Global markets have recovered today, led by a rebound in the oil price from its historic slump earlier this week. Brent crude, the international benchmark, is now up 7% or $1.4 per barrel at $20.74 -- up from a 21-year low just below $16 per barrel this morning. US crude has jumped too, back to $14.55 per barrel - a gain of 25% today. Although those percentage moves may sound impressive, the reality is that oil still remains low by historic terms -- after a US barrel for delivery in May plunged below zero dollars on Monday. The recovery came amid speculation that producers will cut output soon, as they are running out of places to store oil. It also followed a threat from president Donald Trump to attack Iranian boats if they interfered with US ships. European markets have also closed higher, while on Wall Street the Dow is up 1.9% or 438 points at 23,456. But, there are also new signs that the Covid-19 pandemic is driving the world economy down. Consumer confidence across the eurozone has dropped at its fastest rate ever, to its lowest point since the financial crisis. In the UK, inflation dropped last month as people shunned new clothes and bought less fuel. The British government is being urged to tax wealth on the same basis as income, to help cover the cost of the Covid-19 lockdown. Thousands of UK firms are threatening legal action after their insurance claims for business interruption losses were turned down: Good night. GW After a better day for stocks, the main European indices have all closed higher tonight. Every sector of the Stoxx 600 index gained ground. Energy and Technology stocks led the rally, followed by basic materials producers, telecoms operators, utilities and banks. FTSE 100: up 129 points or 2.3% at 2,770 German DAX: up 164 points or 1.6% at 10,415 French CAC: up 54 points or 1.25% at 4,411 But while the Stoxx 600 gained 1.7% today, it\u2019s still down over 20% this year. Donald Trump\u2019s threat to \u201cshoot down\u201d Iranian gunboats if they harass US ships drove the oil price\u2019s recovery today, says Connor Campbell of SpreadEx. It would be nice for oil\u2019s push higher to come from a less troublesome catalyst. Donald Trump\u2019s order for the navy to \u2018shoot and destroy\u2019 Iranian gunboats that \u2018harass\u2019 American ships cause some investors to return to the black stuff, lifting Brent Crude back towards $21 per barrel with a near 8% comeback. This after it had at one point fallen under $16 per barrel overnight. Stocks are turning higher in late trading in London... pushing the FTSE 100 up by 132 points or 2.3% today. Oil giants are leading the way, with BP and Royal Dutch Shell both up over 6% - following the rally in crude prices. Deutsche Bank have dug back through 150 years of data, and concluded that the oil price had never turned negative - before Monday\u2019s remarkable tumble in US crude prices. Jim Reid and Nick Burns write: In nominal terms, it\u2019s not a surprise to see that, over the 150 years for which we have data, there\u2019s never been a negative price print before. This is stunning as it basically says that a barrel of oil earlier this week was effectively cheaper than it was in 1870. America\u2019s stockpiles of gasoline have hit a fresh record high, as the Covid-19 lockdown hammers demand. New figures from the US Energy Information Administration also show that stockpiles of crude rose by 15 million barrels in the week to April 17, following a 19.2m jump the previous week. Consumer confidence across the eurozone has absolutely plummeted this month, amid the Covid-19 lockdown and rising deaths across the region. The European Commission\u2019s gauge of morale, released this afternoon, slumped to -22.7 for April - down from -11.6 in March. That\u2019s its worst reading since early 2009, when the financial crisis and global recession sent confidence to down to record lows. This means Europeans are much more nervous than at any time during the euro debt crisis. It also appears to be the largest decline on record - reflecting the speed and severity of the coronavirus outbreak. Here\u2019s some snap reaction: Markets are pushing higher in Europe now, as traders welcome the recovery in oil prices this afternoon. In London the FTSE 100 is now up by 108 points, or almost 2% - back to 5748 points (recovering a healthy chunk of yesterday\u2019s falls). European markets are higher too, with the French CAC and German DAX both almost 1% higher. But having lost 3% yesterday, the broader picture is of choppy, volatile trading as investors weigh up the latest Covid-19 developments. In the oil market, Brent crude is now UP 10%, or $2 per barrel, at $21.45 - having hit a 21-year low of $15.98 this morning. US crude is up over $3 per barrel, or 28% (!), at $14.85, following these latest hints from the White House that the lockdowns will be eased soon (although this will be on a state-by-state basis). Those upbeat comments from Steve Mnuchin may help stocks recover in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average has jumped by 406 points, or 1.7%, at the start of trading - back to 23,424 points. US Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin has now weighed in. Speaking on Fox, Mnuchin predicted that oil would recover to $30 per barrel by August, and that \u201cmost if not all\u201d of the US economy would be open by the summer. The White House is also talking up the prospects of the US economy re-opening in next couple of months, despite concerns the this could trigger a second wave of infections: Oil prices are moving higher across the board - with US crude oil for June delivery up 13% at over $13 per barrel. I\u2019m not quite clear what\u2019s driving the rally, but it may be partly related to this tweet..... After two days of losses, the New York stock exchange is expected to rebound today. The Dow Jones industrial average is up over 1% in pre-market trading, or 280 points - having lost around 1,000 points in the last two days. But, there\u2019s a lot of anxiety beyond Wall Street. A Gallup poll released last night shows that 25% of employed Americans think they\u2019re likely to be laid off in the next 12 months. That\u2019s on top of the 22 million people who have filed jobless benefit claims in the last four weeks. Just in: Turkey\u2019s central bank has cut interest rates, as it responds to the Covid-19 crisis. The benchmark interest rate has been lowered to 8.75%, from 9.75% -- twice as big a cut as the markets expected. Amid volatile trading in the oil market, Brent crude is now UP for the day -- back around $20 per barrel. Online fashion group Boohoo has seen a surge in casual clothes and pyjamas as Britons hunker down during the pandemic. Carol Kane, the joint chief executive of Boohoo, says demand for \u201cathleisure wear\u201d such as hoodies, jogging pants and nightwear has all jumped in recent weeks, making up for a slump in sales of smarter outfits like dresses. Boohoo is also eyeing up struggling rivals, who might be available cheaply in the current crisis. The Covid-19 lockdown risks increasing the existing economic divide within the eurozone. A new report from ING economists Bert Colijn and Carsten Brzeski points out that the impact of the lockdown measures varies across Europe. They\u2019ve analysed Google\u2019s COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports, which show how visits to groceries, shops and workplaces have fallen this year. They show that Italy and Spain have seen the biggest impact, followed by Frnace, while the Netherlands and Germany have seen less disruption. So with some countries easing the lockdown measures, while others remain locked down for longer, the risk of an \u201casymmetric recovery\u201d has increased. They explain: Covid-19 is often labelled as a symmetric shock hitting the eurozone economy. While this is correct regarding the nature of the shock, differences in the length and depth of the lockdown measures seem to have a rather asymmetric impact on the eurozone economy. Currently, a pattern seems to be emerging that the eurozone countries which experienced the sharpest impact on public (and economic) life will be the last countries exiting the lockdown measures. Add to this significant differences across countries regarding the size of the fiscal reaction and there is a clear risk of an asymmetric recovery in the eurozone. With oil at its lowest levels this century, analysts are warning that prices will keep sliding unless there are significant output cuts soon. Rystad Energy\u2019s head of oil markets, Bjornar Tonhaugen says: \u201cBe prepared for more surprises in this broken oil market.\u201d The astonishing plunge in US crude prices on Monday night, to -$40 per barrel, shows the perils of excess supply. But the major producers haven\u2019t yet responded with fresh cuts. Yesterday, Donald Trump pledged support for the US energy sector, where hundreds of thousands of jobs are at risk. But that would mean shale producers keep pumping - despite the economics being against them. Andreas Steno Larsen of Nordea Markets tweets that this is helping to push oil down. Here\u2019s our news story on today\u2019s drop in inflation: European stock markets are all up this morning, despite the oil price slump. Rachel Winter, associate investment director at Killik &amp; Co, says the rally follows a Financial Times report that suggests the peak for UK Covid-19 deaths was April 8th. \u201cThe FTSE is up just under 1% this morning following comments from professors at both Oxford and Cambridge universities suggesting that the UK may have passed its coronavirus peak. The market is up despite further falls in oil prices, with Brent crude now below $18 per barrel \u2013 that\u2019s a big fall from 2014 when it was over $100 per barrel. \u201cUK inflation numbers came out this morning showing that prices have fallen since last month. The fall was largely blamed on a heavy discounting in the clothing market given the lack of demand while everyone stays at home. Clothing retailers are really suffering right now \u2013 Primark for example, has said it has basically sold nothing because it doesn\u2019t operate online and its stores are all closed.\u201d Posh tonic maker Fevertree appears to be coping well with the coronavirus pandemic. Shares in Fevertree have jumped 13% this morning after it reported \u201cstrong\u201d demand from customers in shops and supermarkets (the \u2018off-trade\u2019) in recent weeks. It says: With regards to trading, while the On-Trade sector is facing an extremely challenging period, we have seen strong sales in the Off-Trade in many of our markets both from the initial buying ahead of lockdown but also in recent weeks as at home consumption has remained robust. Fevertree also reported a 10% rise in revenues in 2019, although profits after tax fell 5%. It also reported tougher competition in the UK, where rivals have also moved into the high-end mixers market. Laura Ashley is reopening its Texplan factory in Wales to make medical scrubs and cubicle curtains for the NHS. The group, which fell into administration last month, will make 3,000 a week of the NHS workwear outfits which are worn underneath personal protective equipment. Under the deal with Alexandra Workwear, a British provider of uniforms, and Laura Ashley\u2019s administrators at advisory firm PwC, 41 Laura Ashley workers have volunteered to return to its factory in Newtown, Wales. Linda Andrew, a Laura Ashley supervisor who is returning from furlough to work on the project said: \u201cWe\u2019ve experience of making beautiful handmade curtains for Laura Ashley, but it has been a while since we made garments here in Wales. But we\u2019re an adaptable bunch so I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll be able to turn our hand to sewing scrubs.\u201d Laura Ashley continues to trade via its website while administrators attempt to secure a buyer for the British brand. Today\u2019s inflation report shows that air fares rose by 5.3% during March (based on flights departing on March 17). By that stage, the Covid-19 pandemic was already hitting the sector - Donald Trump announced his ban on European Union flights to the US on March 12, and added the UK on the 14th. Many people have seen flights and holidays cancelled since - and are struggling to get refunds. Our transport correspondent Gwyn Topham explains: All of the UK\u2019s biggest airlines and most big holiday companies are systematically breaking the law by denying timely refunds to customers for travel cancelled during the pandemic, researchers have found. Consumer groups have warned that the sector risks permanently losing public confidence in booking travel, with Which? finding 20 of the UK\u2019s largest operators are illegally withholding refunds that should be paid within 14 days. Although stock markets are up this morning, oil is still sharply down. Brent crude is changing hands for $17.62 per barrel right now, down 9% today, having hit 21-year lows overnight. That\u2019s a drop of almost 40% this week, and 70% this year, as traders price in the risk of a deep global recession which leaves oil producers struggling to store crude. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says crude prices are a good measure of the economic mess we\u2019re in. I\u2019d say oil markets are telling us how bad things are right now, while equity markets tell us how good or bad investors hope/fear things will be next year. The new governor of the Bank of England has warned against lifting the UK\u2019s Covid-19 restrictions too early. Andrew Bailey has told the Daily Mail that the economic damage would be even worse if the lockdown were lifted, only to be re-imposed because coronavirus cases spiked again. Bailey, who replaced Mark Carney last month, argues: I think we have to be careful when thinking about human psychology If we had a lifting and then [lockdown] came back again, I think that would damage people\u2019s confidence very severely. \u2018If we have a false start... that would have potentially quite difficult effects I think.\u2019 Bailey also points out that firms need to consider the safety of their staff -- both in the workplace, and travelling there. After falling around 3% yesterday, European stock markets have risen slightly at the start of trading. The FTSE 100 has gained 38 points, or 0.7%, to 5678 points. Irish building supplies firm CRH are the top riser, up 4.5%, after it announced a cost-cutting programme this morning and predicted it would benefit from government stimulus plans. But oil companies are under pressure again. BP has dropped 1%, following the 15% plunge in Brent crude this morning to a 21-year low. The drop in inflation in March is just the start. Several economists are predicting that the cost of living will keep easing - as people remain confined at home. Equals Group chief economist Jeremy Thomson-Cook says there simply won\u2019t be enough demand to drive prices up. \u201cUK inflation stayed steady at 1.5% in March but the wider picture around prices shows that we will not be talking about high inflation for some time. A recession like the UK is currently enduring \u2013 we will wait on the data to confirm \u2013 naturally will see lower inflation through the destruction of a demand side to the economy whilst movements in oil markets of late show just what can happen to prices when demand dries up. You cannot have inflation without demand and if we are correct that demand rebounds slower than it fell \u2013 a Nike tick-shaped rebound \u2013 then the impulse into inflation should be low although a weak pound does remain a risk.\u201d Simon French of Panmure Gordon predicts that the CPI could fall below 1% soon -- well below the official target of 2% per year. But he also points out that \u2018lived inflation\u2019 is higher than the official reading. In other words, if you\u2019re only buying food and drink and barely leaving the house, then cheaper petrol and clothes prices aren\u2019t much help. Andrew Wishart of Capital Economics suspects inflation could be as low as 0.5% this summer, adding: We suspect a larger fall in CPI inflation, from 1.5% to 0.9% is in store for April as Ofgem lowers the cap on utility bills to reflect past falls in wholesale energy price. Laura Suter, personal finance analyst at investment platform AJ Bell, says the plunge in oil prices this month will drag inflation down too. \u201cEven before the recent capitulation, the price of oil was on the slide in March and this dragged inflation down slightly from February\u2019s 1.7% to 1.5%. Oil prices have a massive impact on the UK\u2019s inflation rate and with prices at the pump and home energy costs getting cheaper we\u2019d expect this trend to continue for the next couple of months. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, with retailers having to shut their doors we\u2019re seeing more and more offer discounts to shoppers to move their buying online. In particular clothing and department stores have been hit, as people don\u2019t need new outfits to sit on their sofa all day and are delaying large purchases amid worries about where the economy is headed. One area of slight upward pressure was from alcohol and tobacco, partly because we\u2019re drinking at home more and partly because tobacco duty increased in March following the Budget. Alcohol and tobacco prices rose in March -- partly because the duty on tobacco was raised in Rishi Sunak\u2019s budget last month. Petrol prices fell by 5.1 pence per litre between February and March 2020, the inflation report shows. The ONS explains: Global prices for crude oil have fallen sharply in response to reduced global demand during the COVID-19 pandemic and the failure of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC+) to agree to cut supply in early March 2020. Consumer demand for motor fuels has likely also reduced in light of measures taken to curb the spread of COVID-19, including increased working from home and broader travel restrictions. The cost of a \u201cwide range of women\u2019s, men\u2019s and children\u2019s clothing items\u201d fell in March, pulling inflation down. The ONS suspects people began shunning the shops to avoid catching coronavirus - or because they were focused on stockpiling essential items instead. Sales patterns this year are likely to have been influenced by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Although prices were collected around 17 March, before the formal government lockdown was introduced on 23 March, consumer behaviours and retailers\u2019 expectations of that behaviour might have changed as a result of social distancing and other precautions. A number of factors might have contributed to the change, including less browsing in physical stores, people spending more time at home where they might have been less interested in clothing, and a shift in spending patterns towards other necessities such as food and cleaning products. Some early news: Inflation across the UK fell in March, as the government\u2019s Covid-19 lockdown hit demand for some goods. Consumer prices rose by 1.5% per year last month, the Office for National Statistics reports. That\u2019s down from 1.7% in February, and the lowest since December. Cheaper clothing and duel pushed inflation down, the ONS says: Falls in the price of motor fuels and clothing resulted in the largest downward contributions to the change in the CPIH 12-month inflation rate between February and March 2020. Rises in air fares produced the largest, partially offsetting, upward contribution to change. More to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The oil price is continuing to slide today, as producers run out of place to store crude as demand plummets. Brent crude, sourced from the North Sea, has plunged to its lowest level since 1999 this morning -- touching just $15.98 per barrel. It began 2020 at $60 per barrel, but has been badly hit by the Covid-19 recession and supplier\u2019\u2019s tardiness in responding. Weak oil prices are normally good for consumers - pushing down firms\u2019 transport costs and making driving cheaper. But in the current lockdown, many people can\u2019t take advantage. US crude prices are also sliding again too. A barrel of US oil for delivery in June now costs just $10.88 per barrel -- more than halving this week! After May\u2019s contract fell below zero this week, could US producers end up giving away oil in June too? Overnight, some oil-producers held a virtual conference call -- but there was no new agreement to start cutting supplies. Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank explains: In a joint closing statement the ministers said that they should \u201ccontinue holding such consultations\u201d, but it remains unclear if any country has the ability or the inclination to cut further than what is expected to come on May 1. According to Reuters, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates weren\u2019t even on the call -- suggesting a split at the heart of Opec....

      "body": "<p>When Elena Manighetti and Ryan Osborne set off to cross the Atlantic ocean on their 11-metre sailing boat, the coronavirus crisis was just one of many stories in the news. The disease was largely confined to China and the World Health Organization was yet to declare its spread a global pandemic.</p> <p>They left Lanzarote on the 3,000-nautical-mile journey on 28 February, with the latest they\u2019d heard being that deaths from Covid-19 were slowing. On 25 March, as they reached the Caribbean island of Bequia<strong>,</strong><strong> </strong>after 25 days of no internet access, they switched on their phones.</p> <p>\u201cWe bought some data and I remember Ryan reading out the news and our jaws just dropped,\u201d said Elena. \u201cIt was hard to grasp the scale of it at first,\u201d said Ryan. \u201cIf you were waking up from a coma now, I think it would be hard to imagine the scale of what had unfolded.\u201d</p> <p>Elena is from Lombardy in northern Italy, one of the regions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/this-is-like-a-war-view-from-italys-coronavirus-frontline\">most affected by the coronavirus pandemic</a>. \u201cIf you don\u2019t read the news for a month and then you turn on your phone it\u2019s not like there\u2019s a news feed that tells you exactly what has happened every day, so I could only really access the previous week\u2019s news,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cIt was about three days [after we arrived] that Ryan found a 10-day old article in the New York Times that said my home town [of Bergamo] was the worst-hit in the world.

      "bodyText": "When Elena Manighetti and Ryan Osborne set off to cross the Atlantic ocean on their 11-metre sailing boat, the coronavirus crisis was just one of many stories in the news. The disease was largely confined to China and the World Health Organization was yet to declare its spread a global pandemic. They left Lanzarote on the 3,000-nautical-mile journey on 28 February, with the latest they\u2019d heard being that deaths from Covid-19 were slowing. On 25 March, as they reached the Caribbean island of Bequia, after 25 days of no internet access, they switched on their phones. \u201cWe bought some data and I remember Ryan reading out the news and our jaws just dropped,\u201d said Elena. \u201cIt was hard to grasp the scale of it at first,\u201d said Ryan. \u201cIf you were waking up from a coma now, I think it would be hard to imagine the scale of what had unfolded.\u201d Elena is from Lombardy in northern Italy, one of the regions most affected by the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cIf you don\u2019t read the news for a month and then you turn on your phone it\u2019s not like there\u2019s a news feed that tells you exactly what has happened every day, so I could only really access the previous week\u2019s news,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was about three days [after we arrived] that Ryan found a 10-day old article in the New York Times that said my home town [of Bergamo] was the worst-hit in the world. I had had absolutely no idea. I called my dad and he said: \u2018Oh you found out. Don\u2019t panic. It\u2019s all right\u2019. \u201cThe news only truly sank in when we saw the pictures of the military trucks in front of the cemetery in my hometown because they had run out of space and coffins.

      "bodyText": "Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: World has \u2018a long way to go\u2019, warns WHO chief The director general of the World Health Organization says there is still \u201ca long way to go\u201d in tackling the pandemic. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says that, while most national epidemics in western Europe appear to have stabilised or are declining, outbreaks appeared to be growing in Africa, Central and South America, and eastern Europe. Confirmed global death toll nears 180,000 At least 179,778 people are known to have died since the outbreak began and at least 2.5 million have been infected, according to Johns Hopkins University. The US has recorded four times more cases than the next worst-hit country, Italy. US handling of Covid-19 \u2018like third world country\u2019, says top economist Donald Trump\u2019s botched handling of the epidemic has left the US looking like a third world country and on course for a second Great Depression, the Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz says. In an interview with the Guardian, Stiglitz said millions of Americans were turning to food banks, having to work due to a lack of sick pay and dying because of health inequalities. UK hospital death toll rises by 759 The country\u2019s Department for Health and Social Care publishes the latest daily figures, showing that there have been 759 new deaths, taking the total to 18,100. Yesterday\u2019s daily rise was 823. However, according to an analysis of ONS data by the Financial Times, coronavirus-related deaths in the UK may be as high as 41,000. The findings include deaths that occurred outside hospitals, updated to reflect recent mortality trends. Missing Wuhan citizen journalist reappears A Chinese citizen journalist reappears, having gone missing for almost two months after posting videos from Wuhan during the outbreak. Li Zehua claims he was detained by police and forcibly quarantined. He was one of three Chinese journalists reporting in Wuhan during some of the worst weeks of the epidemic. He was last seen on 26 February after posting a video in which he was chased by a white SUV and an hours-long livestream that ended when several agents entered his apartment. Singapore records at least 10,000 infections The number of confirmed cases in Singapore passes 10,000, despite concerted and strenuous attempts to contain the spread of the infection in the city state. The milestone comes after Singapore\u2019s ministry of health reported 1,016 new cases on Wednesday, the third day in a row that the city\u2019s daily tally has exceeded 1,000, bringing the overall total in the city to 10,141. No 10 denies pressuring FCO chief to change his story Downing Street rejects suggestions that Sir Simon McDonald, the head of the Foreign Office, was pressurised into withdrawing his statement to a select committee saying the government took a political decision not to participate in the EU\u2019s ventilator procurement scheme. The European commission has said the UK was well aware of its procurement initiative when it decided not to participate, backing up McDonald\u2019s original assertion and contradicting the UK government\u2019s claim \u2013 backed by McDonald in his later statement \u2013 that a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d was to blame. Refugee camp hit The first case is recorded at a refugee camp in Lebanon. The outbreak of the virus at crowded and often unhygienic refugee camps has been feared since the start of the crisis. Spain aims to ease lockdown Spain announces plans to phase out its lockdown in the second half of May. The prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, also asks lawmakers to extend the country\u2019s state of emergency until 9 May. Vaccine trials expand Germany approves its first human trials for a vaccine. Some 200 healthy people between 18 and 55 will receive several variants of the vaccine candidate.",

      "body": "<p>Greta Thunberg has urged people around the world to take a new path after the coronavirus pandemic, which she said proved \u201cour society is not sustainable\u201d.</p> <p>The Swedish climate activist said the strong global response to Covid-19 demonstrated how quickly change could happen when humanity came together and acted on the advice of scientists.</p> <p>She said the same principles should be applied to the climate crisis.</p> <p>\u201cWhether we like it or not, the world has changed. It looks completely different now from how it did a few months ago. It may never look the same again. We have to choose a new way forward,\u201d she told a YouTube audience in a virtual meeting to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.</p> <p>\u201cIf the coronavirus crisis has shown us one thing, it is that our society is not sustainable. If one single virus can destroy economies in a couple of weeks, it shows we are not thinking long-term and taking risks into account.\u201d</p> <p>The teenage campaigner, who initiated the global school strike movement, was filmed at the Nobel Prize Museum in Stockholm in digital conversation with Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, the earth systems scientist and director of the Potsdam Institute.</p> <p>He said there was a strong correlation between the pandemic and the environmental crisis: deforestation and the wildlife trade heighten the likelihood of viruses leaping the species boundary; air pollution increases human vulnerability by weakening respiratory systems; and the expansion of air travel allows epidemics to spread more quickly. \u201cThe scientific evidence shows they are interconnected and part of the same planetary crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are living beyond the carrying capacity of the planet so we are putting human health and the health of nature at risk.\u201d</p> <p>The lockdown has reduced emissions and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/22/brent-crude-oil-price-hits-21-year-low-amid-glut\">hurt the oil industry</a>, which is the biggest source of the greenhouse gases that are heating the planet to dangerous levels. But the two speakers stressed the virus should not be seen as an environmental panacea because it has brought immense human suffering, provided only temporary respite and distracted from campaigns, research and international meetings that aimed to find a smoother transition to a clean economy.</p> <p>The key lesson from the pandemic, they said, was the need for governments to pay more heed to scientific warnings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f78cf84edd6975568fda689a5bb466009d18bf00\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f78cf84edd6975568fda689a5bb466009d18bf00/0_246_7360_4419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Students take part in a climate march on 14 February in London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Students take part in a climate march on 14 February in London. Campaigns appear to have shifted public opinion about the climate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Summers/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe have underestimated the shocks. We need to build more shock absorbers into the system,\u201d Rockstr\u00f6m said. \u201cAround the world, people are recognising the uncertainty and are being cautious. Also regarding the climate, we cannot know for certain how far we can push up global warming. So I hope that we come out of the pandemic with the recognition that science shows: it\u2019s not worth taking the risk ... I believe that something new is coming from the ashes of the corona crisis. We\u2019ll rise out of this, but not by bouncing back to the old world.\u201d</p> <p>He said there was more support now for green new deals in Europe and South Korea and for China to go beyond the economy when setting priorities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/22/earth-day-2020-could-mark-the-year-we-stop-taking-the-planet-for-granted-aoe\">Earth Day 2020 could mark the year we stop taking the planet for granted</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Neither speaker mentioned the US president, Donald Trump, Brazil\u2019s president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/brazils-jair-bolsonaro-says-coronavirus-crisis-is-a-media-trick\">Jair Bolsonaro</a>, or other leaders who have either dismissed the risk of the pandemic or used it to relax environmental protections and health standards in the name of economic recovery. But Thunberg alluded to these dangers.</p> <p>\u201cDuring a crisis like this there is a big risk that people try to use this emergency to push their own agenda or their own interests. We need to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d she said. \u201cI cannot stress enough how important it is that we are active democratic citizens so a crisis like this doesn\u2019t slide in the wrong direction.\u201d</p> <p>Elsewhere, the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, marked Earth Day by declaring the pandemic to be the biggest threat the world had faced since the second world war, though he said the environmental emergency was deeper.</p> <p>He said post-pandemic recovery should focus on six goals: the creation of clean, green jobs; taxpayer support for sustainable growth; an economic shift from grey concrete to green nature; investment in the future rather than the past with an end to fossil fuel subsidies; the incorporation of climate risk into the financial system, and international cooperation.</p> <p>A new opinion poll suggests there is strong support for this view. Sixty-six per cent of Britons believe the climate is as serious a long-term crisis as Covid-19 and 58% agree it should be prioritised in the economic recovery. The survey of 14 countries by Mori found even higher levels of support in China, Germany, France, India, Italy and Japan. Even in the least enthusiastic nations \u2013 the US and Australia \u2013 a majority supported green priorities in stimulus programmes. </p> <p>Public opinion has shifted dramatically in the past two years as a result of increasingly grim climate studies and high-profile campaigns by groups such as FridaysForFuture and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/extinction-rebellion\">Extinction Rebellion</a>. Big strikes and marches have been postponed but Thunberg vowed they will be back once it is safe to return to the streets.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to adapt. That is what you have to do in a crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are thinking we will get out of this and then we will push even harder.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Greta Thunberg has urged people around the world to take a new path after the coronavirus pandemic, which she said proved \u201cour society is not sustainable\u201d. The Swedish climate activist said the strong global response to Covid-19 demonstrated how quickly change could happen when humanity came together and acted on the advice of scientists. She said the same principles should be applied to the climate crisis. \u201cWhether we like it or not, the world has changed. It looks completely different now from how it did a few months ago. It may never look the same again. We have to choose a new way forward,\u201d she told a YouTube audience in a virtual meeting to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day. \u201cIf the coronavirus crisis has shown us one thing, it is that our society is not sustainable. If one single virus can destroy economies in a couple of weeks, it shows we are not thinking long-term and taking risks into account.\u201d The teenage campaigner, who initiated the global school strike movement, was filmed at the Nobel Prize Museum in Stockholm in digital conversation with Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, the earth systems scientist and director of the Potsdam Institute. He said there was a strong correlation between the pandemic and the environmental crisis: deforestation and the wildlife trade heighten the likelihood of viruses leaping the species boundary; air pollution increases human vulnerability by weakening respiratory systems; and the expansion of air travel allows epidemics to spread more quickly. \u201cThe scientific evidence shows they are interconnected and part of the same planetary crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are living beyond the carrying capacity of the planet so we are putting human health and the health of nature at risk.\u201d The lockdown has reduced emissions and hurt the oil industry, which is the biggest source of the greenhouse gases that are heating the planet to dangerous levels. But the two speakers stressed the virus should not be seen as an environmental panacea because it has brought immense human suffering, provided only temporary respite and distracted from campaigns, research and international meetings that aimed to find a smoother transition to a clean economy. The key lesson from the pandemic, they said, was the need for governments to pay more heed to scientific warnings. \u201cWe have underestimated the shocks. We need to build more shock absorbers into the system,\u201d Rockstr\u00f6m said. \u201cAround the world, people are recognising the uncertainty and are being cautious. Also regarding the climate, we cannot know for certain how far we can push up global warming. So I hope that we come out of the pandemic with the recognition that science shows: it\u2019s not worth taking the risk ... I believe that something new is coming from the ashes of the corona crisis. We\u2019ll rise out of this, but not by bouncing back to the old world.\u201d He said there was more support now for green new deals in Europe and South Korea and for China to go beyond the economy when setting priorities. Neither speaker mentioned the US president, Donald Trump, Brazil\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro, or other leaders who have either dismissed the risk of the pandemic or used it to relax environmental protections and health standards in the name of economic recovery. But Thunberg alluded to these dangers. \u201cDuring a crisis like this there is a big risk that people try to use this emergency to push their own agenda or their own interests. We need to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d she said. \u201cI cannot stress enough how important it is that we are active democratic citizens so a crisis like this doesn\u2019t slide in the wrong direction.\u201d Elsewhere, the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, marked Earth Day by declaring the pandemic to be the biggest threat the world had faced since the second world war, though he said the environmental emergency was deeper. He said post-pandemic recovery should focus on six goals: the creation of clean, green jobs; taxpayer support for sustainable growth; an economic shift from grey concrete to green nature; investment in the future rather than the past with an end to fossil fuel subsidies; the incorporation of climate risk into the financial system, and international cooperation. A new opinion poll suggests there is strong support for this view. Sixty-six per cent of Britons believe the climate is as serious a long-term crisis as Covid-19 and 58% agree it should be prioritised in the economic recovery. The survey of 14 countries by Mori found even higher levels of support in China, Germany, France, India, Italy and Japan. Even in the least enthusiastic nations \u2013 the US and Australia \u2013 a majority supported green priorities in stimulus programmes. Public opinion has shifted dramatically in the past two years as a result of increasingly grim climate studies and high-profile campaigns by groups such as FridaysForFuture and Extinction Rebellion. Big strikes and marches have been postponed but Thunberg vowed they will be back once it is safe to return to the streets. \u201cWe have to adapt. That is what you have to do in a crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are thinking we will get out of this and then we will push even harder.\u201d",

Many of the Syrians are living in informal settlements, which are even harder for health authorities to regulate.",

      "body": "<p>As I sit on a garden chair with my laptop perched on an outdoor table in a last-ditch effort to stop my dog digging the lawn, it\u2019s timely that I\u2019ve been asked to write about setting up a home workstation that doesn\u2019t ruin your back, for people self-isolating during the coronavirus crisis (come to think of it, my back is aching a little).</p> \n<p>So, how can I fix it?</p> \n<h2><strong>It\u2019s not just about the chair</strong></h2> \n<p>The first step to working from home safely is figuring out how you\u2019re going to approach work, says an ergonomics expert, <a href=\"https://scholars.latrobe.edu.au/display/joakman\">Jodi Oakman</a>, an associate professor at La Trobe University, Melbourne. She stresses the importance of a holistic approach to organising the work environment before tackling the workspace.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhere are we going to do it and how am I going to do it? What hours am I going to do? Can I do all of my job?\u201d</p> \n<p>Careful planning, for instance, getting up earlier to get through tasks before the rest of the household stirs, can reduce the likelihood of injury and improve productivity Oakman suggests. \u201cBack pain is caused by work-related stress as well as work-related physical factors,\u201d she explains.</p> \n<p>That includes setting boundaries to create some distinction between home and work. For some, this could mean getting dressed in work gear or communicating \u201cI\u2019m at work\u201d by putting on a headset in a shared environment, or setting clear working hours and sharing them with managers and colleagues.</p> \n<p>A rehabilitation consultant, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/will-davis-119843157/?originalSubdomain=au\">William Davis</a>, emphasises the importance of a strict routine to avoid stress-related injury. \u201cIn this isolation environment when everyone\u2019s working from home, it\u2019s very easy to fall into the habit of doing an extra two or three hours a day. And I would advise against it from a stress-wellbeing point of view.\u201d</p> \n<p>Some people might have to acknowledge they can\u2019t juggle everything from home and adjust their working hours accordingly. \u201cMany people are moving into home schooling,\u201d says an occupational health physiotherapist, <a href=\"https://phwgroup.com.au/phw-group-team/\">David Hall</a>. \u201cSome of us with kids and trying to work from home. It\u2019s like being squeezed like a lemon \u2026</p> \n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t try and be a hero. Just be gentle on yourself and don\u2019t \u2026 feel like you\u2019ve got to be like the best home schooler and the best worker; just set realistic expectations about what all that means.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>OK, let\u2019s get to the chair \u2026</strong></h2> \n<p>All the experts agree that, ideally, a chair should have a height adjustment, to avoid unnecessary muscle strain that causes aching necks and backs. If you can\u2019t afford to buy a proper office chair, Hall says there\u2019s often a spare one somewhere that\u2019s not being used by a friend or neighbour, so ask around.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s important that the chair facilitates good posture \u2013 many chairs that aren\u2019t ergonomically designed go out at too far an angle, Davis explains. He recommends asking someone in the house to take a photo of you sitting, so you can check whether your torso and head are in a straight line.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e2cb80db01dd889814a8f48b725b8308ca23f647\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2cb80db01dd889814a8f48b725b8308ca23f647/0_119_5760_4310/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The right posture for working at a computer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"748\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">When sitting, \u2018ideally you would have the shoulder almost directly above the hips\u2019.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phanie/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The chair should support your lower back, so the spine is in its natural S-shape. If not, Davis recommends adding a cushion or rolled-up towel. This lumbar support is not designed to take all your weight, just to act as a reminder to sit in an upright, S-shaped position.</p> \n<p>The chair should also allow the knees and elbows to be at right angles, to minimise unnecessary muscle strain.</p> \n<p>If the chair is too high and your feet aren\u2019t supported, Davis recommends using a stable surface to prop them up, like a box or ream of paper. The desk should support the elbows \u2013 if that\u2019s too high and you can\u2019t lift the chair, try sitting on a pillow or a cushion.</p> \n<h2>Keep your eyes up</h2> \n<p>Your keyboard and mouse should be about 8cm to 10cm from the edge of your desk, and the top of the monitor should be about one arm\u2019s length away, at eye level to avoid leaning forward or back.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0109a84348296f63ff5db3a7500751e1f2f7a399\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0109a84348296f63ff5db3a7500751e1f2f7a399/265_169_2714_2855/951.jpg\" alt=\"If you must use a laptop at home, experts suggest raising it to eye level using a shoe box or books, and using an external keyboard and mouse\" width=\"951\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">If you must use a laptop at home, experts suggest raising it to eye level using a shoe box or books, and using an external keyboard and mouse.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alyx Gorman</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This can pose problems for users of laptops, which are best suited to occasional work and checking emails while travelling. People who don\u2019t have other options should source an external keyboard and mouse so they can raise the laptop to eye level using something like a shoebox, to prevent hunching over. Similarly, any reference documents that make you look down should be raised \u2013 Davis uses his mother\u2019s old recipe book holder for this.</p> \n<h2><strong>Movement is your friend</strong></h2> \n<p>If there really are limited options for achieving the ideal work position, Oakman says you should do your best to change positions and move between sitting and standing frequently.</p> \n<p>As an exercise physiologist, Davis says regular rest breaks are critical, making sure to get out of the chair every 30 to 45 minutes \u2013 if only briefly, to move around, stretch and change position. This will shift the strain between intervertebral discs, the spine\u2019s shock absorbers.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe most common time you see injuries, even for healthy workers in a sedentary office job or home setup, is with prolonged sitting,\u201d he says. A common example is when someone\u2019s focused on typing for two or three hours, \u201cloading their postures\u201d. Then, when they bend down to pick something up, their back cracks.</p> \n<p>Other ways to facilitate more movement include taking phone calls standing up, or walking around wherever possible.</p> \n<h2><strong>What about a standing workstation?</strong></h2> \n<p>Standup desks are great, Davis says, mostly for facilitating frequent postural change without having to move away from the desk. But they tend to be expensive, so he wouldn\u2019t recommend running out to buy one. If you have a bench or ledge at an appropriate height to set up a monitor or laptop, he suggests you could use it to work standing up for 15 or 20 minutes every hour or two \u2013 the maximum he recommends standing is for 20% to 30% of the working day.</p> \n<p>As far as fit balls go, Davis has no problem with using them for their intended purpose \u2013 which is exercise. But they\u2019re not designed to be used as a chair and cause similar problems to sitting and standing, if you end up in a static posture for prolonged periods. Using them for five to 10 minutes at a time would be his maximum recommendation.</p> \n<h2><strong>Workouts will help</strong></h2> \n<p>Exercise has numerous physical health benefits, Davis says, and is also a brilliant way to strengthen muscles and protect your back, especially through a strong core workout and body weight exercises. But he warns that you should build up, cautioning against isolation crazes on social media where people are doing 1,000 repetitions a day. \u201cIt\u2019s walk before you run.\u201d</p> \n<p>Oakman stresses the importance of getting out and moving for physical and mental health. \u201cOne of the reasons we\u2019re allowed outside is to exercise, and you need to use it \u2013 that\u2019s really, really important.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>If you do have problems</strong></h2> \n<p>For people with pre-existing conditions or emerging back problems, solutions need to be tailored to the specific issue by experts, informed by a full medical and treatment history.<br></p>",

It\u2019s not just about the chair The first step to working from home safely is figuring out how you\u2019re going to approach work, says an ergonomics expert, Jodi Oakman, an associate professor at La Trobe University, Melbourne. She stresses the importance of a holistic approach to organising the work environment before tackling the workspace. \u201cWhere are we going to do it and how am I going to do it? What hours am I going to do? Can I do all of my job?\u201d Careful planning, for instance, getting up earlier to get through tasks before the rest of the household stirs, can reduce the likelihood of injury and improve productivity Oakman suggests. \u201cBack pain is caused by work-related stress as well as work-related physical factors,\u201d she explains. That includes setting boundaries to create some distinction between home and work. For some, this could mean getting dressed in work gear or communicating \u201cI\u2019m at work\u201d by putting on a headset in a shared environment, or setting clear working hours and sharing them with managers and colleagues. A rehabilitation consultant, William Davis, emphasises the importance of a strict routine to avoid stress-related injury. \u201cIn this isolation environment when everyone\u2019s working from home, it\u2019s very easy to fall into the habit of doing an extra two or three hours a day. And I would advise against it from a stress-wellbeing point of view.\u201d Some people might have to acknowledge they can\u2019t juggle everything from home and adjust their working hours accordingly. \u201cMany people are moving into home schooling,\u201d says an occupational health physiotherapist, David Hall. \u201cSome of us with kids and trying to work from home. It\u2019s like being squeezed like a lemon \u2026 \u201cDon\u2019t try and be a hero. Just be gentle on yourself and don\u2019t \u2026 feel like you\u2019ve got to be like the best home schooler and the best worker; just set realistic expectations about what all that means.\u201d OK, let\u2019s get to the chair \u2026 All the experts agree that, ideally, a chair should have a height adjustment, to avoid unnecessary muscle strain that causes aching necks and backs. If you can\u2019t afford to buy a proper office chair, Hall says there\u2019s often a spare one somewhere that\u2019s not being used by a friend or neighbour, so ask around. It\u2019s important that the chair facilitates good posture \u2013 many chairs that aren\u2019t ergonomically designed go out at too far an angle, Davis explains. He recommends asking someone in the house to take a photo of you sitting, so you can check whether your torso and head are in a straight line. The chair should support your lower back, so the spine is in its natural S-shape. If not, Davis recommends adding a cushion or rolled-up towel. This lumbar support is not designed to take all your weight, just to act as a reminder to sit in an upright, S-shaped position. The chair should also allow the knees and elbows to be at right angles, to minimise unnecessary muscle strain. If the chair is too high and your feet aren\u2019t supported, Davis recommends using a stable surface to prop them up, like a box or ream of paper. The desk should support the elbows \u2013 if that\u2019s too high and you can\u2019t lift the chair, try sitting on a pillow or a cushion. Keep your eyes up Your keyboard and mouse should be about 8cm to 10cm from the edge of your desk, and the top of the monitor should be about one arm\u2019s length away, at eye level to avoid leaning forward or back. This can pose problems for users of laptops, which are best suited to occasional work and checking emails while travelling. People who don\u2019t have other options should source an external keyboard and mouse so they can raise the laptop to eye level using something like a shoebox, to prevent hunching over. Similarly, any reference documents that make you look down should be raised \u2013 Davis uses his mother\u2019s old recipe book holder for this. Movement is your friend If there really are limited options for achieving the ideal work position, Oakman says you should do your best to change positions and move between sitting and standing frequently. As an exercise physiologist, Davis says regular rest breaks are critical, making sure to get out of the chair every 30 to 45 minutes \u2013 if only briefly, to move around, stretch and change position. This will shift the strain between intervertebral discs, the spine\u2019s shock absorbers. \u201cThe most common time you see injuries, even for healthy workers in a sedentary office job or home setup, is with prolonged sitting,\u201d he says. A common example is when someone\u2019s focused on typing for two or three hours, \u201cloading their postures\u201d. Then, when they bend down to pick something up, their back cracks. Other ways to facilitate more movement include taking phone calls standing up, or walking around wherever possible. What about a standing workstation? Standup desks are great, Davis says, mostly for facilitating frequent postural change without having to move away from the desk. But they tend to be expensive, so he wouldn\u2019t recommend running out to buy one. If you have a bench or ledge at an appropriate height to set up a monitor or laptop, he suggests you could use it to work standing up for 15 or 20 minutes every hour or two \u2013 the maximum he recommends standing is for 20% to 30% of the working day. As far as fit balls go, Davis has no problem with using them for their intended purpose \u2013 which is exercise. But they\u2019re not designed to be used as a chair and cause similar problems to sitting and standing, if you end up in a static posture for prolonged periods. Using them for five to 10 minutes at a time would be his maximum recommendation. Workouts will help Exercise has numerous physical health benefits, Davis says, and is also a brilliant way to strengthen muscles and protect your back, especially through a strong core workout and body weight exercises. But he warns that you should build up, cautioning against isolation crazes on social media where people are doing 1,000 repetitions a day. \u201cIt\u2019s walk before you run.\u201d Oakman stresses the importance of getting out and moving for physical and mental health. \u201cOne of the reasons we\u2019re allowed outside is to exercise, and you need to use it \u2013 that\u2019s really, really important.\u201d If you do have problems For people with pre-existing conditions or emerging back problems, solutions need to be tailored to the specific issue by experts, informed by a full medical and treatment history.",

      "bodyText": "Competition experts have warned that the biggest risk for a recapitalised Virgin Australia will be its competitor, Qantas, which could potentially flood the domestic market with capacity in the face of much diminished demand for air travel in the foreseeable future. Creditors will meet next Thursday, when the accounting firm Deloitte\u2019s appointment as administrators could face challenge from bondholders owed $1.8bn who fear they will receive a minimal return. In a lengthy declaration sent to creditors, Deloitte laid out its history of work for Virgin and revealed it had so far billed $200,000 for consulting work on the coronavirus crisis, which was done before the administration appointment. Virgin entered voluntary administration on Wednesday and is seeking to rapidly recapitalise the airline so it can restart operations as Australia\u2019s second domestic carrier. Its fate depends in part on what happens at the creditors meeting, where Deloitte will either be removed as administrator or confirmed in the role. Insolvency industry sources said unions and creditors had sounded out rival firm KordaMentha, which was on a shortlist for the job alongside Deloitte and PwC but missed out. KordaMentha has previously drawn support from unions to tip out incumbent administrators, but union sources were unaware of any approaches from the insolvency firm. In a circular sent to creditors on Tuesday, administrators Vaughan Strawbridge, John Greig, Sal Algeri and Richard Hughes said they would ask for court approval to put off a second meeting of creditors, which the law normally requires to be held within 25 days of the first. The extra time would be used to \u201cnegotiate with potential purchasers of Virgin\u201d, the administrators said. \u201cAlternatively, it will give us time to negotiate with stakeholders to recapitalise Virgin, and further time will maximise the chances of Virgin continuing to trade,\u201d they said. Whatever happens to Virgin in coming weeks, both airlines will face a glut of capacity on their domestic services for the foreseeable future and almost no international traffic. Since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic both airlines have cut up to 95% of their flights, leaving only a few operating between capitals. The federal government is also subsidising airlines to operate a skeleton schedule of flights overseas to bring Australians home. The recovery will depend not just on the Australian government\u2019s timetable to relax restrictions on travel but also on how the rest of the world tackles the pandemic. International travel could be stalled for two years or more. This raises questions about whether either Virgin Mark 2 or Qantas could withstand a prolonged downturn in the industry without government support, despite the federal government so far ruling out a bailout for Virgin. The major risk for Virgin Mark 2 would be Qantas flooding the market with cheap fares the moment restrictions on travel were eased, experts said. The chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Rod Sims, said the regulator would work with the government on the competition arrangements for the airline industry as issues around Virgin become clearer. He pointed out the ACCC now had greater powers to deal with abuses of market power that either have the purpose or effect of limiting competition. \u201cIt\u2019s silly to say we can\u2019t have two airlines,\u201d Sims said. \u201cSydney and Melbourne are both big cities by world standards and you have to fly between them, so I don\u2019t buy the argument that we can only support one airline.\u201d The former ACCC chairman Allan Fels, who oversaw deregulation of Australia\u2019s domestic airline market, said the government might find itself forced to intervene. The first pressures may come if Virgin Mark 2 and Qantas decided to wind back regional and rural services and flights to major tourist destinations such as Cairns, leaving towns with little or no service. Significant political pressure will come from MPs in these areas, mostly Nationals. Fels also warned about the potential for Qantas to want to cut fares and drive up its yields once domestic air travel resumed. \u201cIf Qantas finds itself really struggling will they be tempted to grab the whole market during the slowdown?\u201d Fels asked. But Fels noted that Qantas had accepted competition in the wake of Ansett\u2019s collapse rather than the alternative of being regulated as a monopoly. \u201cQantas was somewhat fearful after Ansett collapsed that it would regulated as a monopoly. I doubt they will be trying to drive Virgin out of the market,\u201d he said. But he said Virgin would clearly have to change its business model to avoid running up the losses of recent years. Virgin would need to decide whether it wanted to be a full service airline and chase lucrative business customers, which was high-risk but high-reward, or whether it wanted to be a budget airline, Fels said. Australia\u2019s chequered history on fostering competition in the domestic airline industry also points to the importance of trying to recapitalise Virgin without it being dismantled and sold off in pieces. Dismantling the airline, even if someone bought assets to start a new one, would likely lead to long delays, as the company negotiated for terminal access and applied for a new air operators certificate. The certification cannot be transferred and is granted only once the Civil Aviation Safety Authority is satisfied that the key personnel in the new airline have sufficient experience.",

The figures are the first tranche of data in Australia\u2019s Threatened Species Index for mammals, which combines data from monitoring programs across the country to track trends in threatened species populations. A similar database already exists for birds and is collated by researchers working with the Threatened Species Recovery Hub in collaboration with state agencies and NGOs. The first tranche collates data for 57 threatened and near-threatened mammal species, including the northern quoll and the yellow-footed rock wallaby. It covers the years 1995-2016 across 1,186 different locations. Populations of the mammals at these sites declined on average by 38% , but the researchers found a source for optimism at locations where conservation measures had been put in place. At sites with clear conservation management efforts, populations increased on average by 46%. Only 155 of the 1,186 locations had active conservation work in place. At 15 feral cat and fox-free sites, the populations of threatened and near-threatened mammals had increased five-fold. Elisa Bayraktarov, a researcher at the University of Queensland and the co-leader of the index, said the data showed investment in conservation \u201cpays off\u201d. \u201cIt does tell us we should drive more investment, especially in those mammals that are doing so badly elsewhere,\u201d she said. The research found where there was no active conservation work, populations had declined on average by 60%. John Woinarski, a conservation biologist who is part of the research team, said animals in predator-free havens fared well, with the burrowing bettong and bridled nail-tailed wallaby among species to show large improvements in these areas. \u201cHowever, havens cover only 0.1% of Australia\u2019s total area, so they are only one part of the solution to Australia\u2019s long-term biodiversity loss, and they are not a solution for species that are declining for reasons other than cats and foxes,\u201d he said.

The research team is looking for contributions to future iterations of the index from any scientists and groups collecting standardised monitoring data. The national environment laws set up to protect threatened species are currently under independent review. The statutory review of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act occurs once every 10 years and is due to publish its final report in October. Environment groups have long called for an overhaul of the act, which has been failing to stem Australia\u2019s rate of extinction. Last week, six organisations asked for the review\u2019s timeframes to be extended because of the disruption caused by the back-to-back bushfire and coronavirus crises.",

      "bodyText": "Data released this week by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in conjunction with the Australian Taxation Office reveals that at least 6% of workers have lost their job over the past month, with the accommodation and food and arts and recreation industries absolutely smashed by the impact of the coronavirus. One of the problems with the standard data releases is that while they are nice and regular, during times of big shocks, they can also be somewhat out of date. The GDP figures for example only come out every three months \u2013 and the next lot released on 3 June will only cover the months January to March. That doesn\u2019t mean they are unimportant, but it makes them less valuable when attempting to formulate policy in a fast-changing economy. We saw another example of this when the latest unemployment figures for March only showed a small rise from 5.1% to 5.2%. The survey for each month\u2019s labour force figures covers the first two weeks of each month, and in March the real employment carnage happened in the last two weeks. That is why the ABS should be congratulated for the work they have been doing to provide more up-to-date information on a range of areas such as retail sales and jobs. This week the bureau, together with the ATO, has been able to present the weekly change in employment and wages since the start of the year. We normally don\u2019t care about such \u201coriginal\u201d data, because it is too noisy: \u201cOriginal\u201d data, for example, doesn\u2019t take into account that jobs usually dry up in January and then come back in February as firms start hiring after the summer breaks. Usually we look at the trend or the seasonally adjusted figures which takes what has happened in the past into account. But nothing like what is happening now has happened in the past. This is why original data now is very useful because it shows just how quickly employment began to fall in the second half of March: While the fall in jobs was pretty similar for both women and men, there were large differences across age groups. In the last two weeks of March, employment fell 6% for all workers, but for those under 20 and over 70 it dropped by 9%. The most secure were those in their 50s, and yet they even experienced a stunning 4% fall in jobs: The likelihood of losing a job was also very much dependent upon what industry you worked in. Education is the only industry to employ more people in the first week of April than it did in the first week of March. But accommodation and food services, and the arts and recreation industries are clearly the ones that have suffered the biggest falls: A quarter of those in the hospitality industry and one in five of those in the arts and recreation industry who were working in March no longer have a job. The loss of jobs in those two industries directly echoes the timing of the lockdown and forced closure of restaurants and arts and sporting events: We can see how out of whack these overall figures are when we compare this original data with what has happened over the past 15 years. Usually February sees a strong increase in jobs, followed by small increases or even a dip in March and then generally a bit of an increase in April (besides February, the best months to get a job are September and December). So far this year we were seeing that play out \u2013 but if the numbers released this week continue, we will see April drop completely out of the scope of what occurred even during the GFC: What this will mean for unemployment is hard to gauge. How the jobseeker numbers will affect the \u201cunemployed\u201d numbers is mostly guesswork at this stage. Also on a month-to-month basis there is not much correlation between employment growth and changes in unemployment. But if we look at annual changes we can get some idea of what is going to happen. Usually we need employment each year to grow around 1.7% to keep the unemployment rate stable: In the early 1980s and 1990s recessions when employment fell by 3.5%, unemployment rose by between 2.5 percentage points and 3.9 percentage points. A fall of 6%? That would have us looking at best at a four percentage point rise \u2013 to around 9.2%. And that\u2019s if all goes well. We await the full data to show the economic damage of the coronavirus. But what we have seen already suggests we are experiencing something that has never happened before, and it is very scary indeed. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

Danny Townsend, CEO of Sydney FC, took to Twitter to refute various claims made in the W-League report, including the idea that the women\u2019s game would be \u201ceasy\u201d to cut due to it having \u201clittle return\u201d on the investment clubs put in.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s just materially incorrect,\u201d Townsend told Guardian Australia. \u201cIf you actually lined up some of the football activity we do, the W-League is actually a quite reasonable financial proposition compared to some of the other things we invest in.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a simple thing to cut and given the importance of the Matildas in the Australian sporting landscape and the W-League being one of the oldest semi-professional competitions in this country \u2013 it\u2019s been around for 12 years now \u2013 the investments we\u2019ve all made in building such a viable competition would be crazy to consider [cutting].\u201d</p> <p>According to the original report, the game\u2019s small financial margins are the reason the W-League could not become a full home-and-away fixture in the 2019-20 season. But, Townsend said, these decisions come down to player, club and league priorities.</p> <p>\u201cIf you get an extra million dollars, you can look at spending it in many different ways,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat happens when we assess the future of all our leagues that we control is: where is that money best spent right now to get the best return and invest for the future?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/03/overcoming-current-challenges-in-womens-sport-will-pave-way-for-future-nostalgia\">Overcoming current challenges in women\u2019s sport will pave way for future nostalgia | Megan Maurice</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHaving every [W-League] match available on broadcast was a bigger priority than home-and-away, which was a bigger priority than expansion. That was a set of options that were decided upon by the players themselves through the PFA, which has an active role in the Professional Women\u2019s Football Committee.</p> <p>\u201cWe can say we could expand another four teams in the W-League, but if that means we don\u2019t get home-and-away as a priority, then that\u2019s not in keeping with what the players themselves want.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"68b0fd30823239291070dcf71578d70251f302ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68b0fd30823239291070dcf71578d70251f302ba/0_123_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Caitlin Foord\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The pathway the W-League affords to players like Caitlin Foord can inspire others, according to Townsend.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gavin Ellis/TGS Photo/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the impact of Covid-19 will force football to reshuffle these priorities. Indeed, it\u2019s easy for Sydney FC \u2013 one of Australia\u2019s richest football clubs \u2013 to prioritise their women\u2019s side, but what of clubs in less secure financial positions? Newcastle Jets, for example, were the only club to not sign an international player last W-League season due to off-field financial issues, and yet still filled all five international spots for their A-League side; a clear illustration of their priorities.</p> <p>Townsend believes such strategies are short-sighted. \u201cA club could spend $4.5m on players in the A-League because they see that as the most important competition their club is playing in, and they can skimp on their W-League and pay the floor of the cap; that\u2019s their choice.

      "bodyText": "As Australian football continues to navigate the financial crisis that is the coronavirus, there are fears the W-League may be one of the first competitions to be curtailed in order to keep the more lucrative A-League afloat. A recent report suggested Australia\u2019s top-tier women\u2019s league \u201clooms as the competition most likely to be scaled back if the game\u2019s already precarious finances are left in tatters by Fox Sports\u2019 potential departure\u201d. Some clubs supposedly see the W-League as a \u201chigh cost and little return\u201d endeavour given it still \u201crelies on revenue generated elsewhere to survive\u201d. It came just days before FIFPro, the international players\u2019 union, published a paper warning that women\u2019s football faces \u201can almost existential threat\u201d from the shutdown due to \u201cits less established professional leagues, low salaries, narrower scope of opportunities, uneven sponsorship deals and less corporate investment\u201d. But one senior figure in the game believes the W-League should not become the A-League\u2019s sacrificial lamb. Danny Townsend, CEO of Sydney FC, took to Twitter to refute various claims made in the W-League report, including the idea that the women\u2019s game would be \u201ceasy\u201d to cut due to it having \u201clittle return\u201d on the investment clubs put in. \u201cThat\u2019s just materially incorrect,\u201d Townsend told Guardian Australia. \u201cIf you actually lined up some of the football activity we do, the W-League is actually a quite reasonable financial proposition compared to some of the other things we invest in. \u201cIt\u2019s not a simple thing to cut and given the importance of the Matildas in the Australian sporting landscape and the W-League being one of the oldest semi-professional competitions in this country \u2013 it\u2019s been around for 12 years now \u2013 the investments we\u2019ve all made in building such a viable competition would be crazy to consider [cutting].\u201d According to the original report, the game\u2019s small financial margins are the reason the W-League could not become a full home-and-away fixture in the 2019-20 season. But, Townsend said, these decisions come down to player, club and league priorities. \u201cIf you get an extra million dollars, you can look at spending it in many different ways,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat happens when we assess the future of all our leagues that we control is: where is that money best spent right now to get the best return and invest for the future? \u201cHaving every [W-League] match available on broadcast was a bigger priority than home-and-away, which was a bigger priority than expansion. That was a set of options that were decided upon by the players themselves through the PFA, which has an active role in the Professional Women\u2019s Football Committee. \u201cWe can say we could expand another four teams in the W-League, but if that means we don\u2019t get home-and-away as a priority, then that\u2019s not in keeping with what the players themselves want.\u201d But the impact of Covid-19 will force football to reshuffle these priorities. Indeed, it\u2019s easy for Sydney FC \u2013 one of Australia\u2019s richest football clubs \u2013 to prioritise their women\u2019s side, but what of clubs in less secure financial positions? Newcastle Jets, for example, were the only club to not sign an international player last W-League season due to off-field financial issues, and yet still filled all five international spots for their A-League side; a clear illustration of their priorities. Townsend believes such strategies are short-sighted. \u201cA club could spend $4.5m on players in the A-League because they see that as the most important competition their club is playing in, and they can skimp on their W-League and pay the floor of the cap; that\u2019s their choice. To me, that\u2019s a fairly myopic decision to make. \u201cThe beauty of the female game is the cost base is even lower, so instead of spending $4.6m on [male] players, you might go and spend $4.3 million \u2013 and still have just as good a team, just recruit better \u2013 and have the best team in the W-League. \u201cIt\u2019s not even big clubs. Small clubs as well. You could redirect ten per cent of your A-League playing budget to the W-League and field a team that has a chance of winning.\u201d Townsend said the idea of redistributing funds from one competition to another would \u201cabsolutely\u201d be a conversation worth having in coming months. \u201cOur commitment at the start of this process was to remain intact as an organisation and competitions on the other side \u2026 and if that means redirecting out of your A-League set-up into your W-League set-up, then they\u2019re the decisions we need to make because we don\u2019t want to leave anybody behind.\u201d More importantly, however, the W-League has value to the Australian football landscape beyond the balance sheet. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen, over the last ten years, the proliferation of young females playing football. We\u2019ve seen the rise of the Matildas having a viable pathway is critical to that continuing to grow. \u201cWhen I go back fifteen years when I was playing, there was no real female football.

So here\u2019s a non-exhaustive list of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/picture-books\">picture books</a> that emphasise connection, curiosity and adventure within isolation or domesticity.

Under the Love Umbrella</strong></h2> <p><strong>by Davina Bell, illustrated by Allison Colpoys</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When everything is strange and new<br>On days when you need super glue<br>There\u2019s so much room here just for you<br>Under my love umbrella.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ba2b6af2ac687e889d8443370b1e9de317fc5f36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba2b6af2ac687e889d8443370b1e9de317fc5f36/0_0_2540_3083/824.jpg\" alt=\"Cover image for Under the Love Umbrella by Davina Bell and Allison Colpoys\" width=\"824\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>At a time when children are discouraged from seeing \u2013 let alone touching \u2013 loved ones who do not live with them, the language and images of <strong>Under the Love Umbrella </strong>feel achingly relevant. The book, by an Australian duo, traverses a novel conceit that unseen above the reader is an umbrella protecting and connecting that reader with the love of someone special to them. Here we are, huddled in our own homes, but shielded by a constant umbrella of love. Lovely, really.</p> <h2><strong>2. When I Coloured in the World</strong></h2> <p><strong>by Ahmadreza Ahmadi, illustrated by Ehsan Abdollahi</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"723ce228f20e2e8c6d2d1e92ac1bb4190b57943e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/723ce228f20e2e8c6d2d1e92ac1bb4190b57943e/0_0_600_599/500.jpg\" alt=\"Cover image for When I Coloured in the World\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Ahmadi\u2019s tale of a child who is given a box of crayons and an eraser, then decides to erase the world\u2019s ills and replace them with beauty and peace, is a slow-moving, beautifully illustrated, poetic story of child empowerment. \u201cDespair\u201d is rubbed out and replaced in yellow crayon by the word \u201chope\u201d. \u201cBoredom\u201d needs a blue crayon to replace it with \u201cplaying\u201d. It\u2019s a brave children\u2019s book that mentions words including war, illness and hunger, but <strong>When I Coloured in the World </strong>is a book for children who know more about the world than we usually give them credit for, and gives them a wonderful creative agency to make it better. With crayons.</p> <h2><strong>3. Where the Wild Things Are</strong></h2> <p><strong>by Maurice Sendak</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b6c395f56561f4ceefded554884bf7235a6e96c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6c395f56561f4ceefded554884bf7235a6e96c6/0_0_2976_2681/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cover image for Where the Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak\" width=\"1000\" height=\"901\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>For worlds within bedrooms, there is no better book on the planet than Sendak\u2019s classic among classics. There are few children\u2019s homes without a copy of <strong>Where the Wild Things Are</strong>,<strong> </strong>and while more than half a century old, the prose still feels sharp and the recognisable illustrations remain as engaging as ever. Max, banished to his bedroom for poor behaviour, is unfazed as the walls and floor around him turn to forest and seas to be traversed. His journey takes him to a kingdom of wild things of which he becomes monarch. The wild things are, it turns out, rather closer than we think \u2013 both a comfort and an opportunity for those now in confinement. There\u2019s something to be said for parents, too, being able to turn to books from their own childhood as if nothing in the world has changed.</p> <h2><strong>4. Amy &amp; Louis</strong></h2> <p><strong>by Libby Gleeson, illustrated by Freya Blackwood</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"77e6ac32376786798abb33cd2d9fe35de9def2f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77e6ac32376786798abb33cd2d9fe35de9def2f9/0_0_800_780/500.jpg\" alt=\"Cover image for Amy &amp; Louis by Libby Gleeson and Freya Blackwood\" width=\"500\" height=\"487\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Amy &amp; Louis </strong>is really a tale of a more ordinary isolation than that with which we have now become familiar \u2013 of friends parted by moving house. Gleeson\u2019s softly told story follows best friends and neighbours Louis and Amy, who can no longer play with and call to each other after Amy moves far away. They mourn their friendship and their newfound loneliness but ultimately find that their connection can traverse distance and dreams. Blackwood\u2019s gentle illustrations pair wonderfully with the simplicity of Gleeson\u2019s prose and story. There is no mention of chaotic FaceTime catch-ups but rather a reassurance that friendship remains even when physical closeness does not.</p> <h2><strong>5. It Might Be an Apple</strong></h2> <p><strong>by Shinsuke Yoshitake</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"19c473134b47b1ac8370b53c487c82e45090bd1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19c473134b47b1ac8370b53c487c82e45090bd1b/0_0_954_1200/795.jpg\" alt=\"Cover image for It Might Be an Apple by Shinsuke Yoshitake\" width=\"795\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>When we\u2019re stuck at home, in truth, any book that encourages children to spend a significant amount of time thinking about and engaging anew with a single banal object is a welcome diversion. <strong>It Might Be an Apple </strong>from the Japanese author-illustrator Yoshitake follows one boy\u2019s encounter with an apple left on a table. But, is it an apple? It may be an elaborate machine, it may be a fish in disguise, it might wish to be an aeroplane, or it may be an all-knowing being that turns hard and pointy when angry. Now is the time for curiosity and wonder in all things, and Yoshitake\u2019s story is an ode to imagination.</p> <h2><strong>6. What\u2019s That Noise? (This Book Is Calling You \u2026 )</strong></h2> <p><strong>by Isabel Minh\u00f3s Martins and Madalena Matoso</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c3fae1cc49c6652251bac11c68d3396c568f1ede\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3fae1cc49c6652251bac11c68d3396c568f1ede/0_0_340_400/340.jpg\" alt=\"Cover image for What\u2019s That Noise? This Book is Calling You\" width=\"340\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s a little subgenre of picture books in which the book speaks to the child reader as a book, and the physical object becomes a source of play. And within that subgenre, <strong>What\u2019s That Noise? (This Book Is Calling You \u2026 ) </strong>is a good \u2019un. What makes Minh\u00f3s Martins\u2019 book particularly compelling coronavirus reading is the way in which it becomes a proxy for the natural world. Fingers are instructed to patter on the page, first as droplets and then as a storm. A tap of fingertips into a river \u2013 it feels cold, doesn\u2019t it? \u2013 before the fingers prance from stone to stone across to the other side<em><strong>. </strong></em>A little worm is shielded in a cupped hand from a predatory black bird. When the outside is off-limits, this offers a quirky way to recall and re-enact the sensory adventure of the outdoors.</p> <h2><strong>7. A Child of Books</strong></h2> <p><strong>by Oliver Jeffers and Sam Winston</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"055acdbd4b6105ece672fd88f07e8b76e8c949a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/055acdbd4b6105ece672fd88f07e8b76e8c949a2/0_0_3035_3168/958.jpg\" alt=\"A Child of Books\" width=\"958\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The beauty and power of children\u2019s books is the subject of <strong>A Child of Books</strong>, which reads as much as a poetic manifesto as it does a story. It follows a girl as she asks a boy to come away with her to \u201cmountains of make-believe\u201d and other faraway, fantastical destinations contained within the pages of books. Jeffers and Winston collaborate on this beautiful invocation of the worlds within books. Text from classic stories forms part of the illustrations themselves, the stories building the book\u2019s physical world.

      "bodyText": "Schools are all but closed. Playgrounds are wrapped in hazard tape. Swimming pools, national parks, holidays, birthday parties, cinemas, zoos, grandparents, friends \u2013 all the normal places and people of childhood are now off limits to this generation of children. But they still have books. For children in isolation around the world, books have taken on increased importance. They are a link to the world beyond. So here\u2019s a non-exhaustive list of picture books that emphasise connection, curiosity and adventure within isolation or domesticity. Technically, these are books for young children \u2013 but don\u2019t we all need a bit of beauty, play and comfort nowadays? 1. Under the Love Umbrella by Davina Bell, illustrated by Allison Colpoys When everything is strange and new On days when you need super glue There\u2019s so much room here just for you Under my love umbrella. At a time when children are discouraged from seeing \u2013 let alone touching \u2013 loved ones who do not live with them, the language and images of Under the Love Umbrella feel achingly relevant. The book, by an Australian duo, traverses a novel conceit that unseen above the reader is an umbrella protecting and connecting that reader with the love of someone special to them. Here we are, huddled in our own homes, but shielded by a constant umbrella of love. Lovely, really. 2. When I Coloured in the World by Ahmadreza Ahmadi, illustrated by Ehsan Abdollahi Ahmadi\u2019s tale of a child who is given a box of crayons and an eraser, then decides to erase the world\u2019s ills and replace them with beauty and peace, is a slow-moving, beautifully illustrated, poetic story of child empowerment. \u201cDespair\u201d is rubbed out and replaced in yellow crayon by the word \u201chope\u201d. \u201cBoredom\u201d needs a blue crayon to replace it with \u201cplaying\u201d. It\u2019s a brave children\u2019s book that mentions words including war, illness and hunger, but When I Coloured in the World is a book for children who know more about the world than we usually give them credit for, and gives them a wonderful creative agency to make it better. With crayons. 3. Where the Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak For worlds within bedrooms, there is no better book on the planet than Sendak\u2019s classic among classics. There are few children\u2019s homes without a copy of Where the Wild Things Are, and while more than half a century old, the prose still feels sharp and the recognisable illustrations remain as engaging as ever. Max, banished to his bedroom for poor behaviour, is unfazed as the walls and floor around him turn to forest and seas to be traversed. His journey takes him to a kingdom of wild things of which he becomes monarch. The wild things are, it turns out, rather closer than we think \u2013 both a comfort and an opportunity for those now in confinement. There\u2019s something to be said for parents, too, being able to turn to books from their own childhood as if nothing in the world has changed. 4. Amy &amp; Louis by Libby Gleeson, illustrated by Freya Blackwood Amy &amp; Louis is really a tale of a more ordinary isolation than that with which we have now become familiar \u2013 of friends parted by moving house. Gleeson\u2019s softly told story follows best friends and neighbours Louis and Amy, who can no longer play with and call to each other after Amy moves far away. They mourn their friendship and their newfound loneliness but ultimately find that their connection can traverse distance and dreams. Blackwood\u2019s gentle illustrations pair wonderfully with the simplicity of Gleeson\u2019s prose and story. There is no mention of chaotic FaceTime catch-ups but rather a reassurance that friendship remains even when physical closeness does not. 5. It Might Be an Apple by Shinsuke Yoshitake When we\u2019re stuck at home, in truth, any book that encourages children to spend a significant amount of time thinking about and engaging anew with a single banal object is a welcome diversion. It Might Be an Apple from the Japanese author-illustrator Yoshitake follows one boy\u2019s encounter with an apple left on a table. But, is it an apple? It may be an elaborate machine, it may be a fish in disguise, it might wish to be an aeroplane, or it may be an all-knowing being that turns hard and pointy when angry. Now is the time for curiosity and wonder in all things, and Yoshitake\u2019s story is an ode to imagination. 6. What\u2019s That Noise? (This Book Is Calling You \u2026 ) by Isabel Minh\u00f3s Martins and Madalena Matoso There\u2019s a little subgenre of picture books in which the book speaks to the child reader as a book, and the physical object becomes a source of play. And within that subgenre, What\u2019s That Noise? (This Book Is Calling You \u2026 ) is a good \u2019un. What makes Minh\u00f3s Martins\u2019 book particularly compelling coronavirus reading is the way in which it becomes a proxy for the natural world. Fingers are instructed to patter on the page, first as droplets and then as a storm. A tap of fingertips into a river \u2013 it feels cold, doesn\u2019t it? \u2013 before the fingers prance from stone to stone across to the other side. A little worm is shielded in a cupped hand from a predatory black bird. When the outside is off-limits, this offers a quirky way to recall and re-enact the sensory adventure of the outdoors. 7. A Child of Books by Oliver Jeffers and Sam Winston The beauty and power of children\u2019s books is the subject of A Child of Books, which reads as much as a poetic manifesto as it does a story. It follows a girl as she asks a boy to come away with her to \u201cmountains of make-believe\u201d and other faraway, fantastical destinations contained within the pages of books. Jeffers and Winston collaborate on this beautiful invocation of the worlds within books. Text from classic stories forms part of the illustrations themselves, the stories building the book\u2019s physical world. And as children speaking to the universe, it ends: For this is our world we\u2019ve made from stories Our house is a home of invention Where anyone at all can come For imagination is free.",

They have lost jobs in their tens of thousands. But they are excluded from all government support measures, including the centrepiece jobkeeper wage subsidy and jobseeker welfare payments.</p> \n<p>As the Covid-19 pandemic wreaks its devastation across the world, they face the very real prospect of destitution, of being left homeless, of not having enough to eat.</p> \n<p>That they don\u2019t vote is too simplistic an argument, their treatment reflects a more fundamental conception in Australia that people temporarily in the country \u2013 who live among Australian citizens as neighbours, work alongside them as colleagues, catch the bus as fellow commuters, and pay taxes as fellow contributors \u2013 are somehow less deserving of the country\u2019s protection.</p> \n<p>They are, in a phrase coined by Peter Mares, <a href=\"https://insidestory.org.au/counting-the-not-quite-australians/\">\u201cnot quite Australian\u201d</a>.</p> \n<p>Those left stranded are not an insignificant number: an estimated 1.1 million people are in Australia on temporary visas and are excluded from the jobkeeper and jobseeker support (most New Zealanders, the largest expatriate group, are included).

Who are the people the government should care for and consider its own? Australia\u2019s government has chosen to define that narrowly \u2013 as citizens and permanent residents. It has consciously decided that those in Australia on temporary visas are undeserving of support.</p> \n<p>There are far stronger arguments why Australia should take a broader view of who is \u201cAustralian\u201d, who are members of this community and who should be afforded this community\u2019s protection.</p> \n<p>First is the humanitarian imperative.</p> \n<p>These are extraordinary times. The world faces a global pandemic the likes of which has not been seen for a century. There exists an obligation to offer some measure of assistance to people in this country in a time of unprecedented crisis.</p> \n<p>The entreaties that people should \u201cmake their way home\u201d are politically alluring but simplistic and impractical. Many simply cannot: they cannot afford flights home; the borders of their country have been sealed shut \u2013 even to citizens; transit countries will not allow them to pass through; or they have come to Australia seeking protection and cannot safely go back.</p> \n<p>Others have lived in Australia for years and have built families and lives and communities here, there is no other \u201chome\u201d to go back to.</p> \n<p>Australians too, are stranded overseas. The case for reciprocity is strong. Australia should treat its visitors the way it would like its citizens who are caught overseas at this critical time treated. Other countries have recognised this: Portugal has temporarily granted all migrants in the country the rights of its citizens.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Email:</b>&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email?CMP=cvau_atom\">daily coronavirus newsletter</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>App:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_atom\">download it</a>&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Social:&nbsp;</b>follow us on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://facebook.com/theguardianaustralia\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardianaustralia/\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaus\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Podcast:</b>&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/full-story-coronavirus-updates/id1482061243\">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7GJod4EyoLywB1AW6zrSHh?si=LD1i9SJwRqSAcT3i4ZCI-w\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>There is the moral argument.</p> \n<p>These people have been invited and welcomed into the country \u2013 to study, to bring skills, to be protected from persecution, to labour in our farms and factories, hotels and hospitals.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWe are all in this together,\u201d prime minister Scott Morrison intoned solemnly to parliament, as he outlined Australia\u2019s response to the global Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cWe are charting the road through. We are all in.\u201d Some, however, are more \u201cin\u201d than others. Far from being the great leveller it is asserted to be, Covid-19 has laid bare \u2013 as if it needed further exposition \u2013 the structural inequalities that exist in contemporary Australia. Those who are in Australia temporarily \u2013 to study, to work, to pick fruit, to be protected from persecution \u2013 have had their second-class status brutally exposed by the extremis of Covid-19. As the government has rolled out massive and unprecedented rescue packages for jobs and businesses \u2013 $214bn and counting \u2013 for those in Australia on temporary visas there is no safety net at all. Many work in jobs and industries severely affected by shutdowns. They have lost jobs in their tens of thousands. But they are excluded from all government support measures, including the centrepiece jobkeeper wage subsidy and jobseeker welfare payments. As the Covid-19 pandemic wreaks its devastation across the world, they face the very real prospect of destitution, of being left homeless, of not having enough to eat. That they don\u2019t vote is too simplistic an argument, their treatment reflects a more fundamental conception in Australia that people temporarily in the country \u2013 who live among Australian citizens as neighbours, work alongside them as colleagues, catch the bus as fellow commuters, and pay taxes as fellow contributors \u2013 are somehow less deserving of the country\u2019s protection. They are, in a phrase coined by Peter Mares, \u201cnot quite Australian\u201d. Those left stranded are not an insignificant number: an estimated 1.1 million people are in Australia on temporary visas and are excluded from the jobkeeper and jobseeker support (most New Zealanders, the largest expatriate group, are included). They include international students, working holiday makers, skilled work visa holders, asylum seekers and refugees. At state level, Tasmania and South Australia have announced limited support measures for some temporary visa holders, but the federal government has argued that in constructing its rescue packages for the Australian economy it \u201chad to draw the line somewhere\u201d. That is a reasonable and defensible argument, and in a time of extreme stress, fighting an external invisible foe, national inflexion is a natural instinct for governments, and certainly a politically attractive one. A government\u2019s most fundamental duty, after all, is to protect its people. But who are its people? Who are the people the government should care for and consider its own? Australia\u2019s government has chosen to define that narrowly \u2013 as citizens and permanent residents. It has consciously decided that those in Australia on temporary visas are undeserving of support. There are far stronger arguments why Australia should take a broader view of who is \u201cAustralian\u201d, who are members of this community and who should be afforded this community\u2019s protection. First is the humanitarian imperative. These are extraordinary times. The world faces a global pandemic the likes of which has not been seen for a century. There exists an obligation to offer some measure of assistance to people in this country in a time of unprecedented crisis. The entreaties that people should \u201cmake their way home\u201d are politically alluring but simplistic and impractical. Many simply cannot: they cannot afford flights home; the borders of their country have been sealed shut \u2013 even to citizens; transit countries will not allow them to pass through; or they have come to Australia seeking protection and cannot safely go back. Others have lived in Australia for years and have built families and lives and communities here, there is no other \u201chome\u201d to go back to. Australians too, are stranded overseas. The case for reciprocity is strong. Australia should treat its visitors the way it would like its citizens who are caught overseas at this critical time treated. Other countries have recognised this: Portugal has temporarily granted all migrants in the country the rights of its citizens. There is the moral argument. These people have been invited and welcomed into the country \u2013 to study, to bring skills, to be protected from persecution, to labour in our farms and factories, hotels and hospitals. They have come and contributed, they have broadened the fabric of the Australian community. Australia presents great opportunities to its many migrants, but too, this country has built an economy dependent on migrant labour, on the international student market, and on the economic expansion that a high rate of immigration brings. Hundreds of thousands of jobs are staffed by skilled work visa holders, international students, working holiday makers and seasonal workers. They are vital to the Australian economy. While they are here, these people are part of the Australian community, they are neighbours and colleagues, fellows and friends. They have paid taxes, built families, friendships and communities here. Australia has a moral obligation to the people it has invited to be part of this society. It is not reasonable to welcome people to the country in times of plenty and prosperity only to banish them when things become difficult. Finally, it is in Australia\u2019s own interest to help not only its citizens, but everybody who lives in this country. The Covid-19 pandemic is a global issue, and simply pretending that Australia can be sealed off, and foreign nationals forced overseas, is naive. This crisis will not be solved by Australia acting alone and on its own. No nation can be safe from this virus while it is surrounded by it. At the end of this crisis, Australia must resume its place in the world as an outward-looking, globally engaged, trading, travelling nation, as a place that welcomes the world in. This will be much harder to do if we are seen to summarily discard visitors who suddenly become inconvenient. The government must take a broader view of what it means to be part of the Australian community. If it is true that \u201cwe are all in this together\u201d, everyone here must be \u201cwe\u201d.",

Under the assumption we\u2019d be leaving at that time, we took full advantage of the four open days to say goodbye \u2014 an evening of song with our host families, one last night swim off the sea wall and a trip to the island Savai\u2019i. Our last afternoon on Savai\u2019i, my friend Lily received a call at the boardwalk. It was her mom, stuck in the Netherlands, calling to tell her nearly her entire family across three US states had contracted coronavirus.

At lunch, the news broke that all the suspected cases in Samoa tested negative. People were cheering and pulling out all the Vailima beer and wine they could reach beneath the massive cow in the freezer. Our exit plans were indefinite, but I found profound joy and acceptance in that home. For four days, we danced, cooked and rested together as the US embassy navigated diplomatic discussions with the Samoan government and the governor of American Samoa to aid our exit.</p> <p>American Samoa is just 70km east of the independent nation of Samoa, but as it is a US territory, it looked like our surest route home to the mainland US.</p> <p>Dr Taomi had a cousin who offered to fly us to American Samoa on a chartered flight, we just needed clearance.

Our last afternoon on Savai\u2019i, my friend Lily received a call at the boardwalk. It was her mom, stuck in the Netherlands, calling to tell her nearly her entire family across three US states had contracted coronavirus. I was sitting near Lily when she found out; she seemed to sob and laugh simultaneously, the news still unprocessed. I listened to the ocean as I waited for her to hang up; this strange tide was coming in, whether or not we were ready. I noticed an unnamable tension on the ferry ride back from Savai\u2019i. People had begun to wear masks and step more carefully around me. There were suspected cases quarantined near the airport, and the government of Samoa, unbeknownst to us, was preparing to enter a state of emergency. As we packed, they ordered the airport control tower to reroute our plane to Nadi, Fiji, as no planes from the US were to land in Samoa. When the news came, I spent the night glued to my phone, communicating furiously with my 14 counterparts and Dr Taomi. She\u2019d reworked the plan\u2014we\u2019d fly to Nadi in two days and catch our flight to Honolulu from there. But just a few hours later, Samoa, American Samoa, Fiji and Tonga closed their borders. The flight to Nadi ceased to exist. I called my parents, but couldn\u2019t tell them when I\u2019d be home. The next day, Dr Taomi moved us into a house owned by her church community, who generously prepared a meal for our arrival. At lunch, the news broke that all the suspected cases in Samoa tested negative. People were cheering and pulling out all the Vailima beer and wine they could reach beneath the massive cow in the freezer. Our exit plans were indefinite, but I found profound joy and acceptance in that home. For four days, we danced, cooked and rested together as the US embassy navigated diplomatic discussions with the Samoan government and the governor of American Samoa to aid our exit. American Samoa is just 70km east of the independent nation of Samoa, but as it is a US territory, it looked like our surest route home to the mainland US. Dr Taomi had a cousin who offered to fly us to American Samoa on a chartered flight, we just needed clearance. Once in American Samoa, we could catch one remaining flight scheduled to leave the territory for Hawai\u2019i the next week. One night during a group meeting, a mass breakout of 36 prisoners at the Tanumalala prison occurred. At that point, I wasn\u2019t surprised, it seemed a reasonable addition to the chaos. Dr Taomi jumped to her feet and called another cousin \u2013 this time, one who ran a security company. The guards who came lounged in plastic chairs on the lawn, joking and watching the streets flash red and blue all night long. We were to see those lights again on our journey home, this time after we had made it to American Samoa and were huddled in the back of a yellow school bus racing along the coast toward a quarantine facility. Police escorts surrounded us, alarming the locals as if we were the virus itself. Other Americans joined us at Sadie\u2019s By The Sea, a beachfront hotel co-opted by the Department of Health to quarantine transiting travellers. During our three-day stay, we were divided into rooms and asked to go no further than our porches, but that didn\u2019t break our group morale. We conference-called on the hotel phones and leaned from the porch pillars to see each other. On my roommate\u2019s 21st birthday, a group of Americans nine balconies away finessed her a beer. One of the department of health nurses, Sweetheart Nua, asked that our escorted bus ride to the airport take place during golden hour so that we might enjoy a fleeting glimpse of her country as we left. Leaving quarantine, I rested my head in the open window listening, this time not to the sirens, but to the joy in my friends\u2019 voices. A double rainbow hovered above the Pacific\u2014a bridge we\u2019d soon use to cross home. In Samoa, we learned of va, the inseparable relational space that exists between individuals and their family, community and nation. It gives the Samoan \u2018self\u2019 meaning through relationship with others. We\u2019re home because the innumerable amount of people who fought for our return relied on the strength of their connections and relationships. My semester may have ended prematurely, but I learned my lesson on Pacific resiliency.",

      "bodyText": "At 12.30pm on Wednesday, 83-year-old Alice Kennedy departed from London and headed to Dublin for the very last time. Kennedy, a working-class Irish woman who died shortly after contracting the coronavirus, \u201cwasn\u2019t alone\u201d on that final journey home. Across the UK capital, where Kennedy lived for over 50 years, friends and loved ones marked the moment the plane took off by lighting a candle, saying a prayer, or singing a song. The Irish Pensioners Choir, of which Kennedy was a leading member, overcame many technical difficulties to lend their voice to a video of the song Going Home that was widely shared on social media and played later at her funeral in Clonaslee, county Laois. The 83-year-old, who was described as an \u201cadventurous\u201d woman, lived in a council block in Kentish Town, north London. After retiring from her job at John Lewis, she had been the chair of the Irish Elderly Advice Network (IEAN) for more than 10 years. Kennedy was said to have taken a whole new lease on life after retiring. She busked at Westminster station as part of the choir, took leading roles in plays, and was set to perform in Trafalgar Square on St Patrick\u2019s Day. As well as her fond memories of Kennedy, Nora Mulready, head of culture at the IEAN, spoke of her frustration with the government\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic and delay in advising people to stay home. \u201cAlice was sat in my office on the day we made the decision to close everything and we were putting the house in order to shut down everything. \u201cShe said to me: \u2018The minute the prime minister tells me to stay at home, I\u2019ll stay at home and not come back out.\u2019 She trusted the prime minister, she trusted the government, but that advice came very late. I definitely think lives have been lost that didn\u2019t need to be lost because for some reason the prime minister didn\u2019t give the advice early enough to older people.\u201d Mulready described Kennedy as \u201can incredible ambassador for older people\u201d who constantly challenged people\u2019s perception of older people in how she lived her life and how she encouraged others to. Tributes came flooding in after news of Kennedy\u2019s death, including from the Irish president, Michael D Higgins. In a letter to the family, Higgins wrote: \u201cI have long been an admirer of Alice\u2019s work as chair of the Irish Elderly Advice Network and the driving force behind the Irish Pensioners\u2019 Choir. \u201cAlice epitomised what is best in Ireland\u2019s diaspora, having made such a valuable contribution over several decades as an active leader within London\u2019s Irish Community. \u201cAlice was a most noble daughter of Ireland and her service to her community was immense.\u201d While London wasn\u2019t her final resting place, Mulready said the city was also her home. \u201cShe represents the immigrant story and dilemma \u2013 the dual pull of two places.

The Guardian understands referrals to Prevent are down by more than 50% since the lockdown started on 23 March, according to official figures yet to be made public. Counter-terrorism officials fear a crucial defence is being weakened with young people spending more time online alone and unsupervised since schools and colleges closed. Ch Supt Nik Adams, the national coordinator for Prevent, said: \u201cWhat concerns me greatly is that the decline in the number of referrals doesn\u2019t mean that there are fewer people that need our help, but that fewer people are able to access the support they need. \u201cSchools, mental health workers and other public services provide vital support and protection to young and vulnerable people, and the combination of those services being impacted by Covid-19 and the fact people are spending more time online means a small number of vulnerable people are at greater risk of being drawn towards terrorist activity.\u201d One major cause of the sharp drop in referrals is that those in the community who usually spot signs of concern, such as youth workers and teachers, are no longer meeting people. The scheme relies on such referrals. The fall in referrals is believed to be the largest ever in the more than a decade Prevent has been running. Britain\u2019s top counter-terrorism officer, assistant commissioner Neil Basu, has said Prevent is the most important strand of the UK\u2019s counter-terrorism strategy to thwart mass casualty attacks by those radicalised by both jihadists and the extreme right wing.

It has said that the crisis could allow Isis supporters to \u201coverwhelm\u201d the west.

      "bodyText": "Downing Street ignored a firm warning from Matt Hancock\u2019s Department of Health that ministers should not publicise the expected shipment of protective kit for NHS staff from Turkey in case it backfired, a senior departmental source has told the Guardian. In a sign of deepening tensions between the Department of Health and Downing Street, the source said that Hancock\u2019s Cabinet colleague Robert Jenrick was \u201cstrongly advised\u201d not to mention the consignment at the government\u2019s coronavirus media briefing last Saturday. Instead, the housing, communities and local government secretary \u2013 with No 10\u2019s approval \u2013 went ahead and promised that it would arrive the next day and contain 83 tonnes of personal protective equipment (PPE), including 400,000 of the full-length surgical gowns that are in critically short supply in the NHS. Its non-arrival on Sunday led hospital bosses to go public for the first time with their \u201cintense frustration and exasperation\u201d with ministers over botched deliveries of PPE. The disclosures \u2013 strongly denied by a source close to Hancock who called them \u201ccategorically not true and a fabrication\u201d - come amid what appear to be growing difficulties at the heart of government over who is to blame for the difficulties Boris Johnson\u2019s administration is facing over its handling of the Coronavirus crisis, especially the lack of both testing and PPE for NHS staff. Hancock was subject to a public attack in a front-page story in Tuesday\u2019s Daily Telegraph, quoting government insiders, over his struggle to deliver the 100,000 tests for Coronavirus a day by the end of the month that he promised in early April. An unnamed person referred to as an insider who is close to Downing Street aides was quoted as calling the target \u201carbitrary\u201d, and adding: \u201cThere is a faint irrationality behind it, just because there was a clamour for mass testing.

Everyone in government is normally wary of this and I don\u2019t know why it didn\u2019t happen this time,\u201d he said. The government has faced severe criticism this week over its handling of deliveries of foreign-sourced PPE to the UK. The promised arrival of 400,000 gowns urgently needed by frontline staff turning into a saga which dragged on into Wednesday, when one of three RAF planes that had been scheduled to bring the shipment back finally touched down in the UK. The plane had been dispatched from RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire, where two other aircraft have been on standby to pick up further supplies from Turkey since late on 20 April. The Department of Health and Social Care was blamed for failing to secure the necessary export approvals from Turkey after placing the order, but health sources said on 22 April that there were other reasons for the delay. The planes remain on standby at RAF Brize Norton and may fly to Istanbul imminently if there is enough equipment waiting to make the journey worthwhile. \u201cWe\u2019ve been told there is another delivery at the airport now, but we are not yet sure if there\u2019s enough to justify a flight,\u201d a defence source said. There have been repeated ministerial assurances that the cargo would imminently arrive in the UK since Saturday when Jenrick first referred to it.

      "bodyText": "Social distancing will be needed until at least the end of the year to prevent fresh outbreaks of coronavirus even though the UK has reached the peak of the current epidemic, the government\u2019s chief medical officer has said. Prof Chris Whitty, the UK\u2019s most senior medic, said it was important to be realistic that \u201chighly disruptive\u201d social distancing would need to be in place for \u201creally quite a long period of time\u201d. He said there was only an \u201cincredibly small\u201d chance of a vaccine or treatments being ready for use this year, and social distancing would have to stay in place to suppress outbreaks until then. His stark assessment dampened hopes that the lockdown would be largely removed when it is reviewed in just over a fortnight. \u201cWe have to be very realistic,\u201d he said. \u201cIf people are hoping it\u2019s suddenly going to move from where we are in lockdown to where suddenly into everything is gone, that is a wholly unrealistic expectation. \u201cWe are going to have to do a lot of things for really quite a long period of time, the question is what is the best package and this is what we\u2019re trying to work out. \u201cIf you release more on one area, you have to keep on board more of another area so there\u2019s a proper trade-off and this is what ministers are having to consider.\u201d In other developments: Figures showed 759 people were reported to have died in the UK of coronavirus in the previous 24 hours. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, and other opposition MPs raised concerns that the outbreak may still be worsening in care homes, but the picture is unclear because the government is not providing up-to-date data on deaths. The government came under continued pressure for ignoring offers of personal protective equipment from companies, with Labour highlighting 36 cases of offers that received no response. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said contact tracing would be introduced at a \u201clarge scale\u201d, and an NHS app for tracing was in an advanced state of development. Earlier, Hancock had fuelled hope of the lockdown ending soon by telling the House of Commons the UK was \u201cat the peak\u201d of the virus. Dominic Raab, who is deputising for the prime minister, sounded a slightly more cautious note than Hancock at the daily No 10 press conference, saying \u201cwe are coming through the peak\u201d but the UK is \u201cnot out the other end yet\u201d. Conservative MPs are growing increasingly fractious about the effects of the lockdown on business and held a conference call of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tories on Wednesday where many expressed a desire to see it lifted as soon as possible in early May. However, speaking alongside Raab, Whitty made clear that it would be a long downward slope out of the current peak in terms of falling infections and deaths. He refused to be drawn on how the UK could begin to ease the lockdown but said a combination of measures could make sure the rate of transmission \u2013 known as R \u2013 is kept below 1. This means each case spreads the virus to fewer than one other person. \u201cIn the long run, the exit from this is going to be one of two things, ideally,\u201d he said. \u201cA vaccine, and there are a variety of ways they can be deployed ... or, and/or, highly effective drugs so that people stop dying of this disease even if they catch it, or which can prevent this disease in vulnerable people. \u201cUntil we have those \u2013 and the probability of having those any time in the next calendar year are incredibly small, and I think we should be realistic about that \u2013 we\u2019re going to have to rely on other social measures, which of course are very socially disruptive as everyone is finding at the moment. \u201cBut until that point, that is what we will have to do but it will be the best combination that maximises the outlooks but it\u2019s going to take a long time and I think we need to be aware of that.\u201d Hancock has begun to emphasise that the formula of \u201ctest, trace and isolate\u201d would be key to exiting the lockdown and suppressing new outbreaks. \u201cWe are ramping up our testing capacity and our capacity for contact tracing in a matter of weeks,\u201d he told the House of Commons.

These incidents, which occurred in non-university lectures and seminars, have included being targeted with racial slurs, such as the N-word, by people wearing Ku Klux Klan-style robes.</p> <p>Experts on online harassment said universities\u2019 own computer networks were also vulnerable to abuse. They pointed to a recently leaked <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/university-of-warwick-hiding-data-security-risks-from-students-and-staff-11968654\">report on data security</a> at Warwick University, which found it lacked internet filter software to block students and staff from accessing inappropriate or illegal material.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/apr/01/from-houseparty-to-zoom-our-digital-lives-in-lockdown\">From Houseparty to Zoom: our digital lives in lockdown - podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The internal audit of cyber security, seen by the Guardian, also found that IT monitoring at the university, which has been criticised for its handling of a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jul/10/warwick-university-apologises-to-women-targeted-by-chat\">rape chat\u201d scandal</a>, was \u201cnot sufficiently robust to be useful to investigate and treat a cyber security issue\u201d.</p> <p>Andy Phippen, professor of digital rights at Bournemouth University, said the failings identified by the report were unlikely to be limited to Warwick.

      "bodyText": "Students are posting extreme pornography in online lectures, prompting academics to warn that the switch to digital learning in the coronavirus pandemic will increase harassment at UK universities. Several universities have taken disciplinary action against students for posting abusive images in lectures hosted on the Zoom video app in the past week, according to Aisha Gill, professor of criminology at Roehampton University. The cases come after the University of Derby suspended six students over \u201cdegrading and offensive\u201d comments allegedly made about their female peers in an online group chat, and a leaked report found Warwick University lacked internet filter software to block students and staff from accessing inappropriate or illegal material. Gill, who is also co-chair of End Violence Against Women, said she knew of three to four incidents at different universities in the past week where students had posted abusive sexual images in live Zoom lectures. \u201cWe\u2019re talking really disturbing, violent, pornographic images,\u201d she said. \u201cAction is being taken.\u201d Gill said universities urgently needed to improve their online security, such as stronger internet firewalls. \u201cThe lockdown has really brought cyber-bullying into sharp focus, particularly online harassment,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel it\u2019s spiralling out of control. Universities are not prepared because they\u2019re firefighting with emergency responses to Covid-19.\u201d Since the lockdown began, several black academics and educators have posted accounts on Twitter of racist \u201czoombombings\u201d, where uninvited guests abuse the popular video service to broadcast offensive content. These incidents, which occurred in non-university lectures and seminars, have included being targeted with racial slurs, such as the N-word, by people wearing Ku Klux Klan-style robes. Experts on online harassment said universities\u2019 own computer networks were also vulnerable to abuse. They pointed to a recently leaked report on data security at Warwick University, which found it lacked internet filter software to block students and staff from accessing inappropriate or illegal material. The internal audit of cyber security, seen by the Guardian, also found that IT monitoring at the university, which has been criticised for its handling of a \u201crape chat\u201d scandal, was \u201cnot sufficiently robust to be useful to investigate and treat a cyber security issue\u201d. Andy Phippen, professor of digital rights at Bournemouth University, said the failings identified by the report were unlikely to be limited to Warwick. A freedom of information investigation he undertook last year revealed that most universities lacked adequate policies or procedures to address online harassment. \u201cI\u2019ve seen no evidence of improvement since then,\u201d Phippen said. \u201cThere\u2019s a significant risk of more incidents as universities switch to online education.\u201d Rachel Watters, NUS women\u2019s officer, said: \u201cThe sudden shift to mass online learning on new platforms has revealed weaknesses in policy and practice in relation to online misconduct and harassment. NUS urges institutions to safeguard students and staff using video conferencing, and to hold perpetrators accountable through disciplinary procedures.\u201d A spokeswoman for Universities UK, which represents 137 higher education institutions, said online safeguarding has been a key consideration in the shift to delivering more education online. A Warwick University spokesman said it had invested significant time, effort and resources in the past two years \u2013 and recruited 19 new staff \u2013 to systematically tackling the complex and urgent challenges that information security and data protection posed. He added: \u201cOn online teaching we continue to refine and enhance the security around each initiative that has been developed to introduce more online teaching in these challenging new times.\u201d A Zoom spokesman said it was deeply upset to hear about abuse on the app. \u201cZoom strongly condemns such behaviour and is committed to providing educators with the tools and resources they need on a safe and secure platform,\u201d he said.",

It\u2019s confusing and frightening and raises serious concerns about how the Home Office communicates and shares vital information.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople can\u2019t stay in hotels forever. We need to know how the Home Office plans to accommodate people when lockdown restrictions ease, so charities, local authorities and other partners can support any further moves. We\u2019re also really concerned that people in hotels are not receiving cash support that\u2019s needed for phone top-ups and other essentials.\u201d</p> \n<p>The vast majority of those moved are either new arrivals, some of whom have been in the system for months awaiting decisions on their substantive asylum claim, or those who cannot return to their county of origin because of the pandemic. They were previously receiving financial support either in cash or through a payment card.</p> \n<p>A Mears spokesperson said lockdown measures had severely limited the company\u2019s capacity to utilise short-term let accommodation for new asylum applicants.</p> \n<p>They said: \u201cTherefore we had no alternative but to procure hotel space where we can safely and appropriately house and support each person with food and health services without restriction on time of residence. </p> \n<p>\u201cAll movement of the people concerned was undertaken in accordance with health authority guidance on social distancing and use of PPE. The safety and wellbeing of each person is paramount and Mears are working hard to ensure we meet all obligations at this very difficult time.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Home Office said that accommodation would be reviewed \u201cprior to the end of June\u201d. </p>",

This is to help stop the spread of the virus, protect the NHS and save lives.\u201d But the Guardian has spoken to a number of those who were moved suddenly, on condition of anonymity, as well as outreach workers who say they have significant concerns. They describe their situation as \u201calmost like prison\u201d, with strictly enforced meal collection times and no access to food or drink other than water outside those hours, and some say they cannot open their bedroom windows. One man, S, said he was given 30 minutes to pack up the flat where he had been living since he arrived in Scotland from Saudi Arabia five months ago. \u201cThey didn\u2019t give me any information, but said it was on the orders of the Home Office. Nobody knows how long we will be here.\u201d He added: \u201cEveryone here is feeling bad, and worried about the virus. There is no social distancing in the meals area and all the food is uncovered. I would like to buy some juice or fruit for my room but they told me my [Home Office issued] card won\u2019t work any more.\u201d Another, M, said: \u201cIt\u2019s impossible not to get close to people when you\u2019re in the lift or getting your food, and there are two bottles of hand sanitiser among 80 people. There are many Muslims here and Ramadan begins in two days. The evening meal stops at 8pm, so what happens when we start fasting?\u201d While outreach workers say Mears has promised to make arrangements for those fasting, and to provide prayer mats, none of the asylum seekers to whom the Guardian spoke had been told this. Although the hotels have wifi, support workers point out that without cash, people cannot top up their phones to continue communication with lawyers, or buy extra food or hand sanitiser. Gary Christie, the head of policy at the Scottish Refugee Council, said: \u201cPeople tell us they\u2019ve been moved into hotels at very short notice and without a proper explanation of why they\u2019re being moved, how long for, or what will happen next. It\u2019s confusing and frightening and raises serious concerns about how the Home Office communicates and shares vital information. \u201cPeople can\u2019t stay in hotels forever. We need to know how the Home Office plans to accommodate people when lockdown restrictions ease, so charities, local authorities and other partners can support any further moves. We\u2019re also really concerned that people in hotels are not receiving cash support that\u2019s needed for phone top-ups and other essentials.\u201d The vast majority of those moved are either new arrivals, some of whom have been in the system for months awaiting decisions on their substantive asylum claim, or those who cannot return to their county of origin because of the pandemic. They were previously receiving financial support either in cash or through a payment card. A Mears spokesperson said lockdown measures had severely limited the company\u2019s capacity to utilise short-term let accommodation for new asylum applicants. They said: \u201cTherefore we had no alternative but to procure hotel space where we can safely and appropriately house and support each person with food and health services without restriction on time of residence. \u201cAll movement of the people concerned was undertaken in accordance with health authority guidance on social distancing and use of PPE. The safety and wellbeing of each person is paramount and Mears are working hard to ensure we meet all obligations at this very difficult time.\u201d The Home Office said that accommodation would be reviewed \u201cprior to the end of June\u201d.",

It would therefore be \u201cwholly unrealistic\u201d to think that restrictions would be relaxed any time soon and some \u201cvery socially disruptive\u201d measures would almost certainly have to remain in force for the rest of the year, he said. Whitty added that coronavirus was not going to be eradicated, so we must accept we will be working with it globally for the foreseeable future.</li> \n   <li><strong>We are at the peak of the outbreak, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, told the Commons. </strong>But this was put into further perspective by Chris Whitty at the press briefing, who highlighted that the peak was an \u201cartificial peak\u201d as it was the result of the lockdown. The first secretary of state, Dominic Raab, also reiterated that the biggest risk was a second spike. This all reinforces that an \u201cexit strategy\u201d from physical distancing measures is proving more and more difficult to devise.</li> \n   <li><strong>A contact-tracing system will be in place \u201cin a matter of weeks\u201d, Hancock also said.</strong> He said the effectiveness of \u201ctest, track and trace\u201d every new case as a method rested on the incidence of transmission in the community.</li> \n   <li><strong>The UK\u2019s hospital death toll surpassed 18,000, as a further 759 deaths took the total to 18,100.</strong> The ONS said there had also been 1,043 coronavirus-related deaths in care homes in England and Wales by 10 April. In a joint statement with the CQC, the government conceded that the true number \u201ccould be double\u201d. Chris Whitty also said he thought the ONS figures were \u201can underestimate\u201d. And analysis from the Financial Times suggested the real UK death toll could be as high as 41,000.</li> \n   <li><strong>The EU denied the UK government\u2019s claim that a mix-up was to blame for its non-involvement in its coronavirus procurement scheme.</strong> The European commission said the UK was well aware of the initiative when it decided not to participate, contradicting the government\u2019s claim that it didn\u2019t get involved because of a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d about eligibility. Facing questions from the Commons foreign affairs committee, Sir Simon McDonald, the head of the Foreign Office, said it was a \u201cpolitical decision\u201d, though he later issued a retraction and said non-involvement had been due to a \u201ccommunication problem\u201d. </li> \n   <li><strong>The Welsh government is to fund free \u201cschool meals\u201d for disadvantaged children during the summer holidays.</strong> It is the first UK nation to make such a pledge.</li> \n   <li><strong>And the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, urged the government to ban evictions over rent arrears built up as a result of the coronavirus crisis.</strong> He also called for an increase in housing benefits and that the government should cover, for the duration of the crisis, any shortfall in payments by private renters.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Thank you so much to everyone who got in touch throughout the day with news tips, suggestions, comments and advice.</p> \n  <p>That\u2019s it from us on the UK side, we\u2019ll be back tomorrow to bring you all the latest updates on the pandemic.

On vaccines he said he was \u201cvery hopeful that we will have vaccines which have proof of concept much earlier than a year\u201d. He went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>But there is a long path between having a vaccine that\u2019s proof of concept, and until we have either a vaccine or a drug ... what we will have available to us are social measures.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said the government could not allow the R number, the reproduction number (the rate at which the virus spreads), to get above 1 for any extended period of time.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We cannot allow R, the force of transmission, to go above one for any extended period at any point because, if it does, exponential growth of this will continue, it\u2019ll resume and we will get back to a situation where the NHS could have its emergency services overwhelmed. It does not take very long from where you get from bad numbers to really bad numbers ...</p> \n   <p>What we are trying to work out is what are the things that add up to an R of less than one. That narrows our options quite significantly.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This chart, from<a href=\"https://institute.global/sites/default/files/inline-files/A%20Sustainable%20Exit%20Strategy%2C%20Tony%20Blair%20Institute%20for%20Global%20Change.pdf\"> a report (pdf) </a>published by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change on Monday, illustrates quite how narrow the government\u2019s options are, because it estimates the specific impact on the R number of lifting the various lockdown measures in place.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f9e970563bef083d21ce712440dce9335c542c0\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f9e970563bef083d21ce712440dce9335c542c0/0_0_959_646/500.jpg\" alt=\"Risk of lifting lockdown measures\" width=\"500\" height=\"337\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Risk of lifting lockdown measures</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Blair Institute for Global Change</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Whitty said coronavirus was not going to be eradicated.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This disease is not going to be eradicated, it is not going to disappear so we have to accept that we are working with a disease that we are going to be with globally for the foreseeable future.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that the existence of the new temporary Nightingale hospitals \u201cdoes actually mean that when we are planning forward this does give us a number of options we would not have had if those were not there\u201d.</strong> Whitty did not elaborate, but his remark probably alluded to an option described as \u201crunning hot\u201d in the Sunday Times write-through by <strong>Tim Shipman </strong>and <strong>Caroline Wheeler</strong> at the weekend. Here is an extract from <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/pms-lockdown-dilemma-risk-killing-the-economy-or-thousands-of-people-zk6xrlfhr\">their article (paywall).</a></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Ministers who foresee economic disaster if the lockdown continues believe the NHS has a cushion that can be exploited. \u201cThe debate is now between people who think we should suppress the virus completely and those who think we should run things quite hot, use the spare capacity in the NHS and aim to keep the R number just below one,\u201d one official said.</p> \n   <p>Another senior insider said: \u201cYou have to be clear. Running hot means more people are likely to die. That\u2019s the decision the prime minister will have to take.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Whitty said he thought the ONS figures for coronavirus deaths in care homes were an underestimate. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The numbers that have been ascribed to Covid directly in ONS statistics are still relatively modest. I have said repeatedly, the fact that the ONS said in their last weekly report, 826 deaths, every one of them a tragedy, but I think that could be an underestimate.

Officials, and to a lesser extent ministers, have been signalling it for a while, but Whitty was this afternoon more explicit than anyone else has been about this at these press conferences.</p> \n  <p>Here are his key quotes on this point.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Whitty said that some \u201cvery socially disruptive\u201d measures would almost certainly have to remain in force for the rest of the year.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have to be very realistic if people are hoping it\u2019s suddenly going to move from where we are in lockdown to where suddenly into everything is gone, that is a wholly unrealistic expectation</p> \n   <p>We are going to have to do a lot of things for really quite a long period of time, the question is what is the best package and this is what we\u2019re trying to work out.</p> \n   <p>If you release more on one area, you have to keep on board more of another area so there\u2019s a proper trade-off and this is what ministers are having to consider.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Later he was even more explicit.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In the long run, the exit from this is going to be one of two things, ideally. A vaccine, and there are a variety of ways they can be deployed ... or, and/or, highly effective drugs so that people stop dying of this disease even if they catch it, or which can prevent this disease in vulnerable people.</p> \n   <p>Until we have those, and the probability of having those any time in the next calendar year are incredibly small and I think we should be realistic about that.</p> \n   <p>We\u2019re going to have to rely on other social measures, which of course are very socially disruptive as everyone is finding at the moment.</p> \n   <p>But until that point, that is what we will have to do but it will be the best combination that maximises the outlooks but it\u2019s going to take a long time and I think we need to be aware of that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>I will post a full summary from the press conference soon.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f88d2fb32c06b5eb0043adc2e47cee9bc308bb66\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f88d2fb32c06b5eb0043adc2e47cee9bc308bb66/0_4_3317_1991/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prof Chris Whitty at the press conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prof Chris Whitty at the press conference.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Parsons/10 Downing Street/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T17:25:23.532Z\">at 6.25pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea07a8b8f084784dca58159\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jamie-grierson\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T17:11:36.024Z\">6.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The increase in confirmed cases of Covid-19 in prisons in England and Wales appears to have slowed, daily figures have shown.</p> \n  <p>There were 294 confirmed cases of the coronavirus among prisoners in 66 prisons, a 2% rise in 24 hours, the lowest increase in cases since the <strong>Ministry of Justice </strong>started releasing the figures.

But the government did not implement that for another three and a half weeks, he said. He said that showed the government was not following scientific advice - a claim <strong>Dominic Raab,</strong> the foreign secretary and first secretary of state rejected.</p> \n  <p>Gardiner was referring to <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/873723/03-potential-effect-of-non-pharmaceutical-interventions-npis-on-a-Covid-19-epidemic-in-the-UK.pdf\">this paper (pdf)</a>, one of several Sage papers published <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/scientific-advisory-group-for-emergencies-sage-coronavirus-covid-19-response\">in a batch</a> when the government was under pressure to reveal the scientific advice it was getting.</p> \n  <p>The document does indeed show that the government has failed to follow the scientific advice (or at least the advice set out by Sage in that 26 February). However, it shows the scientists arguing <em>against</em> the hard lockdown measures subsequently announced by Boris Johnson on 23 March.</p> \n  <p>Here is the key extract. (I\u2019ve added the bold type, to highlight the key passage.)</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In the event of a pandemic, without action, the NHS will be unable to meet all demands placed on it. Demand on beds is likely to overtake supply well before the peak is reached. Any interventions that could delay the peak, and/or reduce the size of the peak, whilst increasing the duration of the pandemic, are likely to be helpful, provided the pandemic is not extended into the late autumn/winter.</p> \n   <p>Any of the measures listed below could potentially flatten the peak of the epidemic and extend it to some extent. A combination of measures would be expected to have a greater impact, but the impacts are not strictly additive. SPI-M-O [the scientific pandemic influenza group on modelling] believes that combining all four measures, as a long-term policy, might have a similar impact to that seen in Hong Kong or mainland China - reducing the reproduction number to around 1. <strong>However, this would result in a large second epidemic once measures were lifted. Implementing a subset of measures (eg, the first three) would be expected to have a more moderate impact - still substantially reducing peak incidence, while making a second wave of infection in autumn less likely. This might be the preferred outcome for the NHS.</strong></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The four interventions were, in order: school closures; home isolation for people with symptoms; voluntary household quarantine when someone in a family has symptoms, and \u201csocial distancing\u201d (described as people reducing contacts outside the home and workplace by 75%).</p> \n  <p>The document does not call for any of these measures to be introduced immediately. And it stresses that ultimately what should happen is a \u201cpolitical decision\u201d, although the paragraph quoted above clearly implies that at that point the Sage scientists favoured measures 1 to 3, but not 4 (social distancing).</p> \n  <p>In the same document they argue that there might be advantages to allowing \u201cthe majority of the population ... [to] develop immunity, hopefully preventing any second wave, while reducing pressure on the NHS\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Johnson did reject this proposal. He abandoned \u201cherd immunity\u201d (the concept endorsed here) and opted for a hard lockdown that went much further than the \u201csocial distancing\u201d plan outlined in this document.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea067a78f08a1178d5afce0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/carolinedavies\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T15:52:49.244Z\">4.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Buckingham Palace</strong> has announced the postponement of investitures due to be held in June and that the annual Garter Day service at Windsor Castle has been cancelled.</p> \n  <p>In a statement, the palace said this was \u201cfor practical reasons in the current circumstances\u201d.

Snap verdict</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>That was Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s first outing as Labour leader at PMQs, but just as importantly this marked the debut for a whole new way of running this question session: a \u201chybrid\u201d system, with most MPs participating by Zoom. Both probably amount to a distinct improvement on what came before.</p> \n  <p>First, the process. On a technical level it mostly worked well. One MP did not manage to dial in in time, and another got cut off early. But overall it went smoothly.</p> \n  <p>More importantly, PMQs without 400-odd MPs in the chamber makes everything quieter, calmer, more intelligible and more grown-up. For once the proceedings sounded like the question time sessions that take place in the Scottish parliament and the Welsh assembly. Without the jeering and the aggro, it lacked gladiatorial edge, and frankly it was probably a bit more boring than the old PMQs. But boring is a much underrated virtue in governance. It will be be very interesting to see whether the Commons ever reverts to how it operated before when (or more probably if) this is all over.</p> \n  <p>In the old PMQs, MPs worked on the assumption that there was always a \u201cwinner\u201d. (Journalists like me wrote it up in those terms too, because that was how the participants viewed the proceedings.) Under Zoom PMQs it is much harder to imagine anyone \u201cwinning\u201d old-style, but if Labour had to choose someone well-suited to parliament in serious/boring mode, it is hard to imagine anyone better than Starmer, and he will chalk today\u2019s outing up, not as a triumph, but certainly as a success. His questions were clear, forensic and focused, he avoided bland or trite sloganising and he adopted a measured tone consistent with responsible, constructive opposition. Quite what the public will make of this when the alternative is Boris Johnson remains to be seen, but high-grade seriousness is what Starmer offered in the Labour leadership contest and it is what he delivered today.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T13:11:18.364Z\">at 2.11pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea02e288f0898fe360d5f5e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T11:46:25.468Z\">12.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Deaths in Scotland rise by 77 to 1,062</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A total of 1,062 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for Covid-19, up by 77 from 985 on Tuesday, the first minister, <strong>Nicola Sturgeon,</strong> said.</p> \n  <p>The figures are lower than the 1,616 deaths given earlier by the National Records of Scotland <em>(see 12.22pm)</em> as they do not include suspected and probable coronavirus infections.</p> \n  <p>Sturgeon said 9,038 people had now tested positive for the virus in Scotland, up by 366 from 8,672 the day before.</p> \n  <p>There were 155 people in intensive care with coronavirus or coronavirus symptoms, a decrease of 11 from Tuesday, she added.</p> \n  <p>There were 1,776 people in hospital with confirmed or suspected Covid-19, down from 1,866 yesterday.</p> \n  <p>And since 5 March, 1,813 patients who tested positive have been discharged from hospital.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T12:06:53.856Z\">at 1.06pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea02c0d8f084784dca57d77\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T11:36:44.820Z\">12.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>James Sunderland,</strong> a Conservative, asks Raab what are the ingredients that will take the country through this.</p> \n  <p>Raab says the critical ingredient is for the country to come together.

      "bodyText": "Social distancing is likely to be needed until a vaccine is available for Covid-19, according to the chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty. He told the daily news briefing he was hopeful for a vaccine within a year but there is a long way to go between having a vaccine and widespread immunity. It would therefore be \u201cwholly unrealistic\u201d to think that restrictions would be relaxed any time soon and some \u201cvery socially disruptive\u201d measures would almost certainly have to remain in force for the rest of the year, he said. Whitty added that coronavirus was not going to be eradicated, so we must accept we will be working with it globally for the foreseeable future. We are at the peak of the outbreak, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, told the Commons. But this was put into further perspective by Chris Whitty at the press briefing, who highlighted that the peak was an \u201cartificial peak\u201d as it was the result of the lockdown. The first secretary of state, Dominic Raab, also reiterated that the biggest risk was a second spike. This all reinforces that an \u201cexit strategy\u201d from physical distancing measures is proving more and more difficult to devise. A contact-tracing system will be in place \u201cin a matter of weeks\u201d, Hancock also said. He said the effectiveness of \u201ctest, track and trace\u201d every new case as a method rested on the incidence of transmission in the community. The UK\u2019s hospital death toll surpassed 18,000, as a further 759 deaths took the total to 18,100. The ONS said there had also been 1,043 coronavirus-related deaths in care homes in England and Wales by 10 April. In a joint statement with the CQC, the government conceded that the true number \u201ccould be double\u201d. Chris Whitty also said he thought the ONS figures were \u201can underestimate\u201d. And analysis from the Financial Times suggested the real UK death toll could be as high as 41,000. The EU denied the UK government\u2019s claim that a mix-up was to blame for its non-involvement in its coronavirus procurement scheme. The European commission said the UK was well aware of the initiative when it decided not to participate, contradicting the government\u2019s claim that it didn\u2019t get involved because of a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d about eligibility. Facing questions from the Commons foreign affairs committee, Sir Simon McDonald, the head of the Foreign Office, said it was a \u201cpolitical decision\u201d, though he later issued a retraction and said non-involvement had been due to a \u201ccommunication problem\u201d. The Welsh government is to fund free \u201cschool meals\u201d for disadvantaged children during the summer holidays. It is the first UK nation to make such a pledge. And the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, urged the government to ban evictions over rent arrears built up as a result of the coronavirus crisis. He also called for an increase in housing benefits and that the government should cover, for the duration of the crisis, any shortfall in payments by private renters. Thank you so much to everyone who got in touch throughout the day with news tips, suggestions, comments and advice. That\u2019s it from us on the UK side, we\u2019ll be back tomorrow to bring you all the latest updates on the pandemic. But in the meantime you can continue to follow the Guardian\u2019s coverage of the worldwide picture over on the global live blog. Dominic Raab was chairing that press conference, but in news terms it was dominated by Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser. Here are the main points from what he said, with some analysis. Whitty said that some \u201cvery socially disruptive\u201d measures would almost certainly have to remain in force for the rest of the year. (See 6.22pm.) He stressed that it would take a long time to get vaccine development and production to a stage where it would be able to be used to protect the bulk of the population. That was why social distancing measures would apply for so long, he explained. On vaccines he said he was \u201cvery hopeful that we will have vaccines which have proof of concept much earlier than a year\u201d. He went on: But there is a long path between having a vaccine that\u2019s proof of concept, and until we have either a vaccine or a drug ... what we will have available to us are social measures. He said the government could not allow the R number, the reproduction number (the rate at which the virus spreads), to get above 1 for any extended period of time. He said: We cannot allow R, the force of transmission, to go above one for any extended period at any point because, if it does, exponential growth of this will continue, it\u2019ll resume and we will get back to a situation where the NHS could have its emergency services overwhelmed. It does not take very long from where you get from bad numbers to really bad numbers ... What we are trying to work out is what are the things that add up to an R of less than one. That narrows our options quite significantly. This chart, from a report (pdf) published by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change on Monday, illustrates quite how narrow the government\u2019s options are, because it estimates the specific impact on the R number of lifting the various lockdown measures in place. Whitty said coronavirus was not going to be eradicated. He said: This disease is not going to be eradicated, it is not going to disappear so we have to accept that we are working with a disease that we are going to be with globally for the foreseeable future. He said that the existence of the new temporary Nightingale hospitals \u201cdoes actually mean that when we are planning forward this does give us a number of options we would not have had if those were not there\u201d. Whitty did not elaborate, but his remark probably alluded to an option described as \u201crunning hot\u201d in the Sunday Times write-through by Tim Shipman and Caroline Wheeler at the weekend. Here is an extract from their article (paywall). Ministers who foresee economic disaster if the lockdown continues believe the NHS has a cushion that can be exploited. \u201cThe debate is now between people who think we should suppress the virus completely and those who think we should run things quite hot, use the spare capacity in the NHS and aim to keep the R number just below one,\u201d one official said. Another senior insider said: \u201cYou have to be clear. Running hot means more people are likely to die. That\u2019s the decision the prime minister will have to take.\u201d Whitty said he thought the ONS figures for coronavirus deaths in care homes were an underestimate. He said: The numbers that have been ascribed to Covid directly in ONS statistics are still relatively modest. I have said repeatedly, the fact that the ONS said in their last weekly report, 826 deaths, every one of them a tragedy, but I think that could be an underestimate. What we need to look at, in these data and other data, if we want to get a true picture, is - and I\u2019ve said this right from the beginning - is the all-cause, seasonally adjusted mortality over time. And that is because, as I\u2019ve said here before, deaths from Covid will be a combination of direct deaths from the virus, and also indirect deaths, if for example people are nervous about going into hospital. He said coronavirus was peaking, but that it was an \u201cartificial peak\u201d, because it was the product of the lockdown. He said that the public should not expect the number of Covid-19 deaths to \u201cfall away\u201d suddenly. As he presented a new graph (see below) he said: It is important for people to fully understand that ... even in those countries which started their epidemic curve earlier than in the UK, and which are still ahead, the downward slope from the point which we change is a relatively slow one. We should anticipate the same situation in the UK. We should not expect this to be a sudden fall away of cases. The most striking thing from that press conference was what Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, said about the so-called \u201cexit strategy\u201d from the lockdown. Downing Street has reportedly banned the use of the term \u201cexit strategy\u201d from its planning. That is because it is getting harder to see how there will be any firm exit from some aspects of social distancing for quite a long time to come. Officials, and to a lesser extent ministers, have been signalling it for a while, but Whitty was this afternoon more explicit than anyone else has been about this at these press conferences. Here are his key quotes on this point. Whitty said that some \u201cvery socially disruptive\u201d measures would almost certainly have to remain in force for the rest of the year. He said: We have to be very realistic if people are hoping it\u2019s suddenly going to move from where we are in lockdown to where suddenly into everything is gone, that is a wholly unrealistic expectation We are going to have to do a lot of things for really quite a long period of time, the question is what is the best package and this is what we\u2019re trying to work out. If you release more on one area, you have to keep on board more of another area so there\u2019s a proper trade-off and this is what ministers are having to consider. Later he was even more explicit. In the long run, the exit from this is going to be one of two things, ideally. A vaccine, and there are a variety of ways they can be deployed ... or, and/or, highly effective drugs so that people stop dying of this disease even if they catch it, or which can prevent this disease in vulnerable people. Until we have those, and the probability of having those any time in the next calendar year are incredibly small and I think we should be realistic about that. We\u2019re going to have to rely on other social measures, which of course are very socially disruptive as everyone is finding at the moment. But until that point, that is what we will have to do but it will be the best combination that maximises the outlooks but it\u2019s going to take a long time and I think we need to be aware of that. I will post a full summary from the press conference soon. The increase in confirmed cases of Covid-19 in prisons in England and Wales appears to have slowed, daily figures have shown. There were 294 confirmed cases of the coronavirus among prisoners in 66 prisons, a 2% rise in 24 hours, the lowest increase in cases since the Ministry of Justice started releasing the figures. There are around 81,500 prisoners in England and Wales across 117 prisons. The number of prison staff infected rose by 6% in the same period to 231 workers across 55 prisons, slower than recent increases among the prison staff population. At least 15 prisoners are known to have contracted Covid-19 and died. The figures reflect the total number of recorded positive cases of Covid-19 and include individuals who have recovered. The Prison Service is to temporarily release up to 4,000 inmates who are within two months of their release date, as well as build 500 cells within the existing prison estate to increase single-cell occupancy. Nicola Sturgeon said she was increasingly optimistic Scotland has passed the peak in cases after \u201creally encouraging\u201d data showed a continuing fall in hospital admissions and intensive care cases. The number of intensive care patients in Scotland fell for the seventh day running to 155, the lowest number since 1 April. Covid-19 hospital admissions by ambulance fell to 156 on Tuesday, the lowest level since 18 March, down from a peak of 363 on 6 April. Sturgeon said: These figures for hospital admissions and admissions to intensive care are really encouraging and they\u2019re cause for optimism \u2013 still cautious optimism \u2013 but optimism nevertheless. The first minister warned, however, it was too early to start relaxing the strict lockdown and social isolation rules. The progress is definitely there but it\u2019s fragile at this stage, so any easing up that will very quickly send all of that into reverse. After disclosing 77 further deaths were recorded in hospitals over the last 24 hours, taking Scotland\u2019s hospitals fatalities total to 1,062, Sturgeon said she believed the number of fatalities would start to fall \u201cvery soon\u201d. She admitted, however, she was distressed by new data showing a sharp 60% increase in care homes deaths last week. The National Records of Scotland said 1,616 people had died from confirmed or suspected Covid-19 by Sunday in hospitals or in the community since the start of the outbreak. By last Sunday a third of those, 537, had died in residential homes, echoing the experience in other parts of Europe. The same data last week showed 25% of deaths occurred in care homes. Opposition parties said those figures raised challenging questions about whether enough had been done to prevent the virus overwhelming care homes. Residents\u2019 families claim in some cases GPs have refused to send ill patients to hospital or refused to visit care homes. Sturgeon and Jeane Freeman, the Scottish health secretary, said extra emergency measures were being introduced, including extra deliveries of gowns and masks, and setting up an NHS rapid reaction unit. But they said care homes had been told in March to introduce strict isolation and shielding protocols for their residents, and it was the homes\u2019 responsibility to ensure staff were properly trained and equipped. Pharmacists have voiced growing concerns about contracting Covid-19 at work due to lack of PPE and difficulties maintaining physical distancing. Some said vital community dispensaries may be forced to close if the risk of infection became too great, and that more than \u201cwarm words\u201d were needed to keep staff safe. A survey conducted by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society (RPS) found that almost over a third (34%) of respondents were still unable to access continuous supplies of PPE, and almost 95% said they could not maintain the recommended two-metre distance from colleagues, due to the size of their workplace. The RPS said there should be \u201cno compromise\u201d when it came to the safety of its staff. Ash Soni, who owns Copes pharmacy in Streatham, south-west London, told the PA news agency he had been forced to pay for PPE supplies personally and questioned why he was not considered \u201cfront-line enough\u201d to be given access to sufficient equipment. Others warned that if dispensaries were forced to close, entire communities could lose out. Raj Matharu, a locum pharmacist in Bexleyheath, south-east London, told PA that local pharmacies needed to remain open as they were in the \u201cunique position\u201d to serve deprived communities. And Ade Williams, a pharmacist in Bristol, told PA local people had donated masks and gloves in a show of support to staff putting themselves at risk. He said: You\u2019re trying to do your best and in the back of your mind you\u2019re thinking \u2018I feel very vulnerable doing this. RPS president Sandra Gidley said: Pharmacy teams are essential in the battle against this pandemic and patients are depending on us more than ever. Teams must be safeguarded if pharmacy services are going to be able to continue to function. It is essential the government steps up and provides sufficient PPE to enable pharmacists to face the realities of working in a pharmacy during the pandemic. There were bound to be some teething problems when it came to realising parliament via Zoom \u2013 and who better than senior politicians to demonstrate how not to do it. During a virtual plenary session with up to 28 Assembly Members, the Welsh health minister Vaughan Gething made a major boo-boo when he forgot his microphone was on and launched into a rant about fellow Labour AM Jenny Rathbone. Gething dropped a certain four-letter word as he criticised his colleague, who had asked a question after his finishing statement. The Llywydd, Elin Jones, swiftly weighed in: I think the Vaughan Gething needs to turn his microphone off. Vaughan Gething needs to turn his microphone off. The meeting had to be paused after the incident. The reactions speak for themselves. The blooper called into question Gething\u2019s professionalism and Plaid Cymru called for the minister to resign claiming he does not have the \u201cright attitude, skills or temperament\u201d. Writing of his feeling \u201cobviously embarrassed\u201d over the incident later on Twitter, the minister said he had reached out to Rathbone to apologise. Q: Could the lockdown measures be lifted early in somewhere like Bristol? Raab says it would be counter-productive, or dangerous, if the government eased up on the restrictions too early. And that\u2019s it. The press conference is over. Q: Matt Hancock says the UK has reached the peak. Does that cover places like Bristol, where cases are lower? Or will it peak later? And will its Nightingale hospital still be needed? Whitty says the south-west has has probably the least impact from Covid. That applies to care homes too, he says. But he says this is not the natural peak of an epidemic without the government doing anything. It is a peak generated by the lockdown. So it is an artificial peak. He says this means you would expect the peak to hit everywhere at about the same time. On the Nightingale hospitals, he says that has created new capacity. That means the government has more options as it plans ahead. The NHS is going to be under pressure from Covid \u201cfor really quite a long period of time\u201d, he says. Q: Will you rely on this new app for contact tracing? Or are you going to use other techniques too? Raab says two things will help the government as it moves to the next phase: getting the infection level down, and testing with contact tracing. Whitty says they will be doing a lot more population testing, so that they find out at the earliest point if the R is heading above 1 in any part of the country. Q: What about people who do not have a smartphone, or do not want to use the app? Raab says the public would expect the government to innovate. Whitty says he is very hopeful that they get vaccines with \u201cproof of concept\u201d well within a year. But there is a long way to go between having a vaccine, or a drug, and widespread immunity, he suggests. That is why social distancing measures are so vital, he says. Whitty says, until a vaccine is available, the government will have to rely on social distancing measures. Raab rules out publishing the findings of the government exercise a few years ago that modelled a pandemic of this sort. Q: Sage have looked again at masks, and we are told that wearing maks would be a good idea for people who are asymptomatic. What is your advice to people going out tomorrow? Raab says Sage always looks at the evolving evidence. He says it has not come back with new advice yet. When it does, the government will look at it. Q: What work are you doing on lifting the restrictions, and avoiding a second peak? Whitty says the government cannot allow the R, the reproduction number, to go above 1 for any sustained period of time. That would lead to exponential growth. And it would not be long before you moved from \u201cbad numbers to really bad numbers\u201d, with the NHS at risk of being overwhelmed. He says this disease will not be eradicated. So it will be with us for the foreseeable future. He says it is \u201cwholly unrealistic\u201d to think that the restrictions will be largely relaxed any time soon. The government will have to maintain a lot of measures for a long period of time, he says. Q: Does R have to go well beyond 1, or just slightly below 1? Whitty says getting it below 1 is essential, But there are other ways in which coronavirus could harm people\u2019s health. What optimises outcomes for one group (ie, those who die directly) might not optimise it for those in other groups (ie, those who might die because other health procedures are being affected). Whitty says the government does not yet have an antibody test that is as good as they want. This is critical. He is hoping they will soon have a test that wil give them a \u201cranging shot\u201d as to what proportion of people, of different ages and in different parts of the country, have had the virus. Q: Are you underusing the MoD? Raab says the government is always considering what more can be done. It has to deploy resources where they are most useful. Carter says the MoD has deployed all the personnel it needs to deploy. Q: Will the armed forces be more involved in drive-through centres? Carter says the armed forces are trying to design the right sort of testing model. That is why they have tried mobile \u201cpop-ups\u201d. Some really good people are working on this. Q: When will PPE shortages be resolved. A day? A week? Or can\u2019t you say? Whitty says he is not an international procurement expert. So he is saying what he is told, he says. He says the NHS has been \u201ctight\u201d for different items at different times. At a national level we are not under water for anything, that I am aware of. But there may be \u201clocal issues\u201d, he says. To promise that in two or three days this would all be sorted would be a mistake, he says. He says the government is trying to manage this as best it can. Q: Matt Hancock said we have reached the peak. Is there light at the end of the tunnel? Will some measures be eased on 7 May? Raab says there is light at the end of the tunnel. But we are not there yet. We are at the peak, he says. Q: The Irish PM has said he will give the Irish people at least a roadmap for exiting the lockdown. Can\u2019t you at least give people some idea of what is planned? Raab says he has set out the five tests for easing the lockdown. The government needs more data, he says. Q: The TSSA transport union has been told to prepare for more people using the rail service between 11 and 18 May. Is that when the lockdown might be eased? Raab says he does not recognise those figures. He says it would be a mistake to take the eye of the ball at this point. That is not a government timetable, he says. He says he does not know where the union got those dates. Q: Why should foreign workers have to pay a surcharge for NHS use? Raab says the home secretary has already outlined measures to ensure that foreign workers have their interests protected. Q: There are figures suggesting a doubling of care home deaths. (See 1.19pm) Is that inevitable? Raab says he does not see anything as inevitable. Whitty says the CQC figures have not been published yet. But he says he expects to see a high mortality rate for care homes. The people in care homes are a very vulnerable group, he says. Whitty is now presenting the daily slides. First, the transport one. Whitty say this is a proxy for compliance with the lockdown. Here are the hospital figures numbers. Whitty says they are either stable or improving (in London). Carter is speaking now. He says he has been asked to give an update on what the armed forces are doing. They have concentrated on supporting the \u201cheroic\u201d frontline NHS staff, operating with \u201chumility\u201d, he says. He says there is an established system for using the military to provide help to the civilian authorities. He says decision-making is decentralised. That has proved \u201cextraordinarily successful\u201d, he says. He says this has been the single biggest logistical challenge the MoD has faced in his 40 years of service. He quotes figures highlighting what has been involved. The armed forces are also in involved in testing, both in designing the tests, manning the test centres and providing innovative initiatives, like mobile testing. The armed forces have helped with repatriation. And its 77 Brigade (its cyber warfare component) has been involved in tackling disinformation, he says. As an example, he cites a reservist, a major who works for Google\u2019s supply network in his day job. He has been involved in designing the coronavirus distribution effort. Carter says the armed forces are still defending the UK, and are still involved in operations abroad. He says 99-year-old Capt Tom Moore illustrates the sense of service everyone in the armed forces shares. Raab says there have been problems. But he says he has been on the phone every day pursuing PPE deliveries from abroad. As the government works with partners to get PPE, it is also working with other countries to bring home stranded Britons. Over 13,000 people have been brought home on charter flights, he says. Raab pays tribute to the work of the armed forces. He says people used to joke in this country that the UK could never build a hospital as quickly as the Chinese built theirs. But, with the help of the military, the UK built not just one, but seven, he says. Raab summarises the government\u2019s strategy. It has been tough going, he says, for businesses, for families and for vulnerable people. It has been a mental strain on people too, he says. We are making progress through the peak of this virus, he says. But we are not out of the woods yet. He says the biggest risk is a second spike. He says the government has set out the five conditions that must apply before the government moves to the next phase. Raab starts by reading out the latest testing and mortality figures. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, is holding the daily government press conference. He is appearing with Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, and Gen Sir Nick Carter, the chief of the defence staff (ie, the head of the armed forces). It is the first time Carter has appeared at one of these press conferences. An increasing number of Premier League clubs are actively discussing the possibility of bringing the season to an early end, with concerns growing over the feasibility of a return even behind closed doors. The league is suspended indefinitely and, last week, a meeting of the 20 clubs reaffirmed the intention to complete the season when it is \u201csafe and appropriate\u201d. However, the Guardian has spoken to clubs who have raised a range of concerns, the most immediate of which is a fear over the medical safety of playing a full contact sport while there is the risk of contracting Covid-19. The full story is here. During PMQs (see 12.30pm) the Labour MP Barry Gardiner (who briefly considered standing for the leadership) said the government\u2019s scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) recommended an urgent lockdown to save lives on 26 February. But the government did not implement that for another three and a half weeks, he said. He said that showed the government was not following scientific advice - a claim Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state rejected. Gardiner was referring to this paper (pdf), one of several Sage papers published in a batch when the government was under pressure to reveal the scientific advice it was getting. The document does indeed show that the government has failed to follow the scientific advice (or at least the advice set out by Sage in that 26 February). However, it shows the scientists arguing against the hard lockdown measures subsequently announced by Boris Johnson on 23 March. Here is the key extract. (I\u2019ve added the bold type, to highlight the key passage.) In the event of a pandemic, without action, the NHS will be unable to meet all demands placed on it. Demand on beds is likely to overtake supply well before the peak is reached. Any interventions that could delay the peak, and/or reduce the size of the peak, whilst increasing the duration of the pandemic, are likely to be helpful, provided the pandemic is not extended into the late autumn/winter. Any of the measures listed below could potentially flatten the peak of the epidemic and extend it to some extent. A combination of measures would be expected to have a greater impact, but the impacts are not strictly additive. SPI-M-O [the scientific pandemic influenza group on modelling] believes that combining all four measures, as a long-term policy, might have a similar impact to that seen in Hong Kong or mainland China - reducing the reproduction number to around 1. However, this would result in a large second epidemic once measures were lifted. Implementing a subset of measures (eg, the first three) would be expected to have a more moderate impact - still substantially reducing peak incidence, while making a second wave of infection in autumn less likely. This might be the preferred outcome for the NHS. The four interventions were, in order: school closures; home isolation for people with symptoms; voluntary household quarantine when someone in a family has symptoms, and \u201csocial distancing\u201d (described as people reducing contacts outside the home and workplace by 75%). The document does not call for any of these measures to be introduced immediately. And it stresses that ultimately what should happen is a \u201cpolitical decision\u201d, although the paragraph quoted above clearly implies that at that point the Sage scientists favoured measures 1 to 3, but not 4 (social distancing). In the same document they argue that there might be advantages to allowing \u201cthe majority of the population ... [to] develop immunity, hopefully preventing any second wave, while reducing pressure on the NHS\u201d. Johnson did reject this proposal. He abandoned \u201cherd immunity\u201d (the concept endorsed here) and opted for a hard lockdown that went much further than the \u201csocial distancing\u201d plan outlined in this document. Buckingham Palace has announced the postponement of investitures due to be held in June and that the annual Garter Day service at Windsor Castle has been cancelled. In a statement, the palace said this was \u201cfor practical reasons in the current circumstances\u201d. It added: Events of this nature often involve considerable planning for attendees. Mindful of current government advice, we have taken this decision to eliminate any uncertainty for guests due to attend. Garter Day involves a grand procession of garter knights in ceremonial dress walking through Windsor Castle grounds to the service, accompanied by a marching band, and is a colourful highlight of the royal year. It takes place the day before Royal Ascot. Ascot Racecourse has already announced the \u201cdifficult but unavoidable\u201d decision not to hold Royal Ascot (16-20 June) as an event open to the public. The race meeting is one of the highlights of the Queen\u2019s calendar. Organisers are examining if there is a way to run the Royal Ascot races behind closed doors. There have been a further eight deaths of patients in Northern Ireland who tested positive for Covid-19, the Public Health Agency has said. The eight, along with a number of other deaths in previous days that have now been added to the official record, brings the total who have died with coronavirus in the region to 250, the agency added. Labour says it has been approached by 36 British companies who say they have offered to help the government with the supply of PPE (personal protective equipment) and who say they have not had a reply. According to Labour, the 36 include: Issa Exchange Ltd in Birmingham that told Labour it offered a quarter of a million aprons and masks. Network Medical Products in Ripon, which says it can provide 100,000 face visors per week. CQM Learning, which says it can provide 8,000 face shields per day. In an open letter to Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, his Labour shadow, Rachel Reeves, has given details of all 36 companies (some of whom have asked not to be named). She told Gove: You and your officials and those at the Department for Health and Social Care will be best placed to validate what capability and capacity these firms have, but as they have not received a reply after contacting the government, I wanted to ensure that the Cabinet Office was aware of them. Of these firms, if just one, five or 10 were able to contribute to the national effort of ensuring that our NHS and care workers \u2013 and indeed anybody who needs to use some form of personal protective equipment and clothing \u2013 could be better protected, or just one hospital or care home were able to access adequate supplies of the PPE they need, I know you will agree that that would go a long way and make a big difference. Prince Charles has urged the world to reshape and reset towards a \u201cgreen recovery\u201d and more sustainable future once the coronavirus crisis has passed. In a message to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, he said the slowdown of human and industrial activity during the pandemic showed how quickly the Earth could heal itself, highlighting improved air quality in some of the world\u2019s major cities and the return of wildlife to communities and waterways. He added: I can only hope that as this current crisis passes we are able to reflect on, and shape, the type of world we want for ourselves and for future generations. Together, I am confident that we can use this crisis to reset our course by putting people and planet first. Hundreds of people have become homeless during the coronavirus lockdown, the mayor of Greater Manchester has said. Speaking at a weekly briefing on the region\u2019s response to the pandemic on Wednesday, Andy Burnham said 344 people had been recorded as newly homeless and requiring accommodation since the strict restrictions were implemented. He added that the Greater Manchester combined authority had helped 1,140 homeless people to be housed safely during the crisis but 115 people were still sleeping rough in the region. He said: There are people coming on to the streets through this who perhaps are finding their arrangements, possibly a sofa-surfing arrangement, has broken down. But also, frustratingly for us, on the latest figures we are still seeing people released from prison to no fixed address and that is adding to the problem. Evictions, in some cases, haven\u2019t stopped completely, so we are seeing people coming on to the street as a result of the Covid-19 crisis. Burnham said government funding was only available to provide support for pre-identified homeless people during the pandemic, but those who were newly homeless did not qualify. He added: There should be a positive legacy for homelessness coming out of this but if the government sticks to the position that it\u2019s in, that will become more and more difficult to achieve. In the latest episode of our Science Weekly podcast, the Guardian\u2019s health editor, Sarah Boseley, speaks to Dr Dipesh Patel about the effects of Covid-19 on people with diabetes, including the role that glucose levels and a high BMI might play. Have a listen here. Downing Street has rejected suggestions that Sir Simon McDonald, the head of the Foreign Office, was pressurised into withdrawing his statement to a select committee yesterday saying the government took a political decision not to participate in the EU\u2019s ventilator procurement scheme. Asked who put pressure on McDonald, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cNobody.\u201d Asked to explain McDonald\u2019s surprise decision to issue a statement saying that his original evidence had been based on a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d (see 9.37am), the spokesman said: There was obviously quite a lot of pickup of what he had said by the time he had left that committee [hearing] and it\u2019s important that select committees are given accurate information and that\u2019s why he corrected what he said. The government\u2019s current position is that it failed to take part in the EU procurement scheme because of a communications error, which meant ministers were not aware of the opportunity available. As my colleague Daniel Boffey reports, the European commission has challenged this account, saying the UK was well aware of what was on offer. But, as the Guardian reported last month, before the government started arguing that the UK did not participate in the scheme because of a communications problem (one source claimed the problem was to do with emails being missed), Downing Street said it was not taking part in the scheme because the UK was \u201cno longer a member [of the EU]\u201d and was \u201cmaking our own efforts\u201d. The health of construction workers is being \u201cthreatened by watered-down advice\u201d on physical distancing on building sites, Unite has said. The union said the latest guidance being given to building workers \u2013 issued to coincide with a return to work at a large number of sites this week, particularly in the London area \u2013 was unsafe and placed them at unnecessary risk. The guidance now states that where workers are required to work within two metres of each other, they should \u201cwork side by side, or facing away from each other, rather than face to face\u201d, the union said. When this is not possible and workers have to work \u201cface to face\u201d within two metres of each other, workers should \u201ckeep this to 15 minutes or less where possible\u201d. Unite has written to the business secretary, Alok Sharma, warning that workers\u2019 lives are being endangered and asking that the \u201cdefective procedures\u201d be withdrawn immediately. The union has also launched a hotline so that workers can report concerns and provide evidence of unsafe working practices. Unite national officer Jerry Swain said: We sincerely hope that this is not a case of the economy being put before the health of construction workers and their families. Unite\u2019s position remains unchanged: no site should be working unless it can do so safely and that means two-metre social distancing must be maintained at all times. Contractors and clients also have a moral duty of care for workers from when they leave their home to when they return. Construction workers should not be forced to use overcrowded public transport, potentially endangering their health and that of our key workers. If our members believe their health is being directly compromised, they should stop work and seek the assistance of Unite. Liz Truss, the women and equalities minister (and international trade secretary), has dismissed concerns over the number of female ministers leading the daily Downing Street coronavirus press conference as \u201ctokenism\u201d. At a committee hearing this morning, Truss said \u201cexcessive focus\u201d on the gender of the politician leading the televised briefing \u201cdoes a disservice to women\u201d. Our colleague Frances Perraudin has the full story. There have now been 309,000 applications for the government to pay the wages of furloughed staff through its coronavirus job retention scheme, Downing Street has said. That means 2.2m workers could benefit, it says. The scheme opened on Monday. Hundreds of asylum seekers in Glasgow have been given less than an hour\u2019s notice to pack up their flats before being moved into city centre hotels, where they claim social distancing is \u201cimpossible\u201d, our colleague Libby Brooks reports. The day after announcing limited prisoner release to ease pressure in Scotland\u2019s jails, the justice secretary, Humza Yousaf, has been challenged on emergency amendments that extend 24-hour-a-day detention and lift requirements for clean clothes. The head of the Scottish Human Rights Commission, Judith Robertson, and the Scottish prisons inspector, Wendy Sinclair, met Yousaf earlier today to raise significant human rights concerns about the amendments to prison rules. Robertson told the Guardian: According to the new rules, prisoners who are self-isolating in their cells are there 24 hours a day, for up to 14 days, potentially more if they are sharing a cell with someone who becomes symptomatic. That 24-hours-a-day detention excludes exercise or use of telephone or shower. The amendments also lift the requirement to provide nutritious food and drink to meet religious needs or to provide clean socks and underwear daily and clean clothes as often as is necessary. We are particularly concerned that the guidance to governors does not include the statement that these changes should only be applied in extreme circumstances. The pair also raised issues around oversight and scrutiny, as well as inconsistent practice around different prisons. There are already serious concerns about prisoners\u2019 wellbeing after family visits were suspended and exercise and other activities severely restricted because of social distancing. The Scottish government announced plans to provide phones in cells last week, with some necessary security restrictions. The Department for Health and Social Care has just published the latest daily UK coronavirus hospital death figures. There have been 759 new deaths, taking the total to 18,100. The full details are here. Yesterday the daily rise was 823. The Guardian\u2019s latest Politics Weekly podcast is out. Jonathan Freedland and guests discuss a historic week in parliament, as prime minister\u2019s questions goes \u201cvirtual\u201d, and Larry Elliott speaks to the Enlightened Economist, Diane Coyle, about the potential for economic reform post-pandemic. NHS England has announced 665 further deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 16,272. The full figures are here (pdf). Of the 665 new deaths announced today: - 119 occurred on 21 April - 254 occurred on 20 April - 108 occurred on 19 April The figures also show 175 of the new deaths recorded took place between 1-18 April, and the remaining nine deaths occurred in March, with the earliest new recorded death taking place on 22 March. NHS England releases updated figures each day showing the dates of every coronavirus-related death in hospitals in England, often including previously uncounted deaths that took place several days or even weeks ago. This is because of the time it takes for deaths to be confirmed as having tested positive for Covid-19, for post-mortem examinations to be processed, and for data from the tests to be validated. The figures published today by NHS England show 8 April currently has the highest total for the most hospital deaths occurring on a single day: 828. Public Health Wales has announced another 15 people have died in Wales after testing positive for Covid-19, bringing the total there to 624. A further 274 cases were confirmed, bringing the total number to 8,124. A total of 28,088 tests have now been carried out. Further information here.

Email: lucy.campbell@theguardian.com Twitter: @lucy_campbell_ During PMQs Sir Ed Davey, the acting Lib Dem leader, called for a judge-led inquiry into the government\u2019s handling of coronavirus. Dominic Raab said he did not agree, saying people would expect the government to be focusing now on handling the crisis. Raab told MPs: I have to say I won\u2019t take up his offer of committing to a public inquiry. I think that there are definitely lessons to be learned and when we get through this crisis it will be important that we take stock and we come together to understand with an unprecedented challenge on an international scale what can be done to avoid it happening again. But I think right now, from our key NHS frontline workers to the members of the public, they would rightly expect our full focus to be, as we come through the peak of this virus, to make sure that we save lives, protect the NHS and steer the whole country through this crisis rather than engaging in that process or that set of deliberations right now. In a post-PMQs briefing, Keir Starmer\u2019s spokesman also said the time was not right for an inquiry. The spokesman said: Keir has said that he believes serious mistakes have been made in the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic and ministers do need to be held accountable for those mistakes. The priority now has got to be on how the government fixes the current mistakes it is making. Ken Clarke, the former Tory chancellor, said he expects it will take several years for the UK economy to recover from the pandemic \u2013 and even then it won\u2019t \u201cbounce back\u201d to where it was. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s World at One today: I think we are going to find it a huge blow to the GDP during the crisis and we won\u2019t just bounce back. Of course there will be a recovery, but I fear it won\u2019t bounce back to where we were. My own expectation is once we come out of lockdown, probably for the next two to three years, we will be struggling constantly with the effort to get economies back to something like the healthy state we would have liked to have seen them in before we started. Demand will be suppressed by the considerable number of unemployed we will have, the considerable number of businesses that will be seriously damaged and the whole economy will be held back by the as yet unknown colossal burden of debt. Labour\u2019s Maria Eagle asks if there is a link between Liverpool having a higher than average incidence of coronavirus and the government\u2019s decision to allow the Liverpool v Atl\u00e9tico Madrid match to go ahead on 11 March. The government\u2019s deputy chief scientific adviser has said there might be a link. Does the government think there is a connection? Hancock says that is a question for the scientists. And that\u2019s the end of the Hancock statement. The UK has signed an agreement with Greece to clamp down on migrant crossings in the east Mediterranean, the Home Office has announced. A significant proportion of undocumented migrants from the Middle East, Asia and Africa who seek to reach the UK first pass through Greece on their journey across Europe. The Home Office said the joint action plan, signed by the UK and Greek governments, is designed to tighten asylum and returns processes, enhance work to dismantle migrant smuggling networks and renews the deployment of a Border Force cutter, a patrol vessel that picks up migrants in the Mediterranean. Chris Philp, the minister for immigration compliance, said: Illegal migration is facilitated by dangerous, malicious, criminals, taking advantage of the desperate situations that many people find themselves in. They do not care about the safety of the people involved. The joint action plan will deliver on our commitment to keep our borders secure and will discourage those considering making the dangerous and illegal journey into Greece, through Europe, and in many cases to the UK. This is from the Labour MP Dr Rosena Allin-Khan She has repeatedly urged the UK government to bring its advice in line with that of the World Health Organization, which recommends self-isolation for 14 days as you can still spread the virus after the symptoms have resolved. Labour\u2019s Barry Sheerman, appearing via Zoom, tells Hancock that the \u201cmanagement and leadership of this present crisis has been shambolic\u201d. He says the UK has lagged behind Germany and that a death toll of around 800 people (the daily figure at certain points) is equivalent to two jumbo jets crashing. I believe it is a shambles of leadership and management. I believe we are letting down NHS staff, and they have been let down. He also claims that NHS whistleblowers have been leant on not to tell the truth about conditions in the NHS. He goes on: Many of us do not believe [Hancock] is telling the truth to the people of this country. Hancock says Sheerman had misjudged his tone, and missed what the government was doing. The prime goals were to flatten the curve, and to ensure the NHS was not overwhelmed. Both of those challenges had so far been met, he says. And he says Sheerman is wrong to say whistleblowers have been silenced. This is what Matt Hancock said in his opening statement about the UK being at the peak of the pandemic. He said: We are at the peak. But before we relax any social distancing rules or make changes to them we have set out the five tests that have to be met. Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn asks if the government will provide free masks to people if it advises that they should be worn. Hancock says the government will follow the expert advice. He says giving out free masks would be extraordinary. He says the government does not want to do anything that could lead to the NHS missing out. Hancock says home testing through the post will become available. He says this will be particularly useful for people living in rural areas. Jeremy Corbyn, the former Labour leader, says the director general of the World Health Organization said \u201ctest, test, test\u201d was the way to address this problem. But that did not happen. Will it happen now? Hancock says testing has been developed \u201cat pace\u201d. The UK was one of the first countries in the world to develop a test, he says. He says the government has had \u201cits foot on the gas\u201d the whole time. Coronavirus-related deaths in care homes could be double the number already reported, the government has said. The Department of Health and Social Care also feared a \u201csignificant rise\u201d in deaths not involving Covid-19 among residents, it said on Wednesday. There were 1,043 coronavirus deaths in care homes in England and Wales by April 10, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). In a statement with the Care Quality Commission (CQC), the government said: It is anticipated that the number of deaths in care homes relating to Covid-19 reported by providers between April 11 and April 15 could be double the number of care home deaths reported yesterday. In common with the ONS, CQC\u2019s preliminary analysis also indicates there may be a significant rise in non-Covid-19 deaths. One scientist believes care home deaths as a proportion of the national total may keep increasing, even as the NHS sees a decline. Prof Carl Heneghan, the director of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford previously said: The proportion of deaths might drop in hospitals but the proportion of deaths may go up overall in nursing homes. Particularly in the frail and the vulnerable and the elderly, this will be a debilitating disease. Greg Clark, the Conservative former business secretary who now chairs the Commons science committee, asks if Sage, the scientific advisory group for emergencies, backed the target of having 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month. Hancock says there was scientific input into that decision, although he says he cannot remember whether it directly came from Sage. Jeremy Hunt, the Conservative former health secretary, says that to ease the lockdown, the government has to be able to track and trace every new case. Will this be in place in two weeks, he asks. And will the government appoint a \u201cbig hitter\u201d to take charge of this? Hancock says the government is ramping up its capacity for contact tracing \u201cin a matter of weeks\u201d. We are ramping up our testing capacity and our capacity for contact-tracing in a matter of weeks, and we\u2019ll have it ready to make sure that we can use that as and when the incidence of transmission comes down. It isn\u2019t as tied to the specific decision that we\u2019re required by law to take in just over two weeks time [the review of the lockdown]. The effectiveness of test, track and trace to keep the reproductive rate of this virus down is determined by the incidence in the community and our goal is to get to a point where we can test, track and trace everybody who needs it. Hancock is now responding to some questions from Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary. Hancock is in the chamber, but Ashworth asked his questions by Zoom. Hancock says 15 social care staff have died from coronavirus. (Dominic Raab could not answer this question earlier. See 12.13pm.) As for why the death rate in Germany is lower, Hancock says one factor is the category of people affected in the early stages of the outbreak in Germany. (He does not explain what this means.) Hancock says the government is investigating why a disproportionate number of BAME people have died from coronavirus. He says the government\u2019s contact tracing app is at the beta stage and in trials. UPDATE: These are from ITV\u2019s Robert Peston and the New Statesman\u2019s Jeremy Cliffe. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is now making a Commons statement on coronavirus. Here are some lines from his opening statement. That was Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s first outing as Labour leader at PMQs, but just as importantly this marked the debut for a whole new way of running this question session: a \u201chybrid\u201d system, with most MPs participating by Zoom. Both probably amount to a distinct improvement on what came before. First, the process. On a technical level it mostly worked well. One MP did not manage to dial in in time, and another got cut off early. But overall it went smoothly. More importantly, PMQs without 400-odd MPs in the chamber makes everything quieter, calmer, more intelligible and more grown-up. For once the proceedings sounded like the question time sessions that take place in the Scottish parliament and the Welsh assembly. Without the jeering and the aggro, it lacked gladiatorial edge, and frankly it was probably a bit more boring than the old PMQs. But boring is a much underrated virtue in governance. It will be be very interesting to see whether the Commons ever reverts to how it operated before when (or more probably if) this is all over. In the old PMQs, MPs worked on the assumption that there was always a \u201cwinner\u201d. (Journalists like me wrote it up in those terms too, because that was how the participants viewed the proceedings.) Under Zoom PMQs it is much harder to imagine anyone \u201cwinning\u201d old-style, but if Labour had to choose someone well-suited to parliament in serious/boring mode, it is hard to imagine anyone better than Starmer, and he will chalk today\u2019s outing up, not as a triumph, but certainly as a success. His questions were clear, forensic and focused, he avoided bland or trite sloganising and he adopted a measured tone consistent with responsible, constructive opposition. Quite what the public will make of this when the alternative is Boris Johnson remains to be seen, but high-grade seriousness is what Starmer offered in the Labour leadership contest and it is what he delivered today. A total of 1,062 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for Covid-19, up by 77 from 985 on Tuesday, the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said. The figures are lower than the 1,616 deaths given earlier by the National Records of Scotland (see 12.22pm) as they do not include suspected and probable coronavirus infections. Sturgeon said 9,038 people had now tested positive for the virus in Scotland, up by 366 from 8,672 the day before. There were 155 people in intensive care with coronavirus or coronavirus symptoms, a decrease of 11 from Tuesday, she added. There were 1,776 people in hospital with confirmed or suspected Covid-19, down from 1,866 yesterday. And since 5 March, 1,813 patients who tested positive have been discharged from hospital. James Sunderland, a Conservative, asks Raab what are the ingredients that will take the country through this. Raab says the critical ingredient is for the country to come together. He says people understand how important key workers are. We can and will rise to the challenge as one United Kingdom, he says. Labour\u2019s Stephen Kinnock asks about Port Talbot steel works. He says the government help to Tata steel is only one-tenth of what it needs. Raab says he understands the point Kinnock makes. The chancellor is looking carefully at the needs of the steel sector, he says. Matt Vickers, a Conservative, asks if the government will consider the case for putting more money into the NHS. Raab says the government is already putting record sums into the NHS. Labour\u2019s Naz Shah, who is in the chamber, asks if the government will compensate councils for the costs they are incurring as a result of coronavirus. Raab pays tribute to councils. An extra \u00a31.6bn has already been announced, he says. The Conservative MP Nick Fletcher asks what is being done to ensure NHS staff get enough PPE. Raab says 1bn items have been delivered already. The government will ramp up its capacity to deliver it, he says. Labour\u2019s Barry Gardiner says Sage, the scientific advisory group on emergencies, recommended a lockdown at the end of February. The government claims it has followed scientific advice. But it hasn\u2019t, has it? Raab says the government has followed scientific advice at all times. It will continue to do that, he says. The Conservative MP Sally-Ann Hart asks what can be done to help tourism. Raab says the government knows tourism is being affected. Unprecedented support for businesses and workers is on offer, he says. Labour\u2019s Lucy Powell asks what the government will do to help the hospitality sector. Raab says a whole range of measures have been introduced. He offers to look at what more can be done to help particular businesses. The Tory MP Peter Bone says the banks are offering savers a pathetic interest rate. When will they act in the national interest? Bone gets disconnected before he can finish. Like most of the MPs down to ask a question for the rest of the session, Bone is asking his question by Zoom. Raab says the government expects banks to do their bit. The Speaker says David Mundell was \u201cunable to connect\u201d and so he goes to the next person on the list, Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, who is asking a question remotely. He says many workers are getting no support. The SNP is leading a call for a universal basic income. Can Raab say whether or not he supports this proposal? Raab says he does not agree with a universal basic income. The government has announced a range of measures to support workers, unrivalled in the world. He says a universal income would not be targeted. Blackford says many people are being left behind. A universal basic income is an idea whose time has come. He says 84% of the public support this idea. It will leave no one behind. It deserves more than the answer Raab gave. We should not be left in a situation where the self-employed and others do not get the help they need. Raab says the government wants to provide support to those who need it most. The government\u2019s plan is one of the most extensive in the world. Almost 80% more deaths were recorded in Scotland in the week to 19 April than the average, according to new figures published by National Records of Scotland this morning. The total number of deaths registered in Scotland between 13 and to 19 April stood at 1,911 which is 79% higher than the average number of deaths registered in the same week over the last five years. Of the 844 excess fatalities, three quarters recorded Covid-19 as the underlying cause of death. Today\u2019s figures show that there were 600 more deaths involving coronavirus in Scotland than were previously known, 64% higher than the numbers reported to date. Weekly death registrations show there were a total of 1,616 deaths where Covid-19 was mentioned in the death certificate up to 19 April. As of yesterday the Scottish government had reported 985 people as having died after contracting coronavirus. Although more than half (56%) of the registered deaths occurred in hospitals, a third were in care homes, up from a quarter last week, bringing Scottish figures closer to the experience in other parts of Europe, where around half of deaths are in care homes. One-in-10 deaths occurred at home or non-institutional settings. Almost three quarters of all registered deaths were among those aged 75 and over while 55% of the registered deaths were among men. Pete Whitehouse, director of Statistical Services, \u201cevery death from this virus is a tragedy\u201d. Our aim is to ensure that our statistical publication provides information that is as useful as possible and adds value to the understanding of how the virus is spreading throughout the country. We will continue to review and develop these statistics. This is from our Scotland editor, Severin Carrell: Starmer pays his own tribute to frontline workers. And he says it has been \u201cincredible\u201d to see how the capacity of the NHS has been ramped up. He says he accepts that this is not easy. But he says there have been reports of firms offering PPE, but not having their offers taken up. He understands the need for due diligence. But some of these firms are sending PPE abroad. There has been a pattern here, he says. The UK has been slow on the lockdown, slow on testing, slow on PPE and slow on taking up procurement offers. Raab says the government has always followed scientific advice. If Starmer thinks he knows better than them, he should say so. He says in other countries PPE has had to be recalled because it was faulty. He hopes Starmer accepts the need to scrutinise PPE properly. Starmer says he is disappointed there is no answer for care workers. He says he will ask the same question again next week. He expects an answer then. Turning to PPE, he quotes a worker saying she is \u201cscared\u201d. Half of nursing staff feel under pressure, he says. This has been a stress test of our resilience. When will frontline workers finally get the equipment they need? Raab says our hearts go out to the families of frontline workers who have died. He absolutely agrees on the need to protect them. Getting PPE to where it needs to be is a global challenge, he says. He says the government has delivered 1bn items of PPE. But it has to strive \u201ceven harder\u201d in this incredibly competitive international environment, he says. Starmer asks about an A&amp;E consultant who died on Monday. He was the first Sikh consultant, but one of many NHS workers to have died. How many NHS workers have died and how many social care workers? Raab says he entirely agrees with the broader point Starmer is making about the need to support NHS staff. He says he thinks 69 people have died in the NHS. He says he does not have a figure for care workers, because that is harder to obtain. Starmer says the demand for testing is there. If a care worker has symptoms, they have to self-isolate. To get a test, they have to travel to a test centre, miles away. For example, people in Leicester are being told to go to one on the edge of Nottingham. But some care workers don\u2019t have a car. And they cannot use public transport. So this is not a good plan. What reassurance can Raab give to care workers that things will improve for them, and fast? Raab says he has addressed the capacity point. He accepts that they need to make it easier for people to get to test centres. Mobile labs are being used. He says it is important to have a target. And he says Starmer should get the Welsh Labour government, which has abandoned its testing target, to reinstate it. Starmer says he did not need correcting. He talked about tests, not capacity. He says Raab\u2019s comment about capacity highlights the gap between tests carried out and the number that could be carried out. Why isn\u2019t the government using all the tests available every day? Raab says there are two issues: capacity and testing. Capacity is expanding. On testing, the focus is on NHS workers. He says that is right. And he says the government will expand from there. We will deliver. And those tests will be crucial, not just in controlling the virus, but in moving to the next stage. Sir Keir Starmer starts by thanking the Speaker and the Commons staff for allowing the Commons to meet like this. He sends his best wishes to the PM for a full recovery. And he expresses his condolences to those who have lost loved ones, and his thanks to NHS staff. Starmer says he promised constructive opposition. He will support the government when it is right. But he will challenge it when it is wrong. On testing, he says yesterday the figure for tests carried out was 18,000, down from 19,000 the day before. This is well below the 100,000 target for the end of the month. What will happen in the next eight days to hit this target? Raab says this is a crucial issue. He says it will be an important part of transitioning out of lockdown. But the capacity for testing is 40,000 a day, he says. He says there will have to be an exponential increase. The government is working with its targets to hit this. Dominic Raab says the PM is making a good recovery, and is in good spirits. The government continues to take the right steps at the right time, guided by the experts, he says. He thanks the Speaker for helping to ensure the Commons can meet. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, says he will run these exchanges for 45 minutes. PMQs is about to start. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, is standing in for Boris Johnson, who is still recovering from his illness. Sir Keir Starmer is appearing for his first time as Labour leader. Here is what Commons officials are calling the \u201ccall list\u201d - the list of MPs down to ask a question (most of whom are dialling in on Zoom). This is from the Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, who has been getting ready to ask a question at PMQs from home. In the Commons, Simon Hart, the Welsh secretary, is taking questions \u2013 via video conferencing. There are a few MPs in the chamber, but Hart is responding by Zoom. It seems to be working OK. At 12pm we\u2019ll see the system at work for PMQs, although for those exchanges Dominic Raab and Sir Keir Starmer are both planning to be in the chamber. This is beautiful. From Sky\u2019s Kay Burley. I\u2019m not crying, you\u2019re crying. Nando\u2019s has reopened the kitchens in some of its restaurants to help feed NHS workers. The chain said seven of its city centre restaurants reopened their kitchens on Monday, after closing all its sites in the face of the pandemic on 23 March. Four restaurants in London, two in Manchester and one in Dublin are firing up their grills again to make meals for NHS workers and local charities. The business said it will provide up to 1,700 free meals each day for NHS staff, key workers at local hospitals and charities. It said the restaurants will operate behind closed doors, with meals dropped off at hospitals every evening between 6pm and 9pm. Each restaurant will work under strict health and safety measures while maintaining social distancing, the chain said. The restaurants will each look to cook up to 250 meals a shift before delivering them. The European commission has said the UK was well aware of its coronavirus procurement initiative when it decided not to participate. Its account contradicts the UK government claim that a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d was to blame for the UK not getting involved. (See 9.37am.) These are from the Sun\u2019s Brussels correspondent Nick Gutteridge. Almost 300 Covid-19 cases have been confirmed in Northern Ireland\u2019s nursing and residential homes, the Public Health Agency (PHA) said. Due to understaffing, NHS workers have been drafted in to bolster numbers and the tally of cases is expected to grow, other Stormont health officials added. The plight of residents and workers at under-staffed care homes which initially struggled to secure adequate supplies of protective equipment has been a major issue during the pandemic. A nursing homes representative has warned a systematic procedure needs to be put in place. Pauline Shepherd, chief executive of the Independent Health and Care Providers organisation, told the BBC\u2019s Nolan Show, there needed to be co-ordination and planning in terms of putting nurses in to manage Covid within care homes. The whole care home sector has nurse shortages but they have been relying on agency staff, Shepherd added. Some agency workers are refusing to enter homes where coronavirus is present, and other staff are off work and self-isolating due to the infection, she said. A health department spokesman confirmed NHS-employed or bank staff have been working on the rotas in care homes for the last two to three weeks. Prof Hugo van Woerden, the director of public health at the PHA, said: When the PHA receives a notification of an issue of acute respiratory infection in a care home, the agency\u2019s health protection team investigates and supports the provider in managing the outbreak. A comprehensive risk assessment is completed of the incident, which includes an assessment of each individual resident and the environment, and an ongoing assessment of the severity, spread and context of the incident. He said advice specific to Covid-19 is given regarding isolation, containment and infection prevention and control practice, including cleaning, testing information, how to manage symptoms, when to request additional medical advice, and PPE. The Welsh government has announced that disadvantaged children will receive free \u201cschool meals\u201d throughout the summer holidays, the first UK country to do so. Kirsty Williams, the education minister for Wales, said the government in Cardiff was extending funding for local authorities to provide free school meals for eligible pupils until the start of the next school year in September. Williams said: We will continue to support local authorities, both financially and through revised guidance, to deliver local solutions while schools remain closed. I can confirm we will provide \u00a333m to enable local authorities to continue free school meal provision until schools re-open or up to the end of August. While England\u2019s use of a national voucher scheme contracted to a French company has been plagued by delays, Welsh councils and schools can choose to transfer money directly to parents\u2019 bank accounts, or use vouchers or offer food directly. \u201cAfter examining whether a national voucher scheme would work for Wales, we have decided not to proceed with that approach,\u201d Williams noted. Complaints about the slow delivery of food vouchers in England have lessened. Headteachers say they are now receiving the \u00a315 weekly supermarket vouchers applied for up to two weeks ago. Four men have been given fines totalling \u00a3240 after travelling 25 miles to get a takeaway. Derbyshire police said the friends, who do not live together, were approached in a parked car in Normanton, Derby, on Monday evening. They had made a round trip to Burton-upon-Trent to pick up burgers, chips and soft drinks, and were parked up eating the meal, the force added. Derby West response team said: \u201cThis burger has cost them \u00a3240 in fines for ignoring government guidelines.\u201d Earlier in April Derbyshire police and crime commissioner, Hardyal Dhindsa, warned that the coronavirus lockdown could begin to crumble if \u201cisolation fatigue\u201d began to set in among the public. A senior West Midlands police officer who contracted coronavirus has left hospital after spending 13 days on a ventilator. Ch Supt Phil Dolby fell ill in late March and was later taken to hospital in an ambulance after experiencing symptoms including \u201cbreathlessness and dizziness\u201d. He was discharged from intensive care on Tuesday after spending a total of 26 days in hospital. After being taken off a ventilator on 11 April, Dolby had posted regular updates of his recovery to Twitter. On Monday he posted that he had been taken outside for an assisted walk in the hospital\u2019s grounds. \u201cThe air in my lungs was like a special gift I can\u2019t describe,\u201d said Dolby. \u201cRecovering now like I have had a heavy gym session not a 2 min walk!\u201d The BBC\u2019s Jessica Parker has more on the row about the UK\u2019s non-involvement in the EU\u2019s coronavirus procurement schemes. Scottish stars including Annie Lennox, Irvine Welsh, Janey Godley, Judy Murray, James McAvoy and Lorne Balfe are taking part in a livestream fundraiser, For the Love of Scotland, organised by broadcaster Edith Bowman. The event, which will include music, literature, poetry and chats, aims to raise urgent funds for Masks for Scotland, a crowdfunding initiative set up by Prof Jill Belch of the University of Dundee, in response to the desperate need for PPE for community frontline medical teams across the country. Bowman will host the charity livestream from 6pm to 9pm on Wednesday evening, and viewers can tune into the stream on the Gigs in Scotland Facebook or YouTube. According to the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith, a survey by the National Care Forum, which represents care homes, has found that 75% of care home staff who want a coronavirus test have not been able to get one. The survey found that one problem was that people who do get offered a test have to make a round-trip of 62 miles on average to get to the nearest drive-through centre where the testing takes place. In his Good Morning Britain interview Tony Blair also said it was important not to have \u201ca void of decision-making\u201d in government. While Boris Johnson continued to recover from his own coronavirus infection, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state who is deputising for him, should have the authority to take decisions, Blair said. I think in a situation where every day matters and where every day decisions have to be taken, I think the person who is the acting prime minister along with what is essentially the war cabinet - the top four ministers that are meeting together - that person has got to be taking those decisions. You can\u2019t have a void of decision-making. The former Labour prime minister Tony Blair has restated his call for the government to change the way it operates as it addresses the coronavirus crisis. He believes the government needs to bring in outsiders with the right expertise and experience to take charge of the various specific challenges ahead. Speaking on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain, Blair said this is one of the lessons he learnt from handling the foot-and-mouth crisis. He explained: To be frank about it, for the first few weeks we were behind the curve, but what I learnt is that you just have to set aside all the normal rules and bureaucracy and just reposition the government differently ... All of us know people who are serious people with capabilities to offer who have been trying to fight their way into the system to offer them - and that is what makes me think we are not yet organised in the right way for the scale of this thing so that every possible avenue is being explored. The mayor of London has called on the UK government to ban evictions over arrears built up by renters as a result of the coronavirus emergency, with millions facing falling into debt with their landlords because of lost work and high rents. In an announcement today, Sadiq Khan also called for an increase to housing benefits, and an undertaking that the government would cover, for the duration of the crisis, any shortfall in payments by private renters, including those with no recourse to public funds. Demanding a \u201ctriple lock\u201d protection for renters, Khan said: With millions of low-paid renters in London now facing increased financial uncertainty we face a ticking time bomb of debt, arrears and widespread evictions once the suspension in court proceedings is lifted. Failing to bring in more support for renters will not only result in widespread financial hardship, but risks increasing the public health crisis, as renters may feel forced to return to work too soon, with increasing debt and arrears hanging over their heads. Three million people in London rented privately, more than the number who owned a home with a mortgage in the city, Khan\u2019s office said. Last week the Guardian reported on research suggesting millions of UK renters may already be having to choose between paying rent and buying food and other essentials. The polling by Opinium found six in 10 renters had already taken a financial hit as a result of the crisis. Amina Gichinga from the London Renters Union said landlords were still threatening evictions, despite their halt for the duration of the crisis and official guidance urging them to \u201cshow compassion\u201d to tenants. She said: Lots of people feel they have no choice but to break social distancing guidelines and go out to work, in many cases becoming seriously ill. People must be able to prioritise their safety, health and paying for food and other essentials over rent. We\u2019re glad to see that Sadiq is listening to what we and other organisations in the renters movement are saying and joining us in calling for protections for renters who get in to rent debt during the coronavirus pandemic. The government must immediately suspend all rent payments and introduce measures that waive rent debt. Chris Bryant, the Labour MP whose question about the EU\u2019s ventilator procurement scheme led to Sir Simon McDonald, the head of the Foreign Office, telling the foreign affairs committee that the UK\u2019s decision not to get involved was a \u201cpolitical decision\u201d, is now saying the committee should investigate exactly what happened. As reported earlier (see 8.31am), Bryant has already said that he does not find the retraction issued by McDonald a few hours after the hearing at all credible. Here is the key passage in McDonald\u2019s retraction letter. Unfortunately, due to a misunderstanding, I inadvertently and wrongly told the committee that ministers were briefed by UKMIS [the UK mission in Brussels] on the EU\u2019s joint procurement agreement scheme and took a political decision not to participate in it. This is incorrect. Ministers were not briefed by our mission in Brussels about the scheme and a political decision was not taken on whether or not to participate. The facts of the situation are as previously set out. Owing to an initial communication problem, the UK did not receive an invitation in time to join in four joint Covid EU procurement schemes. As those four initial schemes had already gone out to tender we were unable to take part. Earlier Helen Whately, the care minister, said that the confirmed number of NHS staff who have died from coronavirus was 61. (See 8.22am.) According to the Nursing Notes website, which is compiling an online memorial, 111 health and social care workers have died from coronavirus. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Matthew Weaver. Here is a timetable for the main events coming up today. 9.30am: Liz Truss, the international trade secretary and minister for women and equalities, gives evidence to the Commons women and equalities committee on the impact of coronavirus on women and minorities. 12pm: Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, faces Sir Keir Starmer at PMQs. This is not just Starmer\u2019s first PMQs as Labour leader, but the first PMQs taking place under the \u201chybrid\u201d procedural arrangements that will see most MPs submitting their questions via video conference. The order paper, which says whether a question from an MP will be \u201cvirtual\u201d or \u201cphysical\u201d, is here (pdf). After 12.45pm: Matt Hancock, the health secretary, makes a Commons statement about coronavirus. He will also take questions mostly from MPs via Zoom. After 1.30pm: MPs debate various procedural motions, including one that would allow a move towards electronic voting in the Commons. Afternoon: The daily UK coronavirus hospital death figures are published. 2.30pm: Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, gives evidence to the defence committee. 2.30pm: Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, gives evidence to the Commons culture committee. 5pm: The government is expected to hold its daily press conference. Labour\u2019s Chris Bryant was one of the MPs who quizzed Sir Simon McDonald on why the UK opted out of the EU\u2019s procurement scheme. Bryant says he does not believe McDonald\u2019s retraction of his claim that the decision was political. Whately told BBC Breakfast that 61 NHS staff were known to have died after becoming infected with the coronavirus. She said: We know that 61 NHS workers have died and for care workers I have a figure of 15, but we are working to get more comprehensive data on that because it is important for us to know the number of people in health and care who are dying of this. Earlier she told Sky that she was working to provide more up to date data on deaths in care homes by next week. The latest back dated figures from the ONS showed that Covid-19 fatalities in care homes in England and Wales have more than quadrupled in a week, rising to 1,043. The Guardian\u2019s Brussels correspondent, Jennifer Rankin, points out that EU officials have not confirmed Matt Hancock\u2019s claim that the UK has joined the latest EU medical equipment procurement round. The FT estimates that the true number of those who have died from coronavirus in the UK is 41,000 - more than double the current official total. Chris Giles, the FT\u2019s economics editor, has explained the calculation. The care minister, Helen Whately, has confirmed that some PPE supplies from Turkey have arrived at RAF Brize Norton. She also insisted the initial decision to opt out of an EU procurement scheme was not political. Speaking to Sky News she said: The plane has now arrived bringing really vital PPE with it. The consignment is being checked. What we know with these deliveries is that they do not always have exactly what you expect. On the EU scheme she said There do seem some misunderstandings about the EU scheme. I am assured there was no political decision about the involvement in it The reason we weren\u2019t involved in the initial scheme was to do with a communications error. We are now participating in one EU scheme and ready to participate in future schemes. The important thing is making sure that we are getting the PPE that we need. Stephen Hawking\u2019s ventilator has been donated to the Royal Papworth Hospital in Cambridge to help treat patients with coronavirus. The physicist, who had motor neurone disease, died in 2018, aged 76. His daughter, Lucy Hawking, said: Our father received brilliant, dedicated and compassionate medical care from both Royal Papworth and Addenbrooke\u2019s Hospitals in Cambridge. As a ventilated patient, Royal Papworth was incredibly important to my father and helped him through some very difficult times. We realised that it would be at the forefront of the Covid-19 epidemic and got in touch with some of our old friends there to ask if we could help. Welcome to our UK coronavirus live blog. Ministers\u2019 claims about efforts to procure vital medical equipment appear to be unravelling amid fresh evidence of failures to secure supplies. The government missed opportunities to secure at least 16m face masks for NHS staff in the past four weeks, the Guardian has revealed. And Brussels sources have told the BBC that the UK was given ample opportunity to part in an EU scheme to source medical equipment. Sir Simon McDonald, the permanent secretary at the Foreign Office, told MPs that the decision to opt out was political. But he was then forced to retract the claim within hours after he was contradicted by the health secretary, Matt Hancock. But commentators have picked over the strange wording of McDonald\u2019s retraction. Meanwhile, an RAF plane, believed to be carrying a delayed consignment of personal protective equipment for NHS staff, has landed in the UK. The plane had been dispatched from the Oxfordshire base, where two other planes are on stand-by to pick up further kit from Turkey. It is not known if the consignment, which was ordered on Thursday and originally due to arrive on Sunday, includes 400,000 badly-needed surgical gowns. Later on Wednesday, Labour\u2019s new leader, Keir Starmer will quiz the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, over the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis during the first virtual Prime Minister\u2019s Questions. Starmer is expected to spend his first PMQs as Labour leader questioning Boris Johnson\u2019s stand-in over testing, safety equipment for frontline workers and an exit strategy from the lockdown.",

Two residents \u2013 the venture capitalist Jyri Engestr\u00f6m and pharmaceutical executive Cyrus Harmon \u2013 used their connections to reach researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, and invited them to set up a study in their town. Local volunteers set up a website where people could register and helped source masks, face shields and other protective equipment for medical workers. Local not-for-profit organizations offered to help spread the word to homebound older residents and unhoused community members.</p> <p>The results from the Bolinas study, in addition to a similar testing program in San Francisco\u2019s economically and ethnically diverse Mission District, will help <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/coronavirus-what-scientists-learned-covid-19-so-far\">researchers understand</a> how the virus spreads through rural and urban communities, said Dr Aenor Sawyer, a Bolinas resident and UCSF orthopedic surgeon who is coordinating testing in the small town, about the project.</p> <p><strong>What is the benefit of testing every single person?</strong></p> <p>Over and over, we see people saying that they\u2019re ready to lift the distancing restrictions and open everything back up, but it\u2019s actually reckless to begin lifting before we have any information \u2013 or enough information \u2013 about how the virus moves through a community. We can\u2019t safely start returning to normal life until we learn more about the transmission of the virus, until we learn about the development of antibodies \u2013 the extent to which they give us immunity, and for how long. Community-wide testing is really what we need in order to answer some of those questions.</p> <p><strong>Why is it important to do two types of testing?</strong></p> <p>We\u2019re trying to encourage everybody to get two types of tests \u2013 the PCR test, which will look for the presence of a viral infection, and the serological tests or blood tests, which will look for the presence of antibodies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/americas-food-system-frontline-workers-interviews-illustrated\">Keeping America fed: six workers on life in the thick of the coronavirus crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If someone has a positive result from the PCR test, we\u2019ll call them right away, so they can take steps to keep themselves safe, and isolate themselves so they keep their loved ones safe. If someone isn\u2019t able to isolate themselves, we\u2019ll get them a room in a hotel.</p> <p>The antibody testing is important because there\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know about antibody tests. We don\u2019t know which test is best in class, and beyond that we don\u2019t know once you get the results, what that actually means. If you have the antibodies that your body produces in the early stages of the infection, you could actually still be infected and pass the virus along to others. Another type of antibody may indicate you\u2019ve had the infection and fought it off, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019re fully immune \u2013 we don\u2019t know how long immunity lasts.</p> <p>So we need a lot more information on antibody tests, and the way to get that information is to do a lot more antibody tests.

The tests are conducted in NHS hospitals, through our drive-through centres, mobile units and home deliveries.\u201d</p> \n<p>Contact tracing will also be introduced at a \u201clarge scale\u201d, he told the Commons, and an NHS app for tracing was in development.

      "bodyText": "The UK has reached the peak of the coronavirus epidemic, cabinet ministers have confirmed, despite warnings that the disease may still be rampant in care homes. Dominic Raab, who is deputising for the prime minister, and Matt Hancock, the health secretary, both said the UK was now \u201cat the peak\u201d of the outbreak While updating MPs in the Commons on the government\u2019s strategy for testing the disease, Hancock said social distancing was working, adding: \u201cIt is making a difference. We are at the peak.\u201d His comment appeared to substantiate claims made several days ago by England\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, who said the country was \u201cprobably reaching the peak overall\u201d. However, Hancock said relaxing lockdown restrictions was not imminent as tests needed to be scaled up, including a consistent fall in the daily death rate. Hancock\u2019s comments were echoed by Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, who said she was increasingly optimistic Scotland had passed the peak in cases after \u201creally encouraging\u201d data showed a continuing fall in hospital admissions and intensive care cases. Sturgeon warned, however, it was too early to start relaxing the strict lockdown and social isolation rules. \u201cThe progress is definitely there but it\u2019s fragile at this stage, so any easing up that will very quickly send all of that into reverse,\u201d she said. Public Health England announced 665 new hospital deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19. The number of coronavirus deaths at UK hospitals stands at 17,000, though there are estimates the death toll is far higher \u2013 potentially at 41,000 - if non-hospital deaths are included. Italy is believed to be beyond its peak with the country\u2019s death toll falling consistently for the past two weeks. The number of intensive care patients in Scotland fell for the seventh day running to 155, the lowest figures since 1 April and down from 221 on 12 April. Covid-19 hospital admissions by ambulance fell to 156 on Tuesday, the lowest level since 18 March and down from a peak of 363 on 6 April. \u201cThese figures for hospital admissions and admissions to intensive care are really encouraging and they\u2019re cause for optimism \u2013 still cautious optimism \u2013 but optimism nevertheless,\u201d Sturgeon said. The UK health secretary has been increasingly under fire for the level of testing, which has fallen behind other European countries, and for a lack of personal protective equipment for NHS and care home staff. Hancock said the expansion of testing capacity was ahead of schedule but demand had been \u201clower than expected\u201d. He said: \u201cWe are therefore ramping up the availability of this testing and expanding who is eligible for testing and making it easier to access the tests. The tests are conducted in NHS hospitals, through our drive-through centres, mobile units and home deliveries.\u201d Contact tracing will also be introduced at a \u201clarge scale\u201d, he told the Commons, and an NHS app for tracing was in development. Public Health England has been criticised for not deploying pre-existing environmental health volunteers who have the expertise to help with the outbreak. Defending the government\u2019s strategy on procuring PPE, Hancock said it had focused on large and credible offers first but was engaging with 1,000 companies that buy stock from abroad as well as 159 UK-based manufacturers. His statement came as Labour claimed dozens of companies offering PPE had been \u201cignored\u201d by the government. Labour says 36 British companies have approached it to say their offers to help frontline staff \u201chave not received a reply\u201d. This includes Issa Exchange Ltd in Birmingham, which said it offered a quarter of a million aprons and masks, Network Medical Products in Ripon, which said it could provide 100,000 face visors a week, and CQM Learning, which says it can provide 8,000 face shields a day. In a letter to Michael Gove, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, Rachel Reeves, said: \u201cYou and your officials and those at the Department for Health and Social Care will be best placed to validate what capability and capacity these firms have, but as they have not received a reply after contacting the government. I wanted to ensure that the Cabinet Office was aware of them. \u201cOf these firms, if just one, five or 10 were able to contribute to the national effort of ensuring that our NHS and care workers \u2013 and indeed anybody who needs to use some form of personal protective equipment and clothing \u2013 could be better protected, or just one hospital or care home were able to access adequate supplies of the PPE they need, I know you will agree that that would go a long way and make a big difference.\u201d Hancock told the Commons the government had coordinated the delivery of more than 1bn items of PPE so far. \u201cWe have a rigorous system of verifying the offers we receive because not all offers have been credible and it\u2019s important to focus on the biggest, most credible offers first,\u201d he said.",

We expect that the gap between performance in London and the rest of the UK will widen this year,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The north west and east midlands, which also rely on manufacturing industries and lack many of the most resilient service industries, will also suffer more than most regions along with the East of England region, which KPMG said relies disproportionately on residential and commercial building, which has ceased during the lockdown.</p> <p>The gross domestic product (GDP) of the north west and the east midlands will contract by 9.5% and 9.7% respectively while the GDP of the East of England region will shrink by 10%, KPMG predicts.</p> <p>\u201cAt the other end, we expect London will be the least affected region,\u201d Selfin said. \u201cWe forecast the economy will contract by just over 7% in 2020. A relatively higher share of services that are less impacted by Covid-19, like financial and professional services, mean the capital\u2019s economy is more resilient to the restrictions imposed by the lockdown.</p> <p>\u201cAn ONS survey conducted last year showed that more than 34% of London workers had worked from home at least once, compared to 27% for the UK as a whole,\u201d she added.</p> <p>Northern Ireland and the north east, which will contract by 8% and 8.4% respectively, perform relatively well because they boast large food manufacturing businesses, which have maintained or increased production, and a higher proportion of public sector employers.</p> <p>Northern Ireland also has a cluster of life science businesses that have benefited from an emphasis on healthcare and pharmaceutical spending by the government and private sector.</p> <p>Earlier this month the Treasury\u2019s economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/uk-economy-could-shrink-by-35-with-2m-job-losses-warns-obr\">Britain\u2019s economy could shrink by 35%</a> this spring and unemployment soar by more than 2m due to the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>It said Covid-19 lockdown measures would cut GDP by more than a third in the second quarter of the year and by 13% for 2020 as a whole.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic will hit the West Midlands harder than any other region and leave London the least affected, according to an assessment of the worst affected areas of the UK. Consultancy KPMG said that an analysis of the likely impact this year on the UK\u2019s regions showed that the closure of car plants and mothballing of hundreds of factories connected to the automotive sector meant the region\u2019s economy would shrink by 10.1%. In a report that matched economic forecasts for each region with the mix of local industries and how they will fare in the pandemic, KPMG said London was better placed than other areas to maintain its economic activity, despite suffering the highest number of cases and deaths in the pandemic. London will contract by 7.3% this year, the report found. The report said London\u2019s services sector, from marketing and advertising to architecture and financial services, could carry on remotely through the lockdown and recover lost ground in the months after the lockdown eases. Meanwhile, the double hit to the automotive sector - which makes up 6% of the local economy - from factory shutdowns and a collapse in demand for new cars meant that a major sector in the West Midlands would be dormant through the lockdown and take time to recover during the rest of the year. KPMG\u2019s chief economist, Yael Selfin, said the damage caused to the UK\u2019s regions outside London and the south east would be a setback for the government\u2019s plans to \u201clevel up\u201d the north and west of the country with the east and the south. \u201cOur analysis highlights how the government\u2019s ambition to \u2018level up\u2019 the UK will face a setback as a result of the pandemic. We expect that the gap between performance in London and the rest of the UK will widen this year,\u201d she said. The north west and east midlands, which also rely on manufacturing industries and lack many of the most resilient service industries, will also suffer more than most regions along with the East of England region, which KPMG said relies disproportionately on residential and commercial building, which has ceased during the lockdown. The gross domestic product (GDP) of the north west and the east midlands will contract by 9.5% and 9.7% respectively while the GDP of the East of England region will shrink by 10%, KPMG predicts. \u201cAt the other end, we expect London will be the least affected region,\u201d Selfin said. \u201cWe forecast the economy will contract by just over 7% in 2020. A relatively higher share of services that are less impacted by Covid-19, like financial and professional services, mean the capital\u2019s economy is more resilient to the restrictions imposed by the lockdown. \u201cAn ONS survey conducted last year showed that more than 34% of London workers had worked from home at least once, compared to 27% for the UK as a whole,\u201d she added. Northern Ireland and the north east, which will contract by 8% and 8.4% respectively, perform relatively well because they boast large food manufacturing businesses, which have maintained or increased production, and a higher proportion of public sector employers. Northern Ireland also has a cluster of life science businesses that have benefited from an emphasis on healthcare and pharmaceutical spending by the government and private sector. Earlier this month the Treasury\u2019s economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, said Britain\u2019s economy could shrink by 35% this spring and unemployment soar by more than 2m due to the coronavirus crisis. It said Covid-19 lockdown measures would cut GDP by more than a third in the second quarter of the year and by 13% for 2020 as a whole.",

They are over-represented in the Covid-19 death toll by 27%. This means that for every four fatalities you would expect to see among BAME people an additional Covid-19 related fatality has occurred.

      "bodyText": "The government has been urged to recognise that race and racial inequalities are a risk factor for Covid-19 after Guardian research which has revealed that ethnic minorities in England are dying in disproportionately high numbers compared with white people. The revelation that people from minority groups appear to be over-represented among the coronavirus deaths, by as much as 27%, \u201cconfirmed the worst fears\u201d of campaigners who said there was now no question of an excessive toll. The Guardian analysis found that of 12,593 patients who died in hospital up to 19 April, 19% were Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) even though these groups make up only 15% of the general population in England. And the analysis revealed that three London boroughs with high BAME populations - Harrow, Brent and Barnet \u2013 were also among the five local authorities with the highest death rates in hospitals and the community. The findings confirm suspicions raised by local reports, hospitalisation rates and evidence from other countries, that minority groups face the greatest risk. And they show for the first time that areas with high ethnic minority populations in England and Wales tend to have higher mortality rates. While it is is not yet clear why communities with proportionally higher number of BAME inhabitants appear to be dying at higher rates, one expert on public and ethnic health said that social deprivation was the strongest indicator for mortality due to an increased underlying burden of disease. \u201cThere have been health inequalities that have existed in the [BAME] population but what is being reflected in this pandemic is that those inequalities are actually coming out,\u201d said Wasim Hanif, professor of diabetes and endocrinology at University Hospital Birmingham. He added: \u201cDeaths happen in relation to complications related to diabetes all the time, as with cardiovascular diseases and cancers, but they have never hit the headlines and that\u2019s the effect we\u2019re seeing now.\u201d The findings, which run alongside separate concerns about the death rate among BAME healthcare workers, are based on two data sets and two batches of analysis. One was from the NHS and covered deaths in English hospitals up to 19 April. The findings are based on new figures from the Office or National Statistics breaking down deaths by local authority up to 3 April, enabling the matching of deaths to data on pollution, age, deprivation, population density and BAME populations in England and Wales for the first time. A high proportion of BAME residents was found to be the strongest predictor of a high Covid-19 death rate. The analysis shows that for every 10% increase in ethnic minority residents there were 2.9 more Covid-19 deaths per 100,000 people. The Guardian took into account the influence of other factors including population density and age, which explained only part of the correlation between ethnicity and death rates. Dr Zubaida Haque, deputy director of the Runnymede Trust, said: \u201cThe Guardian\u2019s analysis confirm our worst fears.

      "bodyText": "Ministers are being pressed to reveal the full details of how the government missed out on four opportunities to join an EU medical supplies consortium, in the wake of a U-turn by the top civil servant in the Foreign Office over comments suggesting it was a \u201cpolitical decision\u201d. The Labour MP Chris Bryant, who sits on the foreign affairs select committee, said on Wednesday that he \u201cfeared the government was involved in a full-on cover-up\u201d over how it came to miss out on four rounds of procurement of personal protective equipment (PPE), ventilators and laboratory supplies launched by the EU in late February and March. UK officials failed to take up an invitation to join the steering committee of participating countries that issues orders for medical equipment until 19 March \u2013 after the bulk purchases had been made. Bryant said he feared either Foreign Office ministers or the prime minister decided not to be associated with any EU scheme for political reasons \u201ceven though it was patently in the interests of the NHS and its staff to explore every possible avenue to acquire masks, gowns and ventilator equipment, as fast and most effectively as possible\u201d. His intervention came a day after the Foreign Office\u2019s permanent secretary, Sir Simon McDonald, told MPs that ministers had indeed taken a political decision not to join the scheme. After his claims, made to the foreign affairs committee on Tuesday, were later denied by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, McDonald wrote to the committee that night saying his original statement of a political motive was wrong and \u201cowing to an initial communication problem the UK did not receive an invitation in time to join\u201d. However, Bryant, in a view shared by some fellow committee members, senses that in his letter McDonald was limiting his retraction to the advice given to ministers about the EU ventilator scheme, but not to other EU medical product purchase schemes. Bryant has written to the committee chair, Tom Tugendhat, asking him to seek from the Foreign Office details of British representation at EU meetings held on 31 January, 4 February, 2 March and 13 March \u201cat which EU-wide health security issues arising from coronavirus were discussed and the bulk procurement of masks, gowns, ventilators and other laboratory equipment were discussed\u201d. He is also asking to see the briefing notes after these meetings, and the list of recipients in Whitehall to which any such notes were circulated. Bryant contends that McDonald was being asked by the committee about four rounds of EU procurement schemes launched in February and March, but in his letter to the committee correcting what he told the MPs McDonald appeared only to be referring to the EU ventilator scheme. Bryant then demands to know whether ministers were briefed about the other schemes. Hancock faced further pressure over the protection offered to NHS staff after the European commission said the UK had been given \u201cample opportunity\u201d to join the EU scheme bulk-buying masks, gowns, gloves and goggles. After a day of confusion in Westminster over the UK\u2019s lack of involvement in the EU\u2019s joint procurement of equipment, a spokesman for the commission appeared to bolster the claim that ministers had taken a \u201cpolitical decision\u201d to opt out. The commission spokesman said UK representatives had been briefed on the EU plans throughout February and March when they could have signed up for the huge purchases of ventilators, laboratory supplies and PPE. UK officials and ministers have repeatedly said the government only failed to take part in the schemes because of a communication problem linked to missed emails. The commission spokesman told reporters in Brussels: \u201cThe EU commission already announced on 31 January that it could help member states with organisation of such joint procurement schemes and this idea of joint procurement and reporting on the state of the medical supplies of the member states was a recurring topic of the agenda of the health and security committee meetings. \u201cThe UK was, as all other members of the health security committee meetings, aware of the work that was ongoing and had ample opportunity to express its wish to participate in a joint procurement if it wanted to do so.

The leading economist Joseph Stiglitz <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/22/top-economist-us-coronavirus-response-like-third-world-country-joseph-stiglitz-donald-trump\">has slammed the US response to the pandemic</a>, saying the \u201cpublic social safety net is not working\u201d and that food bank lines are like those seen in \u201ca third world country\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 23 April. Top stories Four police officers have died in a crash involving a truck on the Eastern Freeway in Melbourne. The Victoria police commissioner, Graham Ashton, said two senior constables and two constables had been killed in a \u201cvery tragic night\u201d for Victoria police and the largest single-incident loss of life in the force\u2019s history. The officers were struck by a truck after pulling over a speeding vehicle. A crime scene has been established and the incident is being investigated by the homicide squad and the major collision investigation unit. The world still has \u201ca long way to go\u201d in tackling the coronavirus crisis, according to the World Health Organization\u2019s director general, who added that \u201ccomplacency\u201d represented one of the biggest dangers, despite successful lockdown and physical distancing measures in many countries. The leading economist Joseph Stiglitz has slammed the US response to the pandemic, saying the \u201cpublic social safety net is not working\u201d and that food bank lines are like those seen in \u201ca third world country\u201d. More than 46,000 people have died in the US, with documented global fatalities passing 180,000. Competition experts have warned that a recapitalised Virgin Australia still faces a major threat from Qantas, with Australia\u2019s second domestic carrier at risk of being squeezed out due to diminished demand post-Covid-19. Concerns are being raised over the plight of asylum seekers and temporary residents within Australia. Despite $214bn worth of federal government support for jobs and businesses, little has been done for people with precarious visa status, Ben Doherty writes. And the NRL commissioner, Wayne Pearce, has announced domestic rugby league will restart on 28 May, after receiving the green light from \u201cgovernment authorities\u201d. A Chinese citizen journalist documenting the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan has re-emerged after two months missing, confirming he has undergone a state-ordered quarantine. Li Zehua has praised the state\u2019s treatment of him, saying police \u201creally cared about him\u201d and \u201cacted civilly and legally\u201d. Tensions have risen in South Africa, where soldiers have been put on standby to enforce lockdown, amid a reported rise in burglary, looting and vandalism. Both France and Spain have increasingly faced backlash from citizens, as European nations enter a sixth week of lockdown. And French researchers are looking to trial the use of nicotine patches on coronavirus patients after a study suggested smokers might face less risk of contracting the disease. Australia A reduction in wholesale electricity prices could see energy providers under pressure to reduce consumer costs, as increasing solar and wind generation have sent prices tumbling by nearly 50%. But grid running costs have spiked due to the bushfire crisis. More than 6% of Australian workers lost their jobs last month, with the arts and recreation industries disproportionately affected. So what else can we concretely map of the coronavirus\u2019 effect on Australia\u2019s economy? Greg Jericho runs the numbers. Clear conservation management has greatly increased threatened species numbers, with a new report suggesting that populations of rare northern quolls and rock wallabies have grown again\u2013 but only in areas where strong management plans are in place. The world Islamist extremists have killed more than 50 people in northern Mozambique in a massacre after locals reportedly refused to join the militant\u2019s movement to establish a caliphate in the gas-rich region. Police have only just confirmed the killings, believed to have been carried out several weeks ago. Medical staff are scrambling to contain a potential Covid-19 outbreak inside a Palestinian refugee camp, amid fears for nearly half a million displaced persons inside Lebanon. Police in India have been accused of targeting Muslim student activists with \u201cbogus\u201d charges after two prominent protest leaders were charged under anti-terrorist legislation that allows their detainment for up to six months. Greta Thunberg has marked Earth Day by inviting climate activists to find a \u201cnew way forward\u201d post Covid-19, arguing that the pandemic shows the current model of society is \u201cnot sustainable\u201d. Scientists in Germany are investigating thousands of deaths among the blue tit bird population, with more than 11,000 dead or sick birds reported over the past fortnight from a bacterial infection that causes pneumonia. Recommended reads For children in isolation around the world, books have taken on increased importance. And with the playgrounds cordoned off and pools and parks closed down, Celina Ribeiro looks at seven picture books that emphasise connection, curiosity and adventure within isolation or domesticity. For those workers able to transition to the \u201chome office\u201d during Covid-19 the next challenge emerges: how to set it up ergonomically. So what do you do with your chair? Your desk?

As the Premier League investigates the feasibility of completing the season, several clubs are beginning to contemplate an early termination instead, write Paul MacInnes and Paul Doyle. Media roundup The Victorian state government is contemplating fast-tracking major road and rail construction projects in expectation of an economic downturn, reports the Herald Sun. Retail outlets that have shut their doors to protect staff have been informed that they\u2019re in breach of contract by one of Australia\u2019s biggest shopping centre landlords, reports the Sydney Morning Herald. And the federal government has sent a private firm in to assist with aged care provision in a Sydney nursing home where three people have died and 42 have tested positive for Covid-19, according to the Daily Telegraph. Coming up A special sitting of Victorian parliament will be held to pass legislation for $500m of rental relief measures as well as urgent appropriation bills to ensure healthcare workers get paid.

Away from collective discussions, however, clubs are informally talking about the hurdles in the way of a return, with some asking whether the challenges will soon become too great.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/22/football-quiz-top-goalscorers\">Football quiz: top goalscorers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>West Ham\u2019s David Moyes yesterday became the first manager to publicly question whether the campaign will restart. He said he hoped to continue but added: \u201cThe deeper and deeper you look the harder you feel it is to get it up running again.\u201d</p> <p>The Guardian has spoken to clubs who have raised a range of concerns including over finance and sporting integrity. The most immediate fear, however, regards medical safety.</p> <p>Clubs were told last week that play would only resume once there was sufficient capacity for Covid-19 testing while a provisional medical plan has been drawn up with club doctors over how to minimise the risk of infection.</p> <p>But the practicality of the plan was questioned by one club, who argued that players may have to be separated from their families for a month or more to make sure they are not infected. There is also the concern over the amount of testing required, with perhaps multiple tests per person per match being needed, and the possible insensitivity of such a plan when frontline workers in the NHS and other public services are currently not getting the testing they need.</p> <p>These sentiments have now been echoed by Moyes. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got to realise there are a lot of people whose lives we could be putting at risk,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t let that happen. I think until we have the testing, which we need for the nurses and the doctors \u2013 I\u2019m finding it really difficult to see where the conclusion is and how we can start [to play].\u201d</p> <p>The financial complexities centre on the extension of player contracts. If the season were to return in mid\u2011June \u2013 a best-case scenario \u2013 clubs may have to keep players on large wages who might otherwise have left. Equally some clubs at the bottom would be paying greater wages than they would had they already dropped down a division and activated relegation clauses. It is also the case that some clubs could find themselves in legal dispute with players over extending their deals.</p> <p>If it were judged safe to play and clubs were able to take the short-term financial hit in the hope of recouping the money later through broadcast revenue, for example, there would remain issues over sporting integrity. A compacted remainder of the league season, with 92 fixtures still to be completed, would take place during the summer months and would have a physical impact on players. Clubs with smaller squads would face a challenge.</p> <p>One club is believed to consider their squad\u2019s age profile as a disadvantage if a regular rhythm of weekend-midweek-weekend were required. Another raised the issue of what would happen should a player refuse to play over welfare concerns, or if one who had been set for a transfer were selected against their prospective new club.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email. </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Moyes also raised the issue of compacting next season as a result of extending this one, with the postponed European Championship to follow. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be careful that we are not asking an incredible amount of the players,\u201d said Moyes, whose team were in 16th place when the season stopped.</p> <p>The issues may be resolvable but it is understood they have not been discussed openly in Premier League meetings.

      "bodyText": "An increasing number of Premier League clubs are actively discussing the possibility of bringing the season to an early end, with concerns growing over the feasibility of a return even behind closed doors. The Premier League is suspended indefinitely and, last week, a meeting of the 20 clubs reaffirmed the intention to complete the season when it is \u201csafe and appropriate\u201d. Away from collective discussions, however, clubs are informally talking about the hurdles in the way of a return, with some asking whether the challenges will soon become too great. West Ham\u2019s David Moyes yesterday became the first manager to publicly question whether the campaign will restart. He said he hoped to continue but added: \u201cThe deeper and deeper you look the harder you feel it is to get it up running again.\u201d The Guardian has spoken to clubs who have raised a range of concerns including over finance and sporting integrity. The most immediate fear, however, regards medical safety. Clubs were told last week that play would only resume once there was sufficient capacity for Covid-19 testing while a provisional medical plan has been drawn up with club doctors over how to minimise the risk of infection. But the practicality of the plan was questioned by one club, who argued that players may have to be separated from their families for a month or more to make sure they are not infected. There is also the concern over the amount of testing required, with perhaps multiple tests per person per match being needed, and the possible insensitivity of such a plan when frontline workers in the NHS and other public services are currently not getting the testing they need. These sentiments have now been echoed by Moyes. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got to realise there are a lot of people whose lives we could be putting at risk,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t let that happen. I think until we have the testing, which we need for the nurses and the doctors \u2013 I\u2019m finding it really difficult to see where the conclusion is and how we can start [to play].\u201d The financial complexities centre on the extension of player contracts. If the season were to return in mid\u2011June \u2013 a best-case scenario \u2013 clubs may have to keep players on large wages who might otherwise have left. Equally some clubs at the bottom would be paying greater wages than they would had they already dropped down a division and activated relegation clauses. It is also the case that some clubs could find themselves in legal dispute with players over extending their deals. If it were judged safe to play and clubs were able to take the short-term financial hit in the hope of recouping the money later through broadcast revenue, for example, there would remain issues over sporting integrity. A compacted remainder of the league season, with 92 fixtures still to be completed, would take place during the summer months and would have a physical impact on players. Clubs with smaller squads would face a challenge. One club is believed to consider their squad\u2019s age profile as a disadvantage if a regular rhythm of weekend-midweek-weekend were required. Another raised the issue of what would happen should a player refuse to play over welfare concerns, or if one who had been set for a transfer were selected against their prospective new club. Moyes also raised the issue of compacting next season as a result of extending this one, with the postponed European Championship to follow. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be careful that we are not asking an incredible amount of the players,\u201d said Moyes, whose team were in 16th place when the season stopped. The issues may be resolvable but it is understood they have not been discussed openly in Premier League meetings. One club official who has been part of the meetings said there had been no attempt to ascertain a preferred outcome and none expressed by individual teams. The next Premier League meeting is scheduled for Friday 1 May.",

Care-home deaths are not recorded in the official statistics, nor are many people who have died at home but were not tested for Covid-19.</p> <p>Meanwhile, doctors\u2019 associations and unions have said they are planning legal action over the deaths of 144 medical workers to date, mostly due to the lack of protective equipment at the beginning of the emergency.</p> <p>Robert Lingard, an Italian who lives in London, filed a dossier with the prosecutor of Brescia, another Lombardy province severely affected by coronavirus, after two of his relatives died; three others were in intensive care.</p> <p>He has asked the prosecutor to establish whether campaigns in Milan and Bergamo encouraging people to carry on as normal, such as going to bars and restaurants or shopping, during the early stage of the outbreak constitute criminal negligence.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Our pain is now turning into anger and we demand justice \u2026 whoever made a mistake must take responsibility</p> <footer> <cite>Martina Salerni</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cItalian public authorities were aware of the aggressiveness of the virus in terms of its spread and the death rate associated with it, given the data coming from China, Singapore and South Korea,\u201d said Lingard. \u201cAnd they were also aware of the large-scale measures of containment and prevention they had to put in place. However, in spite of this evidence, authorities in Milan and Bergamo seemed to act in denial, without any sense of prudence applied to public health.\u201d</p> <p>The testimonies being shared on NOI Denunceremo share similarities such as the virus being mistaken for ordinary flu and people at home suffering from a fever advised to take paracetamol. Many have lost both of their parents as a result of Covid-19. Italy\u2019s elderly population has borne the brunt, but many young people who were otherwise healthy have also died, including Steven Rovelli, a 31-year-old who died after being transferred to a hospital in Germany for treatment.</p> <p>Martina Salerni, 18, lost her 54-year-old father on 10 April. He was at home with a fever and cough for eight days before being admitted to hospital in Abruzzo, among the regions least affected by the contagion.</p> <p>\u201cHis initial symptoms didn\u2019t cause any alarm \u2013 it was only when he struggled to breathe,\u201d said Salerni. \u201cOur pain is now turning into anger and we demand justice. Our story is the same as so many other families. Whoever made a mistake must take responsibility.\u201d</p> <p>Elena Gazzolla, a lawyer in Codogno, the Lombardy town where Italy\u2019s outbreak emerged, said the challenge was establishing who should take responsibility as well as the legal requirements for groups of relatives launching class actions. In Italy, procedures of this kind are usually undertaken by consumer associations and involve up to 100 complainants.</p> <p>She expects a lot of legal action to be taken by various groups once the emergency is over.</p> <p>\u201cLawyers are studying the issue and collecting documents to see if there could be eventual judicial processes or compensation for damages,\u201d said Gazzolla, who has so far been contacted by five people who have lost loved ones. \u201cThere are many, many aspects to consider.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The relatives of people killed by coronavirus in Italy are demanding justice as anger mounts over alleged errors made by authorities at the start of the outbreak. The virus has so far claimed 25,085 lives in Italy, and with the daily death rate still high, the painful stories behind the numbers are starting to emerge as relatives come together to work out a course of action. More than 45,000 people have joined NOI Denunceremo (We will report), a Facebook group created by Luca Fusco, whose father died of Covid-19 in Bergamo, the Lombardy province worst-hit by the virus, as a way to gather testimony for magistrates. \u201cWe do not want financial compensation,\u201d said Fusco. \u201cOur main objective is to have justice from a criminal perspective, so if someone is responsible, we want them to be charged and brought to trial.\u201d The aim of the group is not to target health workers, but people in leadership positions who may have underestimated the virus, added Fusco. \u201cThe health workers are victims as much as those who have died,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as the healthcare system in Italy is decentralised, it would have been those who lead the regions who set the guidelines for hospitals. So if a magistrate decides there is a case, then the responsibility would be at regional level.\u201d Several official investigations are already under way, including one into a hospital in Alzano Lombardo, a town in Bergamo where the symptoms were initially not recognised, allowing it to spread within the hospital and beyond. Prosecutors across the Lombardy region are also investigating possible crimes of negligence and multiple manslaughter following hundreds of deaths in residential homes. Care-home deaths are not recorded in the official statistics, nor are many people who have died at home but were not tested for Covid-19. Meanwhile, doctors\u2019 associations and unions have said they are planning legal action over the deaths of 144 medical workers to date, mostly due to the lack of protective equipment at the beginning of the emergency. Robert Lingard, an Italian who lives in London, filed a dossier with the prosecutor of Brescia, another Lombardy province severely affected by coronavirus, after two of his relatives died; three others were in intensive care. He has asked the prosecutor to establish whether campaigns in Milan and Bergamo encouraging people to carry on as normal, such as going to bars and restaurants or shopping, during the early stage of the outbreak constitute criminal negligence. \u201cItalian public authorities were aware of the aggressiveness of the virus in terms of its spread and the death rate associated with it, given the data coming from China, Singapore and South Korea,\u201d said Lingard. \u201cAnd they were also aware of the large-scale measures of containment and prevention they had to put in place. However, in spite of this evidence, authorities in Milan and Bergamo seemed to act in denial, without any sense of prudence applied to public health.\u201d The testimonies being shared on NOI Denunceremo share similarities such as the virus being mistaken for ordinary flu and people at home suffering from a fever advised to take paracetamol. Many have lost both of their parents as a result of Covid-19. Italy\u2019s elderly population has borne the brunt, but many young people who were otherwise healthy have also died, including Steven Rovelli, a 31-year-old who died after being transferred to a hospital in Germany for treatment. Martina Salerni, 18, lost her 54-year-old father on 10 April. He was at home with a fever and cough for eight days before being admitted to hospital in Abruzzo, among the regions least affected by the contagion. \u201cHis initial symptoms didn\u2019t cause any alarm \u2013 it was only when he struggled to breathe,\u201d said Salerni. \u201cOur pain is now turning into anger and we demand justice. Our story is the same as so many other families. Whoever made a mistake must take responsibility.\u201d Elena Gazzolla, a lawyer in Codogno, the Lombardy town where Italy\u2019s outbreak emerged, said the challenge was establishing who should take responsibility as well as the legal requirements for groups of relatives launching class actions. In Italy, procedures of this kind are usually undertaken by consumer associations and involve up to 100 complainants. She expects a lot of legal action to be taken by various groups once the emergency is over. \u201cLawyers are studying the issue and collecting documents to see if there could be eventual judicial processes or compensation for damages,\u201d said Gazzolla, who has so far been contacted by five people who have lost loved ones. \u201cThere are many, many aspects to consider.\u201d",

The pandemic is having a \u201csevere impact\u201d on the mental wellbeing of NHS personnel as well as agency staff, GPs and dentists, with rates of anxiety and burnout also running far higher than usual. New YouGov polling for the IPPR thinktank found that 50% of 996 healthcare workers questioned across the UK said their mental health had deteriorated since the virus began taking its toll. That emerged as the biggest impact on staff, just ahead of worries about their family\u2019s safety because of a lack of testing and protective equipment for NHS workers (49%) and concern about their ability to ensure that patients receive high-quality care when the NHS is so busy (43%). As many as 71% of younger health professionals, who are likely to be inexperienced and early in their careers, said their mental health had deteriorated. More women were affected than men. Just 30% of staff felt that the government was doing enough to protect their mental health; 42% said too little was being done, including 43% of those working in hospitals.

The report suggests that universities could lose \u00a31.5bn in international student fees, more than \u00a3600m from UK-based students, and \u00a3350m from students from the EU, based on surveys of students\u2019 intentions, including one conducted for Ucas, the admissions service. Gavan Conlon, a partner at London Economics, said the pandemic will result in a \u201cvery substantial loss\u201d in enrolments and income, requiring significant government support. \u201cThe proposed student numbers cap will not be enough to avoid an overly competitive market for the remaining pool of applicants, with the impact of this actually being worse for some institutions than the effect of the pandemic itself,\u201d Conlon said. But Nick Hillman, the director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said he thought the report\u2019s forecasts for students numbers \u2013 particularly a 16% drop within the UK \u2013 were overly pessimistic. \u201cI do not want to underestimate the severe impact of Covid-19 on higher education. But, given the diversity of our higher education sector, we must ask if it is right for modelling to assume every single institution will face a recruitment crisis across the board,\u201d Hillman said. London Economics\u2019 forecasts did not include the \u00a3790m lost in accommodation, catering and conference income identified by the Universities UK group of vice-chancellors in its recent submission to UK governments calling for at least \u00a32bn in bailout funding. \u201cThe union is absolutely right to warn of the knock-on impacts this would have for jobs, regional economics, local communities and students,\u201d said Alistair Jarvis, the chief executive of UUK. \u201cGovernment must take urgent action to provide the support which can ensure universities are able to weather these very serious challenges, and to protect students, maintain research, and retain our capacity to drive the recovery of the economy and communities.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The company responsible for delivering traffic reports on radio and TV stations across Australia accidentally sent out the dates of birth, names and home addresses of more than 100 current and former staff to potentially thousands of people as the company seeks to apply for the jobkeeper payments. Australian Traffic Network provides short traffic report updates during news bulletins to 80 radio and television stations, including the ABC, Seven, Nine, 10, 2GB and Triple M. Like hundreds of thousands of Australian employers, ATN is seeking to take up the government\u2019s jobkeeper scheme to keep its staff on the books during the coronavirus pandemic. Under the scheme, employers need to establish that casual staff have been with the company for 12 months or longer to be eligible for the $1,500-a-fortnight payment. In an email to all staff on Monday, which included a number of internal distribution lists and dozens of external email addresses, the company\u2019s finance manager, Patrick Quinlan, asked staff to confirm whether they met the eligibility criteria for the jobkeeper payment. In a follow-up email on Tuesday, he included a table of more than 100 current and former staff who had not responded to the original email, including their names, dates of birth, home addresses and email addresses. Several people responded to the email using the reply-all function to ask why they were receiving it, and why their personal information was being widely distributed. One of those on the list, who spoke to Guardian Australia on the grounds of anonymity, said it wasn\u2019t very professional or safe. \u201cIf I ring my bank and ask to increase a credit limit or change a password, they\u2019re gonna ask for my address and date of birth, and that\u2019s all in this document, and I don\u2019t know who I don\u2019t know the people that have worked for this company \u2013 that could be anyone,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I was a young female worker, and someone was harassing me at work, my address is there. \u201cAm I gonna lose sleep over it personally? No. However, I can look after myself, there could be vulnerable people and then that could be, who knows who\u2019s on that distribution list and what they plan to do with that information? It probably will be fine \u2013 but probably isn\u2019t good enough.\u201d Quinlan told Guardian Australia it had been an error on his part and the company was working to resolve it. He said the email had been deleted from the company\u2019s email server and all those it had been sent to were contacted to advise them of the privacy breach, along with an apology and a request to delete the email. The office of the Australian Information Commissioner had also been notified of the breach, he said. \u201cToday we have consulted our IT department to implement data loss prevention tools to reduce the likelihood of this happening again,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have also restricted access to our payroll portal while we consider password protocols.\u201d More than 800,000 companies and sole traders have expressed interest in claiming the jobkeeper payment, the federal government has said.",
