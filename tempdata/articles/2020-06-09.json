The view is the same as it ever was at Montalto, one of the best-known restaurants and wineries on Victoria\u2019s Mornington Peninsula. Lime-green grass, vines naked for the winter, the thin sun basking everything in soft beauty. John Mitchell watches the first lunch sitting of the day, on the first weekend his restaurant has opened since March. It\u2019s offering lunch only on weekends for now: three sessions at 11am, 12.45 and 2pm. You have to book and there\u2019s a set menu for $49. This room can hold 75 people. Now it will serve just 18. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to rush it,\u201d Mitchell says. \u201cWe are going to be careful and cautious and not overwhelmed, and then take it one step at a time.\u201d As restaurants emerge from hibernation, a conversation is under way. The reopening is welcome but limited numbers are unsustainable in the long term. In Victoria, 20 diners can be in an enclosed space, a number that will possibly increasing to 50 towards the end of June; in New South Wales, it\u2019s 50. In both states there must be 4 sq m of space for every person. That\u2019s tough but industry figures including the Adelaide chef Duncan Welgemoed have raised deeper challenges: \u201cThe hospitality industry as we knew it was terminal anyway,\u201d he wrote for Guardian Australia. The pressures were too great, the margins too thin, the expectations of diners for cheap food unsustainable. Mitchell, 77, is a former Nabisco executive who spent his money after he \u201cretired\u201d buying land at Red Hill and establishing Montalto nearly 20 years ago. It\u2019s grown, with a fine-dining restaurant, a piazza overlooking the vines and award-winning wines. Montalto runs an annual sculpture competition. Writers visit to give talks and musicians perform on the grass. One review said the winery, a little over an hour from Melbourne, offered a \u201cchecklist to all the finer things in life\u201d.

There isn\u2019t a lot of price elasticity. And [there\u2019s] more and more expectation of wonderful food on the plate.

Yet for many, her comments rang equally hollow. In April, Ranaut came out in support of her sister after she wrote a social media post said to have stirred up anti-Muslim hatred by declaring \u201cMullahs [Muslim religious leaders] + secular media stand them in a line and shoot them dead \u2026 they may call us Nazis who cares\u201d.</p> <p>Ranaut\u2019s sister\u2019s post had repeated rumours, later proved to be false, that members of a Muslim congregation had attacked doctors and officials trying to take them into coronavirus quarantine and led to her account being suspended. Ranaut later clarified she and her sister did not believe all Muslims were terrorists but those who attacked officials should be punished.</p> <p>Swara Bhasker, an award-winning Bollywood actor in films such as Veere Di Wedding and Nil Battey Sannata who has been vocal in her criticism of prime minister Narendra Modi\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/20/hindu-supremacists-nationalism-tearing-india-apart-modi-bjp-rss-jnu-attacks\">Hindu nationalist BJP government</a> and their role in the persecution of India\u2019s Muslim and activist community, conceded that there was \u201ca lot in Bollywood which is hypocritical and deeply flawed\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/26/violence-delhi-modi-project-bjp-citizenship-law\">Anti-Muslim violence in Delhi serves Modi well | Mukul Kesavan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, she said it was unrealistic for people to expect Bollywood actors to also be activists on domestic issues, particularly in the current political climate of India, where voices of dissent against the ruling BJP government are often crushed online by an ecosystem of WhatsApp groups and professional social media trolls.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you create a system where you are going to make creative people so vulnerable and that punishes people for speaking their mind, why do you expect that Bollywood actors will put their livelihoods at stake and ruin their careers and peace of mind and expose themselves to filth and vile harassment?\u201d said Bhasker.</p> <p>Just two days ago she was subjected to an online hate campaign calling for her arrest in response to her tweet in support of a pregnant Muslim women arrested under spurious terrorism charges.</p> <p>Bhasker added: \u201cYes we can argue Bollywood actors are privileged and have this public platform, but really who wants to bring that kind of harassment into their lives. So of course it\u2019s easier to talk about Black Lives matter, because it\u2019s safer. There\u2019s nothing at stake.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, in India Bollywood films need certification from a government-controlled body in order to be released, and so films, and therefore actors, are very vulnerable to government intervention.</p> <p>For Bhasker, she said she had paid a \u201cvery, very heavy price\u201d for speaking out against injustices in India. \u201cI\u2019ve lost work, I\u2019ve lost brands, I\u2019ve gained this reputation for being \u2018controversial\u2019 which is just bizarre,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery single day, my family and friends ask \u2018why do you do this to yourself?\u2019\u201d</p>",

Yet for many, these messages of anti-racism and equality rang hollow coming from the mouths of Bollywood\u2019s biggest names, some of whom in the past had made endorsement deals with skin whitening creams, or products that promoted \u201cfairness\u201d, thereby helping to fuel the still-rampant discrimination of darker skinned people in India. The skin-lightening cream industry in India may be controversial but is still worth billions, and, often with Bollywood endorsement, promotes the idea of beauty being conflated with whiteness, or \u201cfairness\u201d and \u201clightening\u201d. \u201cThanks for speaking out for black lives. But, maybe also stop supporting a skin bleaching cream which promotes anti-blackness,\u201d wrote one Twitter user in response to Chopra\u2019s post. Chopra had previously promoted skin fairness products, though recently said it was something she regretted. In the 2008 Bollywood film Fashion, she also played a character ashamed of having sex with a black man. \u201cIt\u2019s not that their views can\u2019t change or that they shouldn\u2019t speak up for what they want, it\u2019s about selective and performative activism especially when they have at some point propagated a colourist attitude in their own country,\u201d read another response. Many of the Bollywood stars were also accused of speaking out against race-driven atrocities in the US while remaining silent about the ongoing persecution of Muslims, migrant workers and lower caste members of society in India. Omar Abdullah, the former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir who was recently imprisoned for six months after the volatile state was taken under the full control of the Indian government, sarcastically tweeted: \u201cSo much respect for all the celebrities tweeting #BLACK_LIVES_MATTER.\u201d In a BBC interview last week, Kangana Ranaut, a Bollywood star, criticised her fellow actors for \u201cshamelessly\u201d promoting Black Lives Matter while also endorsing skin whitening creams and failing to acknowledge that \u201cracism is deep rooted\u201d. Yet for many, her comments rang equally hollow. In April, Ranaut came out in support of her sister after she wrote a social media post said to have stirred up anti-Muslim hatred by declaring \u201cMullahs [Muslim religious leaders] + secular media stand them in a line and shoot them dead \u2026 they may call us Nazis who cares\u201d. Ranaut\u2019s sister\u2019s post had repeated rumours, later proved to be false, that members of a Muslim congregation had attacked doctors and officials trying to take them into coronavirus quarantine and led to her account being suspended. Ranaut later clarified she and her sister did not believe all Muslims were terrorists but those who attacked officials should be punished. Swara Bhasker, an award-winning Bollywood actor in films such as Veere Di Wedding and Nil Battey Sannata who has been vocal in her criticism of prime minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist BJP government and their role in the persecution of India\u2019s Muslim and activist community, conceded that there was \u201ca lot in Bollywood which is hypocritical and deeply flawed\u201d. However, she said it was unrealistic for people to expect Bollywood actors to also be activists on domestic issues, particularly in the current political climate of India, where voices of dissent against the ruling BJP government are often crushed online by an ecosystem of WhatsApp groups and professional social media trolls. \u201cWhen you create a system where you are going to make creative people so vulnerable and that punishes people for speaking their mind, why do you expect that Bollywood actors will put their livelihoods at stake and ruin their careers and peace of mind and expose themselves to filth and vile harassment?\u201d said Bhasker. Just two days ago she was subjected to an online hate campaign calling for her arrest in response to her tweet in support of a pregnant Muslim women arrested under spurious terrorism charges. Bhasker added: \u201cYes we can argue Bollywood actors are privileged and have this public platform, but really who wants to bring that kind of harassment into their lives. So of course it\u2019s easier to talk about Black Lives matter, because it\u2019s safer. There\u2019s nothing at stake.\u201d Indeed, in India Bollywood films need certification from a government-controlled body in order to be released, and so films, and therefore actors, are very vulnerable to government intervention. For Bhasker, she said she had paid a \u201cvery, very heavy price\u201d for speaking out against injustices in India. \u201cI\u2019ve lost work, I\u2019ve lost brands, I\u2019ve gained this reputation for being \u2018controversial\u2019 which is just bizarre,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery single day, my family and friends ask \u2018why do you do this to yourself?\u2019\u201d",

The weather report reads: \u201cA fine, still day to welcome in level 1 and all the freedoms we used to take for granted.\u201d \u2018Now everyone can relax\u2019 Betrothed couples turned their attention again to their weddings, with restrictions limiting gatherings to 100 people lifted. \u201cI\u2019ve already had two of the brides who were thinking about it come to me and say, \u2018We can set a date and get on with it,\u2019\u201d says Julie Lassen, a Christchurch-based celebrant, adding that even though couples could not invite overseas guests, some had decided to proceed anyway. \u201cIt\u2019s made a huge difference because now everyone can relax and hug each other.\u201d The lifting of rules was good news, too, for fans of New Zealand\u2019s most beloved sport: rugby. The domestic competition will be the first professional rugby competition in the world to welcome fans en masse to sports grounds in the Covid-19 era when games kick off in Auckland and Dunedin this weekend. Stadiums are permitted to be filled to capacity. But public health experts still worry about the state of the country\u2019s contact tracing. \u201cThe difficulty is that really the current app seems like very much a temporary filler until something better comes along,\u201d says Michael Baker, an epidemiologist at the University of Otago, referring to the government\u2019s contact-tracing app, which about 10% of New Zealanders have registered to use. The country has recorded fewer than 1,500 confirmed cases and just 22 deaths after Ardern locked down New Zealand at the 200-case mark. Most say that despite the country\u2019s seeming lucky escape from Covid-19, they would return to normal life with slightly cleaner hands than before. \u201cWe\u2019re spraying and sanitising lots. It\u2019s great to see every guy in the toilets washing their hands,\u201d says O\u2019Malley. \u201cPeople sanitising their hands is great. Why not keep doing it?\u201d",

He wanted to alert me to a Black Lives Matter protest there on Saturday that consisted of just around 150 people. But it is significant, the reader said, because of Vidor\u2019s reputation.</p> \n  <p>Here\u2019s an <a href=\"https://www.texasmonthly.com/news/black-lives-matter-vidor/\">excerpt from the Texas Monthly magazine</a>, which covered the protest:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Vidor has been known for many things\u2014among them the activities of the local Ku Klux Klan; its status as a \u201csundown town,\u201d in which blacks were not allowed in city limits after dark; and an ugly fight in the early nineties over a federal effort to desegregate public housing in the city, which caused <em>Texas Monthly,</em> in <a href=\"https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/vidor-in-black-and-white/\">a cover story</a> that year, to describe Vidor as Texas\u2019s \u201cmost hate-filled town.\u201d The census <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/vidorcitytexas/PST120219\">estimates it</a> to be 91 percent white. </p> \n   <p>So when word started to circulate that a Black Lives Matter rally was being planned in Vidor, many people on social media thought it was a trap\u2014and expressed skepticism the event\u2019s supposed planner, 23-year-old Maddy Malone, even existed. (She <a href=\"https://www.texasmonthly.com/news/a-qa-with-the-organizer-of-the-black-lives-matter-march-in-vidor/\">does</a>.) To black folks with knowledge of the region, who had been told never to stop in Vidor, the idea seemed insane. \u201cA civil rights rally in Vidor\u201d is the punchline to a joke, not a thing that could happen in this world.

An updated summary of today\u2019s news: A judge set a $1-1.25 million bail for Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who has been charged with second-degree murder in connection to the killing of George Floyd. Thousands of people paid their respects to Floyd in Houston, Texas, as other Americans held memorials across the country. Thousands attended a public visitation to view Floyd\u2019s casket in Houston, and a memorial service will be held tomorrow. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden met privately with members of George Floyd\u2019s family in Houston. Donald Trump met with police. Congressional Democrats unveiled a police reform bill. The Justice in Policing Act would nationally ban chokeholds and create a national police misconduct registry, but many criminal justice activists have said reforms do not go far enough to address police brutality, and continue to advocate for defunding and divestment. A group of economists said the US entered a recession in February. According to a committee of economists at the national bureau of economic research, the US economy entered a period of recession as businesses started to close down in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Kayleigh McEnany said the White House had \u201cno regrets\u201d about forcibly removing peaceful protesters last week. The White House press secretary claimed the attorney general and the US park police made the decision to use tear gas against the protesters, but she said, \u201cThere\u2019s no regrets on the part of this White House.\u201d As a reckoning over racist practices and racist bosses has begun to spread through culture industries of fashion, publishing, and media, the editor-in-chief of Bon Appetit resigned, and artists pledged to speak out about racism in theater. Artists launch a campaign to talk about racism in American theater Hundreds of black theater-makers and other artists of color have written an open letter to the \u201cWhite American Theater,\u201d pledging to support each other as they \u201cfearlessly share our many truths\u201d about the racism they have experienced in the industry from \u201ctheaters, executive leaders, critics, casting directors, agents, unions, commercial producers, universities and training programs.\u201d \u201cYou are all a part of this house of cards built on white fragility and white supremacy,\u201d the artists wrote. \u201cWe are about to introduce you...to yourself.\u201d The open letter does not tell any specific stories or name any names. It appears that theater artists know something about suspense. The campaign has a website, a Change.org petition for supporters to sign (nearly 15,000 signatures), and a hashtag, #WeSeeYou. Prominent actors, directors, playwrights and other artists have already expressed their support. Protest for Erik Salgado in Oakland drew an estimated 1,500 people A protest today demanding justice for the 23-year-old shot to death by the California Highway Patrol in Oakland on Saturday night drew more than a thousand people, organizers estimated. Witnesses told journalists that officers shot Erik Salgado\u2019s car more than 20 to 40 times. His pregnant girlfriend, who was also in the car, was shot and is now in the hospital. Salgado leaves behind a three-year-old daughter, NBC Bay Area reports. \u201cThis country was built on black and brown bodies... It\u2019s unacceptable its systems don\u2019t work for us, the ones who built it,\u201d 15-year-old Luna Ekundayo told The Guardian. The Oakland Police Department has yet to release the names of the highway patrol officers who shot Salgado and his girlfriend, a local ABC station reported. White liberals have long fought against integration. Will they change? Public opinion on police violence towards black Americans is shifting profoundly, with a majority of the public believing that \u201cthe police are more likely to use excessive force with a black person than a white person in similar situations,\u201d according to a poll last week. But America\u2019s violent policing system is deeply intertwined with larger systems of racial segregation in housing, education, and transit. And it\u2019s white liberals, in America\u2019s most supposedly progressive cities, who have been fighting to maintain that segregation, New York Times education reporter Dana Goldstein noted today, referencing journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones\u2019 reporting on American school segregation, as well as reporting on affordable housing. \u201cWill this moment evolve into a broader policy reckoning?\u201d Goldstein asked. Kentucky\u2019s governor promises healthcare to all black residents \u201cMy commitment today is we\u2019re going to begin an effort to cover 100 percent of our individuals in our black and African American communities,\u201d Kentucky\u2019s Democratic governor Andy Beshear said today, according to the Lexington Herald-Leader. \u201cEverybody. We\u2019re going to be putting dollars behind it, we\u2019re going to have a multifaceted campaign to do it.\u201d Details of how Beshear\u2019s administration would fulfill the pledge remain unclear, local news outlets reported. Black Kentucky residents represent 16% of the state\u2019s coronavirus cases but only make up 8% of the state\u2019s population, according to the Louisville Courier Journal. Some images from Houston, where thousands of mourners braved the sweltering heat on Monday to view George Floyd\u2019s casket and attend a vigil. His funeral will be held tomorrow. California protesters march for Erik Salgado, killed by police last night On Saturday night, 23-year-old Erik Salgado was shot and killed by California Highway Patrol officers in Oakland. NBC Bay Area reported that Salgado\u2019s family said he was unarmed. Neighbors told journalists that officers fired dozens of rounds into the car, with estimates of more than 20 to more than 40 shots. Salgado\u2019s pregnant girlfriend was also shot, but survived, and is now in the hospital with gunshot wounds, NBC Bay Area reported. Today, protesters are marching for Erik Salgado in Oakland. Read more about activists working to amplify the stories of the many American killed by the police in the wake of global protests over George Floyd\u2019s death. The force of furious national protests over racist policing is rippling through many different industries now, as workers speak up about racist practices and racist bosses in culture industries like fashion, publishing, and media. The editor-in-chief of beloved cooking brand Bon Appetit announced today that he is stepping down after photographs of him in \u201cbrown face\u201d were recirculated on social media, and an editor spoke out about the \u201csystemic racism\u201d she had experienced at Bon Appetit and its parent company Conde Nast, including alleging that \u201ccurrently only white editors are paid for their video appearances.\u201d (A company spokesperson told Variety that was not true, but did not offer details.) Bon Appetit\u2019s popular test kitchen videos had already attracted scrutiny, with Bay Area food writer Soleil Ho describing in January \u201chow often staffers of color are sidelined or relegated to cameos on their white colleagues\u2019 shows.\u201d \u201cThe way we define what is contemporary and fashionable in food is tied to whiteness as a cultural norm \u2014 and to its ability to incorporate other cultures without actually becoming them,\u201d Navneet Alang wrote last month in a feature for Eater on Bon Appetit\u2019s test kitchen, and on the way that white chefs like Alison Roman have profited from marketing watered-down, rebranded recipes from other cultures. The Bon Appetit editor once publicly confused the names of two of his employees of color, as Guardian culture writer Andr\u00e9 Wheeler noted today. Adam Rapoport announced his resignation on Instagram. The presumptive Democratic nominee for president shared a meal with George Floyd\u2019s family at an acclaimed black-owned restaurant in Houston today, CultureMap Houston reported. Joe Biden traveled to Houston to give his condolences to Floyd\u2019s family in advance of his funeral tomorrow. The New York Daily News reported that Biden \u201cmet for more than an hour with Floyd\u2019s brother Philonise Floyd, his uncle Roger Floyd, two of his children and an aunt,\u201d according to the Rev Al Sharpton, who was also at the meeting. In Houston, lines of people waited in the heat to pay their respects to George Floyd, who is from the city\u2019s Third Ward, the Houston Chronicle reported. In Los Angeles, in honor of Floyd, mourners joined four different funeral processions that converged downtown. Texas\u2019 Republican governor, Greg Abbott, paid his respects in Houston, the New York Daily News reported, after calling Floyd\u2019s killing a \u201chorrific act of police brutality\u201d. Army will consider renaming bases named after Confederate generals Some of the US army\u2019s largest military bases are named after Confederate military commanders, including Fort Lee, in Virginia, and Fort Bragg, in North Carolina. The New York Times editorial board has called for renaming military bases \u201cfor American heroes \u2013 not racist traitors,\u201d and argued that the military\u2019s current practice is a celebration of white supremacy. As recently as late February, the army said it had no interest in renaming bases named after confederate generals. But George Floyd\u2019s killing and the protests that followed have changed that, Politico reports. Now, \u201cThe Secretary of the army is open to a bipartisan discussion on the topic,\u201d an army spokesperson told Politico. An unnamed army official said the protests \u201cmade us start looking more at ourselves and the things that we do and how that is communicated to the force as well as the American public.\u201d 23-year-old faces federal charges in Minnesota police precinct arson A 23-year-old man from St. Paul. Minnesota, is facing federal charges for \u201caiding and abetting arson\u201d at the Minnesota police department\u2019s Third Precinct building, which burned on the night of May 28, during outrage over the police killing of George Floyd, federal prosecutors announced Monday. Authorities said the 23-year-old was \u201cwearing multiple items stolen from the Third Precinct, including body armor, a police-issue duty belt with handcuffs, an earphone piece, baton, and knife,\u201d at the time of his arrest on June 3, and that law enforcement later found other items taken from the police department in his apartment, including a riot helmet, an ammunition magazine, and a police radio. The U.S. attorney\u2019s office said they located the 23-year-old after receiving a complaint from a home improvement store that he was trying to get into the store after being fired from his job as a security guard earlier that day. Employees said he had been fired after referring to social media posts about stealing from the police, officials said. Local Minneapolis news station KIMT3 ran photographs of 23-year-old, showing a young white man wearing body armor and handcuffs. Portland\u2019s police chief is resigning; new police chief is African American Amid continuing protests over police violence towards black Americans, the white police chief of Portland, Oregon, has announced she is resigning. An African American lieutenant in the department will become the new police chief, The Oregonian reports. \u201cI have listened and our community and you have said show us change,\u201d police chief Jami Reisch tweeted. \u201cThis change in leadership comes from my heart.\u201d Reisch said the decision to resign was her own, and that she would continue to hold a different role within the police department, The Oregonian reported. A \u2018misleading\u2019 headline on asymptomatic transmission, experts say There\u2019s an attention-grabbing headline from CNBC today: \u201cAsymptomatic spread of coronavirus is \u2018very rare,\u2019 WHO says.\u201d CNBC quotes Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, the head of WHO\u2019s emerging diseases and zoonosis unit, who said during a press briefing in Geneva that \u201cFrom the data we have, it still seems to be rare that an asymptomatic person actually transmits onward to a secondary individual.\u201d If it\u2019s \u201cvery rare\u201d that people without symptoms are transmitting coronavirus, many people are asking, then why are members of the general public required to wear masks? Several public health experts cautioned that the WHO\u2019s conclusion may be much less dramatic than it appears, and criticized both WHO\u2019s communication on the issue and the way that CNBC has covered the story. Dr Ashish Jha, the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, and professor Carl Bergstrom, an infectious disease expert at the University of Washington, made similar points. The upshot, both experts suggested: there\u2019s a difference between people who are \u201ctruly asymptomatic\u201d, meaning that they would test positive for Covid-19 but never develop any symptoms of the disease, and people who are \u201cpre-symptomatic\u201d, meaning that they haven\u2019t developed symptoms yet, but will in a few days. Both experts said they think the WHO was referring only to \u201ctruly asymptomatic people\u201d, and suggesting that those people rarely spread the disease. But that second category of people, the ones who still feel fine but are actually infected and can pass on the virus to other people, are a major reason why the public should wear masks even when they feel fine, the experts said. We\u2019ll be asking the WHO for more clarification on this issue. Coronavirus transmission rate rising in Los Angeles, Bay Area Los Angeles is seeing an uptick in the transmission rate for people with coronavirus, which public health experts attribute to the loosening of stay-at-home restrictions, the Los Angeles Times reports. So is the Bay Area. This uptick predates any changes in coronavirus infections that may result from the massive public demonstrations against police killings of black Americans, and the subsequent large numbers of arrests, public health experts said. The Trump campaign is planning to start holding campaign rallies again \u201cin the next two weeks\u201d, Politico reports. What safety measures may be put in place, and how the number of coronavirus cases in different areas will affect the location for rallies, remains unclear. In a statement on resuming the president\u2019s crowded, in-person rallies during a global pandemic, Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Brad Parscale, told Politico, \u201cYou\u2019ll again see the kind of crowds and enthusiasm that sleepy Joe Biden can only dream of.\u201d The Trump campaign plans to respond to any criticism about the danger of holding rallies by comparing his campaign rallies with the enormous protests against police violence towards black Americans that have taken place across the country, despite the threat of Covid-19. \u201cTrump hasn\u2019t held a rally since March, though in recent weeks he has used ostensibly official events to visit swing states,\u201d the Politico reporter Alex Isenstadt notes. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Lois Beckett, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: A judge set a $1-1.25m bail for Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who has been charged with second-degree murder in connection to the killing of George Floyd. Thousands of people paid their respects to Floyd in Houston, Texas. Thousands attended a public visitation to view Floyd\u2019s casket, and a memorial service will be held tomorrow. Congressional Democrats unveiled their sweeping police reform bill. The Justice in Policing Act would nationally ban chokeholds and create a national police misconduct registry, but many criminal justice activists have said reforms do not go far enough to address police brutality. A group of economists said the US entered a recession in February. According to a committee of economists at the national bureau of economic research, the US economy entered a period of recession as businesses started to close down in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Kayleigh McEnany said the White House had \u201cno regrets\u201d about forcibly removing peaceful protesters last week. The White House press secretary claimed the attorney general and the US park police made the decision to use tear gas against the protesters, but she said, \u201cThere\u2019s no regrets on the part of this White House.\u201d The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Trump emphasized his opposition to the defund the police movement during a lawn enforcement roundtable at the White House. \u201cWe won\u2019t be defunding our police. We won\u2019t be dismantling our police. We won\u2019t be disbanding our police,\u201d the president said moments ago. \u201cWe won\u2019t be ending our police force in a city. I guess you might have some cities who want to try it, but that would be a very sad situation if they did.\u201d The president\u2019s comments come one day after the Minneapolis city council pledged to disband the city\u2019s police department and replace it with a new public safety system. US attorney general William Barr said this afternoon that there are no plans to extradite Prince Andrew to the United States for questioning in the sex crimes case involving the late financier Jeffrey Epstein. Asked during a Fox News interview whether the US has officially asked Britain to hand over the prince, Barr said: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a question of handing him over. I think it\u2019s just a question of having him provide some evidence.\u201d Asked if Prince Andrew would be extradited, Barr said \u201cNo\u201d, Reuters reports. Lawyers for the prince earlier today accused US prosecutors of misleading the public and breaching their own confidentiality rules in their handling of the investigation into the disgraced financier and child sex offender, the Guardian reports. In a strongly worded, two-page statement, Blackfords, the London-based criminal law specialists, alleged that the US Department of Justice (DoJ) had effectively rejected offers of help volunteered by the prince. Epstein was found dead in a New York prison cell last year where he was being held on charges of sex trafficking girls as young as 14. The prince had known the billionaire since 1999 and stayed at several of his residences. Epstein has been convicted years earlier in Florida of certain offenses, involving a plea deal, but was arrested last year and faced fresh and more serious charges. But the federal prosecutor for the Southern District of New York, US attorney Geoffrey Berman, issued the following statement in response to Prince Andrew\u2019s legal team, Axios reports: Today, Prince Andrew yet again sought to falsely portray himself to the public as eager and willing to cooperate with an ongoing federal criminal investigation into sex trafficking and related offenses committed by Jeffrey Epstein and his associates, even though the Prince has not given an interview to federal authorities, has repeatedly declined our request to schedule such an interview, and nearly four months ago informed us unequivocally \u2014 through the very same counsel who issued today\u2019s release \u2014 that he would not come in for such an interview. If Prince Andrew is, in fact, serious about cooperating with the ongoing federal investigation, our doors remain open, and we await word of when we should expect him.\u201d When asked about the barriers around Lafayette Square during her White House briefing, press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the matter was not in White House control. McEnany acknowledged that the DC protests, like those across the country, have been mostly peaceful, but the press secretary claimed the fencing was a security matter and thus \u201cnot a decision for the White House.\u201d House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer are now calling on Trump to remove the barriers, arguing Lafayette Square \u201chas long been a venue where Americans can gather to freely exercise their constitutional rights in close proximity to the White House.\u201d An update on former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who appeared in court today charged with second degree murder in the death of George Floyd two weeks ago. He and the other three now-ex-officers charged in the case all remain behind bars at this point. Chauvin, 44, said almost nothing during an 11-minute hearing in which he appeared before Hennepin County Judge Jeannice Reding on closed-circuit television from the state\u2019s maximum security prison in Oak Park Heights, the AP reports. Chauvin\u2019s unconditional bond had been raised from $500,000 to $1 million when a second-degree murder charge was added on Wednesday. Monday\u2019s hearing was a chance for arguments over the higher bail. Chauvin\u2019s attorney, Eric Nelson, did not contest the increased bail and didn\u2019t address the substance of the charges, which also include third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Nelson did not speak with reporters afterward. Chauvin\u2019s next appearance was set for June 29 at 1.30 p.m. Chauvin, a white officer, pressed his knee into Floyd\u2019s neck during an arrest attempt, as Floyd, a black member of the public, was held down on the street and pleaded with him, struggling to say \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d until he eventually became silent and died. Chauvin and three other officers on the scene were fired the day after. The other three officers J. Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao are charged with aiding and abetting the murder of Floyd. They remain in the Hennepin County jail on $750,000 bond. The World Bank said today that humanity is facing an unprecedented health and economic crisis that has spread with astonishing speed and will result in the largest shock the global economy has witnessed in more than seven decades. Millions of people are expected to be pushed into extreme poverty, the Associated Press reports. In an updated \u201cGlobal Economic Prospects,\u201d the World Bank projected that global economic activity will shrink by 5.2% this year, the deepest recession since a 13.8% global contraction in 1945-46 at the end of World War II. The 5.2% downturn this year will be the fourth worst global downturn over the past 150 years, exceeded only by the Great Depression of the 1930s and the periods after World War I and World War II when the economies of many war-torn countries were devastated and the United States and other nations demobilized after massive defense buildups. Because of the steep contraction, the amount of income per person is expected to fall sharply, with more than 90% of emerging market and developing countries seeing per capita incomes declining. For all countries, the drop in per capital incomes is expected to average 6.2%, much larger than the 2.9% fall during the 2009 financial recession. Reflecting this downward pressure on incomes, World Bank economists said they expected the number of people in extreme poverty could grow by between 70 million and 100 million this year. The 5.2% estimate for a decline in global output is 7.7 percentage-points more severe than the World Bank\u2019s January estimate that the world economy would grow by a modest 2.5% this year. For the United States, the updated World Bank forecast is for GDP to fall 7% this year, before growing 3.9% in 2021. That estimate is similar to top forecasters for the National Association for Business Economics who forecast a 5.9% drop in for the U.S. this year. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer are calling on Trump to reopen Lafayette Square, the park near the White House that has been barricaded off from the public since last week\u2019s George Floyd protests. The House speaker and Senate minority leader said in a letter to the president that Lafayette Square \u201chas long been a venue where Americans can gather to freely exercise their constitutional rights in close proximity to the White House.\u201d Barriers have been erected around the public square in response to the mostly peaceful protests in DC, and administration officials have not been transparent about when the barriers might be removed. The Democratic leaders wrote, \u201cLafayette Square should be a symbol of freedom and openness, not a place behind which the leader of our Executive Branch cowers in fear of protesters who are crying out for justice.\u201d White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany just wrapped up her briefing, during which she was asked whether Trump still believes NFL players who kneel during the national anthem should be fired. \u201cThe president is very much against kneeling in general,\u201d McEnany said. \u201cHe\u2019s not a fan of the kneeling movement. He\u2019s made that very clear.\u201d However, the press secretary would not explicitly say whether the president still believes players who kneel during the national anthem to protest police brutality should be fired. Last night, Trump criticized NFL commissioner Roger Goodell for saying that the league had mishandled the players\u2019 protests and encouraging players to \u201cspeak out\u201d about police brutality. \u201cCould it be even remotely possible that in Roger Goodell\u2019s rather interesting statement of peace and reconciliation, he was intimating that it would now be O.K. for the players to KNEEL, or not to stand, for the National Anthem, thereby disrespecting our Country &amp; our Flag?\u201d Trump wrote in a tweet. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany lashed out against Mitt Romney after the Republican senator participated in a protest against police brutality over the weekend. McEnany recounted some of Romney\u2019s gaffes during his 2012 presidential campaign and went on to brag that Trump got 8% of the black vote, while Romney got 2%. But exit polls indicate Romney actually got 6% of the black vote when he ran against Barack Obama in 2012, and needless to say, both men received very little support from African Americans, which is something the Republican party as a whole has struggled with. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the administration stands by the decision to forcibly remove peaceful protesters using tear gas last week. \u201cThere\u2019s no regrets on the part of this White House,\u201d McEnany said of the decision, which sparked international outcry. McEnany tried to shift responsibility for the decision to attorney general William Barr and the US park police. When again asked whether Trump is sorry about the way protesters were removed, McEnany deflected by saying, \u201cThe president is sorry about the fact that Antifa wreaked havoc on our streets.\u201d White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany emphasized that Trump is strongly opposed to proposals to defund police departments. The president \u201cis appalled by the defund the police movement,\u201d McEnany said during her White House briefing. When McEnany was pressed on whether Trump believes there is systemic racism in law enforcement, she said the president thinks there are \u201cinstances of racism\u201d among police officers but they are overall \u201cgood, hard-working people.\u201d A judge has set a $1-$1.25 million bail for Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who has been charged with second-degree murder in connection to the killing of George Floyd. Chauvin virtually appeared in court today to face charges of murder and manslaughter after he was filmed keeping his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for nearly nine minutes. Judge Jeannice Reding granted the prosecutors\u2019 motion to set unconditional bail at $1.25 million, or $1 million with conditions, which included being law-abiding, making future court appearances and surrendering firearms. Joe Biden met with George Floyd\u2019s family in Houston, where the family will soon hold a memorial for Floyd, who was killed in police custody two weeks ago. The family allowed the public to view Floyd\u2019s casket today before the memorial, and thousands have already attended the visitation. Here\u2019s some unsurprising but still alarming news: the US economy entered a recession in February, according to a committee of economists at the national bureau of economic research. The economists said today that the depth of the country\u2019s economic downturn since February led them to conclude a recession had started, ending the longest expansion on record. \u201cThe unprecedented magnitude of the decline in employment and production, and its broad reach across the entire economy, warrants the designation of this episode as a recession, even if it turns out to be briefer than earlier contractions,\u201d the NBER panel said. The news comes after Friday\u2019s jobs report showed the country\u2019s unemployment rate had dropped slightly to a still-high figure of 13.3%. More than 42 million Americans have applied for unemployment benefits since the start of the coronavirus crisis, and many businesses remain shuttered due to social distancing restrictions. The Trump campaign is still trying to link Joe Biden to the movement to defund police departments, even though a Biden spokesperson has issued a statement saying he does not support the idea. \u201cJoe Biden cannot be let off the hook after his campaign issued a weak statement from a mid-level staffer,\u201d said Tim Murtaugh, the communications director of the Trump campaign. \u201cWe have previously seen the Biden campaign say one thing on an issue right before their candidate says another. Until Americans hear from Joe Biden himself, they have no way of knowing where he really stands.\u201d The statement seemed a bit odd coming from a staffer for Trump, who has become well known for throwing the White House into chaos after sending an unexpected tweet that caught his aides by surprise. A leader of the Virginia KKK has been arrested for driving into a group of demonstrators yesterday, who were protesting the killing of George Floyd in police custody. Harry Rogers appeared in court in Henrico county this morning and was charged with attempted malicious wounding, felony vandalism, and assault and battery. No one was seriously injured in the attack. \u201cThe accused, by his own admission and by a cursory glance at social media, is an admitted leader of the Ku Klux Klan and a propagandist for Confederate ideology,\u201d Henrico county commonwealth\u2019s attorney Shannon Taylor said in a statement. Taylor said her office was investigating whether hate crime charges \u201care appropriate\u201d in the case. \u201cWhile I am grateful that the victim\u2019s injuries do not appear to be serious, an attack on peaceful protesters is heinous and despicable and we will prosecute to the fullest extent of the law,\u201d Taylor said. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Congressional Democrats unveiled their sweeping police reform bill. The legislation would nationally ban police chokeholds and create a national police misconduct registry, but many criminal justice activists have said reforms do not go far enough to address police brutality. The former police officer charged with George Floyd\u2019s murder is expected to appear in court today. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who has been charged with second-degree murder in connection to Floyd\u2019s death, is scheduled to appear in court in about 45 minutes. New York started its reopening process today. Hundreds of thousands of employees returned to work today in the city, where more than 21,000 people have died of coronavirus. However, many businesses, such as hair salons and gyms, remain closed. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Joe Biden\u2019s statement expressing opposition to defunding police departments comes shortly after the Trump campaign held a press call about the movement. The president and his allies have sought to tie all Democrats to calls to defund police departments, which have intensified since the killing of George Floyd. However, many of the Democratic party\u2019s leaders seem hesitant to endorse the movement, and congressional Democrats just unveiled legislation to reform police departments rather than defund them. A spokesperson for Joe Biden said the presumptive Democratic nominee does not support defunding the police, as a number of criminal justice activists have called for after the killing of George Floyd. Campaign spokesperson Andrew Bates said in a statement that Biden \u201chears and shares the deep grief and frustration of those calling out for change, and is driven to ensure that justice is done and that we put a stop to this terrible pain.\u201d Bates said the former vice president \u201csupports the urgent need for reform,\u201d including proposals to fund community policing programs and diversify cities\u2019 police forces, but some activists have said such reforms do not go far enough to crack down on police brutality. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said anyone who participated in George Floyd protests should get a coronavirus test, as New York City starts to reopen. The Democratic governor held his daily briefing today as the city entered phase one of its reopening process, after the coronavirus infection rate there started to slow. Cuomo said the city would be conducting 35,000 tests a day to begin the reopening. Cuomo also implored state legislators to pass police reform legislation, which would ban chokeholds and make police disciplinary records transparent, in response to the killing of Floyd. House speaker Nancy Pelosi and congressional black caucus chairwoman Karen Bass tip-toed around a reporter\u2019s question about the movement to defund the police. The Justice in Policing Act focuses on police reform rather than police defunding, which some criminal justice advocates have pushed for. Pelosi said of the calls to shift police budgets to other government programs, \u201cWe could rebalance some of our funding to address those issues more directly.\u201d Bass noted the bill would not provide any new money to police departments and would allocate funds for community grants to potentially reenvision what policing could look like. House Democratic caucus chair Hakeem Jeffries argued the Justice in Policing Act would help to crack down on police brutality and hold officers accountable. \u201cUnless there is accountability, there will never be change,\u201d Jeffries said. \u201cUnless there\u2019s change, brutality will continue, and we\u2019ll be trapped in a vicious cycle of anguish &amp; despair.\u201d The New York Democrat added, \u201cAll we ever wanted is to be treated equally. Not better, not worse. Equally. Why has that been so difficult to achieve?\u201d As congressional Democrats held a press conference on their police reform bill, House minority leader Kevin McCarthy sent a tweet in support of the nation\u2019s police officers. \u201cTo the police officers across the country who put on the uniform every day and uphold their oath\u2014THANK YOU,\u201d McCarthy said in the tweet. \u201cDemocrats want to defund you, but Republicans will never turn our backs on you.\u201d The Justice in Policing Act being introduced by Democratic lawmakers focuses on reforming policing, by banning chokeholds and incentivizing racial bias trainings, not defunding departments. Senator Cory Booker praised the details of the Justice in Policing Act, which he said would help hold police officers accountable. \u201cEmpathy and sympathy and words of caring for those who have died and suffered are necessary, but it is not enough,\u201d Booker, who is African American, said. \u201cWe must change laws and systems of accountability.\u201d Senator Kamala Harris, the only other African American Democrat in the Senate, added, \u201cWe\u2019re here because black Americans want to stop being killed.\u201d Harris emphasized the country still had a long way to go on racial justice, noting the Senate could not approve an anti-lynching bill just last week after Republican Rand Paul blocked its passage. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer called on majority leader Mitch McConnell to put the Justice in Policing Act on the floor before July. The bill will likely pass the Democratic-controlled House, but McConnell has previously held up key pieces of legislation passed by House Democrats. Schumer pledged that Senate Democrats would \u201cfight like hell\u201d to get a vote on the police reform bill, but the Democratic leader has few options when it comes to pressuring McConnell to take up the legislation. House speaker Nancy Pelosi reflected on the moment of silence that lawmakers observed for George Floyd in Emancipation Hall this morning. Just before unveiling the Justice in Policing Act, congressional Democrats kneeled for eight minutes and 46 seconds, in observation of the lenght of time that a police officer had his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck. \u201cMy members will attest, it is a very long time,\u201d Pelosi said. The Democratic speaker said \u201cthe martyrdom of George Floyd\u201d has sparked nationwide protests, which has now inspired this piece of legislation. \u201cThis moment of national anguish is being transformed into a movement of national action,\u201d Pelosi said. After reading out the names of some of the people who have been killed in police custody, Pelosi said, \u201cWe cannot settle for anything less than transformative, structural change.\u201d Congressional Democrats are now holding a press conference to introduce their sweeping police reform bill in response to the recent killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. Karen Bass, the chairwoman of the congressional black caucus, said the Justice in Policing Act would help prevent future deaths in police custody, and she applauded the protests against police brutality in recent weeks. \u201cThe world is witnessing the birth of a new movement in our country,\u201d Bass said. Democratic lawmakers held a moment of silence on Capitol Hill in honor of George Floyd, minutes before they are exepcted to reveal a bill aimed at cracking down on police brutality. Congressional Democrats kneeled in Emancipation Hall for eight minutes and 46 seconds to recognize the length of time that a police officer had his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck. The number of people fatally shot by police each year has been frighteningly stable in recent years, despite recurring protests against police brutality that have spread across the country in recent weeks, since the killing of George Floyd. According to the Washington Post\u2019s database on police shootings, officers have shot and killed nearly 1,000 people every year since 2015. The Post reports: Protests against the use of deadly force by police swept across the country in 2015. ... That year, The Washington Post began tallying how many people were shot and killed by police. By the end of 2015, officers had fatally shot nearly 1,000 people, twice as many as ever documented in one year by the federal government. With the issue flaring in city after city, some officials vowed to reform how police use force. The next year, however, police nationwide again shot and killed nearly 1,000 people. Then they fatally shot about the same number in 2017 \u2014 and have done so for every year after that, according to The Post\u2019s ongoing count. Since 2015, police have shot and killed 5,400 people. ... Even amid the coronavirus pandemic and orders that kept millions at home for weeks, police shot and killed 463 people through the first week of June \u2014 49 more than the same period in 2019. In May, police shot and killed 110 people, the most in any one month since The Post began tracking it. The criminal justice activists who have pushed to defund police departments have pointed to the stable statistics to argue that reforms like body cameras and racial bias training will not be enough to crack down on police brutality. Congressional Democrats are expected to release their bill aimed at cracking down on police brutality today, two weeks after George Floyd was killed while in police custody. The bill is expected to include a national ban on police chokeholds and the creation of a national police misconduct registry \u201cto prevent problem officers from changing jurisdictions to avoid accountability,\u201d according to CNN. The legislation will also incentivize racial bias training for officers and include the anti-lynching measure that has stalled in the Senate, which sparked a heated argument on the Senate floor last week after Republican Rand Paul blocked the proposal. The Democratic legislation will almost certanly attract criticism from criminal justice activists, some of whom have argued that such reforms do not go far enough to address police brutality and have thus pushed to defund departments instead. New York will start its reopening process today, nearly three months after the iconic city came to a standstill because of the coronavirus pandemic. Hundreds of thousands of workers will return to work today as the city enters \u201cphase one\u201d of the reopening. While construction sites and retail stores can now resume operations with social distancing restrictions in place, businesses like hair salons and gyms will remain shuttered. New York lost more people to coronavirus than any other US city, with more than 21,000 of the city\u2019s residents dying in the past few months. This morning\u2019s front-page story of the New York Times captures the losses that have preceded this moment and the challenges that still lie ahead: Getting here took the sacrifice of millions of New Yorkers who learned to live radically different lives. More than 205,000 have been infected, and nearly 22,000 have died. As many as 400,000 workers could begin returning to construction jobs, manufacturing sites and retail stores in the city\u2019s first phase of reopening\u2014 a surge of normalcy that seemed almost inconceivable several weeks ago, when the city\u2019s hospitals were at a breaking point and as many as 800 people were dying from Covid-19 on a single day. ... State and city officials said they were optimistic that the city would begin to spring back to life. Testing is robust, reaching 33,000 people on a recent day. And new infections are now down to around 500 a day \u2014 half as many as there were just a few weeks ago. ... The road back will undoubtedly be challenging. More than 885,000 jobs vanished during the outbreak, and strong gains are not expected for the city until 2022. The city budget hemorrhaged tax revenue and now faces a $9 billion shortfall over the next year. And the reopening has been complicated by the vast protests for racial justice that have swept the city for more than a week and have forced government officials and business owners to unexpectedly adjust their plans. This is Joan Greve in Washington, taking over for Oliver Holmes. As the country grapples with the question of whether to defund police departments after the killing of George Floyd, the president is busy griping about his polling numbers. \u201cCNN Polls are as Fake as their Reporting,\u201d Trump wrote in a tweet. \u201cSame numbers, and worse, against Crooked Hillary. The Dems would destroy America!\u201d The tweet comes after a CNN poll found Trump to be 14 points down against Joe Biden, with his approval rating sliding 7 points to 38%. That\u2019s his worst approval rating in the CNN poll since January 2019, and, at this point in a first term, it puts Trump on par with former presidents Jimmy Carter and George HW Bush, who both went on to lose reelection. The poll comes as the president\u2019s reelection campaign has reportedly started worrying about his standing in states like Ohio and Iowa, which would be must-win states in order to have any chance at a second term. Thank you for all your emails and messages. I\u2019m going to sign off now and hand over to my US-based colleague and live news pro, Joan E Greve. There\u2019s quite a bit of chatter online about Republican Senator Mitt Romney, who was seen among roughly 1,000 Black Lives Matter demonstrators on Sunday marching to the White House. Ren\u00e9e Graham, a columnist for the Boston Globe, considers it a stunt: Eugene Scott, a Washington Post writer covering identity politics, argues that the amount of credit Romney is getting is unwarranted: Derek Chauvin, the fired Minneapolis Police Department officer who pressed his knee on the neck of George Floyd for nearly nine minutes, will make his first appearance in court later today, US media is reporting. Chauvin, 44, is scheduled to appear at the Hennepin County District Court in Minneapolis at 12.45pm Central time (roughly six hours from now). He faces charges of third-degree murder, second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. I\u2019ve been contacted by a reader who said they grew up near the city of Vidor, in east Texas. He wanted to alert me to a Black Lives Matter protest there on Saturday that consisted of just around 150 people. But it is significant, the reader said, because of Vidor\u2019s reputation. Here\u2019s an excerpt from the Texas Monthly magazine, which covered the protest: Vidor has been known for many things\u2014among them the activities of the local Ku Klux Klan; its status as a \u201csundown town,\u201d in which blacks were not allowed in city limits after dark; and an ugly fight in the early nineties over a federal effort to desegregate public housing in the city, which caused Texas Monthly, in a cover story that year, to describe Vidor as Texas\u2019s \u201cmost hate-filled town.\u201d The census estimates it to be 91 percent white. So when word started to circulate that a Black Lives Matter rally was being planned in Vidor, many people on social media thought it was a trap\u2014and expressed skepticism the event\u2019s supposed planner, 23-year-old Maddy Malone, even existed. (She does.) To black folks with knowledge of the region, who had been told never to stop in Vidor, the idea seemed insane. \u201cA civil rights rally in Vidor\u201d is the punchline to a joke, not a thing that could happen in this world. C\u2019mon. The demonstration \u201cmay not seem like much\u201d, wrote the reader in an email, \u201cbut when they gather in Vidor, Texas, that\u2019s a big deal.\u201d Big news from the weekend is certainly that the Minneapolis city council pledged to disband the police department. The embattled agency responsible for George Floyd\u2019s death could now be replaced by an alternative model of community-led safety. The nine councilmembers who announced their support represent a supermajority on the twelve-person council, meaning Mayor Jacob Frey, who opposes the move, could not override it. Frey was heckled by a crowd of protesters on Saturday when he ruled out defunding the police department. Here\u2019s a video of Frey walking through the crowds as they shout: \u201cGo home!\u201d Note: this post was amended to make clear a vote had not yet taken place. George Floyd\u2019s body has been flown to his hometown of Houston, Texas, where mourners will be able to view his casket on Monday. A six-hour viewing will be held at The Fountain of Praise church in southwest Houston, the final stop of a series of memorials across the country. Visitors in Houston will be required to wear a mask and gloves, as per coronavirus restrictions. Floyd\u2019s funeral will be held on Tuesday, where he will be buried next to his mother, Larcenia Floyd. Previous memorials have taken place in Raeford, North Carolina, near where Floyd was born, and Minneapolis, where he lived at the end of his life and was killed. Mourners there observed 8 minutes 46 seconds of silence - the period that Floyd was filmed pinned under a police officer\u2019s knee. Three Guardian writers have just published features that take a deeper look at the protest movement: Lois Beckett, who covers gun violence and the far right in the US, has been interviewing family members of black Americans who were killed by police or white vigilantes for whom the past week has been painfully familiar. But they also see signs of change, she writes: \u201cI think people have had enough,\u201d said Sybrina Fulton, whose unarmed 17-year-old son Trayvon [Martin] was shot to death in 2012 by a neighborhood watch volunteer, George Zimmerman, who was later acquitted of all charges. Adam Gabbatt, who writes for us from New York, has also been looking at the potential impact of the movement, particularly around whether it could energize young voters in presidential, state and local elections. There is precedent for real change inspired by protests, he writes. In recent years the youth-led protests against gun violence following the Parkland school shooting, led to stronger gun laws, while young climate activists succeeded in drawing attention to the Green New Deal environment legislation, which many Democratic politicians have since endorsed. Finally, Michael Sainato, a contributor who covers civil rights issues, has written about the large numbers of protesters, more than 10,000, who have been arrested around the US. Many were non-violent: Ruby Anderson was arrested while non-violently protesting in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 31 May. The police refused to provide a reason for her detention until they were placed in a police van, where they were told the charge was loitering. They were given a wristband that stated \u201cunlawful assembly\u201d and ultimately charged with disorderly conduct. \u201cWhile I was arrested, I was standing next to two white people who were doing the same thing as me, standing between a group of officers and a group of black teenagers. I was the only one arrested in my group of three, I was the only black person,\u201d Anderson said. Read Sainato\u2019s full story here: Hello\u2026 \u2026and welcome to a fresh US politics live blog as we enter a new day on Monday across the US. The sun has risen in New York while it is still the early hours of the morning along the West Coast. I\u2019m Oliver Holmes, and I\u2019ll be with you for the next couple of hours. You can reach me via Twitter and also on email: oliver.holmes [@] theguardian.com Please do send anything you think is worth including on our blog. For those who have been sleeping or offline, here is an update with the main developments: The Minneapolis city council pledged to abolish the city\u2019s police department and replace it with a new system of public safety. The historic move has been hailed as the first concrete victory in the mounting nationwide movement in the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd. New York City\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio, pledged to cut police department funding. The money will be given to Youth and Social Services. The mayor also lifted a contentious citywide curfew. A protester was shot in Seattle, Washington. A man drove a car into a demonstration and shot a demonstrator. Police said officers have a man in custody. The US soccer federation is considering repealing its ban on players kneeling during the national anthem, ESPN has reported.",

      "bodyText": "\u2018What are you most looking forward to about going home?\u201d Andrew Burnham, a Covid-19 patient at University hospital in Coventry, is asked. \u201cJust getting out of the hospital,\u201d the 65-year-old says abruptly. \u201cWe\u2019re not that bad are we?\u201d quips one of the nearby nurses. \u201cNo, I\u2019m just going stir crazy,\u201d he says. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen my family for 10 weeks. It\u2019s going to be quite incredible. I don\u2019t know if I can give them a big hug straight away \u2013 I might have to keep 2 metres away. But if I can, oh I will.\u201d Burnham spent six of the past 10 weeks in intensive care and has required extensive physiotherapy to rehabilitate his body. Today, he\u2019s finally going home. Dr Vjeran Cajic, a consultant in infectious diseases, says: \u201cThe success rate of patients treated in ITU [intensive care] for Covid is not more than 50%. Without support for his breathing, Mr Burnham would definitely have died. But we\u2019re not surprised [he\u2019s going home]. As doctors, we provide treatment when we feel there\u2019s a chance we will be successful, so any good outcome is a reason to be happy, not surprised.\u201d Though visibly drained and still short of breath, Burnham is thankful to the NHS. \u201cI appreciate an awful lot of people put an awful lot of effort into keeping us going,\u201d he says. As he is wheeled out of the ward by an ambulance crew, the corridor is lined with well-wishers: the people who saved his life are clapping him out. Reunited ____________________ Since the start of the pandemic, 537 patients have been discharged from University hospital, which is part of the UHCW trust, and the hospital now has only six patients with Covid-19; to date, 248 patients have died from, or with, coronavirus. Molly Phillis, 84, and her husband, John, 83, were discharged from University hospital last month. The couple, who have been together for 63 years, were admitted days apart and kept on separate wards. John and Molly Phillis, who were treated in hospital for Covid-19, have been together for 63 years. \u201cMolly went out on a stretcher and then I was left at home alone,\u201d John says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t well, I couldn\u2019t phone her, I couldn\u2019t talk to her, I couldn\u2019t check. Then I went downhill and called an ambulance for myself. \u201cWe didn\u2019t see each other for 17 days. I was only about 90ft away from her in the neighbouring ward but we couldn\u2019t even shout or write a note to one another because of the risk of contamination. I didn\u2019t know what was happening to Molly, it was awful.\u201d Early on, Molly was asked to consider what kind of end-of-life care she might prefer. She declined the doctor\u2019s proposals for resuscitation. Luckily, she made a full recovery and Molly and John are now back at home together. \u201cIf you get taken into a ward and you\u2019ve got pneumonia, the staff know exactly how to treat you; if you go in with a broken leg, they can fix it,\u201d says John. \u201cBut with this, all they can do is make you comfortable. They are in the dark as much as we are. And that\u2019s why you\u2019ve got to admire them so much. They were absolutely brilliant. \u201cWhen Molly came home, life changed. We still had to isolate in our apartment for another 14 days but it didn\u2019t matter. We could talk, we could hold each other, we felt better immediately when we saw each other.\u201d Gratitude ____________________ Dawn Annette Baker, 52, was in the same ward as Molly. While delighted to be home, she is still living with the legacy of the infection. \u201cAfter two weeks in hospital, most of my muscle mass had gone, so my daughter had to help me get into the shower because I was too shaky. Even just making a cup of coffee was difficult,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m left with damage because I get out of breath constantly and my asthma is really bad now, whereas it was totally under control beforehand. My peak flow is lower than it should be, but I have to manage that.\u201d Dawn Annette Baker, who spent two weeks in hospital with Covid-19. She says the impact of her illness is ongoing. Baker says of her time in hospital: \u201cI think [the severity of the situation] only hit me on the second day when they said there were no visitors. I started thinking to myself: have I seen my kids for the last time? I haven\u2019t been able to say what I needed to say.\u201d After two weeks in hospital, she surprised her children when she returned home on 8 April.

Even in their final hours, patients with Covid-19 must be strictly isolated from loved ones. Erica Young, whose mother Vicky Cornwell died in hospital after testing positive for Covid-19. Cornwell was a social worker and lay preacher. Erica Young\u2019s mother, Vicky Cornwell, contracted Covid-19 in her care home and died in hospital. The experience was heartbreaking for Young, but she says she is grateful that her mother was so tenderly cared for by everyone in the NHS. \u201cWhen Mum was moved to hospital there was no opportunity to speak; it was a case of asking whoever answered the phone how she was, passing on my love and the love of the family, but there was no more that that could be done,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was heartbreaking to be allowed to see her only when she was dead and not when she was still alive, when she would have known I was there.\u201d When Young visited her mother\u2019s body, she had to wear full PPE (personal protective equipment). \u201cI was still thinking they had rung the wrong daughter, that somebody else\u2019s mum had died, not mine. But it was mine. \u201cI said to them, \u2018What can I and can\u2019t I do when I go in?\u2019 They said, \u2018You can hold her hand but you can\u2019t kiss her.\u2019 So I had a chat and I held her hand. I\u2019m glad I saw her \u2013 it gave me a chance to say goodbye.\u201d Only six mourners could attend the funeral because of local lockdown restrictions. Standing in the gap ____________________ And yet, even amid the sadness of her family\u2019s loss, Young sees reasons to be positive. In particular, she was reassured by the knowledge that hospital chaplains were visiting Cornwell in hospital. \u201cThey made an awful situation more bearable,\u201d Young says. \u201cMy family owe them a huge debt.\u201d Having granted permission for a BBC camera crew to film one such conversation, the family were able to watch footage of Cornwell discussing her life and role as a lay preacher.

That was really, really reassuring and comforting because it was probably the last significant conversation of her life.\u201d Rev Simon Betteridge, who offers comfort and guidance to patients and staff at the hospital. Rev Simon Betteridge, the chaplain who counselled Cornwell that day, says: \u201cThere is a privilege in people accepting you within their story for a short time, and you providing them with a degree of firm ground. We don\u2019t necessarily come up with any clever words or prayers or anything. It\u2019s about listening, really. The language we often use to describe our role is that we\u2019re \u2018standing in the gap\u2019.\u201d Elsewhere in the hospital, technology provides a bridge to loved ones. Through the UHCW charity, University hospital has sourced dozens of iPads, which are being used for patient-to-family video calls. Heather Healey, a \u201cquery Covid\u201d patient, was able to call her 13-year-old son, James, from her bed. \u201cWhen you interact online and you can see somebody\u2019s face, you can see the love in their eyes,\u201d she says. \u201cI could see his and he could see mine as well. That meant everything to me.\u201d Heather Healey is shown how to make a video call to her son, James, using one of the hospital\u2019s iPads. Lifeline ____________________ Mark and Kathy Anders believe the NHS has reaffirmed its value to the British public. Mark, who works locally as a paramedic, was taken to hospital with Covid-19 symptoms in early April while Kathy, who experienced milder symptoms, remained at their home in Rugby. Mark says: \u201cTo see it from the other side when you\u2019re poorly is amazing. From A&amp;E and into ward 12, they were constantly watching me through the window, constantly taking my obs\u2019 [medical observations such as blood pressure]. They couldn\u2019t do enough for me. They\u2019re all fantastic.\u201d Kathy says: \u201cWe\u2019ve both always known that the NHS is invaluable but until you\u2019re in a position to need it yourself you don\u2019t quite appreciate it. Kathy and Mark Anders. Mark, who is a local paramedic, spent a week in hospital with Covid-19 before making a full recovery. \u201cI\u2019ve really suffered with anxiety through all of this. It\u2019s probably the worst experience we\u2019ve been through together in 18 and a half years. \u201cBut the support from Mark\u2019s colleagues was absolutely amazing \u2013 I get emotional just thinking about it. They knew I was poorly and I was on my own, so two of his colleagues came to check me out. They gowned up and masked up. To me that was like a lifeline.\u201d After more than a month\u2019s rest, Mark recently returned to work on the frontline. Tears ____________________ Roger Townsend, a clinical lead in ITU, acknowledges the trauma faced by staff working throughout the NHS and is especially sympathetic to those drafted into ITU from other roles. \u201cThere were a lot of tears from everybody from time to time,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the run-up to the Easter weekend, we were admitting to intensive care on average four patients per day with Covid-19. Over the last week we have admitted two patients with Covid-19. So, two in a week, versus four patients per day \u2013 that\u2019s a huge difference. \u201cI think we\u2019ve come through the test \u2013 I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll ever be the same again.\u201d Townsend smiles as he reflects on the lives he and his colleagues have saved. \u201cWe\u2019ve had vast outpourings of gratitude from everybody. Stuff is just delivered with notes from, you know, the Johnson family. A box of food and things like that. \u201cSome people will come back to say thank you in person but most people don\u2019t actually remember being in ITU. And do you know what \u2013 if people forget us, that\u2019s fine. They are alive, they\u2019ve got more things to think about.\u201d Roger Townsend, a clinical lead in ITU, in discussion with a colleague. Togetherness ____________________ John and Molly Phillis are feeling upbeat as they consider the future. Forget the new car and the cruises they had booked \u2013 right now they are simply looking forward to an exercise class on their balcony. The session is hosted by a local gym instructor who stands on the ground floor and uses a megaphone to direct the participants. It has become a popular communal activity, with residents throughout the apartment block taking part. Asked what the crisis has taught him, John says: \u201cTogetherness, and to trust our neighbours and friends more. Although we are still apart, we\u2019re all together in this.\u201d Young says the NHS must be protected for future generations: \u201cIt\u2019s easy to complain about the NHS and about waiting times. But the NHS is a fundamental part of the UK and how we do things \u2013 healthcare for everyone when they need it, regardless of whether they have money or not. \u201cI really hope the warm words that have been spoken by everyone in the last couple of months don\u2019t just fade away with the memory of Covid-19.\u201d John and Molly Phillis holding hands.",

      "body": "<p>On 4 June 2020, as darkness enveloped Hong Kong, thousands of people broke through barricades and slipped into the tree-lined Victoria Park in the heart of the city. Shielding their candles from the wind, and carefully sitting 1 metre apart, they filled the length of the open space. The annual Tiananmen Square vigil had been banned, with police citing coronavirus concerns. But Hong Kong was determined to mark the anniversary as it always has. For three decades, the city has been the only place within China where the massacre can be publicly remembered. The commemoration is by far the world\u2019s largest, but also its most vulnerable. Its tiny flames speak to the endurance of hope and memory, and to their looming extinction.</p> <p>When the People\u2019s Liberation Army massacred hundreds of demonstrators in Beijing on 4 June 1989, the response in Hong Kong was overwhelming. One million or more residents marched in mourning. People from across society \u2013 clergymen, activists, Cantopop stars, businesspeople, foreign diplomats, even triad gangs \u2013 worked together to smuggle \u201cmost wanted\u201d student leaders off the mainland and to safety.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t just horror and sympathy that Hong Kongers were feeling in 1989; it was foreboding. The British colony was due to be handed back to China eight years later, and in the days before the killings, as rumours of an impending crackdown spread, local activists had held signs warning \u201cToday China, tomorrow Hong Kong\u201d.</p> <p>By that point, the Chinese and the British had already made the handover agreement that would come into effect in 1997. Hong Kong would be allowed to maintain its autonomy and way of life for 50 years, until 2047, under the formulation known as \u201cone country, two systems\u201d. It was a fudge, probably the best outcome achievable under the circumstances \u2013 a binding international treaty, but one that everyone knew was essentially unenforceable should China break its pledge.</p> <p>About 500,000 people left between the signing of the deal in 1984 and 1997. Prince Charles, who attended the handover ceremony, wrote after his departure: \u201cThus we left Hong Kong to her fate and the hope that Martin Lee, the leader of the Democrats, would not be arrested.\u201d</p> <p>Yet at the time of the handover, the fear in Hong Kong was matched by a certain excitement. One supporter of the current protests, Li, who is 71 and came to Hong Kong as a teenager from Guangdong, popped two bottles of champagne to celebrate: \u201cOne to say farewell to Britain, and one to welcome the People\u2019s Liberation Army to Hong Kong,\u201d he remembered. As a child, Li had witnessed the mass famine caused by the Great Leap Forward and the chaos of the Cultural Revolution, but now he felt hopeful. \u201cWe expected tomorrow to be better. We\u2019re Chinese people, not just Hong Kongers,\u201d he said.</p> <p>As the handover passed and life in Hong Kong appeared to be continuing pretty much as promised, sympathy for the mainland grew. China\u2019s years of double-digit growth brought economic rewards to the region and optimists hoped that its ongoing economic liberalisation would, over time, bring political change, too: the mainland might become more like Hong Kong. In 1997, one in five Hong Kongers identified as Chinese; 10 years later, one in three saw themselves that way.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The Tiananmen vigil has always been a barometer of anti-Beijing sentiment; the first, in 1990, attracted 150,000 people, while only 30,000 gathered in 2000. When the activist Bonnie Leung first attended as a student, a few years later, she was seen as \u201ca weirdo\u201d, she said. Every one of the friends she invited refused. But its relative unpopularity did not, to her, diminish its importance. Its very existence showed why Hong Kong was different: \u201cEven when we don\u2019t care, we always know.\u201d</p> <p>Every so often, Beijing would tighten its grip on Hong Kong, and attendance at the vigil would surge again \u2013 as in 2004, after a huge backlash killed off an attempt by the Hong Kong government to pass a national security bill that might have paved the way for peaceful critics of the Chinese Communist party to be jailed. Still, it seemed inevitable that the commemoration would gradually dwindle. Some wondered how long it would be before the vigils died away, and the memory of Tiananmen Square passed with them.</p> <p>But on 4 June 2019, 30 years after the massacre, 180,000 gathered in Victoria Park. It was the biggest turnout for years. The public had been galvanised by the threat of an extradition bill that would allow suspects to be taken to the mainland to face Communist party-controlled courts. If the bill became law, it seemed to spell the end for Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy from China. Anger had spread well beyond the usual community of activists and intellectuals. Even then, few saw what was brewing. On 9 June, when 1 million people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/09/vast-protest-in-hong-kong-against-extradition-law-china\" title=\"\">marched</a> to demand that the law be scrapped, the organisers \u2013 who included Leung, now in her 30s \u2013 were as astonished as anyone. A few days after that, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/16/hong-kong-protests-carrie-lam-china\" title=\"\">another march</a> drew 2 million people: more than one in four of the population.</p> <p>In the months that followed, even as the movement grew more radical, support continued to rise. By this spring, 58% of residents backed the protesters. A city once seen as orderly and materialistic has discovered itself to be idealistic and angry. In the past year, police have arrested more than 8,000 protesters, including children as young as 11 and pensioners as old as 83. Demonstrators and police have fought pitched battles outside shopping malls, government offices, police stations and the international airport. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3ca13c77dd931f1b43f27ac259df2e7972cb76f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ca13c77dd931f1b43f27ac259df2e7972cb76f9/0_0_5643_3762/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman shouts at police officers as they advance towards protesters in Hong Kong in July 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman shouts at police officers as they advance towards protesters in Hong Kong in July 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have any choice but to fight. We have to try to do something,\u201d said 25-year-old Kelvin Chan, sitting alone near the waterfront of Victoria Harbour as dusk fell. It was a Sunday in early August, nine weeks into the protests. Chan, in a loose black T-shirt and a facemask that barely covered his face, did not look ready to fight, but said he was \u201cwaiting for the battle\u201d that would inevitably take place once the police arrived. Protesters nearby made a barricade outside the Intercontinental Hotel as curious guests watched from the stairs. Like many of his generation, Chan believed that soon he would no longer have the chance to attend protests like these. \u201cIn the future, 2047 or earlier, I think China will brainwash Hong Kong people. China wants to control Hong Kong,\u201d he said.</p> <p>That future is arriving more abruptly than anyone anticipated. Late on 21 May, China\u2019s national legislature announced plans to impose an anti-sedition law on Hong Kong, going even further than the bill shelved by the Hong Kong government 17 years ago and the subsequent extradition law. \u201cHong Kong as we know it is finally dead,\u201d said Claudia Mo, an opposition lawmaker and longtime pro-democracy campaigner. \u201cThis is the start of a new but sad chapter for Hong Kong.\u201d The new legislation will give the government the power to silence critics and dissidents through vague charges of subversion, and to install Chinese national security agencies in the city. The nature of the move is as alarming as its content: it sets a precedent of Beijing forcing unpopular legislation on Hong Kong, which under the terms of the handover was promised \u201ca high degree of autonomy\u201d. </p> <p>Days later, police announced that they were banning the Tiananmen vigil, citing Covid-19 measures. By then, the idea of a candlelit commemoration seemed to belong to another Hong Kong: to the restrained, almost genteel activism that endured for so long. But Tiananmen\u2019s legacy persists, even among young protesters who have grown dismissive of the vigil over the years. When unrest reached its height last autumn, with molotov cocktails arcing over roads and tear gas grenades bouncing off the tarmac, graffiti appeared on a wall in the centre: \u201cIs it our 4 June 1989 now?\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Understanding the protests shaking Hong Kong requires delving back far beyond 1989. Hong Kong as we know it began to take shape in the years after the second world war. In just a decade, the population quadrupled to about 2.5 million, as former residents who had escaped the brutal wartime Japanese occupation returned, and mainland Chinese fled across the border to escape the civil war between the nationalists and communists, and after 1949, the beginning of Communist party rule.</p> <p>This was an exhausted, impoverished, crowded, hungry city. But it was also dynamic. Its inhabitants had experienced how bad things could get, and were intent on establishing a life for themselves. The new arrivals provided much of the cheap labour that powered the city\u2019s postwar manufacturing boom in the 50s and 60s, with the textile sector soon supplemented by clothing, plastic and electronics factories. This success, along with the city\u2019s heritage of trade and of the rule of law, and from 1978 onwards China\u2019s own economic liberalisation, would later make it a global financial centre.</p> <p>Until the prospect of the territory\u2019s return to China loomed, during a century and a half of colonial rule, Britain showed little interest in giving Hong Kong\u2019s citizens the power to elect their leaders. But to serve British interests, the administrators had introduced powerful institutions such as an independent judiciary. Thus Hong Kong had what the last governor, Chris Patten, described as \u201cliberty without democracy\u201d, enjoying free speech, free media and the right to protest, without the right to choose who ran the place.</p> <p>Under this system, protests became a crucial way to challenge British authorities, and later Beijing. In the 60s, major demonstrations, which developed into deadly riots in 1967, were brutally put down by police. But these events also pushed the colonial administration into tackling the needs of the local population: housing, labour rights, education. Aware of Hong Kong\u2019s anachronistic status in a post-colonial world, the British became highly conscious of the need to respond to public demands. Partly in response, protests tended to be targeted in their aims and cautious in means. After the handover, demonstrations would force authorities to abandon plans for a national security law in 2003, and the imposition of \u201cmoral and national education\u201d classes <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/30/world/asia/thousands-protest-chinas-curriculum-plans-for-hong-kong-schools.html\" title=\"\">in 2012</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bff9529d92a789c69c526c26d2ada27c54a6e646\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bff9529d92a789c69c526c26d2ada27c54a6e646/0_0_2000_1270/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A 2003 march to protest the Hong Kong government\u2019s anti-subversion bill.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"635\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A 2003 march to protest the Hong Kong government\u2019s anti-subversion bill.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vincent Yu/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the most part, though, political activity remained a fairly marginal business, and the democratic movement was law-abiding, even sedate. It wasn\u2019t until the excitment of the 2008 Beijing Olympics faded that the mood clearly began to shift. Many protesters remember that year as a turning point in their views on the mainland. Many were shocked by the steady stream of reports on corruption and other abuses in China. They included the embezzling of donations sent by Hong Kongers to victims of the Sichuan earthquake and the Sanlu infant formula <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/24/china-executes-milk-scandal-pair\" title=\"\">scandal</a>, when officials suppressed warnings about tainted milk and 300,000 children fell ill as a result.</p> <p>Over the next few years, Hong Kongers were outraged by the moral and national education controversy, and protested against the extension of the mainland\u2019s high-speed train line, fearing it was another sign of how the mainland wanted to swallow up Hong Kong. They were also alarmed by Beijing\u2019s increasing authoritarianism and repression \u2013 particularly after Xi Jinping took power in 2012 \u2013 and the mainland\u2019s growing impact on the city. It began to become evident that the mainland\u2019s economic boom was not making it more like Hong Kong, as some had once thought inevitable. It was making Hong Kong more like the mainland.</p> <p>Alongside the political anxieties came economic frustrations. Hong Kong is one of the most unequal developed economies in the world. In a city full of designer stores and flashy restaurants, it is impossible to ignore the gap between the rich and the poor. A handful of ultra-rich families prosper while the very poorest dwell in tiny \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/29/hong-kong-coffin-homes-horror-my-week\" title=\"\">coffin homes</a>\u201d, less than 2 square metres in size. Even middle-class young people see no hope of moving out of cramped family apartments. Since 1997, about 1 million new residents have arrived from the mainland, without a corresponding increase in public spending, adding to the pressure on services and contributing to soaring property prices.</p> <p>Over the past decade, Max Chung, an activist from a residential area near the border with China, has seen his neighbourhood transformed by visitors from the mainland who come to Hong Kong on weekend shopping trips. \u201cYou can\u2019t even get a table at a restaurant,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want to take back our normal lives. We don\u2019t want the Chinese suitcases to roll over our feet. We want to have normal food, not the expensive ones. We really want to take back what we used to have.\u201d</p> <p>There is undoubted snobbery, and at times outright bigotry, in the way that many in Hong Kong talk about mainlanders \u2013 casting them as uncouth, uncultured \u201clocusts\u201d straining services and taking over the town. But Hong Kong has also chafed at what it sees as the arrogance of the mainland: the belief that Mandarin should take precedence over Cantonese, and that Hong Kong should simply adapt to the expectations of new arrivals. \u201cThey think: I give you money, so I am the boss. So they can be rude. They can do anything they want,\u201d said Jay, a 21-year-old student \u2013 like many activists, he preferred not to give his name.</p> <p>The hollowness of liberty without democracy has become clear to all. Hong Kong\u2019s 3.8 million voters can choose district councillors to handle matters such as bus routes. But the city\u2019s chief executive is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/22/hong-kong-chief-executive-election-what-you-need-to-know\" title=\"\">elected by</a> a committee of only 1,200, composed of representatives from business and other groups, as well as elected legislators. The system ensures that the successful candidate is Beijing\u2019s candidate. It has also traditionally given the wealthy a big say in choosing the leader, in a society where a tiny number of tycoon families already have disproportionate power, owning everything from supermarket chains and insurance firms to utility companies and housing.</p> <p>Beijing has now begun to accuse the same oligarchs it once relied upon of being greedy. It sees the protests, at root, as an economic problem, seized upon by \u201ctroublemakers\u201d and hostile foreign powers. But the tradeoff that the party has offered on the mainland \u2013 material security in place of political freedoms \u2013 does not attract Hong Kongers. People don\u2019t believe they\u2019re getting a decent economic deal, and they see political space as a right, not an optional extra. The grievances about their standard of living have morphed into deeply political sentiment.</p> <p>Over time, as discontent grew, so did the number of protests. In 2004, there were 1,975 protests in Hong Kong; by 2015 that had risen to 6,029. Tactics began to diversify. Attendance at the Tiananmen vigils began to rise. The friends who once snubbed Bonnie Leung now called her and asked if they could go together.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Despite the mounting frustrations of Hong Kongers, by early 2019, the pro-democracy movement looked to many as though it was in terminal decline. The last major protests, which took place in 2014, had ended <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/01/hong-kong-protests-produce-no-real-winners\" title=\"\">in failure</a>, and since then the erosion of Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms had accelerated. On 31 March 2019, the usual stalwarts \u2013 Martin Lee, pro-democracy politicians and Joshua Wong, the teenage face of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/30/-sp-hong-kong-umbrella-revolution-pro-democracy-protests\" title=\"\">2014 umbrella movement</a> \u2013 demonstrated against the extradition bill. The implications of the bill seemed obvious: if Hong Kong\u2019s residents could easily be extradited to face the party-controlled mainland legal system, did \u201ctwo systems\u201d really exist any more? It looked like a death blow to Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy. Yet recent history had showed the severe costs of challenging Beijing. The crowd totalled just 12,000.</p> <p>To understand the movement that has taken shape over the past year, you need to understand its relationship with its predecessor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2014/dec/11/hong-kong-protests-timeline-in-pictures\" title=\"\">the umbrella movement</a>. Those protests also centred on a demand for real universal suffrage, electrified the city and grabbed international attention. But they did not achieve their goals, and today many scorn the earlier movement as timid and unserious. \u201cAfter umbrella, I felt totally disappointed in Hong Kong people,\u201d said Jay, the student. \u201cI was there on 28 September 2014. I was shot by teargas and pepper spray. The next day people were singing songs like it was a carnival. So I think they\u2019re hopeless.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"29004360d4d64179f875529e18a7c88a42cc44ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29004360d4d64179f875529e18a7c88a42cc44ec/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A poster in Hong Kong after the end of the umbrella movement protests in 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A poster in Hong Kong after the end of the umbrella movement protests in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bobby Yip/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From 2014 onwards, Beijing did everything it could to crush the possibility of another umbrella movement. Members of the Democratic Legislative council were disqualified from the parliament. Independent bookshops disappeared, while five <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/oct/31/a-chapter-closes-last-hong-kong-bookshop-selling-titles-banned-in-china-shuts\" title=\"\">booksellers</a> dealing in salacious titles about China\u2019s leaders were kidnapped and transported to the mainland. Hong Kong University rejected the highly regarded human-rights scholar Johannes Chan for a senior position after pro-Beijing newspapers waged a campaign against him, increasing concerns about pressure on academia. The umbrella movement leaders were jailed; the best-known, Wong, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/14/joshua-wong-the-student-who-risked-the-wrath-of-beijing-its-about-turning-the-impossible-into-the-possible\" title=\"\">warned that</a> Beijing\u2019s encroachment had already diminished one country, two systems to \u201cone country, one-and-a-half\u201d.</p> <p>The defeat of the umbrella movement had looked to most like an end, not a beginning. In retrospect, it was the moment when many Hong Kongers started to believe that polite protest wouldn\u2019t work. For people like Jay, the umbrella movement has been a useful example of what not to do. Those protests demanded universal suffrage; this time round, they are primarily a stand against the erosion of rights. Those had charismatic leaders; these are leaderless and decentralised. Those were led by academics and students; these span classes, with construction workers and finance professionals joining forces. Those were committed to polite civil disobedience; these are more radical, and at times violent. Above all, the umbrella movement fractured quickly, while this time \u2013 despite all the government\u2019s efforts to split the movement \u2013 people have stayed unified.</p> <p>Yet when the mass protests began in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2019/jun/10/hong-kong-protests-in-pictures\" title=\"\">June </a>2019, they were peaceful. In mid-June, after police fired tear gas on protesters outside the seat of the government, the Legislative Complex, protesters formed what is known as the \u201cfive demands\u201d, which included the withdrawal of the bill and an independent inquiry into police brutality. On 15 June, Carrie Lam, the city\u2019s chief executive, announced she was suspending the legislation. But as many as 2 million people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2019/jun/16/hong-kong-streets-flooded-by-extradition-bill-protesters-in-pictures\" title=\"\">took to the streets</a> the following day.</p> <p>Though he is known as Hong Kong\u2019s father of democracy, Martin Lee was initially reluctant to join the demonstration. He thought it was time to negotiate: \u201cI would have liked the movement to stop,\u201d he admitted when we met last autumn at his wood-panelled chambers in central Hong Kong, where a bust of Winston Churchill stood on a shelf. In the end, he concluded he should march because the bill had been postponed rather than scrapped and might yet be revived. Lee embodies the city\u2019s tradition of courageous but pragmatic, cautious activism. But he, like so many in the city, found himself swept along by the tide.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2f6ac6da56ada6329aca6e9c2ef38707ef825341\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f6ac6da56ada6329aca6e9c2ef38707ef825341/0_186_2784_1670/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martin Lee in his Hong Kong chambers in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martin Lee in his Hong Kong chambers in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Helen Davidson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Others in the movement began to adopt more radical tactics, storming the legislative council on 1 July. Harsher police crackdowns spurred further protests as demonstrators escalated in response. Authorities refused permission for rallies and police violence intensified. Officers arrested bystanders for heckling them, drove vehicles directly at protesters and fired at journalists, in one case leaving a woman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/16/an-eye-for-an-eye-hong-kong-protests-get-figurehead-in-woman-injured-by-police\" title=\"\">blind in one eye</a>. Thugs were unleashed upon protesters and prominent activists, leaving them bloodied and beaten. In August, protesters paralysed the airport, forcing thousands of flights to be cancelled as police began to use live rounds. On 1 October, China\u2019s national day, a police officer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/01/hong-kong-protester-shot-with-live-round-during-china-national-day-rally\" title=\"\">shot</a> a 21-year-old student in the chest, while across town, a middle-aged man arguing with protesters was set on fire. The government invoked the emergency regulations ordinance, awarding itself draconian powers. In November, universities were turned into fortified camps for protesters, leading to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/20/we-couldnt-hesitate-escaping-hong-kongs-university-siege\" title=\"\">12-day siege</a>. Hundreds have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/31/fresh-unrest-in-hong-kong-after-44-protesters-charged-with-rioting\" title=\"\">charged</a> with the vaguely defined offence of rioting, which can carry a 10-year prison sentence, and more than 1,000 children have been arrested.</p> <p>If the protests were initially motivated by fear about Hong Kong\u2019s future, as they continued, a new sense of identity and community formed. It was evident in the flashmob performances of the new \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/12/glory-to-hong-kong-pro-democracy-anthem-embraced-by-protesters\" title=\"\">anthem</a>\u201d, Glory to Hong Kong, held in the shopping malls that once seemed to epitomise the city\u2019s individualism and devotion to consumption. It was evident, too, in the networks that formed to provide mutual aid, from feeding activists to treating the injuries of protesters who were too afraid of arrest to go to hospital. (These networks would find new purpose when the coronavirus reached Hong Kong. While the government dithered, the people took action: tracking cases and warning of apparent hot spots; distributing masks to the poor and elderly.) </p> <p>The sheer inventiveness of protesters helped to maintain a movement that most expected to fizzle out within weeks. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/27/hong-kong-way-peaceful-protest\" title=\"\">Hong Kong Way</a>, a 30-mile human chain that stretched across the city in late August, revived the spirits of supporters. Other actions had a concrete effect. The landslide for pro-democracy candidates in November\u2019s local elections didn\u2019t just send a message to Beijing. District councillors are among the few allowed to vote for the chief executive \u2013 potentially giving pro-democrats a greater say in who replaces Lam. It was followed by a surge in the formation of pro-democracy trade unions. </p> <p>For Helen, a protester in her late 20s, the past year has redefined how she sees Hong Kong. \u201cWe valued economics over a lot of things before,\u201d she said. \u201cThis time around, you see that people care for freedom and rights over economics. We found out how much we loved this place.\u201d </p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>While most protesters remained peaceful, a significant number started to adopt more extreme tactics, attacking Chinese state-owned businesses and companies seen to sympathise with the government. In a few cases, they assaulted locals sympathetic to Beijing. One man was killed by a stone thrown, seemingly by a protester, in a clash.</p> <p>Along the route of a march in September, someone had scrawled under a bus stop: \u201cToday Xinjiang, tomorrow Hong Kong.\u201d To outsiders, it might have seemed incredible to compare this still largely rural region of western China, which is kept under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/aug/07/why-uighur-muslims-across-china-are-living-in-fear\" title=\"\">extraordinarily repressive</a> security, to this cosmopolitan global financial centre, still by far the freest part of China. Protesters saw Xinjiang as a warning: if they did not take a stand now, they would never be able to do so. People were fighting not to win, but because they knew what losing meant.</p> <p>Many young protesters speak of a willingness to die for the cause, writing wills and last messages for their families to find. \u201cThere is some part of me that has changed,\u201d says Niko Cheng, 22, a nursing student who volunteers as a medic. For months she has been prepared to be arrested, sacrificing her future. And at the height of the protests in the summer, she was ready to die if that would help to expose the brutality of the police. \u201cIf you have been to the frontline once, you feel that everyone surrounding you loves Hong Kong so much, and they are willing to do everything for it,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of them have already given up their future to be here. After that, you can\u2019t go back to being a normal person again. You can\u2019t just watch,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5b7aeee85871e9a018a48a303bcb1c8a4cbb721d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b7aeee85871e9a018a48a303bcb1c8a4cbb721d/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cOne Nation, One Hong Kong\u201d graffiti left behind by protesters on a wall in Hong Kong - 24 May 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Graffiti left after a protest in Hong Kong last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Willie Siau/SOPA Images/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though there is no doubt that protesters have been violent, there is widespread suspicion in the movement \u2013 rightly or not \u2013 that undercover officers have acted as agents provocateurs. There is also fury that no police have been held responsible for outrages. Before the protests, just 6% of the population said it had no trust in the police; now, <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2019/11/09/surveys-show-majority-of-hong-kong-people-have-lost-trust-in-the-citys-police-force/\" title=\"\">more than half</a> report zero trust. The population is traumatised and exhausted. A study by the University of Hong Kong suggested that one in three adults <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/10/hong-kong-nearly-a-third-of-adults-report-ptsd-symptoms-study\" title=\"\">had symptoms</a> of post-traumatic stress disorder, comparable to rates in conflict zones. (This may underestimate the extent of the problem, since only those over 18 were surveyed, while many protesters are younger.) </p> <p>As support for the movement has intensified, so has opposition to it. A large chunk of the population, not only recent arrivals from the mainland, is equally passionate in rejecting the movement. Friends have fallen out. Parents have kicked out activist children. Helen, the protester whose view of Hong Kong has been transformed by the protests, hadn\u2019t spoken to her father for months, even though they live in the same small flat. He couldn\u2019t understand how irresponsible she was being. She couldn\u2019t understand how a man who had swum across the sea to escape Mao\u2019s China had become so loyal to Beijing.</p> <p>The rallying cry for Helen\u2019s generation has been \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time\u201d. Now some have become supportive of the idea of full independence from the mainland, even if they believe it unrealisable. As people gathered late last month to protest Beijing\u2019s announcement of the national security law, they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/07/anger-still-there-hong-kong-defiant-one-year-anniversary-first-protests-china\" title=\"\">chanted a slogan</a> rarely heard before: \u201cHong Kong independence, the only way out!\u201d</p> <p>Activism in Hong Kong was always constrained by the understanding of how little was possible. Margaret Ng, a veteran democratic activist and former legislator, describes Hong Kong\u2019s struggle with Beijing as \u201cDavid and Goliath, without the sling\u201d. But the political space has shrunk so far that, for some, the end result is not caution but nihilism. An ideology of self-destruction known as lam chao, or \u201cIf we burn, you burn with us\u201d, has gained momentum. More radical demonstrators believe the collapse of Hong Kong is the only way to really bring change. \u201cWe are not afraid. If the Chinese army comes out, we will celebrate. The entire Hong Kong business environment will collapse. If they call the military here, it would ruin Hong Kong and also mainland China\u2019s economy,\u201d said Yan, 26.</p> <p>\u201cI have hope, but my hope is that we take China down with us,\u201d Helen said.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Beijing has abandoned any pretence of winning hearts and minds. With the prospect of pro-democracy candidates making inroads in this September\u2019s elections for the legislative council, and the international cover afforded by the coronavirus pandemic, repression by authorities has dramatically intensified. Now they are doing through fear what they failed to do through persuasion.</p> <p>In the months before the new national security law was announced, Beijing replaced its envoy in Hong Kong with an enforcer lacking experience of the region but known for his hardline tactics. The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office described protesters as a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/china-calls-hong-kong-protesters-a-political-virus\" title=\"\">political virus</a>\u201d that required elimination. In April, 15 of the region\u2019s best-known pro-democracy figures <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/police-in-hong-kong-arrest-14-activists-amid-autonomy-warnings\" title=\"\">were arrested</a> on charges of illegal assembly. They included Margaret Ng, the media tycoon Jimmy Lai, Lee Cheuk-yan, a key vigil organiser \u2013 and Martin Lee, who had until now avoided the fate that Prince Charles had feared in 1997. \u201cI\u2019m relieved and very proud to finally be listed as a defendant after seeing so many brilliant young people arrested and charged,\u201d the 81-year-old told reporters.</p> <p>Even after these ominous moves, the news of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/hong-kong-what-are-the-implications-of-china-sedition-laws-national-security-beijing\" title=\"\">national security law</a> was shattering. \u201cIf the extradition bill was a rifle aimed at our rights, the national security legislation is a machine gun,\u201d Lai wrote. Johannes Chan, the legal scholar, said: \u201cHistory tells us the law will soon apply to all kinds of political dissidents, then it will apply to media, NGOs, the lawyers and basically anyone who criticises the government.\u201d That is how the mainland\u2019s laws are used. The Nobel peace prize laureate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/13/liu-xiaobo-nobel-laureate-chinese-political-prisoner-dies-61\" title=\"\">Liu Xiaobo</a> died while serving an 11-year sentence for incitement to subvert state power. His crime was a call for democratic reforms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"016fcb4be03fa24f6bdc7d26590064dcf6b6c0d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/016fcb4be03fa24f6bdc7d26590064dcf6b6c0d2/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam in June 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam earlier this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tyrone Siu/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After the announcement, downloads of VPNs soared, as did calls to immigration consultants. Some in Hong Kong always saw the movement as a last-ditch bid to stay in their home. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019m leaving,\u201d one professional said when the anti-extradition bill first drove him to the streets in anger in July. But the spur for many protesters was the knowledge that they would not be able to do so. \u201cAcross classes, people in Hong Kong have completely lost trust in the PRC. They just give up hope entirely. If they cannot leave, what can they do? Many people are asking this question,\u201d says Ming Sing, an associate professor at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.</p> <p>Authorities insist there is nothing to fear, claiming that the new law will only target \u201ca narrow set of acts\u201d, and that the vast majority of Hong Kong residents will not be affected. Yet Carrie Lam has refused to rule out the law being applied retrospectively, and her statements seem designed to induce rather than allay people\u2019s fears: \u201cWe are a very free society, so for the time being, people have the freedom to say whatever they want to say\u201d, she told reporters in May.</p> <p>Some Hong Kong residents are genuinely anxious to put the unrest behind them as the city plunges deeper into recession. But many are also under intense pressure to demonstrate support for Beijing. Victor Li, the son of the billionaire tycoon Li Ka-shing, said he hoped that the legislation would help the city\u2019s society and economy return to normal. The heads of five of the city\u2019s universities also endorsed the law, along with hundreds of celebrities and artists. State media claim that 2.93 million residents have signed a petition backing the law, though protesters believe this figure is wildly implausible.</p> <p>With the law yet to be drafted, Hong Kong\u2019s protesters hope international pressure could still have some impact on its final form, and how it is implemented and enforced. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure even Beijing would have not preferred to exercise this nuclear option \u2026 we made Beijing pay the full price,\u201d the researcher and activist Lokman Tsui wrote in a Facebook post the morning after the announcement. \u201cTaiwan is watching. The United States is watching. Beijing is on notice, in front of the entire world. We have hope because we act. We take the hit, we get up and we live to fight another day.\u201d</p> <p>Beijing appears unfazed by US threats or international criticism. Even as the Chinese economy struggles to recover amid the pandemic, it no longer \u201cneeds\u201d Hong Kong as it once did. In 1997, Hong Kong\u2019s economy was equivalent to 20% of the mainland economy; now it is about 3%. Either Beijing has gambled that Trump won\u2019t follow through on threats to remove the region\u2019s special trade status, or \u2013 more likely \u2013 it has concluded that asserting its own power takes precedence. It, too, can take the hit.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p>Though the fear in Hong Kong is palpable, resistance has not yet disappeared. This year has seen a marked shift to what political scientist Edmund Cheng calls \u201ceveryday resistance\u201d, such as trade unionisation and the \u201cyellow-ribbon economy\u201d, supporting only local businesses that back the protests. This is what opposition might look like in the long-term.</p> <p>The Tiananmen commemoration, too, is evolving. Despite the ban, thousands of Hong Kong residents descended on Victoria Park. Others held vigils throughout each of the city\u2019s districts. \u201cYou can seal the park but you can\u2019t seal people\u2019s hearts,\u201d said Han Dongfang, a labour rights activist who led protests in Beijing in 1989.</p> <p>For many, this year\u2019s commemoration was no longer just about those who died in Beijing, but Hong Kong\u2019s struggle. The usual slogans calling for the CPC to reckon with the massacre were drowned out by chants of the protest movement, as well newer slogans calling for independence: \u201cOne-nation Hong Kong\u201d. The crowd included the older generation and young activists, who now see the events of 1989 as a warning.</p> <p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t do something now, maybe someday Hong Kong will become like June 4,\u201d said Zack Ho, 18, who attended a vigil near his home before rushing to join the main one in Victoria Park. \u201cWe saw how the tanks rode over students. That\u2019s the real picture of how evil the Chinese regime is. We have to remind Hong Kongers that maybe that\u2019s the future of Hong Kong.\u201d</p> <p>The massacre, and the vigils to commemorate it, planted the seeds for today\u2019s Hong Kong: the understanding of what is at stake, and the sacrifices that may be required to defend it. The CPC drew its own lessons from the events of that year \u2013 not just Tiananmen, but the collapse of the Soviet Union. It learned to avoid a bloody crackdown if you can help it \u2013 the costs are too high \u2013 but also to avoid concessions, and to hold on to political power at all costs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/08/chinas-memory-manipulators\">China\u2019s memory manipulators</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Will Hong Kong ever see another mass commemoration of 1989? \u201cI think it will be one of the things that they really want to get rid of,\u201d said Leung. \u201cIt is totally peaceful.

The vigil stood not only for the city\u2019s freedoms of assembly and expression, but also of information. That knowledge gave them the choice to exercise their rights or not, and to imagine another future, however impossible it might be to realise. No one can doubt, now, that Hong Kong people care. But how long will they know? How many candles will light up the darkness in the years to come? </p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Verna Yu</em> </p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">weekly email here</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "On 4 June 2020, as darkness enveloped Hong Kong, thousands of people broke through barricades and slipped into the tree-lined Victoria Park in the heart of the city. Shielding their candles from the wind, and carefully sitting 1 metre apart, they filled the length of the open space. The annual Tiananmen Square vigil had been banned, with police citing coronavirus concerns. But Hong Kong was determined to mark the anniversary as it always has. For three decades, the city has been the only place within China where the massacre can be publicly remembered. The commemoration is by far the world\u2019s largest, but also its most vulnerable. Its tiny flames speak to the endurance of hope and memory, and to their looming extinction. When the People\u2019s Liberation Army massacred hundreds of demonstrators in Beijing on 4 June 1989, the response in Hong Kong was overwhelming. One million or more residents marched in mourning. People from across society \u2013 clergymen, activists, Cantopop stars, businesspeople, foreign diplomats, even triad gangs \u2013 worked together to smuggle \u201cmost wanted\u201d student leaders off the mainland and to safety. It wasn\u2019t just horror and sympathy that Hong Kongers were feeling in 1989; it was foreboding. The British colony was due to be handed back to China eight years later, and in the days before the killings, as rumours of an impending crackdown spread, local activists had held signs warning \u201cToday China, tomorrow Hong Kong\u201d. By that point, the Chinese and the British had already made the handover agreement that would come into effect in 1997. Hong Kong would be allowed to maintain its autonomy and way of life for 50 years, until 2047, under the formulation known as \u201cone country, two systems\u201d. It was a fudge, probably the best outcome achievable under the circumstances \u2013 a binding international treaty, but one that everyone knew was essentially unenforceable should China break its pledge. About 500,000 people left between the signing of the deal in 1984 and 1997. Prince Charles, who attended the handover ceremony, wrote after his departure: \u201cThus we left Hong Kong to her fate and the hope that Martin Lee, the leader of the Democrats, would not be arrested.\u201d Yet at the time of the handover, the fear in Hong Kong was matched by a certain excitement. One supporter of the current protests, Li, who is 71 and came to Hong Kong as a teenager from Guangdong, popped two bottles of champagne to celebrate: \u201cOne to say farewell to Britain, and one to welcome the People\u2019s Liberation Army to Hong Kong,\u201d he remembered. As a child, Li had witnessed the mass famine caused by the Great Leap Forward and the chaos of the Cultural Revolution, but now he felt hopeful. \u201cWe expected tomorrow to be better. We\u2019re Chinese people, not just Hong Kongers,\u201d he said. As the handover passed and life in Hong Kong appeared to be continuing pretty much as promised, sympathy for the mainland grew. China\u2019s years of double-digit growth brought economic rewards to the region and optimists hoped that its ongoing economic liberalisation would, over time, bring political change, too: the mainland might become more like Hong Kong. In 1997, one in five Hong Kongers identified as Chinese; 10 years later, one in three saw themselves that way. * * * The Tiananmen vigil has always been a barometer of anti-Beijing sentiment; the first, in 1990, attracted 150,000 people, while only 30,000 gathered in 2000. When the activist Bonnie Leung first attended as a student, a few years later, she was seen as \u201ca weirdo\u201d, she said. Every one of the friends she invited refused. But its relative unpopularity did not, to her, diminish its importance. Its very existence showed why Hong Kong was different: \u201cEven when we don\u2019t care, we always know.\u201d Every so often, Beijing would tighten its grip on Hong Kong, and attendance at the vigil would surge again \u2013 as in 2004, after a huge backlash killed off an attempt by the Hong Kong government to pass a national security bill that might have paved the way for peaceful critics of the Chinese Communist party to be jailed. Still, it seemed inevitable that the commemoration would gradually dwindle. Some wondered how long it would be before the vigils died away, and the memory of Tiananmen Square passed with them. But on 4 June 2019, 30 years after the massacre, 180,000 gathered in Victoria Park. It was the biggest turnout for years. The public had been galvanised by the threat of an extradition bill that would allow suspects to be taken to the mainland to face Communist party-controlled courts. If the bill became law, it seemed to spell the end for Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy from China. Anger had spread well beyond the usual community of activists and intellectuals. Even then, few saw what was brewing. On 9 June, when 1 million people marched to demand that the law be scrapped, the organisers \u2013 who included Leung, now in her 30s \u2013 were as astonished as anyone. A few days after that, another march drew 2 million people: more than one in four of the population. In the months that followed, even as the movement grew more radical, support continued to rise. By this spring, 58% of residents backed the protesters. A city once seen as orderly and materialistic has discovered itself to be idealistic and angry. In the past year, police have arrested more than 8,000 protesters, including children as young as 11 and pensioners as old as 83. Demonstrators and police have fought pitched battles outside shopping malls, government offices, police stations and the international airport. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any choice but to fight. We have to try to do something,\u201d said 25-year-old Kelvin Chan, sitting alone near the waterfront of Victoria Harbour as dusk fell. It was a Sunday in early August, nine weeks into the protests. Chan, in a loose black T-shirt and a facemask that barely covered his face, did not look ready to fight, but said he was \u201cwaiting for the battle\u201d that would inevitably take place once the police arrived. Protesters nearby made a barricade outside the Intercontinental Hotel as curious guests watched from the stairs. Like many of his generation, Chan believed that soon he would no longer have the chance to attend protests like these. \u201cIn the future, 2047 or earlier, I think China will brainwash Hong Kong people. China wants to control Hong Kong,\u201d he said. That future is arriving more abruptly than anyone anticipated. Late on 21 May, China\u2019s national legislature announced plans to impose an anti-sedition law on Hong Kong, going even further than the bill shelved by the Hong Kong government 17 years ago and the subsequent extradition law. \u201cHong Kong as we know it is finally dead,\u201d said Claudia Mo, an opposition lawmaker and longtime pro-democracy campaigner. \u201cThis is the start of a new but sad chapter for Hong Kong.\u201d The new legislation will give the government the power to silence critics and dissidents through vague charges of subversion, and to install Chinese national security agencies in the city. The nature of the move is as alarming as its content: it sets a precedent of Beijing forcing unpopular legislation on Hong Kong, which under the terms of the handover was promised \u201ca high degree of autonomy\u201d. Days later, police announced that they were banning the Tiananmen vigil, citing Covid-19 measures. By then, the idea of a candlelit commemoration seemed to belong to another Hong Kong: to the restrained, almost genteel activism that endured for so long. But Tiananmen\u2019s legacy persists, even among young protesters who have grown dismissive of the vigil over the years. When unrest reached its height last autumn, with molotov cocktails arcing over roads and tear gas grenades bouncing off the tarmac, graffiti appeared on a wall in the centre: \u201cIs it our 4 June 1989 now?\u201d * * * Understanding the protests shaking Hong Kong requires delving back far beyond 1989. Hong Kong as we know it began to take shape in the years after the second world war. In just a decade, the population quadrupled to about 2.5 million, as former residents who had escaped the brutal wartime Japanese occupation returned, and mainland Chinese fled across the border to escape the civil war between the nationalists and communists, and after 1949, the beginning of Communist party rule. This was an exhausted, impoverished, crowded, hungry city. But it was also dynamic. Its inhabitants had experienced how bad things could get, and were intent on establishing a life for themselves. The new arrivals provided much of the cheap labour that powered the city\u2019s postwar manufacturing boom in the 50s and 60s, with the textile sector soon supplemented by clothing, plastic and electronics factories. This success, along with the city\u2019s heritage of trade and of the rule of law, and from 1978 onwards China\u2019s own economic liberalisation, would later make it a global financial centre. Until the prospect of the territory\u2019s return to China loomed, during a century and a half of colonial rule, Britain showed little interest in giving Hong Kong\u2019s citizens the power to elect their leaders. But to serve British interests, the administrators had introduced powerful institutions such as an independent judiciary. Thus Hong Kong had what the last governor, Chris Patten, described as \u201cliberty without democracy\u201d, enjoying free speech, free media and the right to protest, without the right to choose who ran the place. Under this system, protests became a crucial way to challenge British authorities, and later Beijing. In the 60s, major demonstrations, which developed into deadly riots in 1967, were brutally put down by police. But these events also pushed the colonial administration into tackling the needs of the local population: housing, labour rights, education. Aware of Hong Kong\u2019s anachronistic status in a post-colonial world, the British became highly conscious of the need to respond to public demands. Partly in response, protests tended to be targeted in their aims and cautious in means. After the handover, demonstrations would force authorities to abandon plans for a national security law in 2003, and the imposition of \u201cmoral and national education\u201d classes in 2012. For the most part, though, political activity remained a fairly marginal business, and the democratic movement was law-abiding, even sedate. It wasn\u2019t until the excitment of the 2008 Beijing Olympics faded that the mood clearly began to shift. Many protesters remember that year as a turning point in their views on the mainland. Many were shocked by the steady stream of reports on corruption and other abuses in China. They included the embezzling of donations sent by Hong Kongers to victims of the Sichuan earthquake and the Sanlu infant formula scandal, when officials suppressed warnings about tainted milk and 300,000 children fell ill as a result. Over the next few years, Hong Kongers were outraged by the moral and national education controversy, and protested against the extension of the mainland\u2019s high-speed train line, fearing it was another sign of how the mainland wanted to swallow up Hong Kong. They were also alarmed by Beijing\u2019s increasing authoritarianism and repression \u2013 particularly after Xi Jinping took power in 2012 \u2013 and the mainland\u2019s growing impact on the city. It began to become evident that the mainland\u2019s economic boom was not making it more like Hong Kong, as some had once thought inevitable. It was making Hong Kong more like the mainland. Alongside the political anxieties came economic frustrations. Hong Kong is one of the most unequal developed economies in the world. In a city full of designer stores and flashy restaurants, it is impossible to ignore the gap between the rich and the poor. A handful of ultra-rich families prosper while the very poorest dwell in tiny \u201ccoffin homes\u201d, less than 2 square metres in size. Even middle-class young people see no hope of moving out of cramped family apartments. Since 1997, about 1 million new residents have arrived from the mainland, without a corresponding increase in public spending, adding to the pressure on services and contributing to soaring property prices. Over the past decade, Max Chung, an activist from a residential area near the border with China, has seen his neighbourhood transformed by visitors from the mainland who come to Hong Kong on weekend shopping trips. \u201cYou can\u2019t even get a table at a restaurant,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want to take back our normal lives. We don\u2019t want the Chinese suitcases to roll over our feet. We want to have normal food, not the expensive ones. We really want to take back what we used to have.\u201d There is undoubted snobbery, and at times outright bigotry, in the way that many in Hong Kong talk about mainlanders \u2013 casting them as uncouth, uncultured \u201clocusts\u201d straining services and taking over the town. But Hong Kong has also chafed at what it sees as the arrogance of the mainland: the belief that Mandarin should take precedence over Cantonese, and that Hong Kong should simply adapt to the expectations of new arrivals. \u201cThey think: I give you money, so I am the boss. So they can be rude. They can do anything they want,\u201d said Jay, a 21-year-old student \u2013 like many activists, he preferred not to give his name. The hollowness of liberty without democracy has become clear to all. Hong Kong\u2019s 3.8 million voters can choose district councillors to handle matters such as bus routes. But the city\u2019s chief executive is elected by a committee of only 1,200, composed of representatives from business and other groups, as well as elected legislators. The system ensures that the successful candidate is Beijing\u2019s candidate. It has also traditionally given the wealthy a big say in choosing the leader, in a society where a tiny number of tycoon families already have disproportionate power, owning everything from supermarket chains and insurance firms to utility companies and housing. Beijing has now begun to accuse the same oligarchs it once relied upon of being greedy. It sees the protests, at root, as an economic problem, seized upon by \u201ctroublemakers\u201d and hostile foreign powers. But the tradeoff that the party has offered on the mainland \u2013 material security in place of political freedoms \u2013 does not attract Hong Kongers. People don\u2019t believe they\u2019re getting a decent economic deal, and they see political space as a right, not an optional extra. The grievances about their standard of living have morphed into deeply political sentiment. Over time, as discontent grew, so did the number of protests. In 2004, there were 1,975 protests in Hong Kong; by 2015 that had risen to 6,029. Tactics began to diversify. Attendance at the Tiananmen vigils began to rise. The friends who once snubbed Bonnie Leung now called her and asked if they could go together. * * * Despite the mounting frustrations of Hong Kongers, by early 2019, the pro-democracy movement looked to many as though it was in terminal decline. The last major protests, which took place in 2014, had ended in failure, and since then the erosion of Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms had accelerated. On 31 March 2019, the usual stalwarts \u2013 Martin Lee, pro-democracy politicians and Joshua Wong, the teenage face of the 2014 umbrella movement \u2013 demonstrated against the extradition bill. The implications of the bill seemed obvious: if Hong Kong\u2019s residents could easily be extradited to face the party-controlled mainland legal system, did \u201ctwo systems\u201d really exist any more? It looked like a death blow to Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy. Yet recent history had showed the severe costs of challenging Beijing. The crowd totalled just 12,000. To understand the movement that has taken shape over the past year, you need to understand its relationship with its predecessor, the umbrella movement. Those protests also centred on a demand for real universal suffrage, electrified the city and grabbed international attention. But they did not achieve their goals, and today many scorn the earlier movement as timid and unserious. \u201cAfter umbrella, I felt totally disappointed in Hong Kong people,\u201d said Jay, the student. \u201cI was there on 28 September 2014. I was shot by teargas and pepper spray. The next day people were singing songs like it was a carnival. So I think they\u2019re hopeless.\u201d From 2014 onwards, Beijing did everything it could to crush the possibility of another umbrella movement. Members of the Democratic Legislative council were disqualified from the parliament. Independent bookshops disappeared, while five booksellers dealing in salacious titles about China\u2019s leaders were kidnapped and transported to the mainland. Hong Kong University rejected the highly regarded human-rights scholar Johannes Chan for a senior position after pro-Beijing newspapers waged a campaign against him, increasing concerns about pressure on academia. The umbrella movement leaders were jailed; the best-known, Wong, warned that Beijing\u2019s encroachment had already diminished one country, two systems to \u201cone country, one-and-a-half\u201d. The defeat of the umbrella movement had looked to most like an end, not a beginning. In retrospect, it was the moment when many Hong Kongers started to believe that polite protest wouldn\u2019t work. For people like Jay, the umbrella movement has been a useful example of what not to do. Those protests demanded universal suffrage; this time round, they are primarily a stand against the erosion of rights. Those had charismatic leaders; these are leaderless and decentralised. Those were led by academics and students; these span classes, with construction workers and finance professionals joining forces. Those were committed to polite civil disobedience; these are more radical, and at times violent. Above all, the umbrella movement fractured quickly, while this time \u2013 despite all the government\u2019s efforts to split the movement \u2013 people have stayed unified. Yet when the mass protests began in June 2019, they were peaceful. In mid-June, after police fired tear gas on protesters outside the seat of the government, the Legislative Complex, protesters formed what is known as the \u201cfive demands\u201d, which included the withdrawal of the bill and an independent inquiry into police brutality. On 15 June, Carrie Lam, the city\u2019s chief executive, announced she was suspending the legislation. But as many as 2 million people took to the streets the following day. Though he is known as Hong Kong\u2019s father of democracy, Martin Lee was initially reluctant to join the demonstration. He thought it was time to negotiate: \u201cI would have liked the movement to stop,\u201d he admitted when we met last autumn at his wood-panelled chambers in central Hong Kong, where a bust of Winston Churchill stood on a shelf. In the end, he concluded he should march because the bill had been postponed rather than scrapped and might yet be revived. Lee embodies the city\u2019s tradition of courageous but pragmatic, cautious activism. But he, like so many in the city, found himself swept along by the tide. Others in the movement began to adopt more radical tactics, storming the legislative council on 1 July. Harsher police crackdowns spurred further protests as demonstrators escalated in response. Authorities refused permission for rallies and police violence intensified. Officers arrested bystanders for heckling them, drove vehicles directly at protesters and fired at journalists, in one case leaving a woman blind in one eye. Thugs were unleashed upon protesters and prominent activists, leaving them bloodied and beaten. In August, protesters paralysed the airport, forcing thousands of flights to be cancelled as police began to use live rounds. On 1 October, China\u2019s national day, a police officer shot a 21-year-old student in the chest, while across town, a middle-aged man arguing with protesters was set on fire. The government invoked the emergency regulations ordinance, awarding itself draconian powers. In November, universities were turned into fortified camps for protesters, leading to a 12-day siege. Hundreds have been charged with the vaguely defined offence of rioting, which can carry a 10-year prison sentence, and more than 1,000 children have been arrested. If the protests were initially motivated by fear about Hong Kong\u2019s future, as they continued, a new sense of identity and community formed. It was evident in the flashmob performances of the new \u201canthem\u201d, Glory to Hong Kong, held in the shopping malls that once seemed to epitomise the city\u2019s individualism and devotion to consumption. It was evident, too, in the networks that formed to provide mutual aid, from feeding activists to treating the injuries of protesters who were too afraid of arrest to go to hospital. (These networks would find new purpose when the coronavirus reached Hong Kong. While the government dithered, the people took action: tracking cases and warning of apparent hot spots; distributing masks to the poor and elderly.) The sheer inventiveness of protesters helped to maintain a movement that most expected to fizzle out within weeks. The Hong Kong Way, a 30-mile human chain that stretched across the city in late August, revived the spirits of supporters. Other actions had a concrete effect. The landslide for pro-democracy candidates in November\u2019s local elections didn\u2019t just send a message to Beijing. District councillors are among the few allowed to vote for the chief executive \u2013 potentially giving pro-democrats a greater say in who replaces Lam. It was followed by a surge in the formation of pro-democracy trade unions. For Helen, a protester in her late 20s, the past year has redefined how she sees Hong Kong. \u201cWe valued economics over a lot of things before,\u201d she said. \u201cThis time around, you see that people care for freedom and rights over economics. We found out how much we loved this place.\u201d * * * While most protesters remained peaceful, a significant number started to adopt more extreme tactics, attacking Chinese state-owned businesses and companies seen to sympathise with the government. In a few cases, they assaulted locals sympathetic to Beijing. One man was killed by a stone thrown, seemingly by a protester, in a clash. Along the route of a march in September, someone had scrawled under a bus stop: \u201cToday Xinjiang, tomorrow Hong Kong.\u201d To outsiders, it might have seemed incredible to compare this still largely rural region of western China, which is kept under extraordinarily repressive security, to this cosmopolitan global financial centre, still by far the freest part of China. Protesters saw Xinjiang as a warning: if they did not take a stand now, they would never be able to do so. People were fighting not to win, but because they knew what losing meant. Many young protesters speak of a willingness to die for the cause, writing wills and last messages for their families to find. \u201cThere is some part of me that has changed,\u201d says Niko Cheng, 22, a nursing student who volunteers as a medic. For months she has been prepared to be arrested, sacrificing her future. And at the height of the protests in the summer, she was ready to die if that would help to expose the brutality of the police. \u201cIf you have been to the frontline once, you feel that everyone surrounding you loves Hong Kong so much, and they are willing to do everything for it,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of them have already given up their future to be here. After that, you can\u2019t go back to being a normal person again. You can\u2019t just watch,\u201d she said. Though there is no doubt that protesters have been violent, there is widespread suspicion in the movement \u2013 rightly or not \u2013 that undercover officers have acted as agents provocateurs. There is also fury that no police have been held responsible for outrages. Before the protests, just 6% of the population said it had no trust in the police; now, more than half report zero trust. The population is traumatised and exhausted. A study by the University of Hong Kong suggested that one in three adults had symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, comparable to rates in conflict zones. (This may underestimate the extent of the problem, since only those over 18 were surveyed, while many protesters are younger.) As support for the movement has intensified, so has opposition to it. A large chunk of the population, not only recent arrivals from the mainland, is equally passionate in rejecting the movement. Friends have fallen out. Parents have kicked out activist children. Helen, the protester whose view of Hong Kong has been transformed by the protests, hadn\u2019t spoken to her father for months, even though they live in the same small flat. He couldn\u2019t understand how irresponsible she was being. She couldn\u2019t understand how a man who had swum across the sea to escape Mao\u2019s China had become so loyal to Beijing. The rallying cry for Helen\u2019s generation has been \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time\u201d. Now some have become supportive of the idea of full independence from the mainland, even if they believe it unrealisable. As people gathered late last month to protest Beijing\u2019s announcement of the national security law, they chanted a slogan rarely heard before: \u201cHong Kong independence, the only way out!\u201d Activism in Hong Kong was always constrained by the understanding of how little was possible. Margaret Ng, a veteran democratic activist and former legislator, describes Hong Kong\u2019s struggle with Beijing as \u201cDavid and Goliath, without the sling\u201d. But the political space has shrunk so far that, for some, the end result is not caution but nihilism. An ideology of self-destruction known as lam chao, or \u201cIf we burn, you burn with us\u201d, has gained momentum. More radical demonstrators believe the collapse of Hong Kong is the only way to really bring change. \u201cWe are not afraid. If the Chinese army comes out, we will celebrate. The entire Hong Kong business environment will collapse. If they call the military here, it would ruin Hong Kong and also mainland China\u2019s economy,\u201d said Yan, 26. \u201cI have hope, but my hope is that we take China down with us,\u201d Helen said. * * * Beijing has abandoned any pretence of winning hearts and minds. With the prospect of pro-democracy candidates making inroads in this September\u2019s elections for the legislative council, and the international cover afforded by the coronavirus pandemic, repression by authorities has dramatically intensified. Now they are doing through fear what they failed to do through persuasion. In the months before the new national security law was announced, Beijing replaced its envoy in Hong Kong with an enforcer lacking experience of the region but known for his hardline tactics. The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office described protesters as a \u201cpolitical virus\u201d that required elimination. In April, 15 of the region\u2019s best-known pro-democracy figures were arrested on charges of illegal assembly. They included Margaret Ng, the media tycoon Jimmy Lai, Lee Cheuk-yan, a key vigil organiser \u2013 and Martin Lee, who had until now avoided the fate that Prince Charles had feared in 1997. \u201cI\u2019m relieved and very proud to finally be listed as a defendant after seeing so many brilliant young people arrested and charged,\u201d the 81-year-old told reporters. Even after these ominous moves, the news of the national security law was shattering. \u201cIf the extradition bill was a rifle aimed at our rights, the national security legislation is a machine gun,\u201d Lai wrote. Johannes Chan, the legal scholar, said: \u201cHistory tells us the law will soon apply to all kinds of political dissidents, then it will apply to media, NGOs, the lawyers and basically anyone who criticises the government.\u201d That is how the mainland\u2019s laws are used. The Nobel peace prize laureate Liu Xiaobo died while serving an 11-year sentence for incitement to subvert state power. His crime was a call for democratic reforms. After the announcement, downloads of VPNs soared, as did calls to immigration consultants. Some in Hong Kong always saw the movement as a last-ditch bid to stay in their home. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019m leaving,\u201d one professional said when the anti-extradition bill first drove him to the streets in anger in July. But the spur for many protesters was the knowledge that they would not be able to do so. \u201cAcross classes, people in Hong Kong have completely lost trust in the PRC. They just give up hope entirely. If they cannot leave, what can they do? Many people are asking this question,\u201d says Ming Sing, an associate professor at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Authorities insist there is nothing to fear, claiming that the new law will only target \u201ca narrow set of acts\u201d, and that the vast majority of Hong Kong residents will not be affected. Yet Carrie Lam has refused to rule out the law being applied retrospectively, and her statements seem designed to induce rather than allay people\u2019s fears: \u201cWe are a very free society, so for the time being, people have the freedom to say whatever they want to say\u201d, she told reporters in May. Some Hong Kong residents are genuinely anxious to put the unrest behind them as the city plunges deeper into recession. But many are also under intense pressure to demonstrate support for Beijing. Victor Li, the son of the billionaire tycoon Li Ka-shing, said he hoped that the legislation would help the city\u2019s society and economy return to normal. The heads of five of the city\u2019s universities also endorsed the law, along with hundreds of celebrities and artists. State media claim that 2.93 million residents have signed a petition backing the law, though protesters believe this figure is wildly implausible. With the law yet to be drafted, Hong Kong\u2019s protesters hope international pressure could still have some impact on its final form, and how it is implemented and enforced. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure even Beijing would have not preferred to exercise this nuclear option \u2026 we made Beijing pay the full price,\u201d the researcher and activist Lokman Tsui wrote in a Facebook post the morning after the announcement. \u201cTaiwan is watching. The United States is watching. Beijing is on notice, in front of the entire world. We have hope because we act. We take the hit, we get up and we live to fight another day.\u201d Beijing appears unfazed by US threats or international criticism. Even as the Chinese economy struggles to recover amid the pandemic, it no longer \u201cneeds\u201d Hong Kong as it once did. In 1997, Hong Kong\u2019s economy was equivalent to 20% of the mainland economy; now it is about 3%. Either Beijing has gambled that Trump won\u2019t follow through on threats to remove the region\u2019s special trade status, or \u2013 more likely \u2013 it has concluded that asserting its own power takes precedence. It, too, can take the hit. * * * Though the fear in Hong Kong is palpable, resistance has not yet disappeared. This year has seen a marked shift to what political scientist Edmund Cheng calls \u201ceveryday resistance\u201d, such as trade unionisation and the \u201cyellow-ribbon economy\u201d, supporting only local businesses that back the protests. This is what opposition might look like in the long-term. The Tiananmen commemoration, too, is evolving. Despite the ban, thousands of Hong Kong residents descended on Victoria Park. Others held vigils throughout each of the city\u2019s districts. \u201cYou can seal the park but you can\u2019t seal people\u2019s hearts,\u201d said Han Dongfang, a labour rights activist who led protests in Beijing in 1989. For many, this year\u2019s commemoration was no longer just about those who died in Beijing, but Hong Kong\u2019s struggle. The usual slogans calling for the CPC to reckon with the massacre were drowned out by chants of the protest movement, as well newer slogans calling for independence: \u201cOne-nation Hong Kong\u201d. The crowd included the older generation and young activists, who now see the events of 1989 as a warning. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do something now, maybe someday Hong Kong will become like June 4,\u201d said Zack Ho, 18, who attended a vigil near his home before rushing to join the main one in Victoria Park. \u201cWe saw how the tanks rode over students. That\u2019s the real picture of how evil the Chinese regime is. We have to remind Hong Kongers that maybe that\u2019s the future of Hong Kong.\u201d The massacre, and the vigils to commemorate it, planted the seeds for today\u2019s Hong Kong: the understanding of what is at stake, and the sacrifices that may be required to defend it. The CPC drew its own lessons from the events of that year \u2013 not just Tiananmen, but the collapse of the Soviet Union. It learned to avoid a bloody crackdown if you can help it \u2013 the costs are too high \u2013 but also to avoid concessions, and to hold on to political power at all costs. Will Hong Kong ever see another mass commemoration of 1989? \u201cI think it will be one of the things that they really want to get rid of,\u201d said Leung. \u201cIt is totally peaceful. We hold candles. We do nothing but mourn, and be the guardians of the truth. But the idea is so threatening to the Communist party.\u201d It echoed her earlier remark that Hong Kongers knew, even when they didn\u2019t care: not just about 1989, but about all the events that had followed in its wake \u2013 as mainlanders could not. The vigil stood not only for the city\u2019s freedoms of assembly and expression, but also of information. That knowledge gave them the choice to exercise their rights or not, and to imagine another future, however impossible it might be to realise. No one can doubt, now, that Hong Kong people care. But how long will they know? How many candles will light up the darkness in the years to come?

      "body": "<p>From top to bottom, from big to small, from freelancer to staffer, from humble hall to grand auditorium, the world of classical music is facing its biggest crisis in living memory. Most musicians in the UK work freelance, even members of many big-name orchestras, so for them no gigs means no earnings. Some qualify for help for the self-employed, but many don\u2019t. Conservatoires \u2013 employers of musicians, producers of future talent \u2013 are facing a financial crisis as overseas students stay away. All the backroom people who usually keep the show on the road, from agents to publishers, are haemorrhaging money. Concert halls and opera houses cannot earn.</p> <p>In London, the Royal Albert Hall and the South Bank have warned of imminent catastrophe. The Royal Opera House can keep going \u201cfor a few months\u201d, says its chief executive, Alex Beard. But when your art form is \u201ca hundred people on stage, a hundred in the pit and 2,700 in the audience\u201d, when your financial model means you break even when you sell 95% of your tickets, when public subsidy accounts for only 20% of your income, rather than 80% as it would in Germany, it is obvious that you are going to hit the buffers. \u201cIn many ways all this is a purification, a chance to start again,\u201d says John Gilhooly, director of London\u2019s Wigmore Hall. \u201cBut there is huge anxiety and hardship. Orchestras could be going to the wall in the next 12 weeks.\u201d</p> <p>There is a deep contrast beginning to open up between the UK and much of continental Europe. For our neighbours, public investment in culture is much greater, and organisations are less reliant on box-office income, so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">the Covid-19 crisis</a> is not an existential one, as it is in the UK. And there has been silence from the upper echelons of government. \u201cI\u2019m desperately worried for my orchestra in London,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/simon-rattle\">Simon Rattle</a> told fellow conductor Alan Gilbert recently, in a conversation on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GilbertConducts/\">Facebook</a>. \u201cI\u2019m so scared for the financial hardship that they will be going through.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"eca3739cc142fcb912361c23017871e82ff712c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eca3739cc142fcb912361c23017871e82ff712c1/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The future? \u2026Britten\u2019s opera Peter Grimes staged on the beach at Aldeburgh, Suffolk.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The future? \u2026Britten\u2019s opera Peter Grimes staged on the beach at Aldeburgh, Suffolk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet when I spoke to Christoph Lieben-Seutter, artistic director of the Elbphilharmonie in Hamburg, he had a different attitude. \u201cWe are not afraid,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause culture has great importance in the public realm in Germany and we cannot be allowed to fail.\u201d He has announced a full autumn season for the hall, albeit with the proviso that things may change.</p> <p>This kind of recovery seems some way off in the UK, notwithstanding the recitals that <a href=\"https://wigmore-hall.org.uk/wigmore-series/special-broadcasts\">began in the Wigmore Hall last week</a>, relayed to the ultimate socially distanced audience, the listeners of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006tny5\">Radio 3</a> and viewers online. The performing arts will be among the last activities to be resumed as the UK continues its faltering and divisive progress out of lockdown.</p> <p>Kathryn McDowell, managing director of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/london-symphony-orchestra\">London Symphony Orchestra</a>, tells me she is contemplating a return for the orchestra that might involve hour-long concerts, performed twice in an evening to a socially distant audience, with the hall cleaned in between. Others, including John Summers, the outgoing managing director of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/halle-orchestra\">the Hall\u00e9 in Manchester</a>, think differently. \u201cIt\u2019s time to batten down the hatches,\u201d he says. \u201cDoing concerts to small numbers of people can\u2019t do anything but lose you money.\u201d</p> <p>Martyn Brabbins, music director of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/english-national-opera-eno\">English National Opera</a>, isn\u2019t alone in voicing an urgent need to get going as soon as possible. \u201cWe have a wonderful orchestra, chorus, lighting and tech team \u2013 everyone we need to make an amazing series of events,\u201d he says. \u201cIt would be irresponsible and lazy not to be trying to do something.\u201d The company is planning a <a href=\"https://eno.org/news/eno-is-launching-eno-drive-live-a-series-of-live-opera-performances-that-audiences-can-safely-drive-to-and-stay-in-their-cars-for-the-experience/\">drive-through La Boh\u00e8me</a> at Alexandra Palace in London.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d51e7a59ad8415ea6a0b4c6d476dfe4513b6afad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d51e7a59ad8415ea6a0b4c6d476dfe4513b6afad/38_145_3505_2103/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A car park concert in Peckham \u2026 \u2018The idea that music of high stature has to be performed in buildings of high stature closes things down,\u2019 says Kate Romano.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A car park concert in Peckham \u2026 \u2018The idea that music of high stature has to be performed in buildings of high stature closes things down,\u2019 says Kate Romano.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ambra Vernuccio</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is no consensus: but having houses only 20-30% full, as is being planned for socially distant performances in Europe, is economically impossible in the UK without a huge injection of government support. Beyond that bald fact are dozens of intricacies. What to do about the toilets? What to do about the bar? Will audiences pay full whack for a short concert? Will they come at all, particularly those who are older? What do you do if you tour to multiple venues, each with their own distinct insurance arrangements? And how would you travel? What do you do if you are based in Wales, but tour to England, where regulations are different? What do you do about evidence of the spread of the virus by aerosolisation? Spit, not to put too fine a point on it, is the inevitable byproduct of singing and brass.&nbsp;</p> <p>This crisis is largely hidden from the public. No great figures of the music world have spoken out publicly; the only remarks to have made the headlines have been Prince Charles\u2019s anguished mumblings, in an <a href=\"https://www.classicfm.com/music-news/exclusive-programmes-prince-of-wales/\">interview with Classic FM</a>, about the importance of the Royal Opera House. By contrast, figures in British theatre, who face many similar problems,&nbsp;have been much more adept at raising awareness. Many \u2013 directors Rufus Norris and Vicky Featherstone, producer Sonia Friedmann, playwright James Graham and more \u2013 have been writing articles and appearing on TV and radio for weeks.</p> <p>The classical music world in the UK is used to being on the defensive, each part conserving its own precious inheritance from the past. Theatre, however, is used to creating new narratives. \u201cWe\u2019ve been banging on about the crisis in classical music for ages,\u201d says clarinettist and producer <a href=\"http://kateromano.co.uk/we-need-to-talk-about-classical-music/\">Kate Romano</a>. \u201cThe drop in provision of GCSE music, the ageing audience.

      "bodyText": "From top to bottom, from big to small, from freelancer to staffer, from humble hall to grand auditorium, the world of classical music is facing its biggest crisis in living memory. Most musicians in the UK work freelance, even members of many big-name orchestras, so for them no gigs means no earnings. Some qualify for help for the self-employed, but many don\u2019t. Conservatoires \u2013 employers of musicians, producers of future talent \u2013 are facing a financial crisis as overseas students stay away. All the backroom people who usually keep the show on the road, from agents to publishers, are haemorrhaging money. Concert halls and opera houses cannot earn. In London, the Royal Albert Hall and the South Bank have warned of imminent catastrophe. The Royal Opera House can keep going \u201cfor a few months\u201d, says its chief executive, Alex Beard. But when your art form is \u201ca hundred people on stage, a hundred in the pit and 2,700 in the audience\u201d, when your financial model means you break even when you sell 95% of your tickets, when public subsidy accounts for only 20% of your income, rather than 80% as it would in Germany, it is obvious that you are going to hit the buffers. \u201cIn many ways all this is a purification, a chance to start again,\u201d says John Gilhooly, director of London\u2019s Wigmore Hall. \u201cBut there is huge anxiety and hardship. Orchestras could be going to the wall in the next 12 weeks.\u201d There is a deep contrast beginning to open up between the UK and much of continental Europe. For our neighbours, public investment in culture is much greater, and organisations are less reliant on box-office income, so the Covid-19 crisis is not an existential one, as it is in the UK. And there has been silence from the upper echelons of government. \u201cI\u2019m desperately worried for my orchestra in London,\u201d Simon Rattle told fellow conductor Alan Gilbert recently, in a conversation on Facebook. \u201cI\u2019m so scared for the financial hardship that they will be going through.\u201d Yet when I spoke to Christoph Lieben-Seutter, artistic director of the Elbphilharmonie in Hamburg, he had a different attitude. \u201cWe are not afraid,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause culture has great importance in the public realm in Germany and we cannot be allowed to fail.\u201d He has announced a full autumn season for the hall, albeit with the proviso that things may change. This kind of recovery seems some way off in the UK, notwithstanding the recitals that began in the Wigmore Hall last week, relayed to the ultimate socially distanced audience, the listeners of Radio 3 and viewers online. The performing arts will be among the last activities to be resumed as the UK continues its faltering and divisive progress out of lockdown. Kathryn McDowell, managing director of the London Symphony Orchestra, tells me she is contemplating a return for the orchestra that might involve hour-long concerts, performed twice in an evening to a socially distant audience, with the hall cleaned in between. Others, including John Summers, the outgoing managing director of the Hall\u00e9 in Manchester, think differently. \u201cIt\u2019s time to batten down the hatches,\u201d he says. \u201cDoing concerts to small numbers of people can\u2019t do anything but lose you money.\u201d Martyn Brabbins, music director of English National Opera, isn\u2019t alone in voicing an urgent need to get going as soon as possible. \u201cWe have a wonderful orchestra, chorus, lighting and tech team \u2013 everyone we need to make an amazing series of events,\u201d he says. \u201cIt would be irresponsible and lazy not to be trying to do something.\u201d The company is planning a drive-through La Boh\u00e8me at Alexandra Palace in London. There is no consensus: but having houses only 20-30% full, as is being planned for socially distant performances in Europe, is economically impossible in the UK without a huge injection of government support. Beyond that bald fact are dozens of intricacies. What to do about the toilets? What to do about the bar? Will audiences pay full whack for a short concert? Will they come at all, particularly those who are older? What do you do if you tour to multiple venues, each with their own distinct insurance arrangements? And how would you travel? What do you do if you are based in Wales, but tour to England, where regulations are different? What do you do about evidence of the spread of the virus by aerosolisation? Spit, not to put too fine a point on it, is the inevitable byproduct of singing and brass. This crisis is largely hidden from the public. No great figures of the music world have spoken out publicly; the only remarks to have made the headlines have been Prince Charles\u2019s anguished mumblings, in an interview with Classic FM, about the importance of the Royal Opera House. By contrast, figures in British theatre, who face many similar problems, have been much more adept at raising awareness. Many \u2013 directors Rufus Norris and Vicky Featherstone, producer Sonia Friedmann, playwright James Graham and more \u2013 have been writing articles and appearing on TV and radio for weeks. The classical music world in the UK is used to being on the defensive, each part conserving its own precious inheritance from the past. Theatre, however, is used to creating new narratives. \u201cWe\u2019ve been banging on about the crisis in classical music for ages,\u201d says clarinettist and producer Kate Romano. \u201cThe drop in provision of GCSE music, the ageing audience. Now we\u2019ve really got a crisis, it\u2019s just not the one we thought we were going to have. Maybe it\u2019s not the pandemic that\u2019s the real crisis. It\u2019s underlying things in the way we operate. We could be looking for something better now \u2013 if we have the guts to talk about it.\u201d The environment, for example, has become an urgent new focus of conversation, given how the deeply damaging airport-to-concert-to-airport lifestyle of classical\u2019s jetset has juddered to an emergency stop. \u201cThe days of all these orchestras going over the globe \u2013 this is unthinkable,\u201d said Rattle. John Summers of the Hall\u00e9 says touring \u2013 sticking 90 musicians and their instruments on a plane to somewhere that already has an orchestra of its own \u2013 is a form of \u201cvanity publishing\u201d. Of the LSO, McDowell says: \u201cWe might limit long haul to once a year. For Europe, a single long trip by train. It would be better for everyone\u2019s health and wellbeing.\u201d John Gilhooly, who runs the Wigmore Hall, says that instead of having a pianist like Igor Levit come to and from London several times a season to perform a series, he is thinking of inviting him for a single, concentrated period.

      "bodyText": "The government has been accused of \u201cincompetence and complacency\u201d in its handling of an independent review of Prevent, the programme that aims to stop people from becoming terrorists, amid further delays to its completion. The review was first announced in January 2019 and it has been beset by delays. Its first chair, Lord Carlile, was forced to step down in December 2019 and it took four months for the Home Office to launch a recruitment campaign for his replacement. Since then, the department has extended the window for applications from 1 June to 22 June with the final interviews not taking place until the end of July. A counter-terrorism and sentencing bill that will have its second reading in the House of Commons on Tuesday seeks to remove a statutory deadline for ministers to respond to the review\u2019s findings. Conor McGinn, the shadow security minister, said: \u201cThe Prevent review should have finished its work and reported to ministers this month, but the government\u2019s incompetence and complacency means it won\u2019t even have started. \u201cThe introduction of a new counter-terrorism bill before the Prevent review has even begun underlines just how much time the government has wasted. Ministers must ensure there are no further delays or they will risk further undermining the credibility of the review and their own counter-terrorism strategy.\u201d A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThe Independent Review of Prevent began in August 2019 and the Government wants to see it concluded as soon as possible. \u201cWe have launched a full and open competition to appoint a new Reviewer following Lord Carlile stepping down, and have extended the application period in recognition of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\u201d Communities, activists and civil liberties organisations have been calling for a review of Prevent for years, claiming that it fosters discrimination against people of Muslim faith or background. Advocates of the strategy reject this and say it has successfully diverted vulnerable individuals from being radicalised. The most controversial element of the Prevent programme is the statutory duty imposed on schools, NHS trusts, prisons, local authorities and other public bodies to report concerns about people they suspect may be at risk of turning to extremism. The Home Office said it had extended the deadline for applications due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and to \u201censure that as broad a range of candidates as possible have the opportunity to apply\u201d. The counter-terrorism and sentencing bill returning to parliament on Tuesday includes proposals to weaken the burden of proof for terrorism prevention and investigation measures (Tpims) to be imposed on people suspected of terrorist activity and remove the two-year cap on their use. Tpims are controversial and resource-heavy measures \u2013 usually based on secret intelligence \u2013 for controlling the risk presented by terrorism suspects at large where criminal prosecution is not an option. The bill introduces a new \u201cserious terrorism sentence\u201d with a 14-year minimum jail term and up to 25 years on licence for the most dangerous offences, broadly defined as featuring a likelihood of multiple deaths.",

There\u2019s more in our Coronavirus Extra section further down \u2026 and here\u2019s where you can find all our coverage of the outbreak \u2013 from breaking news to factchecks and advice. * * * \u2018I hear you\u2019 \u2013 Boris Johnson has responded to Black Lives Matter protests by acknowledging the \u201cincontrovertible, undeniable feeling of injustice\u201d motivating the rallies, while condemning those who have flouted social distancing. \u201cYou are right, we are all right, to say Black Lives Matter; and to all those who have chosen to protest peacefully and who have insisted on social distancing \u2013 I say, yes of course I hear you, and I understand. \u201cBut I must also say that we are in a time of national trial, when for months this whole country has come together to fight a deadly plague. After such sacrifice, we cannot now let it get out of control.\u201d Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, has sparked some unease in his party after he condemned as \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d the tearing down of the statue of Edward Colston in Bristol \u2013 saying \u201cwe can\u2019t, in 21st century Britain, have a slaver on a statue\u201d but it should have been taken down properly and put in a museum. In the US, where protests continue, a judge has set $1m bail on Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer charged with second-degree murder after he was filmed kneeling on George Floyd\u2019s neck for nearly nine minutes before Floyd died. * * * \u2018Seeking publicity\u2019 \u2013 Prince Andrew has become embroiled in a war of words with US prosecutors investigating the child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. His lawyers issued a statement on Monday accusing US investigators of misleading the public and breaching their own confidentiality rules. The firm alleged the US Department of Justice (DoJ), despite its claims, had effectively rejected three offers of help volunteered by the prince this year. The firm suggested US authorities were \u201cseeking publicity\u201d in their attcks on Andrew. In reply to Monday\u2019s letter, Geoffrey Berman, the US attorney for the southern district of New York, wrote that Andrew\u2019s lawyers had previously \u201cinformed us unequivocally\u201d that the prince would not come in for an interview, but if he would \u201cour doors remain open\u201d. * * * Rape victim adds to McCann case \u2013 An Irish woman raped in Portugal has asked detectives investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann to review her case after hearing about the German prisoner who is now the main suspect. Hazel Behan was working in Praia da Rocha, Portugal, 30 minutes\u2019 drive from where Madeleine was abducted, when she was viciously raped by a stranger in her apartment in 2004. The assailant was never caught. Christian Br\u00fcckner has been named as a key suspect in Madeleine\u2019s 2007 disappearance. The 43-year-old German was recently convicted of raping a 72-year-old American woman in Praia da Luz in 2005. Behan, who has waived anonymity, said: \u201cMy mind was blown when I read how he had attacked a woman in 2005, both the tactics and the methods he used.\u201d Behan has given a statement to the Met. * * * Underground radar reveals ancient city \u2013 Archaeologists have mapped a complete Roman city for the first time using ground-penetrating radar. The detailed scanning of the town of Falerii Novi, just over 30 miles north of Rome, has uncovered the layout of the city\u2019s water system, offering new clues to how it was planned and laid out. As well as a bath house, theatre, shops and several temples, the team from the universities of Cambridge and Ghent discovered a large public monument of a kind never seen before, which may relate to the religion of the pre-Roman population. First occupied in 241BC, Falerii Novi survived until around AD700 but few ruins remain visible above ground. Unusually the 30 hectare site has not been built over, allowing it to be scanned quickly using antennae towed behind a quad bike. Coronavirus Extra Why is it more difficult to stay physically apart from friends and family than a stranger in a supermarket queue? Nicola Davis speaks to Prof John Drury about the psychology of physical distancing and why we like to be near those with whom we feel emotionally close. \u201cWe sold eight bikes in 20 minutes!\u201d Shops can barely keep up with demand as bicycles \u2013 and even parts \u2013 sell out. But experts say time is running out to grasp the \u201conce-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity to change how we travel. As coronavirus patients across the UK are discharged, photojournalist Jonny Weeks meets some of those reunited with their loved ones after being released from University hospital, Coventry. Today in Focus podcast: Could curtain fall on British theatre? Every year 34 million people go to the theatre, double the number that attend Premier League football. But lockdown and physical distancing rules mean the industry is on the edge of collapse. The artistic director of the Pitlochry theatre, Elizabeth Newman, describes the impact. Lunchtime read: How Hong Kong caught fire Hong Kong used to be seen as cautious, pragmatic and materialistic. But in the past year increasingly bold pro-democracy demonstrations have transformed the city. Now, as Beijing tightens its grip, how much longer can the year-old protest movement survive? Sport Raheem Sterling has called for English football to seize the moment and finally address its lack of black representation in positions of power. Lewis Hamilton has supported unequivocally the actions of protesters who pulled down the statue of Edward Colston in Bristol. Premiership rugby clubs have unanimously agreed to reduce the salary cap to \u00a35m for the 2021-22 season, the Guardian understands. Tony Dunne, one of Manchester United\u2019s European Cup heroes of 1968, has died at the age of 78. And jobs are to be lost at the Racing Post, the daily paper that serves horse racing and its followers, with its owner blaming loss of revenue caused by the Covid-19 crisis. Business Britain\u2019s retailers suffered another steep fall in sales in May with monthly figures showing that consumers spent 5.9% less than in the same month last year. However, there were some signs of hope with office supplies, fitness equipment and bicycle suppliers all performing well thanks to strong online sales. BP, one of Britain\u2019s biggest companies, is not immune from the crisis and is shedding 10,000 jobs worldwide thanks to falling demand for oil. Stocks broadly continued their rally in Asia overnight with the FTSE100 expected to open flat this morning while the pound is buying $1.272 and \u20ac1.126. The papers The Guardian leads with \u201cBid to defuse tensions as racism protests escalate\u201d. The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, is seeking to apply pressure on the Metropolitan police, the UK\u2019s largest force, over the use of stop and search, Tasers and other practices. The Times summarises Priti Patel: \u201cStatue thugs must face justice\u201d though it might be questionable whether an inanimate object can be subjected to thuggery. The home secretary is on the Metro\u2019s front page as well: \u201cThis is Priti pointless\u201d \u2013 the story is about the 14-day quarantine strictures. The Mail has \u201cAndrew and US at war on Epstein\u201d. The front also points to a story inside: \u201cGerman police shock revelation: we have evidence Maddie is dead\u201d and the Mirror has that one as its splash: \u201cGerman cops on Maddie: we have evidence she is dead\u201d. The FT leads with \u201cBP to slash 10,000 jobs as virus crisis hammers oil\u201d \u2013 here is our version of that story. The Express has \u201cVirus in retreat but we can\u2019t risk 2nd wave\u201d while the Telegraph leads on \u201cSchools may remain shut beyond September\u201d.

      "bodyText": "1. Who was Edward Colston and why was his Bristol statue toppled? \u2018In 1680 Colston joined the Royal African Company company that had a monopoly on the west African slave trade. The company branded the slaves \u2013 including women and children \u2013 with its RAC initials on their chests. It is believed to have sold about 100,000 west African people in the Caribbean and the Americas between 1672 and 1689.\u2019 2. I am still learning about racism \u2013 but I know a history-changing moment when I see one \u2018History is made and unmade in a moment. To witness such moments is thrilling. Watching the statue of Edward Colston pulled down was beautiful. A symbolic gesture, perhaps, but one that hurt no one, and one that taught many of us so much.\u2019 3. South Africa may hold the answer to who murdered Olof Palme \u2018For 11 years I investigated the mysterious aeroplane crash that killed the former UN secretary general Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld, a project that became the subject of the documentary Cold Case Hammarskj\u00f6ld. It was during a 2014 research trip for the documentary that the murder case of the former prime minister Olof Palme literally fell into my lap, when the journalist De Wet Potgieter passed me the so-called Deepsearch papers at the end of a dinner.\u2019 4. Premier League restart preview No 1: Arsenal \u2018There is no dancing around it: the stakes could be no higher for Arsenal in the next 10 games.\u2019 5. Nobel prize winner Barry Marshall admits driving through carpark boom gate \u2018Nobel laureate Prof Barry Marshall has admitted driving through a boom gate after becoming agitated and frustrated with carpark attendants near a building named in his honour.\u2019 6. US air force sergeant accused of killing sheriff\u2019s deputy in ambush attack \u2018An active-duty US air force sergeant is accused of killing a northern California sheriff\u2019s deputy in an ambush-style attack near Santa Cruz over the weekend.\u2019 7. The toppling of Edward Colston\u2019s statue is not an attack on history. It is history \u2018Today is the first full day since 1895 on which the effigy of a mass murderer does not cast its shadow over Bristol\u2019s city centre. Those who lament the dawning of this day, and who are appalled by what happened on Sunday, need to ask themselves some difficult questions. Do they honestly believe that Bristol was a better place yesterday because the figure of a slave trader stood at its centre?\u2019 8. #Publishingpaidme: authors share advances to expose racial disparities \u2018Malorie Blackman, the UK\u2019s former children\u2019s laureate and author of the Noughts and Crosses series, wrote that she had \u201cnever in my life received anything like the sums being posted by some white authors\u201d.\u2019 9. Transvision Vamp: how we made Baby I Don\u2019t Care \u2018The famous scream at the beginning was an accident. Luckily, I always turn the record button on 20 seconds before a track starts, and she just let out this huge scream just to loosen up her voice, like a boxer entering the ring.\u2019 10. What the George Floyd protests have achieved in just two weeks \u2018From Minneapolis to London to New York and Atlanta, thousands have taken to the streets in a show of solidarity. Organizations and individuals have donated millions; editors have resigned; and statues have toppled. Here are just some of the concrete changes we are seeing happening across the US right now.\u2019 How we create the antidote Every day we measure not only how many people click on individual stories but also how long they spend reading them.

      "bodyText": "Marcos dos Santos Jr has counted 13 deaths from Covid-19 among Brazilian families he is close to in S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o de Meriti, a satellite town of Rio de Janeiro. Like him, they were black, and therefore proportionally more likely to be killed by the pandemic in Latin America\u2019s biggest country. All but one of the victims came from families helped by the Inclusion Project, which Dos Santos, 43, and his wife \u00c9lida, 40, launched in 2014 to educate teenagers away from drugs and crime. It now helps to feed poorer families who lost jobs or income as shops and businesses across Rio state closed for quarantine. \u201cAs we have a lot of faith in Jesus Christ, people are always asking for prayers and that\u2019s how we know about these deaths,\u201d he says. \u201cMost people here are black and mixed race.\u201d One victim was his father, also called Marcos, who was 68. He went to hospital with heart problems, caught Covid-19, and died. \u201cIt was very really difficult,\u201d says Dos Santos. \u201cWhen you have a good relationship with your father, it is even worse.\u201d Covid-19 first hit Brazil\u2019s white upper classes, who brought it back from abroad. Now the virus is scything through the country\u2019s poorer suburbs, favelas and low-income towns such as S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o de Meriti \u2013 where 63% of the population self-declared as black or mixed race in Brazil\u2019s last census in 2010, compared to 48% in nearby Rio de Janeiro. As of 8 June Brazil had almost 700,000 confirmed cases and 37,000 deaths. The virus is not as democratic as it initially seemed. Government statistics show it is more lethal for BAME people in the UK. Figures reveal a higher mortality rate for black Americans. And a new study added to evidence that the virus is killing proportionally more black Brazilians than whites, exposing, in sharp relief, the country\u2019s staggering inequalities. The study was released in the same week that the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis sparked anti-racism demonstrations across the US, which Dos Santos says he can well understand. \u201cThis revulsion that people feel is just,\u201d he says, adding that he \u201creally feels\u201d racism in Brazil. \u201cIt\u2019s hidden, not as loud as it used to be.\u201d Researchers, doctors and health specialists believe factors including poverty, poor access to health services, overcrowded housing and high rates of health issues such as hypertension are some of the reasons Covid-19 kills proportionally more black Brazilians. \u201cThere is clearly a difference in lethality for whites and non-whites,\u201d says Fernando Bozza, a researcher in infectious diseases at the government research institute Fiocruz, who co-authored the analysis of deaths by race published on 27 May by the Nucleus of Health Operations and Intelligence. The researchers studied health service data on 30,000 patients diagnosed with Covid-19, who had either recovered or died by 18 May. It found that 55% of the black and mixed-race patients died, compared to 38% of white patients. It noted that a black patient who could not read had nearly four times more chance of dying than a white university graduate, \u201cconfirming the enormous disparities in access and quality of treatment in Brazil\u201d. A report by the P\u00fablica investigative media outlet showed more Covid-19 deaths in neighbourhoods in Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo with majority black populations. According to health ministry figures reviewed by the Guardian, from 26 April to 23 May, the numbers of deaths of black and mixed-race Brazilians who died of Covid-19 after testing positive (where race was listed) increased 7.2 times, and white Brazilians 4.5 times. \u201cThe majority of black people in our country are more vulnerable to contamination and more vulnerable in terms of access to treatment and health,\u201d says Rita Borret, a black doctor working in Jacarezinho, one of Rio\u2019s poorest favelas, who heads the black health study group at the Brazilian Society of Family and Community Medicine. \u201cThe pandemic has exposed these inequalities.\u201d Inequality extends to official data, she says, which in the city of Rio is so thin that favelas started their own online counts of Covid-19 cases and deaths. As of last year, 43% of Brazilians self-declared as white, 9% as black and 47% as mixed race \u2013 the latter two groups earned less than 60% of the salaries of white Brazilians in the first quarter of 2020. While white Brazilians isolate in apartment buildings in middle-class neighbourhoods, black Brazilians make deliveries, work in pharmacies and supermarkets, drive buses, and clean apartments \u2013 exposing them to more risk. After authorities closed their fast-food trailer in S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o de Meriti, Sandra Gon\u00e7alves, 48, and her husband Carlos, 51, who both identify as mixed race, began selling herbs and spices on the street. They receive food parcels from the Inclusion Project \u2013 just as other residents of poorer communities and favelas across Brazil are helped by donations of food and hygiene products. In early May, her brother-in-law Sebasti\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alves, 53, a diabetic, fell ill and was hospitalised. \u201cThey said it was Covid,\u201d she says. \u201cHe spent two days and a night in a chair, there was no bed for him.\u201d The day after a bed was found, he died of a heart attack. Last week her stepfather Serafin Suarez, 67, died after a week in hospital.

Others were swayed against social isolation by far-right president Jair Bolsonaro, who has dismissed the pandemic and railed against isolation measures because of their negative impact on the economy. \u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d Gon\u00e7alves says of the president. \u201cIf we don\u2019t work, we go hungry, if we get sick we don\u2019t have money to buy medicine.\u201d In favelas such as Jacarezinho, Borret says, Bolsonaro\u2019s message was reinforced by evangelical pastors \u2013 many of whom support the far-right populist. \u201cPeople did not know what to believe. And when a country goes through a pandemic without knowing what to believe, this is very dangerous,\u201d she says. Another study suggested that poverty makes black Brazilians more at risk.

      "body": "<p>Good evening, here are the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Justine Landis-Hanley and it\u2019s Tuesday 9 June.</p> <h2>PM warns \u2018difficult decisions\u2019 looming</h2> <p>Prime minister Scott Morrison told a Coalition joint party room meeting today to prepare for \u201cdifficult decisions ahead\u201d as the government tries to salvage Australia\u2019s economy while staying on top of the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told the room that the government could not afford to keep income supports in place indefinitely.

      "bodyText": "Good evening, here are the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Justine Landis-Hanley and it\u2019s Tuesday 9 June. PM warns \u2018difficult decisions\u2019 looming Prime minister Scott Morrison told a Coalition joint party room meeting today to prepare for \u201cdifficult decisions ahead\u201d as the government tries to salvage Australia\u2019s economy while staying on top of the coronavirus crisis. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told the room that the government could not afford to keep income supports in place indefinitely. This week, the government announced that the childcare sector would lose the jobkeeper wage subsidy, days after Morrison told reporters it was guaranteed until September. Frydenberg warned the next federal election would be a battle about the role of government, claiming the Labor party sees it as \u201ca limitless provider\u201d, while the Coalition sees it \u201cas an enabler\u201d. Australia records three coronavirus cases Australia has recorded only three new coronavirus cases overnight, two in NSW and one in the ACT. NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian said the two cases in NSW were both from overseas, meaning \u201cthere were no extra or new community transmission cases overnight\u201d. A foreign diplomat, who was exempt from the 14-day quarantine, is only the second ACT coronavirus case in weeks. Australia has reported at least one new case every day since 29 February. Government defends $60bn jobkeeper shortfall Treasury secretary Steven Kennedy told the Covid-19 Senate committee today that he took full responsibility for overestimating the cost of jobkeeper by $60bn. The Treasury originally budgeted $130bn for the program that it now expects will only cost $70bn. Finance minister Mathias Cormann told the committee the underspend was an \u201cestimates variation \u2026 not an accounting error, as it has been falsely described by some\u201d. \u201cIt is important that we erred on the side of prudence, rather than put ourselves at the risk of a potential deteriorating situation, [in which case] we might have been forced to make an estimates variation in the other direction, which would not have been good for confidence,\u201d Cormann said. Also appearing before the Covid-19 Committee, ATO commissioner Chris Jordan said the ATO believed many more employees were covered by the scheme due to errors in employers\u2019 responses in their jobkeeper applications. South Australia gives AFL green light \u2026 The South Australian government will allow the AFL to host 2,000 spectators in the general admission section at Adelaide Oval for this Saturday\u2019s \u201cshowdown\u201d between the Crows and Port Adelaide. Premier Steven Marshall said he believed it would be \u201cthe first time we have had a significant crowd at any sport in Australia for months and months and months\u201d. \u2026 but refuses coming Black Lives Matter rally Meanwhile, South Australia police commissioner Grant Stevens said police would not allow a second Black Lives Matter rally in Adelaide to go ahead this weekend. Protestors were allowed to gather in Victoria Square last weekend. But Stevens said that \u201cin this current context, and acknowledging the sentiments of the community, to continually allow people to disregard the restrictions we have in place would make a mockery of the good efforts of everybody else who are doing their very best to abide by the restrictions\u201d.

<strong>William Callaghan:</strong> </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>An air-and-ground search is continuing for a lost Victorian teenager with non-verbal autism, after life-threatening low temperatures overnight.</p> \n   <p>Hundreds of people are racing to find William Callaghan, 14, who became lost in steep and rugged terrain on Mount Disappointment about 2.20pm on Monday.</p> \n   <p>William became separated from his family wearing just blue trackpants and a hoodie ahead of a night where temperatures dropped below zero.</p> \n   <p>Acting Inspector Christine Lalor said the youngster had been walking to the summit with his family when he raced ahead.</p> \n   <p>Tuesday\u2019s clear, sunny sky kept hopes high of finding him after an air-and-ground search started on Monday afternoon.</p> \n   <p>But with another chilly night coming, fears for the boy are growing.</p> \n   <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be another cold evening again, hence ... it\u2019s vital that we try to find William before nightfall,\u201d Insp Lalor said. \u201c(His parents) are holding up as well as can be expected.\u201d</p> \n   <p>Search and Rescue Squad Senior Sergeant Greg Paul told reporters on Tuesday they were fighting against time, but remained hopeful.</p> \n   <p>The weather bureau expects the temperature on the exposed mountain to drop to zero degrees and -3C in the valleys overnight.</p> \n   <p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite life-threatening weather, but we have had people survived several nights in these weather conditions as well,\u201d he said.</p> \n   <p>\u201cLuke Shambrook, six years ago ... we found him on day five, he was alive and he\u2019s alive today.\u201d</p> \n   <p>A mix of four-wheel-drives, people on foot, motor bikes, horseback and those in the air are involved in the search.</p> \n   <p>More than 200 volunteers joined about 150 police and emergency services who are looking for William.</p> \n   <p>Sen Sgt Paul said the area had very thick bush from bushfire regrowth and it hampered searches, given the undergrowth.</p> \n   <p>But they were \u201cgiving it our best effort\u201d to search the steep terrain.</p> \n   <p>\u201cThe only advantage is ... there is an opportunity to stay a little bit warm if you can snuggle up in the undergrowth,\u201d he said.</p> \n   <p>William went missing without food and water and could have covered a lot of distance by now, police said.</p> \n   <p>He is very energetic and food-focused, with police believing he may have walked into a house to help himself to food, or tuck himself into a bed.</p> \n   <p>\u201cWilliam doesn\u2019t verbalise so if anyone finds him the best way to communicate with him is to be patient and calm,\u201d Acting Insp Lalor said, adding William taps his chest to communicate.</p> \n   <p>\u201cIf anyone in the area could check their homes, check their beds and any out houses to see if William is in those locations.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div>

acknowledge the racism he says he was subjected to during his playing career, AAP report.</p> \n  <p>The 33-year-old posted on social media today to detail his experiences during 10 years at the Magpies - which he said were inadequately dealt with.</p> \n  <p>Lumumba, who retired from football in 2016 after repeated concussion problems, said he endured a \u201cculture of racist jokes\u201d at the Magpies and that coach <strong>Nathan Buckley</strong> had not supported him when he spoke out against <strong>Eddie McGuire</strong> in 2013.</p> \n  <p>Club president McGuire had suggested on radio that Sydney\u2019s <strong>Adam Goodes</strong> could be used to promote the King Kong movie, and later apologised for doing so.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI spoke out against McGuire\u2019s racism on 28/5/2013 and was ostracised internally for doing so, particularly from Buckley, who stated, \u2018You threw the president under the bus\u2019,\u201d Lumumba said in a Facebook post.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThey viewed what I did as wrong, and remained unapologetic about it, and as a result, I was treated differently, for the worse.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt had a negative effect on my mental health and general well-being.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWithout a support network within the club/league that could cater to my specific needs, I used psilocybin (mushrooms) out of desperation to deal with my distressed state, which subsequently helped me confront CFC over the issues.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Lumumba, who made his AFL debut in 2005, also reiterated the claim that he was called \u201cChimp\u201d by Collingwood teammates before being traded to Melbourne at the end of 2014.</p> \n  <p>That claim was publicly backed up by former Magpies teammate <strong>Andrew Krakouer</strong> in 2017.</p> \n  <p>Lumumba said the AFL and Collingwood did not have the capacity or desire to address the issues he raised.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThey were negligent and did not (take) their internal issues seriously,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>Lumumba played 199 games for Collingwood and added another 24 with Melbourne.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5edf30a18f083999a26dcd54\" class=\"block\"

Here\u2019s what happened: South Australian police have refused permission for a second Black Lives Matter rally in Adelaide, but the SA government will allow 2,000 AFL spectators into Adelaide Oval to watch the Saturday \u201cshowdown\u201d between the Crows and Port Adelaide. 300 people protested in Perth outside the headquarters of Rio Tinto after the mining company destroyed a 46,000-year-old sacred Aboriginal site. The ABC announced it would cut approximately 250 jobs. The Indigenous affairs minister, Ken Wyatt, said the renewed Closing the Gap commitments will include justice targets. The Treasury secretary, Steven Kennedy, said he takes responsibility for the $60bn \u201cestimates variation\u201d on jobkeeper. The ACT\u2019s single new coronavirus case in weeks was revealed to be a foreign diplomat who was exempted from 14 days quarantine, and who drove from Sydney Airport to Canberra in a private car. The search continues for teenager William Callaghan, who is missing near Mount Disappointment in Victoria. Thanks for reading along, and stay safe. The women\u2019s rugby league competition, the NRLW, will continue this year, with the season restarting in September. Read our full story here: AAP have this report on the protests in WA today: Hundreds of people have rallied outside Rio Tinto\u2019s Perth headquarters to protest the mining giant\u2019s destruction of a significant indigenous site in Western Australia. Rio Tinto has apologised but refused to say whether reparations are being considered. Organiser and Noongar man Robert Eggington told the crowd of about 300 peaceful protesters on Tuesday that Rio had exploited the weakness of WA\u2019s Aboriginal heritage legislation. \u201cThey used that against the people and then turned and blamed (it on) misunderstandings between the company and the custodians of that site,\u201d Mr Eggington said. \u201cIt\u2019s so important to understand how Rio Tinto came like a thief in the night and blew away a site ... that surpassed the last ice age.\u201d Mr Eggington called upon Rio Tinto iron ore chief executive Chris Salisbury to resign and for a 100km buffer to be placed around the Juukan caves to prevent further damage. Changes to Australia Post\u2019s delivery model will result in one in four jobs being lost, the Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union says. Australia Post says the concerns are speculative. Here is an update on the search for missing teenager William Callaghan: An air-and-ground search is continuing for a lost Victorian teenager with non-verbal autism, after life-threatening low temperatures overnight. Hundreds of people are racing to find William Callaghan, 14, who became lost in steep and rugged terrain on Mount Disappointment about 2.20pm on Monday. William became separated from his family wearing just blue trackpants and a hoodie ahead of a night where temperatures dropped below zero. Acting Inspector Christine Lalor said the youngster had been walking to the summit with his family when he raced ahead. Tuesday\u2019s clear, sunny sky kept hopes high of finding him after an air-and-ground search started on Monday afternoon. But with another chilly night coming, fears for the boy are growing. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be another cold evening again, hence ... it\u2019s vital that we try to find William before nightfall,\u201d Insp Lalor said. \u201c(His parents) are holding up as well as can be expected.\u201d Search and Rescue Squad Senior Sergeant Greg Paul told reporters on Tuesday they were fighting against time, but remained hopeful. The weather bureau expects the temperature on the exposed mountain to drop to zero degrees and -3C in the valleys overnight. \u201cIt\u2019s quite life-threatening weather, but we have had people survived several nights in these weather conditions as well,\u201d he said. \u201cLuke Shambrook, six years ago ... we found him on day five, he was alive and he\u2019s alive today.\u201d A mix of four-wheel-drives, people on foot, motor bikes, horseback and those in the air are involved in the search. More than 200 volunteers joined about 150 police and emergency services who are looking for William. Sen Sgt Paul said the area had very thick bush from bushfire regrowth and it hampered searches, given the undergrowth. But they were \u201cgiving it our best effort\u201d to search the steep terrain. \u201cThe only advantage is ... there is an opportunity to stay a little bit warm if you can snuggle up in the undergrowth,\u201d he said. William went missing without food and water and could have covered a lot of distance by now, police said. He is very energetic and food-focused, with police believing he may have walked into a house to help himself to food, or tuck himself into a bed. \u201cWilliam doesn\u2019t verbalise so if anyone finds him the best way to communicate with him is to be patient and calm,\u201d Acting Insp Lalor said, adding William taps his chest to communicate. \u201cIf anyone in the area could check their homes, check their beds and any out houses to see if William is in those locations.\u201d Former Collingwood player Heritier Lumumba has called on his former club and the AFL to publicly acknowledge the racism he says he was subjected to during his playing career, AAP report. The 33-year-old posted on social media today to detail his experiences during 10 years at the Magpies - which he said were inadequately dealt with. Lumumba, who retired from football in 2016 after repeated concussion problems, said he endured a \u201cculture of racist jokes\u201d at the Magpies and that coach Nathan Buckley had not supported him when he spoke out against Eddie McGuire in 2013. Club president McGuire had suggested on radio that Sydney\u2019s Adam Goodes could be used to promote the King Kong movie, and later apologised for doing so. \u201cI spoke out against McGuire\u2019s racism on 28/5/2013 and was ostracised internally for doing so, particularly from Buckley, who stated, \u2018You threw the president under the bus\u2019,\u201d Lumumba said in a Facebook post. \u201cThey viewed what I did as wrong, and remained unapologetic about it, and as a result, I was treated differently, for the worse. \u201cIt had a negative effect on my mental health and general well-being. \u201cWithout a support network within the club/league that could cater to my specific needs, I used psilocybin (mushrooms) out of desperation to deal with my distressed state, which subsequently helped me confront CFC over the issues.\u201d Lumumba, who made his AFL debut in 2005, also reiterated the claim that he was called \u201cChimp\u201d by Collingwood teammates before being traded to Melbourne at the end of 2014. That claim was publicly backed up by former Magpies teammate Andrew Krakouer in 2017. Lumumba said the AFL and Collingwood did not have the capacity or desire to address the issues he raised. \u201cThey were negligent and did not (take) their internal issues seriously,\u201d he said. Lumumba played 199 games for Collingwood and added another 24 with Melbourne. The special inquiry into the Ruby Princess has heard from NSW\u2019s chief human biosecurity officer today. NSW Health communicable disease senior medical officer Dr Sean Tobin said the ship was low-risk mainly because no passengers had been to countries with worrying Covid-19 outbreaks, AAP reports. \u201cYou\u2019ve said the most significant factor was the absence of passengers and crew who had travelled through China, South Korea, Iran or Italy in the last 14 days before embarkation,\u201d counsel assisting, Richard Beasley SC, read from Tobin\u2019s statement. Commissioner Bret Walker SC said he thought it was \u201ca bit odd\u201d that clinical judgements were being made without the authorities having seen individual patient records. \u201cThere were a number of key factors we were considering,\u201d Tobin replied. \u201cI didn\u2019t see anything in this that would suggest that I should look at the ARD log in more detail.\u201d Tobin told the inquiry earlier he was part of a panel that initially discussed the health and risk assessments of cruise ship entry into NSW and was also involved in providing insight on the states\u2019 draft cruise ship protocol document. A man has been charged after he allegedly used the internet to threaten to kill NSW police minister David Elliott. AAP report that detectives from the fixated persons unit started investigating on Sunday. A home in Belmont, in the state\u2019s Hunter region, was raided on Monday afternoon. Cannabis, medication without a prescription, two gel blasters and ammunition were found during the search and seized for forensic examination. A 25-year-old man was arrested at the home. He was charged with using a carriage service to threaten to kill and possessing drugs and firearms. He was granted bail to appear at Belmont local court in July. And here is our story from Amanda Meade: The ABC\u2019s managing director, David Anderson, has announced the organisation will have to make job cuts and redundancies. This comes after Newscorp Australia also announced that dozens of jobs would be cut at the Daily Telegraph, Herald-Sun and the Australian. The NSW supreme court has released its reasons for allowing the Black Lives Matter rally in Sydney on Saturday, and AAP has this report: The green light was given to Sydney\u2019s Black Lives Matter rally after a judge made legal errors about the organiser\u2019s police application, an appeal court says. The last-minute go-ahead given to Sydney\u2019s Black Lives Matter rally came down to a narrow legal point rather than competing public interests about protests and the Covid-19 pandemic. Late on Friday in the supreme court, justice Des Fagan made findings about the Summary Offences Act before declining an oral application to approve the rally because it breached coronavirus restrictions. But in reasons published on Monday, the appeal court ruled justice Fagan erred in those findings, which related to organiser Raul Bassi\u2019s application to hold the rally on 6 June. Chief justice Tom Bathurst, sitting with justices Andrew Bell and Mark Leeming, said Bassi on 29 May gave the required seven days\u2019 notice to the NSW police commissioner of a proposed assembly of up to 50 people. But after realising many more were likely to attend, Bassi suggested to police on 4 June the number of protesters would be up to 5,000 and they would convene at Sydney Town Hall and proceed to Belmore Park. The appeal court found justice Fagan erred in finding this was a new application and the required seven days\u2019 notice hadn\u2019t been given. The judges found Bassi\u2019s suggestion was an amendment to the 29 May application, although the particulars of the assembly had changed significantly. The Summary Offences Act expressly allowed the \u201cparticulars\u201d to be amended by agreement, which in fact was given in a police email on 4 June, according to the court. The court also found Bassi was \u201cgiven an unequivocal indication that the public assembly in the amended form proposed would occur without opposition from the Commissioner\u201d. Police later changed their view and opposed the rally. The court said: No criticism should be made of that change of stance; we live in challenging and uncertain times where the exigencies of public health are of critical importance and the situation is no doubt extremely fluid. During Saturday\u2019s urgent hearing at the \u201cheel of the hunt\u201d, the lawyer for police tried to launch a cross-appeal to ban the rally under the Summary Offences Act. But the appeal court said this cross-appeal was made orally within 20 minutes of the rally\u2019s starting time and did not meet any of the required pre-conditions for mounting such an appeal. Victoria police are providing an update about the search for William Callaghan, the 14-year-old boy who is missing near Mount Disappointment. A spokeswoman says: We have in excess of 450 people out today and many of those are volunteers, so thank you very much. At this stage, we do have as many volunteers as we need because it starts to become difficult to manage or ensure the safety of those people. Apart from keeping William warm, he doesn\u2019t really like to be touched. He doesn\u2019t like loud noise. Just to take those things into account and approach in a quiet manner, try and avoid touching, apart from keeping him warm or a blanket or that sort of thing, and obviously call 000 immediately. At a Coalition joint party room meeting today \u2013 on the eve of the resumption of parliament tomorrow \u2013 Scott Morrison warned that \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d were looming. The prime minister is understood to have told colleagues that the government needed to stay on top of the coronavirus-related health issues but remain focused on jobs and the economy. He indicated there were \u201cdifficult decisions ahead\u201d \u2013 in an apparent reference to budget measures \u2013 and some of the challenges would \u201ctake us outside our comfort zone\u201d, but the Coalition should apply its philosophical principles as it formulated policies. The deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, told the same meeting the government had spent a lot of money during the pandemic, but this was to cushion the economy. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, briefed the meeting on recent announcements including the homebuilder package, the extension of the instant asset writeoff and the reintroduction of childcare fees. He said the next election would be a battle about the role of government, claiming that Labor saw it as a \u201climitless provider\u201d while the Coalition saw it as an \u201cenabler\u201d. Frydenberg said the government could not afford to keep income supports in place indefinitely. He said there would be some tough times ahead in the lead-up to the budget, with the outcomes of the jobkeeper review to be announced at the end of July. Corrective Services NSW has issued a statement about the use of tear gas yesterday at Sydney\u2019s Long Bail jail. The department said officers fired tear gas to break up a fight in the yard, and then afterwards, inmates spelled out \u201cBLM\u201d on the ground for media helicopters. Some commentators and media \u2013 not including Guardian Australia \u2013 reported that tear gas was used to stop a Black Lives Matter demonstration. In its statement, Corrective Services NSW says it refutes that \u201cyesterday\u2019s Long Bay disturbances were in support of Black Lives Matter\u201d. CSNSW\u2019s information is that the disturbances were drug-related. The disturbance originated from two fights that broke out in a yard of Long Bay hospital around midday. All six assailants and one of two victims identify as Aboriginal. The other victim is not Aboriginal. Only at the very end of the incident, an inmate made the letters BLM out of towels on the ground in a separate yard. This was an opportunistic action taken in response to the presence of media helicopters. A foreign diplomat, who was exempt from 14 days of quarantine, is the ACT\u2019s first new coronavirus case in weeks. The ACT chief health officer, Dr Kerryn Coleman, revealed today that the man, who tested positive on Saturday, was a diplomat. He drove from Sydney Airport to Canberra in a private car, and he and his family are now in isolation. Coleman said: He traveled back to Canberra extremely safely in a private car, and no one else was exposed in that trip. Australia is legally required, under the Vienna Convention, to allow diplomats freedom of movement. One more thing that\u2019s worth noting out of the Coalition joint party room meeting: The attorney general, Christian Porter, seemed to signal to his colleagues that the government was likely to appeal against elements of last week\u2019s federal court ruling that the Labor government\u2019s suspension of live cattle export in 2011 was invalid. My colleague Calla Wahlquist reported details of the ruling here. The Coalition has long criticised the suspension of the export trade, but is now worried about the impact of the court ruling on ministerial decision-making. It is understood several Coalition members raised the issue of the recent court decision on live cattle export trade and asked whether the government was intending to appeal against the decision. Scott Morrison replied that the government was working with the live animal export sector to deal with \u201cthe injustices\u201d suffered by that industry. But the prime minister added that the judgment raised \u201creal issues\u201d. Porter did not commit one way or the other regarding an appeal, but argued the tort of misfeasance was applied here in a way that had not been seen before. He argued the judge had effectively introduced a new test of proportionality, which could have a significant impact on the capacity of ministers to make decisions. Porter told the meeting he believed it was possible to do justice to those affected by the live export shutdown decision while ensuring there was no impact on democratic decision-making by duly elected ministers. During the meeting, a number of Coalition members called for support to help north Queensland with rising insurance premiums, while others pressed the need to support domestic manufacturing. It is understood there was no substantial discussion of the weekend protests in Australia at the Coalition party room meeting today. But some members of the government referred to events in the United States and the United Kingdom. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, told Coalition colleagues there had been shocking pictures on television screens of looting in New York and the \u201cdisgraceful defacing\u201d of a Winston Churchill statue in London. (Somebody sprayed \u201cwas a racist\u201d under Churchill\u2019s name, in reference to allegations of his responsibility for the Bengal Famine of 1943.) Frydenberg approvingly repeated the comment of a commentator who said that if Winston Churchill was a racist, what would you call the guy he stopped? Hi all, thanks to Luke and Calla for their work on the blog today. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has doubled down on his earlier comments that people should not have attended the Black Lives Matter and Indigenous Lives Matter protests over the weekend. Andrews said it was \u201ca worthy cause but a fundamentally irresponsible thing to do\u201d, according to AAP. He said the state\u2019s treatment of Indigenous Australians was \u201csomething we should all be ashamed of \u2013 the fact that so many Indigenous Australians are behind bars and that so many die so young.\u201d The state recorded no new cases of Covid-19 today. I\u2019m going to leave you with my colleague Naaman Zhou. See you soon. The South Australia police commissioner, Grant Stevens, has just said police will not grant an exemption for a second Black Lives Matter rally in Adelaide at the weekend. The police allowed people to congregate in Victoria Square on Saturday. But Stevens says now: We acknowledged the unique and exceptional circumstances of the protest we saw on Saturday and the public sentiment around the horrific events we saw in the United States. And it was appropriate that we gave consideration to that, also acknowledging that we weren\u2019t able to prevent that from happening. I think in this current context, and acknowledging the sentiments of the community to continually allow people to disregard the restrictions we have in place, would make a mockery of the good efforts of everybody else who are doing their very best to abide by the restrictions. The South Australia government has said it will allow the AFL to have 2,000 spectators at Adelaide Oval for Saturday\u2019s \u201cshowdown\u201d between the Crows and Port Adelaide. Those supporters will be allowed to sit in various general admission sections of the stadium. The SA police commissioner, Grant Stevens, said: One decision that was made today was that for the AFL game, the showdown on the weekend, a crowd of 2,000 people will be allowed into the general area of the Adelaide Oval, with an additional about 240 people in private rooms in the stadium complex itself. The premier, Steven Marshall, said: South Australia, I think, will be the first with a significant number of people at an AFL match and the first time we have had a significant crowd at any sport in Australia for months and months and months. Crowds will return in the NRL from this week, but those spectators will be confined to corporate boxes. A distillery in the Victorian town of Apollo Bay has recalled a single bottle of gin, which is believed to contain hand sanitiser. The SS Casino Gin bottle was for sale at the Great Ocean Road Brewhouse between 5pm Friday and 7.30pm on Sunday and has since been recalled by Apollo Bay Distillery, according to a Nine News report. A recall notice has been issued by Food Standards Australia New Zealand. Labor\u2019s Katy Gallagher is targeting the Coalition over the fact Scott Morrison appeared to guarantee jobkeeper would stay in place until September on Friday, only to renege by removing the payment from the childcare sector on Monday. Finance minister Mathias Cormann replied: I don\u2019t agree that\u2019s what he\u2019s done. Jobkeeper is in place to the end of September. In relation to childcare workers, [it was] replaced with a transition payment and subsidy. Morrison had said: The six months provision of jobkeeper has been set out in legislation and people can count on that. [Q: You can guarantee that? That will be there until the end of September?] Morrison: Yes. Cormann said jobkeeper was \u201calways a temporary support\u201d. Although the program was in place until September, there \u201cmay well be some further adjustments made at the edges\u201d. Cormann noted the childcare sector had to agree to keep employment levels up to receive extra subsidy support, but wouldn\u2019t guarantee there would be no job losses. So the program named jobkeeper will be in place til September, but that doesn\u2019t mean everyone getting the $1,500 fortnightly payment will continue to get it. If only you could pay bills with the name of or legislated end date of a program, instead of cash. South Australian authorities are grappling with the \u201cdifficult\u201d decision on whether to grant permission for a second Black Lives Matter rally in Adelaide amid a possible further easing of Covid-19 restrictions, AAP reports. Organisers have called for a second protest on Saturday after more than 5,000 gathered at the weekend in an event praised by police. SA police commissioner Grant Stevens told ABC radio on Tuesday: I\u2019ll have look at the circumstances and ... determine what the community sentiment is going to be, what the issues are around safety, and find a position that meets all needs. It\u2019s a difficult decision but one we have to turn our minds to over the next few days. At the first rally, the city\u2019s Victoria Square was packed with people calling for justice over the death of African-American man George Floyd during his arrest in the US, and ongoing concerns over Indigenous deaths in custody. Labor leader Anthony Albanese is attacking the government over its childcare changes, which reverts from free childcare back to the childcare subsidy system. He says: What we will see is a snap back in terms of a shutdown of some childcare centres as a result of this. What we will see is that parents will struggle because they are snapping back to the old system that already had, we know, one of the highest cost childcare systems in the world. We know that. It\u2019s not good enough. He also points out Scott Morrison had pledged the jobkeeper scheme would be available until the end of September. Yesterday, the government announced it would withdraw jobkeeper from childcare centres on 20 July. ATO second commissioner Jeremy Hirschhorn has said the error rate on the employee form was 0.1% because (to date) 1,500 employers out of 1 million put a \u201cdramatically wrong number\u201d in the form for the number of employees covered by jobkeeper. Hirschhorn said the ATO notified Treasury on 20 May it had \u201cidentified there was a problem with those [employers] that had moved to application\u201d, but it wasn\u2019t until 21 May it notified Treasury of the separate issue with employers who had not moved to the stage of confirming their enrolled employees. Labor\u2019s Kristina Keneally is agitated by this because on 21 May, Treasury witnesses gave evidence to the Covid-19 committee that the program covered up to 6.3 million workers. She says this was done \u201cwithout a caveat, without an asterisk\u201d. Treasury officials had said on 21 May there would need to be a \u201creconciliation\u201d between the estimated and actual employee numbers. It wasn\u2019t until Friday 22 May that we found out the reconciliation cleaned up a discrepancy of 3 million employees. The Indigenous affairs minister, Ken Wyatt, has said the renewed Closing the Gap commitments \u2013 described as a refresh by the government \u2013 will include justice targets. In a statement on Tuesday, Wyatt described every death in custody as \u201ca tragedy\u201d, three days after tens of thousands of people gathered for Black Lives Matter protests across the country. Unfortunately, there is no simple solution and no single answer. However, Wyatt confirmed that justice targets would be included in the Closing the Gap refresh. The Morrison government is progressing with the Closing the Gap refresh in partnership with the Coalition of Peaks. And while we\u2019re still in final negotiations, it has been agreed that there will be justice targets contained within that agreement that focus on incarceration rates. Wyatt also said: If we want to reduce the number of deaths in custody, we need to look very closely at what\u2019s happening here in Australia \u2013 the factors contributing to incarceration rates and the way in which our systems are handling these incidents. This requires a co-operative approach between government and with communities, particularly when states and territories hold the policies and levers relating to policing and justice matters. The relationship between Indigenous Australians and the police \u2013 both the good and the bad \u2013 in respective jurisdictions must also be examined. The Morrison government, through the National Indigenous Australians Agency, is playing a key role in ensuring that there are additional protections in place for individuals when they are taken into custody through the custody notification system. But we also need to remember that reducing the number of Indigenous people in contact with the justice system, through addressing the underlying factors that lead to offending, is just as key in addressing the number of deaths in custody. What\u2019s important is that this ggreement has been developed in partnership with Indigenous Australians and so we\u2019re all working towards better outcomes for all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. In his opening statement, Steven Kennedy said: As the secretary of the Treasury, I take full responsibility for the revised costing of the jobkeeper program and all matters associated with the advice that Treasury has provided. Given the importance of understanding the potential funding needs of a program of the potential size and scope of the jobkeeper program, the trajectory that the virus and economic impacts were on at the time, and the sequential tightening of restrictions that had been imposed over the previous two weeks in Australia and overseas, it was judged prudent to cost using Treasury\u2019s worse-case economic scenario being modelled at the time. The Treasury secretary, Steven Kennedy, says he takes responsibility for the $60bn \u201cestimates variation\u201d on jobkeeper, and backs Cormann\u2019s explanation about parameters changing (because health results were better than expected). The Covid-19 committee then heard from the ATO commissioner, Chris Jordan, on the second error \u2013 that the ATO believed many more employees were covered due to errors in employers\u2019 responses. Jordan said a small number of the 900,000 businesses made errors such as putting their phone numbers, ABN or bank account details into the employees-covered field, and some put in 1,500 or multiples of 1,500. He said 0.1% of employers appeared to think the field was asking for \u201cthe amount payable to, rather than the number of employees\u201d. He said many categories of error were picked up but: We did not build rigorous analytics behind that field that asked for the estimated number of employees that businesses had [claimed for]. Jordan said the ATO told treasury about the error on 21 May, before the public update on 22 May. Explaining why it took so long to detect, the ATO said the numbers enrolling in jobkeeper \u201cseemed to be on trajectory consistent with estimates ... but once [we] began to confirm employees covered, we identified within a fortnight the numbers were less than expected\u201d. The ATO conducted outreach to big employers and believed the discrepancy was due to big employers not completing the second stage of their application (confirming which employees they were claiming for). Eventually, it \u201cbecame evident\u201d there was another factor: the employers mis-entering the number of employees. Jordan said this \u201ctemporarily obscured the size of a demand driven program\u201d but did not result in incorrect payments. The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, is before the Senate Covid-19 committee, explaining that the $60bn underspend in the jobkeeper program (from $130bn to $70bn) was an \u201cestimates variation ... not an accounting error as it has been falsely described by some\u201d. Cormann explained the government was \u201cexpecting the worst\u201d and was \u201cprudently planning for the worst\u201d, but the variation was due to \u201csubstantially changed\u201d parameters \u2013 as the health outlook was much better than expected. He said: It is a usual estimates variation in relation to a demand driven program. The size [of the variation] is a function of the high degree of uncertainty, and the potential size of the program. Importantly, the revised cost estimate was much lower, not much higher, than anticipated ... a very good thing. It is important that we erred on the side of prudence, rather than put ourselves at the risk of a potential deteriorating situation, [in which case] we might have been forced to make estimates variation in the other direction, which would not have been good for confidence. The health minister, Greg Hunt, is speaking in Queanbeyan. What we have seen now is that in the last four hours, as the states and territories have made their announcements, on the advice I\u2019ve just had from the National Incidence Centre, there have been so far no cases of community transmission. I want to repeat that. On the latest advice I have, so far, there have been no cases of community transmission, two cases overseas-acquired. That explains why our border protections remain so fundamental. Fifty-nine cases in the last seven days. Of those, 69% have been detected through the hotel quarantine or our border protection processes. Hunt says the Covidsafe app has now been downloaded 6.2m times. The NSW premier was also asked about reports that Sal Navarra, who owns the Sydney wedding venue company Navarra Venues, claimed he was going to \u201creopen to any numbers\u201d next month. \u201cWe are reopening and we are reopening to any numbers,\u201d Navarra reportedly said in an Instagram post, linking his decision to the recent Black Lives Matter protests. Gladys Berejiklian said authorities would \u201cabsolutely\u201d punish any businesses that flout the rules. Can I say, can I just ask everybody to please be patient. There isn\u2019t much more to wait in terms of making sure that every aspect of businesses that have felt restricted will have some pressure released in the near future, so long as all of us keep doing the right thing. Wedding venues in NSW are currently restricted to 20 guests, compared with 50 for cafes and clubs. Mutual obligations for welfare recipients return today. There are now about 1.6 million people receiving the unemployment benefit jobseeker. Before the pandemic, the figure was about 700,000. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, was giving a press conference just now. She was pressed on comments from her police minister, David Elliott, who said yesterday that police would not approve future permit protests that did not comply for the health guidelines. Does she agree with Elliott? She says: Well, obviously that is what we\u2019ll look at. Because we want people to respect the health orders. But she adds: I think we need to draw a line in the sand in what happened on the weekend. It wasn\u2019t just what happened in Sydney, it happened all across Australia. And as disappointing as it was, we need to draw a line in the sand and move forward. We have a total of two new cases in Australia today. The last time that occurred was Saturday. As NSW authorities noted, both new cases in that state today were from returning overseas travellers. You have to go back to 29 February for the last time there were no new cases reported in Australia. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, says the two new cases in NSW were from overseas, which means \u201cthere were no extra or new community transmission cases overnight\u201d. Mark McGowan says there were no new cases of Covid-19 in WA. \u201cAnd that means at this point in time we\u2019ve had 599 cases across the state,\u201d the premier said. \u201cThe latest advice I have is no one is in hospital across the state with Covid.\u201d NSW has recorded two new cases of Covid-19, bringing the total to 3,114. A statement from NSW Health said there were 66 cases now being treated. No patients were in intensive care. Annastacia Palaszczuk has told a media conference the state has had 1,062 coronavirus cases \u2013 and only three that are still active. There were no new cases overnight. Meanwhile, the AFL chief executive, Gillon McLachlan, says the league has not yet received authorisation to have crowds back in venues for the competition\u2019s return this week but it\u2019s ready if that changes. It comes despite reports the Queensland government had given the green light for the Gabba and Metricon Stadium to be at 25% capacity for games as soon as this weekend. GWS have also raised the prospect of hosting corporate supporters at their round-two match against North Melbourne at Giants Stadium on Sunday, according to AAP. McLachlan told SEN on Tuesday morning his understanding is that, as things stand, no crowds are allowed to attend matches in Queensland or NSW this week: I think there will be announcements this week but as we sit here \u2026 my understanding is there\u2019s not an authorisation in Queensland and there\u2019s not an authorisation in NSW. The federal government is considering \u201cdecreased capacity\u201d for NRL games, according to the deputy chief medical officer Dr Nick Coatsworth. AAP reports that the NSW state government has already ticked off on corporate boxes, with one person for every 4 sq m and up to 50 people, being open from this weekend. But discussions have begun about opening up the grandstands, with the ARL Commission chairman, Peter V\u2019landys, aiming for a 1 July return for fans. Coatsworth said it would be easier to maintain social distancing in stadiums than protests, which were given the green light at the weekend. He told Nine\u2019s Today Show: The important thing of course about the footy is you have a large number of people, like we saw on the weekend with the protests of course, coming together in different parts of the city and then dispersing into the city. You can be a little more controlled in a stadium than you can in a protest. That\u2019s an important thing to note, and we could consider going back to situations of decreased capacity in stadiums. Ultimately that\u2019s going to be a matter for states and territories, but it is something we are considering now. Hopefully within before the footy season finishes, that\u2019ll be good. At this stage, only NSW venues have been given the green light to open up their corporate boxes, with Queensland considering doing the same. The Covid-19 pandemic is making it hard for Mexican drug cartels to smuggle cocaine and methamphetamine into Australia, AAP reports. Travel restrictions and ramped-up border security have led to dwindling supplies in Australia and skyrocketing prices. The US Drug Enforcement Administration estimates a kilo of meth was worth between US$90,000 and US$130,000 (A$128,000 and A$185,000) in Australia before the pandemic, but now sells for about US$200,000. Cocaine followed a similar spike, with dealers passing the price rise to users. \u201cAs businesses are having to adjust, every arm of cartels are having to adjust,\u201d the DEA\u2019s Australia attache, Kevin Merkel, told the Louisville Courier Journal. Australia was the cartels\u2019 \u201cmost sought-after illicit drug market\u201d, with Australians more willing to pay a higher price for top-quality Mexican meth than US buyers. Daniel Andrews has started a media conference. He says there have been 1,687 Covid-19 cases in Victoria \u2013 meaning there were no new cases yesterday. There are seven people in hospital; one person is in an ICU. Hi everyone. Thanks to Calla for her work this morning. I\u2019ll be with you for the next few hours. If you want to get in touch, send an email to luke.henriques-gomes@theguardian.com or a message via Twitter: @lukehgomes. I am going to hand over to Luke Henriques-Gomes to take you through the morning. Authorities in Western Australia have rejected reports that a woman was \u201cbody-slammed\u201d by a guard at Bandyup women\u2019s prison before suffering a medical episode on Saturday morning. A spokesperson for the WA Department of Justice said that, while the investigation by the department\u2019s professional standards division was ongoing, \u201ca preliminary assessment has found no evidence of any unreasonable force or an alleged \u2018body slam\u2019 incident as reported in the media\u201d: The Departments Professional Standards Division attended Bandyup Women\u2019s Prison and were advised that the prisoner had been found trying to access a vending machine and was ushered back to her cell. The hospitalisation the following day appears to be related to an existing medical condition. The investigation continues tomorrow. A 2018 report by the inspector of custodial services said the prison had \u201cfor many years suffered from neglect, indifference, and structural inequality\u201d. If you\u2019re looking to cultivate some positive habits from lockdown, this list might provide some inspiration. Have you also begun jogging, started meal planning or made a dint in your to-read list? Personally I have only developed, or further entrenched, bad habits. But my baking has never been better. This is the scene at Mount Disappointment this morning. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners has called for more support for GPs to battle Covid-19. In a submission to the Covid-19 Senate inquiry, the RACGP asked for a GP representative to be put on the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee to ensure the needs of GPs are represented. The submission also called for the coordination of urgent supplies of personal protective equipment and adequate supplies of the flu vaccine; a public information campaign on the importance of not delaying other medical care during the pandemic; and a government campaign about the importance of vaccinations. The president, Dr Harry Nespolon, said: Because state and territory governments manage the health crisis response and the federal government has primary responsibility for general practice, GPs have not been properly embedded into the wider pandemic response. This is not new, we have been drawing attention to this problem for years. However, the pandemic exposed the full scope of these shortcomings and we believe the role of GPs as frontline health providers must be formally recognised in pandemic preparation, mitigation, response and recovery. GPs know their communities and will be there for patients during and after this pandemic so we should be front and centre. Police are holding a press conference at Mount Disappointment this morning about the search for a 14-year-old, William Callaghan, who has been missing since 2.30pm yesterday and spent the night in the \u201clife-threatening cold\u201d. William has autism and is nonverbal. About 100 people searched for him overnight, many of them volunteers. Sergeant Christine Lalor told reporters at a press conference at Mount Disappointment, 60km north of Melbourne, that it was possible William had gone into someone\u2019s home to seek shelter: William doesn\u2019t verbalise, so if anyone finds him, the best way to communicate with him is just to be patient and calm with him. What we would like to let the public know, William is capable of wandering a fair distance. He does like food and water, and there is a chance that he could go into houses or you know, places to seek food or water. So, if anyone in the area could please check their homes, check their beds. If William is found, please call triple-zero straight away. Obviously, keep him calm and keep him warm. This is very concerning. Obviously, it\u2019s been a cold night. Senior Sergeant Greg Paul from search and rescue said it had been life-threateningly cold overnight: Obviously, there\u2019s no sugar-coating it. It was a very cold night last night, life-threatening cold, no doubt about that, down to zero, or close to zero. He said the thick vegetation from bushfire regrowth made it difficult for searchers, but may provide some shelter: There\u2019s an opportunity to stay a little bit warm if you can snuggle up in the undergrowth and try a stay a bit warm and seek a bit of insulation through that forest, so it\u2019s a positive and a negative. But in terms of the actual searching, it\u2019s very difficult countryside. Paul said there was a real risk of hypothermia, particularly if William remained missing for several nights: We\u2019re pulling out everything to try and find this young fellow ... We really don\u2019t want to have this turn badly. We want to find Will as soon as possible. So we really appreciate all the people coming out today last night, searching all night and today, with the sun coming up and the bit of warmth that that brings in, we\u2019re feeling like, you know, it could be a positive day. We hope. Josh Frydenberg also reportedly told Sky News this morning that the federal government\u2019s $150,000 instant asset write-off scheme would be extended until the end of the year. The extension will cost $300m and help 3.5m businesses, AAP reported. Frydenberg told Sky: [They] will be able to go and buy equipment or machinery, other materials for their business \u2013 up to $150,000 \u2013 and write it off straight away. Josh Frydenberg has been doorstopped this morning about the end of the free childcare program: What we\u2019re seeing is more people start to use those childcare support services. When we first announced the reform package, the viability of a number of childcare centres was threatened. And we had to ensure that childcare centres could be provided, particularly for children of essential workers, because we needed to get them to the frontline. That support has worked: 99% of childcare businesses remained operational. Now we move to the next stage, which is an effective transition. In other (extremely British) news, PG Tips and Yorkshire Tea are now anti-racist. Considering the colonial history of tea, this is probably the least they could do. We have just passed the first long weekend in 12 weeks in which people were allowed to head up the coast, and Sydney had the traffic jams to show for it. The Sydney Morning Herald reports that \u201cseveral spots on the M1 remained heavily backed up into the night\u201d as holidaymakers returned form the mid-north coast. The M1 is clogged. Nature is healing. The federal deputy chief medical officer Nick Coatsworth says that everyone who attended a Black Lives Matter protest at the weekend should \u201cself-monitor\u201d and get a Covid-19 test if they experience any symptoms. He says there\u2019s no need to quarantine unless you are unwell: If you were at a protest and you get any sort of symptoms the most important thing is to get tested as soon as possible. Speaking on Radio National, Coatsworth dismissed a suggestion that politicians who attended a protest should not attend parliament, saying that if ordinary Australians can attend work then politicians can attend parliament. There\u2019s no difference between a politician and any other Australian. Our advice on the weekend was don\u2019t attend a protest and, if they did, they need to self-monitor. Coatsworth said the protests, attended by tens of thousands of people, should not be taken as a signal that other mass gatherings should take place. Even if the protests did not result in a spike, he said, that would be \u201cbut one indicator\u201d of rates of community spread and would not necessarily mean it was safe for crowds to return to the football or for nightclubs to reopen. Asked when crowds would return to the football, he says: \u201cIt will be, I think, before the end of the footy season.\u201d He said New Zealand\u2019s lifting of restrictions, after it was declared Covid-free on Monday, should also not be taken as an indicator that Australia was safe to open up: We\u2019re two very different countries and I think there has been a lot of temptation over the past few days to say that we\u2019re in the same race, we\u2019re in a different race ... We have to acknowledge again that the virus is going to set its own timetable, but there are states and territories that have gone to stage three lifting of restrictions very quickly. The education minister, Dan Tehan, has been on ABC News Breakfast this morning explaining the decision to end the free childcare package on 12 July and stop paying the jobkeeper payment to childcare services from 20 July. Asked if this was a broken promise, when jobkeeper was initially set to last for six months and expire in September, Tehan said the government \u201calways said that we would review jobkeeper\u201d. We said that we would review it in June. We said that we would make changes if it needed to be more targeted. We had discussions with the sector, and it was seen that it was much more equitable to have a transition payment that went right across the sector, which enabled the sector to be able to transition from the relief package that we put in place to these new arrangements ... Now, obviously jobkeeper will be reviewed, and decisions will be made on that after the review. But it was done on consultation with the sector, and it was seen as a much more equitable way for us to be able to provide the transitional support that the sector needs. In some depressing news, a study published today has found that 75% of Australians hold implicit bias against Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The data comes from 10 years of responses to an implicit association test. More than 11,000 responses were analysed. The study found there was no correlation between higher education and a reduction in implicit bias, and those younger than 25 and older than 60 held higher rates of bias than those in the middle. The group with the lowest rates of bias, either towards or against Indigenous peoples, were Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples themselves, who \u201cstatistically speaking they are unbiased\u201d. Good morning and welcome to our continued live coverage of the coronavirus in Australia. The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, the Treasury boss, Dr Steven Kennedy, and officials from the Australian Taxation Office, including the taxation commissioner, Chris Jordan, will face the Covid-19 Senate inquiry this afternoon to explain the $60bn accounting error in the budget for the jobkeeper program. You\u2019ll recall the $1,500-a-fortnight program was initially forecast to cost $130bn and cover 6 million workers, but then revised down to a $70bn program with only 3 million applicants. Today is also the first day back at school for the final cohort of Victorian students. Students in years three to 10 will return to the classroom, and schools have implemented staggered start times and banned access to drinking fountains in an attempt to minimise the spread of any infection. Meanwhile, the federal deputy chief medical officer Nick Coatsworth said it would take two to three weeks before it was known if the Black Lives Matter protests at the weekend had caused a spike in cases. The Australian Medical Association yesterday called for everyone who attended a protest to quarantine for 14 days as a precaution. And, if you need the reminder: today is Tuesday.",

      "bodyText": "The holiday letting company that owns Hoseasons and Cottages.com has agreed to give customers refunds for stays that were cancelled because of the coronavirus crisis, after it was reported to the competition watchdog. Vacation Rentals, which has a range of holiday brands and accommodation websites, including Welcome Cottages and Landal GreenParks, had originally refused to give money back to customers. Customers reported the firm to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) after they were offered vouchers, which had to be used to rebook by the end of August. It is the first victory for the watchdog against companies refusing to refund customers for goods or services cancelled because of the pandemic, and a government ban on non-essential travel. Vacation Rentals has made a formal commitment to the CMA to give customers the option of a full refund, while informing them of the new policy on its website and providing monthly reports on the number of refunds it has made. However, the CMA is warning that other holiday rental companies have not yet agreed to follow suit, and it is continuing its investigation. The watchdog said its Covid-19 taskforce has already received about 4,500 complaints about UK holiday rental companies, of which Vacation Rentals accounted for a significant proportion. It set up the taskforce during the lockdown to monitor the market and identify the biggest problems facing consumers. Consumers have complained that companies are refusing to provide them with full refunds, or are offering vouchers instead of cash. The CMA vowed in April to get tough with firms failing to give refunds to customers and threatened to take them to court if they did not comply. The CMA chief executive, Andrea Coscelli, called on other holiday accommodation firms to do the same as Vacation Rentals. \u201cWe know the pandemic is presenting businesses with challenges too, but it\u2019s not right that people are being left hundreds or even thousands of pounds out of pocket \u2013 on top of having to sacrifice their holidays. Consumer protection law exists for a reason; businesses must observe the law or face the possibility of enforcement action,\u201d he said. The watchdog has previously said that complaints about cancellations and refunds account for four out of five reports to its taskforce. It identified holiday accommodation as an area of particular concern, along with weddings and private events, and nurseries and childcare providers. It is also investigating package holiday providers. Consumer group Which? said it had reported Hoseasons and Cottages.com to the CMA, but warned not all companies are changing their refund policy. \u201cThere are still many customers struggling to get their money back for cancelled holiday accommodations and package travel bookings,\u201d said Rory Boland, travel editor at Which?. \u201cThe CMA must continue to investigate these sectors and come down strongly on any firms found to be flouting the law.\u201d",

The University of NSW, which has one of the largest exposures to international students, has estimated its losses at up to $600m in 2020 (from a budget of $2bn), with possible losses of $450m in 2021 and again in 2022. The trade minister, Simon Birmingham, has rejected China\u2019s warnings to its citizens not to travel to Australia due to a \u201csignificant\u201d increase in racist attacks since the coronavirus outbreak. Labor\u2019s deputy leader, Richard Marles, said on Sunday Australia was \u201cclearly not free from the issue of racism, and I\u2019m sure that there are Chinese Australians who have been on the receiving end of that\u201d. \u201cBut I think the way in which that statement is framed [by the foreign ministry] does not accurately describe where Australia is at\u201d. Anti-Discrimination New South Wales reported it had received an increase in inquiries \u201crelated to the pandemic and racism against people of Asian backgrounds\u201d between January and April 2020 and a community database that tracks anti-Asian racism has received 380 reports in two months \u2013 the equivalent of 47 a week.",

The good news is that if you\u2019re keen to eat more seafood that\u2019s been caught closer to home, there\u2019s a wealth of alternatives to choose from.</p> <p>We know fish is good for us and the catches found in our waters, from mussels, oysters and crab, to oil-rich mackerel and flaky lemon sole, are a great source of protein, vitamins and minerals.

      "bodyText": "Fish and chips with a side order of mushy peas has been a Friday night tradition for generations. A Jewish immigrant, Joseph Malin, opened the first recorded fish and chip shop in London in 1860 and dedicated takeaways have been serving customers ever since. Yet despite this heritage, if you choose battered cod, plaice or haddock to soak up your vinegar, it\u2019s unlikely to have been fished from UK waters: the majority of the cod and haddock we buy is imported from the Barents Sea or around Norway or Iceland. According to the Sea For Yourself campaign, which is largely funded by Defra and aims to inspire the UK to eat seafood caught in UK waters, close to half of adults would buy more seafood if they knew it was caught locally. The good news is that if you\u2019re keen to eat more seafood that\u2019s been caught closer to home, there\u2019s a wealth of alternatives to choose from. We know fish is good for us and the catches found in our waters, from mussels, oysters and crab, to oil-rich mackerel and flaky lemon sole, are a great source of protein, vitamins and minerals. The NHS recommends that we should all enjoy at least two portions of fish a week, one of which should be an oil-rich variety. \u201cMost of us are familiar with nutrition advice that encourages us to eat a wide variety of fruit and vegetables for optimal health, and it\u2019s the same when it comes to seafood,\u201d says Juliette Kellow, consultant nutritionist at Seafish, a non-departmental public body set up to support the UK seafood industry and funded mainly by a levy on all first-hand purchases of seafood products in the UK, including imported seafood. \u201cMany varieties of fish provide a range of B vitamins, which help fight fatigue for those of us always on the go. \u201cIncorporating fish such as herring, coley or hake, and shellfish like crab and mussels into your diet is smart, as they provide a great source of protein and allow you to make the most of all the health benefits seafood offers.\u201d When you\u2019re trying to get more variety into your diet, it makes sense to try something new. Trying a wide variety of fish dishes instead of sticking to well-worn favourites supports UK fishermen, helps stocks stay sustainable and keeps your mealtimes creative \u2013 because of course, the real beauty of seafood is its endless versatility.

The executive chairman of News Corp Australasia, Michael Miller, said last month the publisher is transforming from \u201ca network of newspapers\u201d to \u201cAustralia\u2019s leading journalism network\u201d. Staff at the Herald Sun, the Daily Telegraph and the Australian were told of the cuts on Tuesday. The company is centralising its reporting, subediting and production under the Melbourne-based News Corp veteran Peter Blunden. The fresh round of cuts comes a fortnight after News Corp shut down more than 100 newspapers and cut at least 500 staff from its local mastheads, including 150 journalists, photographers and designers. The scale of the latest round of cuts is understood to be less than the 500 lost in May. In the new role of national executive editor Blunden will lead the sharing of copy between the previously discrete mastheads in the Murdoch stable. He told the Australian the new model meant \u201cdone once, done better and shared across the company\u201d. There will be a specialist sports newsroom, a national team of news reporters and a centralised subbing division. Following News Corp\u2019s withdrawal as a major shareholder of Australian Associated Press, the company has established its own internal wire service, called NewsWire, to supply court, crime and politics reports. \u201cWe are reshaping our operations to meet the needs of customers and clients \u2013 we will be much more focused on digital, growing digital subscriptions and simplifying our structures to be less complex for advertisers to leverage,\u201d a News Corp spokesman said. \u201cAt a local level our focus is on developing our successful community news coverage approach which now makes up 50% of our fast-growing subscription business. \u201cAt a state and national level, we are going to better coordinate and harness our considerable journalistic talent across Australia. \u201cThese initiatives to reposition News Corp Australia for growth will involve some job role changes and regretfully, some job losses.\u201d Miller had warned job cuts were \u201cinevitable\u201d after the collapse of the advertising market during the pandemic when he suspended printing of 60 local newspapers including the Manly Daily, which has been in print since 1906. Sources say the recent cuts News Corp has made amount to about 30% of staff across the company. The company refuses to confirm numbers. News Corp\u2019s global empire lost US$1bn in the three months to the end of March and is expecting more financial pain as the economic fallout from the coronavirus crisis continues. The chief executive, Robert Thomson, foreshadowed the wave of cost-cutting, including a \u201cstrategic review of our Australian newspaper holdings\u201d at a results briefing last month. Many other publishers have been hit hard, including Australian Community Media, Nine Entertainment, Ten Daily, Bauer Media and Vice Media. The ABC has also announced job cuts of 250 to meet an $84m budget cut.",

It is hard to imagine what life is like for a single parent with two kids living on the 10th floor of a high-rise, but we try to do so: after all, we need reminding of how fortunate we are where we live. It\u2019s a sort of elderly enclave, not dissimilar to a geriatric Butlins, each of us with our own chalet-type dwelling. Just over a dozen of us, cut off from the outside world, yes, but isolated? Not on your life.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jun/02/more-age-appropriate-homes-needed-in-the-uk-says-report\">More 'age-appropriate' homes needed in the UK, says report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We have been in constant touch with each other, not literally of course, but we could hang out in our handkerchief gardens and chat over fences, as well as telephone and electronic contact. But we really miss the personal contact, especially the volunteering, which was crucial to our wellbeing.&nbsp;Golf and tennis don\u2019t really do it for us, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/29/uk-lockdown-rules-what-are-the-key-changes\">recent relaxation</a> on \u201ccongregation\u201d simply re-emphasises how draconian were the previous restraints. It\u2019ll take more than a barbecue to get over it all. Although being allowed out is welcome, it still feels like we\u2019re being treated like naughty schoolchildren.</p> <p>It\u2019s the internet that has been the big winner from the crisis. We could not have done without it, we would not have come through without it. Let\u2019s hope we can move on without it, now that we can bring whole families together and meet up with more than one other human being \u2013 off screen.</p> <p>Mind you, we know what\u2019s going on without the internet. Most of our news feed is analogue and authentic: it\u2019s from real-life contacts. We know the traffic is increasing because there\u2019s a main road outside; we get the town gossip from a postie whose social skills could probably resolve the war in Syria. One of us knows someone who empties the park rubbish bins so we\u2019re up to date with what\u2019s in on the alfresco drinking and eating front \u2013 it\u2019s dry cider, vodka and Domino\u2019s.</p> <p>Another has a grandson who opens the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/05/help-us-map-what-is-happening-with-public-toilets-across-the-uk\">public toilets</a> \u2013 there are 4,500 in the country, most have been closed, not ours. It\u2019s the same with snitching: all of us know someone, who knows someone who has been the victim of being reported for breaking the rules, and we\u2019ve all had unpleasant moments in the street or supermarket from accusing looks, questioning our geriatric right to be out. We are viewed with even more disapproval if we wear a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/05/face-masks-coronavirus\">mask</a>. Madness.</p> <p>Nevertheless, we hope these are exceptional and that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/05/neighbourliness-to-the-fore-its-been-the-highlight-of-our-lockdown\">coronavirus-generated neighbourliness</a> will persist, because we\u2019ve come to recognise that neighbourliness takes some working on. One of the \u201cconditions\u201d for being offered a place in these elderly sanctuaries is the social literacy to get the balance right between respect for the privacy of others and social accessibility. The lockdown has enhanced this. Before the crisis, we lived in harmony: as members of the moribundi, we know too well that life\u2019s too short for feuding, and we practised sociability with what could be called emotional distancing. The shared experience of the crisis has shown us that neighbourliness is not just saying hello and enquiring after health, it\u2019s about engagement.</p> <p>The crisis has also made us more \u201calert\u201d, although not in the way our prime minister means. We may not have reached the eighth age of the zimmered nincompoop but we know that the reaper is never far away; we may confront him with haemorrhoid humour, but in our serious moments, longevity and dying receive due vigilance.</p> <p>We also share some strong opinions about the NHS. Naturally we joined in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/22/lets-stop-clapping-for-the-nhs-says-woman-who-started-the-ritual\">Thursday clap</a>, but we don\u2019t get dewy-eyed over the NHS.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWe\u2019ve been lucky I suppose \u2026 think of all those families without a garden, really cut off.\u201d This has been the recurring theme of conversations with my crumbly neighbours. It is hard to imagine what life is like for a single parent with two kids living on the 10th floor of a high-rise, but we try to do so: after all, we need reminding of how fortunate we are where we live. It\u2019s a sort of elderly enclave, not dissimilar to a geriatric Butlins, each of us with our own chalet-type dwelling. Just over a dozen of us, cut off from the outside world, yes, but isolated? Not on your life. We have been in constant touch with each other, not literally of course, but we could hang out in our handkerchief gardens and chat over fences, as well as telephone and electronic contact. But we really miss the personal contact, especially the volunteering, which was crucial to our wellbeing. Golf and tennis don\u2019t really do it for us, and the recent relaxation on \u201ccongregation\u201d simply re-emphasises how draconian were the previous restraints. It\u2019ll take more than a barbecue to get over it all. Although being allowed out is welcome, it still feels like we\u2019re being treated like naughty schoolchildren. It\u2019s the internet that has been the big winner from the crisis. We could not have done without it, we would not have come through without it. Let\u2019s hope we can move on without it, now that we can bring whole families together and meet up with more than one other human being \u2013 off screen. Mind you, we know what\u2019s going on without the internet. Most of our news feed is analogue and authentic: it\u2019s from real-life contacts. We know the traffic is increasing because there\u2019s a main road outside; we get the town gossip from a postie whose social skills could probably resolve the war in Syria. One of us knows someone who empties the park rubbish bins so we\u2019re up to date with what\u2019s in on the alfresco drinking and eating front \u2013 it\u2019s dry cider, vodka and Domino\u2019s. Another has a grandson who opens the public toilets \u2013 there are 4,500 in the country, most have been closed, not ours. It\u2019s the same with snitching: all of us know someone, who knows someone who has been the victim of being reported for breaking the rules, and we\u2019ve all had unpleasant moments in the street or supermarket from accusing looks, questioning our geriatric right to be out. We are viewed with even more disapproval if we wear a mask. Madness. Nevertheless, we hope these are exceptional and that coronavirus-generated neighbourliness will persist, because we\u2019ve come to recognise that neighbourliness takes some working on. One of the \u201cconditions\u201d for being offered a place in these elderly sanctuaries is the social literacy to get the balance right between respect for the privacy of others and social accessibility. The lockdown has enhanced this. Before the crisis, we lived in harmony: as members of the moribundi, we know too well that life\u2019s too short for feuding, and we practised sociability with what could be called emotional distancing. The shared experience of the crisis has shown us that neighbourliness is not just saying hello and enquiring after health, it\u2019s about engagement. The crisis has also made us more \u201calert\u201d, although not in the way our prime minister means. We may not have reached the eighth age of the zimmered nincompoop but we know that the reaper is never far away; we may confront him with haemorrhoid humour, but in our serious moments, longevity and dying receive due vigilance. We also share some strong opinions about the NHS. Naturally we joined in the Thursday clap, but we don\u2019t get dewy-eyed over the NHS. The hands-on people \u2013 nurses and doctors, cleaners and porters \u2013 they totally deserve heroic status. It is the professions we applaud, not the institution. My major concern as the rules relax is that people have become so dependent on the electronic connection that it could become our default setting for sociability. The bard was right: the world has indeed become a stage \u2013 well, a screen \u2013 and the internet has made actors of us all. The problem is that virtual engagement doesn\u2019t work in the way that real contact does. It may work for good news, although its virtual bonhomie and forced joy smacks of egocentric desperation to be \u201cliked\u201d. However, it is of no use whatsoever in bad news transactions; when it attempts gravitas, sympathy, consolation, it comes over as pompous, mawkish and sentimental. It is incapable of expressing emotional literacy. So I truly hope that we can wean ourselves off the convenience of e-connected affability and restore the less comfortable but essentially more comforting vocabulary of emotional engagement. \u2022 Stewart Dakers is an 81-year-old community voluntary worker",

At that moment, Nolan Fuzzell had seen enough.</p> <p>Fuzzell is a table server at a restaurant in Lawrence, Kansas, and previously supported Trump. But after the photo stunt he tweeted: \u201cBeginning to regret wearing all Trump gear on Election Day 2016. This is not right, on any level.\u201d</p> <p>So how did Trump lose supporters like Fuzzell, and are they gone for good?</p> <p>It\u2019s helpful to remember, first, what the president has asked of Republicans. He has treated the party like Theseus\u2019s ancient ship, replacing one plank at a time until it becomes unrecognizable as itself.&nbsp;From a party whose elites sought to reject Trump in 2016, it has now become almost unerringly loyal and much changed.</p> <p>Under Trump\u2019s leadership, Republicans have gone to war against their traditional allies, the FBI. They have cozied up to their old opponents, in Russia. Republican leaders have signed off on federal deficits so gargantuan \u2013 this year it will top a trillion dollars \u2013 they would make Franklin D Roosevelt blush.&nbsp;</p> <p>Trump adherents have had to boycott the reddest of American sports, professional football.&nbsp;</p> <p>Towering Republican heroes \u2013 political like Mitt Romney, military like John Kelly, both like John McCain \u2013 have come under Trump\u2019s withering attack.&nbsp;</p> <p>Trump\u2019s own former defense secretary, James Mattis, felt compelled to speak out against the treatment of American citizens during protests following the death of George Floyd at the hands of police. Comparing the president to Nazi propagandists, Mattis wrote: \u201cWe must reject and hold accountable those in office who would make a mockery of our constitution.\u201d</p> <p>Among other things Trump has asked evangelical Christians, his staunchest allies, to overlook lurid descriptions of his sexual escapades, hush money paid to a porn actor and \u2013 with difficulty \u2013 the abandonment of vulnerable Christian communities in northern Syria.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c296bcbc3cd47717b2767d0ec0f34e1a3b904aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c296bcbc3cd47717b2767d0ec0f34e1a3b904aa/0_0_4087_2725/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump walks past police in Lafayette Park after the visit to St John\u2019s Church across from the White House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump walks past police in Lafayette Park after the visit to St John\u2019s Church across from the White House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Semansky/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the most difficult demand of Trump\u2019s followers is unfolding now.</p> <p>For years, activists on the right railed against the possibility of US military deployment within the country\u2019s borders. A conspiracy theory about such a program \u2013 called \u201cJade Helm 15\u201d \u2013 grew so adamant that in 2015 Texas senator Ted Cruz requested an explanation from the Pentagon. It was a figment of the fevered rightwing imagination.</p> <p>But now, under Trump, the American self-invasion is coming true: squads of troops from agencies that normally oversee prisons, borders and drug enforcement have taken to the streets, often with no identifying insignia, to tamp down protests and riots. This week, active-duty troops mustered outside Washington, awaiting Trump\u2019s command.&nbsp;</p> <p>The troop build-up alarmed Mattis, a retired marine general.</p> <p>\u201cMilitarizing our response, as we witnessed in Washington DC, sets up a conflict \u2013 a false conflict \u2013 between the military and civilian society,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt erodes the moral ground that ensures a trusted bond between men and women in uniform and the society they are sworn to protect, and of which they themselves are a part.\u201d</p> <p>All these circumstances have converged to chip away at Trump\u2019s previously granite-hard base.</p> <p>Fuzzell, the regretful waiter in Kansas, is not alone.</p> <p>\u201cIf I were a Republican operative, I\u2019d be concerned about some of these numbers,\u201d said Natalie Jackson, director of research at the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI).&nbsp;</p> <p>PRRI\u2019s latest poll shows Trump with an 11-point deficit to Biden. And underneath that margin, Jackson said, there are some previously unseen trends. For example, 47% of white voters with no college degree saw Trump favorably.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s an all-time low,\u201d Jackson said. In 2019 that rating had averaged 52%. \u201cIt\u2019s statistically significant.\u201d</p> <p>Much of the drop may be because those non-degreed white voters \u2013 Trump\u2019s hard core \u2013 have suffered mightily during the coronavirus outbreak.</p> <p>\u201cThey are more likely to work in the service industry, and are losing jobs at a higher rate, or going to work at a significant risk to their health,\u201d Jackson said.</p> <p>It\u2019s difficult to know, yet, how the current civil unrest may affect Trump\u2019s support. But the initial signs are not in his favor. PRRI researchers collected their information around the country between May 26 and 31. Midway through that span, protests reached an inflection point when rioters burned down the Minneapolis police\u2019s third precinct building.&nbsp;</p> <p>So the researchers, curious about the protests\u2019 effect, divided their polling into pre- and post-precinct-burning samples. Among all Republicans, Jackson said, Trump\u2019s favorability dropped a whopping 9% after the precinct fire, from 88% to 79%.&nbsp;</p> <p>Republican leaders have not turned against Trump, largely, but they have fallen silent. After Trump\u2019s photo with a Bible outside St John\u2019s, senators Mike Enzi of Wyoming and Rob Portman of Ohio <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kasie/status/1267865976818806784?s=21\">told NBC</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kasie/status/1267868881667993609?s=21\">separately</a>, they couldn\u2019t comment because they were \u201clate for lunch\u201d.</p> <p>Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JakeSherman/status/1267889477470560259\">said</a> he didn\u2019t want to \u201ccritique other people\u2019s performances\u201d.</p> <p>Cruz did offer criticism, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kasie/status/126787187692942131\">of a sort</a>. He leveled charges of abuse of power: \u201cBy the protesters, yes.\u201d</p> <p>But other Republican leaders, those who have less to fear from Trump, have begun to denounce him. The last Republican president, George W Bush, sided with the protesters with a clear reference to Trump. He <a href=\"https://www.bushcenter.org/about-the-center/newsroom/press-releases/2020/06/statement-by-president-george-w-bush.html\">wrote</a>: \u201cThe only way to see ourselves in a true light is to listen to the voices of so many who are hurting and grieving. Those who set out to silence those voices do not understand the meaning of America \u2013 or how it becomes a better place.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/07/tearing-apart-america-how-friends-and-foes-now-view-trumps-rule\">'Trump is tearing apart America': how the world sees the US protests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Senator Mitt Romney, of Utah, said in a statement: \u201cFrom the news clips I have seen, the protesters across from the White House were orderly and nonviolent.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump once famously boasted he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue, and not lose supporters. For years that seemed true. But his latest actions \u2013 including the deployment of an ad hoc paramilitary force against protesters on avenues around the country \u2013 may have been too much. New polls show Trump\u2019s support is slipping among key groups, some showing him at a double-digit disadvantage to Democratic rival Joe Biden. Last Monday night, police and soldiers violently cleared protesters so Trump could walk from the White House to St John\u2019s church for a photo opportunity. At that moment, Nolan Fuzzell had seen enough. Fuzzell is a table server at a restaurant in Lawrence, Kansas, and previously supported Trump. But after the photo stunt he tweeted: \u201cBeginning to regret wearing all Trump gear on Election Day 2016. This is not right, on any level.\u201d So how did Trump lose supporters like Fuzzell, and are they gone for good? It\u2019s helpful to remember, first, what the president has asked of Republicans. He has treated the party like Theseus\u2019s ancient ship, replacing one plank at a time until it becomes unrecognizable as itself. From a party whose elites sought to reject Trump in 2016, it has now become almost unerringly loyal and much changed. Under Trump\u2019s leadership, Republicans have gone to war against their traditional allies, the FBI. They have cozied up to their old opponents, in Russia. Republican leaders have signed off on federal deficits so gargantuan \u2013 this year it will top a trillion dollars \u2013 they would make Franklin D Roosevelt blush. Trump adherents have had to boycott the reddest of American sports, professional football. Towering Republican heroes \u2013 political like Mitt Romney, military like John Kelly, both like John McCain \u2013 have come under Trump\u2019s withering attack. Trump\u2019s own former defense secretary, James Mattis, felt compelled to speak out against the treatment of American citizens during protests following the death of George Floyd at the hands of police. Comparing the president to Nazi propagandists, Mattis wrote: \u201cWe must reject and hold accountable those in office who would make a mockery of our constitution.\u201d Among other things Trump has asked evangelical Christians, his staunchest allies, to overlook lurid descriptions of his sexual escapades, hush money paid to a porn actor and \u2013 with difficulty \u2013 the abandonment of vulnerable Christian communities in northern Syria. But the most difficult demand of Trump\u2019s followers is unfolding now. For years, activists on the right railed against the possibility of US military deployment within the country\u2019s borders. A conspiracy theory about such a program \u2013 called \u201cJade Helm 15\u201d \u2013 grew so adamant that in 2015 Texas senator Ted Cruz requested an explanation from the Pentagon. It was a figment of the fevered rightwing imagination. But now, under Trump, the American self-invasion is coming true: squads of troops from agencies that normally oversee prisons, borders and drug enforcement have taken to the streets, often with no identifying insignia, to tamp down protests and riots. This week, active-duty troops mustered outside Washington, awaiting Trump\u2019s command. The troop build-up alarmed Mattis, a retired marine general. \u201cMilitarizing our response, as we witnessed in Washington DC, sets up a conflict \u2013 a false conflict \u2013 between the military and civilian society,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt erodes the moral ground that ensures a trusted bond between men and women in uniform and the society they are sworn to protect, and of which they themselves are a part.\u201d All these circumstances have converged to chip away at Trump\u2019s previously granite-hard base. Fuzzell, the regretful waiter in Kansas, is not alone. \u201cIf I were a Republican operative, I\u2019d be concerned about some of these numbers,\u201d said Natalie Jackson, director of research at the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI). PRRI\u2019s latest poll shows Trump with an 11-point deficit to Biden. And underneath that margin, Jackson said, there are some previously unseen trends. For example, 47% of white voters with no college degree saw Trump favorably. \u201cThat\u2019s an all-time low,\u201d Jackson said. In 2019 that rating had averaged 52%. \u201cIt\u2019s statistically significant.\u201d Much of the drop may be because those non-degreed white voters \u2013 Trump\u2019s hard core \u2013 have suffered mightily during the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cThey are more likely to work in the service industry, and are losing jobs at a higher rate, or going to work at a significant risk to their health,\u201d Jackson said. It\u2019s difficult to know, yet, how the current civil unrest may affect Trump\u2019s support. But the initial signs are not in his favor. PRRI researchers collected their information around the country between May 26 and 31. Midway through that span, protests reached an inflection point when rioters burned down the Minneapolis police\u2019s third precinct building. So the researchers, curious about the protests\u2019 effect, divided their polling into pre- and post-precinct-burning samples. Among all Republicans, Jackson said, Trump\u2019s favorability dropped a whopping 9% after the precinct fire, from 88% to 79%. Republican leaders have not turned against Trump, largely, but they have fallen silent. After Trump\u2019s photo with a Bible outside St John\u2019s, senators Mike Enzi of Wyoming and Rob Portman of Ohio told NBC, separately, they couldn\u2019t comment because they were \u201clate for lunch\u201d. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, said he didn\u2019t want to \u201ccritique other people\u2019s performances\u201d. Cruz did offer criticism, of a sort. He leveled charges of abuse of power: \u201cBy the protesters, yes.\u201d But other Republican leaders, those who have less to fear from Trump, have begun to denounce him. The last Republican president, George W Bush, sided with the protesters with a clear reference to Trump. He wrote: \u201cThe only way to see ourselves in a true light is to listen to the voices of so many who are hurting and grieving. Those who set out to silence those voices do not understand the meaning of America \u2013 or how it becomes a better place.\u201d Senator Mitt Romney, of Utah, said in a statement: \u201cFrom the news clips I have seen, the protesters across from the White House were orderly and nonviolent. They should not have been removed by force and without warning, particularly when the apparent purpose was to stage a photo op.\u201d One voter, who requested anonymity due to threats, wrote in a message: \u201cConsidering how far right the Trumpublican party has moved, I\u2019m now considered left.\u201d So he started a Facebook page, directly titled I Regret Voting for Donald Trump in 2016. \u201cMany are afraid of posting in public due to fears of being attacked by unforgiving people on the left,\u201d the voter said. But his page has 8,600 followers now.",

Firms will have to decide whether they can afford to keep staff on furlough when they have to start contributing towards the cost of the government scheme or choose to make workers redundant. \u201cFrom the middle of June, I expect a significant increase in redundancies,\u201d said Andrew Sanford, a business advisory partner at the tax and advisory company Blick Rothenberg. The furlough scheme, which began in March, is costing taxpayers about \u00a314bn a month, and is being used by about 1m firms. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced at the end of May that the Treasury would slowly taper the furlough scheme \u2013 which currently pays 80% of wages up to \u00a32,500 \u2013 from August. Businesses will initially have to pay employer national insurance (ER NIC) and pension contributions for workers kept on furlough, which is equal to about 5% of gross employment costs before the furlough scheme started. However, from October the government will be paying only 60% of wages, up to a cap of \u00a31,875, while employers will have to contribute 20% plus ER NICs and pension \u2013 equal to about 23% of gross employment costs pre-furlough. If firms do not believe they will have the income to begin paying towards the furlough scheme from August, as well as covering holiday pay, they may decide to make workers redundant. Gillian McAteer, the head of employment law at business advisory firm Citation, says there has been an \u201cenormous increase\u201d in questions from clients about redundancy. She said one in five of all queries coming in from clients are now about job losses, but added that making workers redundant can be expensive. \u201cA lot of them have got no income coming in at all, so therefore they are looking at losses and what is keeping them going is borrowing. Questions that we are getting a lot of are \u2018I need to make people redundant, but I can\u2019t afford their redundancy pay.\u2019 There is emergency borrowing you can ask for if that is the case,\u201d she said. A number of other changes to the furlough rules will also affect employers\u2019 decisions over whether to keep staff on. Furloughed staff can also be brought back to work part-time from 1 July, with employers paying wages in proportion to hours worked. However, Sanford warned that only staff who have been furloughed for three weeks before 30 June can join the part-time scheme, so companies must decide by 10 June what to do about those workers. In addition, from 1 July companies are not allowed to have more employees on furlough than they had earlier in the year. Sanford said that to avoid widespread job losses later in the year, the government should consider continuing the furlough scheme for the sectors of the economy most affected by the shutdown. \u201cThere are some sectors where government support up until the end of October will be adequate, and there are others, in particular hospitality and retail, where with social distancing measures I don\u2019t see how they can recruit all of their staff back.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, Just a few weeks ago, New York was considered the global centre of the coronavirus crisis. On Monday, the city cautiously began reopening for business, a moment that the mayor, Bill de Blasio, described as \u201ca triumph for all New Yorkers\u201d. But though the pandemic appears to have eased in the north-east, public health officials are concerned by a rise in cases across southern US states including Florida, Texas and California. Researchers at the University of Washington have raised their forecast for Covid-19 deaths, predicting that more than 145,000 people will die with the disease in the US by August. While the recent mass protests could exacerbate its spread, the incubation period of the virus means this latest rise in cases can more likely be traced to a loosening of lockdown restrictions around Memorial Day weekend late last month. The pandemic is still worsening around the world, the WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has warned, saying: \u201cThis is not the time for any country to take its foot off the pedal.\u201d In Brazil, the worst-affected nation in South America, recorded infections have now passed 700,000. The crisis has exposed the country\u2019s deep racial disparities, while a trend for coronavirus-themed parties is causing division and unrest. How two weeks of protest have already inspired change George Floyd\u2019s family is preparing to bury the 46-year-old in his home town of Houston on Tuesday, after a judge in Minneapolis set bail at $1.25m for Derek Chauvin, the former police officer charged with his murder. Meanwhile, across the US the push for radical reform inspired by Floyd\u2019s death two weeks ago is gaining traction. The Minneapolis council is grappling with how to implement its pledge to replace the city\u2019s police department with a community-based public safety model. In New York, De Blasio has said funding previously earmarked for the NYPD will be diverted to \u201cyouth initiatives and social services\u201d. And Democrats in Congress unveiled proposals with the potential to transform law enforcement across the US. Trump is using calls to \u201cdefund the police\u201d to attack Democrats, as the president and his party turn the debate over racism and policing into a campaign issue. Amazon is under fire for publicly backing Black Lives Matter while continuing its commercial relationships with US police forces, which campaigners say perpetuate policies and technologies that are \u201charming black and brown communities\u201d. Cars, guns, pepper spray: the violence visited on protesters The protesters against police brutality in cities across the US have repeatedly come up against violent responses, and not just from the police. In Minneapolis, a man drove a semi truck at protesters blocking a bridge. On Sunday, a man drove his car towards a demonstration in Seattle, and then shot a protester who approached his window. In Virginia, a self-described Ku Klux Klan leader was arrested after driving into a group of protesters. During a protest in San Jose, California, police fired a rubber bullet at an activist who had given officers anti-bias training, causing injuries that could leave him unable to have children. The black film-maker Christopher Frierson was pepper-sprayed by police in Brooklyn, captured the incident on camera, and then returned to engage officers in conversation about the protests and their response. Republican criticism of Trump is growing The 2012 Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, marched through Washington DC on Sunday alongside Black Lives Matter protesters. On the same day, Colin Powell, the secretary of state under George W Bush, told CNN he would vote for Joe Biden in November. Criticism of Trump from the grandees of his own party is growing. But, asks David Smith, will it dent his unwavering support from the congressional GOP \u2013 or from the grassroots? The Trump supporters who regret their vote. Polls suggest the president\u2019s response to the coronavirus and the recent protests has chipped away at his own base. Matthew Teague reports. In other news \u2026 Daniel Radcliffe has addressed the controversy over JK Rowling\u2019s trans tweets, saying \u201ctrans women are women\u201d. The Harry Potter actor said he hoped the debate over recent comments by the author \u2013 which critics said were transphobic \u2013 would not \u201ctaint\u201d the book and film series for its fans. The US has officially entered recession for the first time since 2007-09, bringing to an end 128 months of growth \u2013 the longest economic expansion in US history. Trump\u2019s plan to withdraw 9,500 troops from Germany risks giving Russia a strategic advantage, and would further undermine the postwar western military alliance, European politicians and military experts have said. Prince Andrew has accused US prosecutors of misleading the public. In a statement, his lawyers said that, contrary to the claims of US authorities, the DoJ has rejected three offers of help from the prince in their investigation of Jeffrey Epstein. Great reads How Hong Kong caught fire It is a year since demonstrations first began in Hong Kong over a proposed law that would fundamentally diminish its autonomy from China. Tania Branigan and Lily Kuo report on how the traditionally pragmatic city has been transformed by a radical protest movement. A famed Yellowstone bear survives another season The grizzly bear known as \u201c399\u201d is probably the most famous wild bruin in the world. The 24-year-old Yellowstone resident has done more than any other grizzly to change people\u2019s perception of her species. And she recently re-emerged after another annual hibernation, writes Todd Wilkinson, with four cubs in tow. Opinion: Trump\u2019s ex-lawyer compared protesters to terrorists Last week, the president retweeted a letter by his former personal lawyer John Dowd. In it Dowd described the peaceful protesters in Washington DC\u2019s Lafayette Park as \u201cterrorists\u201d. That is a frightening rhetorical escalation, says Lawrence Douglas. In labeling protesters as terrorists, Dowd engages in something far more ominous and shocking than mere rhetorical overkill. He is effectively erasing the difference between Americans peaceably exercising their constitutional rights and Isis insurgents laying down roadside explosives.

      "body": "<p>In a recent <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/03/exclusive-coronavirus-began-accident-disease-escaped-chinese/\">interview with the Telegraph</a>, the former head of MI6 Sir Richard Dearlove cited an \u201cimportant\u201d scientific report that suggested that the novel coronavirus had not emerged naturally, but had been created by Chinese scientists. Dearlove said he believed the pandemic had \u201cstarted as an accident\u201d after the virus escaped the lab. A month earlier, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, had said he had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/mike-pompeo-donald-trump-coronavirus-chinese-laboratory\">\u201cenormous evidence\u201d</a> that Covid-19 had originated in a lab in China, only to backtrack from this claim on <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/interview-pompeo-sends-mixed-messages-coronavirus-wuhan-lab-993341/\">live TV</a> in the same sentence.</p> <p>Suggestions that Covid-19 is a manmade virus are the latest chapter in a tale of blame, misinformation and finger-pointing. Cue the <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/collections/new-coronavirus-collection/\">conspiracy theorists</a>, marching out their narrative about the high-security BSL-4 lab in Wuhan, where mysterious experiments to design \u201cfrankenviruses\u201d led to the tragic global pandemic. Cue the genetic analyses pointing to \u201cunexpected\u201d insertions in the code of A, G, T, and C that explain how this virus could <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.927871v1.full.pdf\">not have evolved naturally</a>. Cue political posturing against China, with calls for an inquiry, trade sanctions and even reparations.</p> <p>Determining the origins and emergence of a pandemic is as messy and complex as studying a plane crash. Just as an air crash investigator pieces together fragments at a crash site, pinpointing the origins of a new virus is painstakingly difficult and time-consuming, and requires logic and reason. I know, because this is exactly what <a href=\"https://www.ecohealthalliance.org/\">our organisation</a>, EcoHealth Alliance, does. We work around the world to identify the origins of pandemics, map them and analyse them, and use these results to predict where the next pandemic will likely emerge. We then target these \u201chotspots\u201d for enhanced surveillance, capacity-building and risk-reduction programmes to prevent diseases emerging.</p> <p>I also know the work of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, because we have partnered with them on research projects. For the past 15 years we\u2019ve been working in China to analyse the group of viruses from which Sars and now Covid-19 have emerged. Sampling more than 16,000 bats, <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/06/nih-halted-study-unveils-its-massive-analysis-bat-coronaviruses\">we showed that S</a><a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/06/nih-halted-study-unveils-its-massive-analysis-bat-coronaviruses\">ars emerged from a cluster of coronaviruses carried by horseshoe bats</a> that are abundant across southern and central China and traded frequently in wet markets. We found Sars-related viruses that could infect human cells in the lab, cause diseases in lab animals, and evade drugs and vaccines designed to protect us. We worked with the scientists behind the breakthrough drug <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/remdesivir-drug-to-be-available-for-selected-nhs-covid-19-patients\">Remdesivir</a> to show that it was effective against known human coronaviruses and the viruses we suspected might be the next to emerge. We raised the red flag on these viruses and pointed out their potential to cause the next pandemic.&nbsp;</p> <p>Our 15 years of work in China now puts us in a unique position to identify, with a remarkable degree of confidence, the likely origin of Covid-19. In a recent paper, soon to appear in a peer-reviewed journal, we reported 781 genetic sequences of bat-origin coronaviruses previously unknown to scientists. These include the closest known relatives to Sars-CoV, Sars-CoV-2 and <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0010-9\">S</a><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0010-9\">ads-CoV</a>, a virus that killed more than 25,000 pigs in Guangdong in 2016 and 2017. All are carried by horseshoe bats that are found across southern China and neighbouring countries. Our report firmly concludes that Covid-19 originated in bats, in a hotspot of viral evolution along the border of Yunnan province in China, Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam.&nbsp;</p> <p>Most people (including former heads of intelligence agencies) aren\u2019t trained in how to decipher genetic codes, so we have to assess the rigour of competing research to determine the truth of claims that Covid-19 was manmade. Writing in the peer-reviewed journal <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9\">Nature Medicine</a>, researchers strongly refuted the idea that the code had been purposefully manipulated. Whereas the article in Nature Medicine<em> </em>was written by senior virologists, one author, John Fredrik Moxnes, the chief scientific adviser to the Norwegian military, has already withdrawn his name from the <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/DBBC0FA6E3763B0067CAAD8F3363E527/S2633289220000083a.pdf/biovacc19_a_candidate_vaccine_for_covid19_sarscov2_developed_from_analysis_of_its_general_method_of_action_for_infectivity.pdf\">paper</a> cited by Dearlove \u2013 while scientists from the Francis Crick institute and Imperial College London also dismissed its conclusions.</p> <p>And the claim in the earlier version of this paper to have proven \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt that the Covid-19 virus is engineered\u201d was removed in the later version. This claim relied on an insertion in the genetic code for the spike protein of the virus, the place where the virus locks into our own cells. But the <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(20)30662-X.pdf\">discovery</a> of another novel bat coronavirus in southern China, very closely related to Sars-CoV-2, that includes a similar insertion shows this can evolve naturally.&nbsp;</p> <p>Contrary to the idea that Chinese scientists deliberately released the virus, existing patterns of infection suggest that the wide spread of Covid-19 was a question of when, not if. Only a handful of people work on bat coronaviruses in labs in China, and they wear masks and gloves so as not to contaminate their laboratories. In 2018, we conducted a pilot survey of people living in rural Yunnan province and found nearly <a href=\"https://www.ecohealthalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Virologica-Sinica-SARSr.pdf\">3% had antibodies for bat coronaviruses</a>. Expanding this data to cover the densely populated area in southeast Asia where there are bats known to harbour coronaviruses, we can safely estimate that between one and seven million people are infected with bat coronaviruses each year.</p> <p>Unfortunately, this sort of logic will not deter conspiracy theorists. The dark power of the internet means that anyone, anywhere, can find evidence to echo even the most outlandish of claims. Theories that Sars originated from space or that HIV was manmade are readily available, but it doesn\u2019t make them true. Such conspiracies play to our most base instincts and paranoias \u2013 fears that dissolve logic and reason. The details of how this virus emerged naturally are far less exciting. They\u2019re about how humans and animals have interacted for millennia, now at an unprecedented rate. They\u2019re about how human domination of the world\u2019s ecosystems as we encroach on animal habitats is opening new pathways for viruses, once hidden in the depths of the forest, to be transmitted to humans.</p> <p>Even as Covid-19 continues to spread across the world, analysing its origin is of critical importance for our species on this planet. If we allow myths and rumours to set our pandemic prevention agenda, we miss, quite literally, the forest for the trees. We estimate that there are <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6378/872\">1.7</a><a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6378/872\">m</a><a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6378/872\"> undiscovered viruses</a> in wildlife in emerging disease hotspots such as rural southeast Asia. Rather than chasing conspiracies, we should be focusing our efforts on these regions and the communities on their frontlines. A pandemic such as this one isn\u2019t a once-in-a-lifetime tragedy. Ignoring the guidance of the global scientific community about how and why they emerge will come at a great cost to us all.</p> <p>\u2022 Peter Daszak is president of EcoHealth Alliance, a non-profit dedicated to analysing and preventing pandemics</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 11 June 2020 to make clear the writer\u2019s past work with researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

Whereas the article in Nature Medicine was written by senior virologists, one author, John Fredrik Moxnes, the chief scientific adviser to the Norwegian military, has already withdrawn his name from the paper cited by Dearlove \u2013 while scientists from the Francis Crick institute and Imperial College London also dismissed its conclusions. And the claim in the earlier version of this paper to have proven \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt that the Covid-19 virus is engineered\u201d was removed in the later version. This claim relied on an insertion in the genetic code for the spike protein of the virus, the place where the virus locks into our own cells. But the discovery of another novel bat coronavirus in southern China, very closely related to Sars-CoV-2, that includes a similar insertion shows this can evolve naturally. Contrary to the idea that Chinese scientists deliberately released the virus, existing patterns of infection suggest that the wide spread of Covid-19 was a question of when, not if. Only a handful of people work on bat coronaviruses in labs in China, and they wear masks and gloves so as not to contaminate their laboratories. In 2018, we conducted a pilot survey of people living in rural Yunnan province and found nearly 3% had antibodies for bat coronaviruses. Expanding this data to cover the densely populated area in southeast Asia where there are bats known to harbour coronaviruses, we can safely estimate that between one and seven million people are infected with bat coronaviruses each year. Unfortunately, this sort of logic will not deter conspiracy theorists. The dark power of the internet means that anyone, anywhere, can find evidence to echo even the most outlandish of claims. Theories that Sars originated from space or that HIV was manmade are readily available, but it doesn\u2019t make them true. Such conspiracies play to our most base instincts and paranoias \u2013 fears that dissolve logic and reason. The details of how this virus emerged naturally are far less exciting. They\u2019re about how humans and animals have interacted for millennia, now at an unprecedented rate. They\u2019re about how human domination of the world\u2019s ecosystems as we encroach on animal habitats is opening new pathways for viruses, once hidden in the depths of the forest, to be transmitted to humans. Even as Covid-19 continues to spread across the world, analysing its origin is of critical importance for our species on this planet. If we allow myths and rumours to set our pandemic prevention agenda, we miss, quite literally, the forest for the trees. We estimate that there are 1.7m undiscovered viruses in wildlife in emerging disease hotspots such as rural southeast Asia. Rather than chasing conspiracies, we should be focusing our efforts on these regions and the communities on their frontlines. A pandemic such as this one isn\u2019t a once-in-a-lifetime tragedy. Ignoring the guidance of the global scientific community about how and why they emerge will come at a great cost to us all. \u2022 Peter Daszak is president of EcoHealth Alliance, a non-profit dedicated to analysing and preventing pandemics \u2022 This article was amended on 11 June 2020 to make clear the writer\u2019s past work with researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

      "bodyText": "Businesses have taken at least half a trillion dollars in coronavirus aid from the American public, and the government is refusing to disclose which companies are getting the money. The lack of oversight in the system for US lawmakers\u2019 \u201cpaycheck protection program\u201d makes the historic levels of spending ripe for abuse. The media and watchdogs cannot scrutinize the payments to ensure against waste, fraud or favors to political allies. Eleven national news publications are suing for public records, yet little public attention has gone to the problem, as the government has scrambled to respond to a cratered economy and unemployment that has soared past 40m jobless claims. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely mind-boggling that we\u2019re in a situation where we\u2019re shoveling so much money out to private businesses, and we don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going,\u201d said Kyle Herrig, founder of the watchdog group Accountable.US. Loans under the program are forgivable, meaning companies don\u2019t have to pay them back. Recipients are meant to spend the money on continuing to pay workers or on recurring expenses, such as rent and utilities. As Congress rushed to provide economic relief to US businesses, it also sent money to companies that did not critically need financial aid. More than 300 publicly traded companies received payments. Indebted fossil-fuel producers have been among them. At least one company used its aid to benefit wealthy, private jet-owning clients. Small businesses, meanwhile, say they have struggled to gain access to the loans. The program has also raised concerns of conflicts of interest. A top treasury department official charged with steering the coronavirus bailout program is set to benefit financially from the spending he is overseeing. Liz Hempowicz, policy director at the Project On Government Oversight, said the program and the cracks in it demonstrate a \u201cshocking lack of transparency\u201d. Meaghan Smith, a Democratic strategist and former Department of Health and Human Services official, said the amount of aid is unprecedented. \u201cIt\u2019s trillions of dollars that was passed basically at warp speed so I think there are severe concerns about the level of oversight,\u201d Smith said. Oversight advocates want Democrats to demand better transparency with any funds they approve. But the Senate\u2019s Republican majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has said any additional aid legislation should be narrower in scope than Democrats in the House have backed. Congress and Donald Trump last week updated the program to let businesses spend more of the money on expenses other than payroll \u2013 but they declined to set new oversight requirements. One transparency measure was defeated after failing to get support from two-thirds of lawmakers in the House. The bill, sponsored by Congressman Dean Phillips from Minnesota, would have required the Small Business Administration to make information about payments to businesses public. \u201cWe cannot accept a situation in which bigger businesses with access to other sources of liquidity are pushing to the front of the line at the expense of those with the greatest need,\u201d Phillips said on the House floor. The government bailout for businesses is unprecedented, dwarfing what went out even during the 2008 recession. In the first 14 days of lending, the SBA oversaw 1.7m loans totaling more than $342bn, more than it administered over the last 14 years. By 30 May, those figures had grown to 4.5m loans totaling $510bn. The SBA has refused to release its loan records to media organizations and transparency groups. In a 20 April letter to Accountable.US, the SBA official William Briggs pointed to \u201cprivacy and confidentiality issues\u201d. The SBA\u2019s internal watchdog has already found that the program \u201cdid not fully align\u201d with the legislation\u2019s provisions, including for giving banks guidance about which loans to prioritize. None of the entities involved are required to publicly disclose where the money is going \u2013 not the banks lending the money, the companies taking it nor the government agencies overseeing the program. The government has said it will review loans of more than $2m. Revelations of loans so far have come from voluntary disclosures, leaks by whistleblowers, or regulatory filings required of publicly traded companies. Big companies \u2013 including the $4.4bn NBA team the Los Angeles Lakers and $2.2bn fast-food chain Shake Shack \u2013 have taken money and then given it back following media scrutiny. Congress did establish a five-person panel to oversee spending, but it does not have the power to subpoena records. Bharat Ramamurti is on that commission and is also managing director for the corporate power program at the liberal Roosevelt Institute thinktank. \u201cTo me, the biggest issue with the PPP [paycheck protection program] is not the Lakers and Shake Shack are not getting the money, it\u2019s that hundreds of thousands of small businesses that are eligible for PPP and really need PPP are not getting it,\u201d Ramamurti said, noting he was speaking for himself and not the commission. \u201cThat is more tragic to me than a public company getting a few million bucks that will likely go to help its workers because of the design of the program.\u201d Many of the companies getting aid have hundreds of employees and are worth millions or billions of dollars. They fit the legal description of a \u201csmall business\u201d but are not the mom-and-pop companies in most Americans\u2019 minds. At the same time, businesses like local restaurants and shops have said they have not been able to access the funds \u2013 or have had longer waits than bigger companies \u2013 and have been forced to lay off employees and even permanently close. A survey of small businesses by the Census Bureau through the beginning of May found that only 38% of those that had asked for a loan had received one. Minority-owned businesses have had an even harder time \u2013 only 12% that sought loans got them, according to a survey by two equal-rights organizations. Rob Grover, the economic development coordinator for Trempealeau county in Wisconsin, said \u201cit seems like this program and many others have really focused on helping the large Wall Street businesses\u201d. Laid-off workers are frustrated to see big corporations getting money when they have received at most a $1,200 payment from the government, Grover said. An additional unemployment insurance benefit of $600 a week has been helpful, but many Wisconsinites have not received it yet because of a backlog in applications, he added. Republicans leaders in Washington oppose extending that benefit. In all, the government has spent about $3tn on coronavirus aid in four separate packages. Of that, $784bn has been allocated to individuals, including unemployment benefits, paid leave and direct cash payments, according to NPR. Far more has been set aside for businesses: $810bn for small businesses, $513bn in tax benefits for all businesses and $532bn in non-forgivable loans to large corporations. \u201cA lot of folks feel like maybe the government isn\u2019t focusing on them, and is leaving them behind,\u201d Grover said.",

      "bodyText": "Hundreds more deaths from Covid-19 in the north-west of England and in care homes have driven up the number of excess fatalities since the UK went into lockdown to more than 63,000, a toll believed to be greater than those anywhere else except the US. The number of deaths from the virus in England and Wales fell to 1,822 in the last week of May, the fewest for eight weeks, according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). But the numbers remain relatively high in the north-west, where there have been fears of a resurgence of the virus. The region including Liverpool and Manchester recorded 282 deaths from the virus in England and Wales in the week ending 29 May, the most in any region. Care home deaths rose to a total of 13,454 up to 29 May. Care homes are now calling for the government to roll out repeat-testing of staff and residents to improve their infection control. More up-to-date figures from the Care Quality Commission and the Care Inspectorate Wales show that in the week to last Friday 448 people died in care homes with confirmed or suspected cases of coronavirus. The disease accounts for at least 28% of all deaths in care and nursing homes. HC-One, the largest provider of private homes, said on Monday it was approaching 1,000 coronavirus deaths among its residents, including 24 in a single home in Durham. The latest weekly deaths data from the ONS shows that a total of 45,748 deaths involving Covid-19 had been registered in England and Wales as of 29 May. The number of excess deaths in the period from the week ending 27 March to 29 May was 57,961. Statisticians say this figure could show undiagnosed Covid-19 deaths as well as deaths caused by a lack of treatment resulting from the lockdown. Adding in excess deaths for a similar period in Scotland and Northern Ireland, the total rises to 63,629. The rate of excess deaths is falling but it remained 20% higher than the five-year average for England and Wales, with 1,653 excess deaths in the week to 29 May. At the peak of the crisis in mid-April, there were almost 12,000 more deaths per week than normal. A study of 24 European countries shows that on average the continent is returning to normal levels of mortality, with effectively no excess mortality in France, Spain or Italy. England is still ranked as having \u201cmoderate excess\u201d by the European Mortality Monitoring Project. Last week, the ONS reported that undiagnosed Covid-19 could help explain many of the excess deaths. \u201cIt is possible that symptoms may not be apparent or that Covid-19 could be mistaken for illnesses with similar symptoms,\u201d it said. \u201cSome death certificates state that more information will be provided later, and some of these have since been updated to mention Covid-19. This supports the theory that Covid-19 is under-diagnosed at present on death certificates.\u201d It said underreporting could be due to people dying with a severe underlying conditions exacerbated by Covid-19, such as chronic lower respiratory disease, dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The largest increases in non-Covid-19 deaths compared with the five-year average were in deaths due to \u201cdementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease\u201d (up 52% on the five-year average) and \u201csymptoms, signs and ill-defined conditions\u201d (up 78%).

In another high-profile case, the family of Adama Traor\u00e9, 24, a black Frenchman, who died in 2016 after being arrested by police in circumstances similar to George Floyd in the US, said on Tuesday they had rejected the offer of talks with the justice minister. \u201cThe Traor\u00e9 family reiterates that it wants legal progress and not an invitation to talks that won\u2019t lead to any procedural purpose,\u201d the campaign group, Truth for Adama, said. The family\u2019s campaign for the officers involved in his arrest to face legal action has been given new momentum by worldwide anger over Floyd\u2019s killing and the BLM movement. Demonstrations are expected across France on Tuesday evening to coincide with Floyd\u2019s funeral in Texas. In Paris, SOS Racisme called for a \u201csolemn gathering\u201d at Place de la R\u00e9publique and asked protesters to respect eight minutes and 46 seconds of silence, the time it took for Floyd to die. \u201cYour presence will serve to remind people of our determination to fight racism in the police and everywhere else,\u201d the association said, adding that protesters should wear masks and respect social distancing rules.

      "bodyText": "Pangolin scales have been removed from an official 2020 listing of ingredients approved for use in traditional Chinese medicine in a move lauded by animal protection groups as a key step in stamping out trade in the scaly anteater, the world\u2019s most trafficked mammal. As many as 200,000 pangolins are consumed each year in Asia for their scales and meat and more than 130 tonnes of scales, live and dead animals were seized in cross-border trafficking busts last year, a figure estimated to represent up to 400,000 animals, according to conservation group WildAid. Trade in all eight species of pangolin are protected under international law and three of the four native to Asia are included on the red list of the International Union for Conservation of Nature as critically endangered species, including the functionally extinct Chinese pangolin. The news of the delisting from the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) pharmacopoeia, reported by China\u2019s Health Times newspaper, comes after the country\u2019s State Forestry and Grassland Administration (SFGA) raised the protected status of pangolins to the highest level last week, with immediate effect. \u201cI am very encouraged,\u201d said Zhou Jinfeng, secretary general of the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation (CBCGDF), who has long pushed for better protection of pangolins and for stopping the use of their scales. \u201cOur continuous efforts for several years have not been in vain.\u201d In February, China\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress pushed forward a ban on the consumption of meat from wild animals, though there has been uncertainty as to what wildlife will still be allowed for use in TCM and the fur and leather industries. More clarity is expected once China finalises and approves revisions to its wildlife protection law, possibly in the next year. \u201cWe highly applaud this announcement, made in recognition of the need to protect critically endangered pangolins,\u201d Steve Blake, chief representative of WildAid in Beijing, told the Guardian. \u201cAlong with upgrading pangolins to a national level 1 protected species, these two actions are crucial to help curb illegal trade,\u201d Blake said. \u201cThis shows China\u2019s rapidly strengthened commitment to protecting wildlife.\u201d \u201cBut we still have a long way to go,\u201d Zhou said. \u201cWe need to be vigilant about so-called \u2018captive breeding\u2019 and medicinal research [related to pangolin] because some wrong findings could lead to the wrong policy decisions,\u201d Zhou said. The SFGA currently provides permits to TCM pharmaceutical companies for using parts from previous stockpiles or poorly regulated \u201cfarmed\u201d wildlife, but the practice is widely shown to be a magnet for poaching and the illegal trafficking of both parts and live animals. Pangolins \u2013 which are notoriously difficult to breed in captivity \u2013 have been in the spotlight since the start of the Covid-19 outbreak, due to studies suggesting they may have been the intermediate host that transmitted the virus to humans. Of the two animals known to naturally carry the Sars-CoV-2 virus \u2013 bats and pangolins \u2013 the latter is the most problematic, both for its meat and for the scales that protect its body. Neither has been positively identified as the intermediate source that transferred the virus to humans, though a 100% identification may prove elusive, according to experts. Since 1 January, when Chinese authorities shut down the Wuhan wet market where the virus was suspected to have originated, no official details have been released about the specific wildlife found there. What is known is that out of the 33 samples taken by investigators from the market that tested positive for the Sars-CoV-2 virus, 31 were from the area where wildlife was sold.

She told the House of Commons in an update on Brexit talks that she and Michael Gove would \u201cemphasise that we will not be extending the transition period\u201d when they meet EU counterparts at a Brexit joint committee meeting on Friday. It led to an immediate accusation of the government behaving recklessly, with the Scottish National party MP Pete Wishart accusing the Conservatives of trying to \u201cheap misery upon misery\u201d with Covid-19 and Brexit \u201cthe twin horsemen of the economic apocalypse\u201d denying any prospect of recovery. Mordaunt insisted the country would not be \u201cbarrelling off a cliff edge\u201d and hoped to have a deal by autumn. It said the government would be able to divert money from the EU coffers to to \u201clevel up\u201d the British economy. Mordaunt also strongly hinted that no-deal planning was back on the table. Asked what preparations the government was making for a collapse in talks she told the House it \u201cwould be prudent and wise for us to prepare for every scenario\u201d. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, pressed the government to honour the \u201coven-ready\u201d deal Boris Johnson promised in his general election campaign. She was speaking as the former environment secretary Theresa Villiers said the government would not succumb to EU demands to access British fishing waters. \u201cWe are not going to see the compromises coming from Boris\u2019s government,\u201d Villiers said, arguing that the common fisheries policy (CFP) was \u201cgrossly unfair\u201d. Her comments came days after Brexit talks over a future trade deal hit the buffers with four major areas of disagreement, including access to British seas for EU boats. \u201cI just don\u2019t see that the UK government is going to just shift in any substantive way from what is put on the table already,\u201d Villiers told an Institute for Government webinar on Tuesday. She said the government was \u201cintensely conscious of how crucial fisheries are to the Scottish economy\u201d and fishing communities and would defend them. The impasse over sharing British fishing waters has thrown the prospects of a Brexit deal into disarray, with the UK and the EU calling for an acceleration of talks to try to break the logjam in July. The UK has consistently said it will not extend the transition period, which ends in December. Catherine Barnard, a senior fellow at the thinktank UK in a Changing Europe, said in a briefing launching a separate report published on Tuesday that the threat of no deal raised the prospect of ugly fish wars in addition to trouble over the jurisdiction of the European court of justice in disputes over trade and state aid. The EU, she said, also wanted the UK to stay committed to the European convention on human rights, the international treaty between Council of Europe members (a 47-member non-EU body). Salmon exports, a significant part of Scotland\u2019s fishing economy, would become a more expensive option for EU diners with a 2% tariff on fresh salmon and 13% on smoked salmon. A recent study by the Wageningen University in the Netherlands suggested that while UK fishing would gain $420m (\u00a3400m) from having exclusive access to UK waters, it would lose $500m from the imposition of tariffs and non-tariff barriers on its exports, said James Kane, an associate at the independent thinktank the Institute for Government.

We call on the government to work with the teaching profession and education unions to develop a secure plan for the wider opening of schools and invest the necessary resources to make it a success.\u201d",

A group of ministers nicknamed the \u201cSave Summer Six\u201d was reportedly weighing up plans to open beer gardens, amid concern that the hospitality sector is facing up to 3.5m job losses unless pubs, restaurants and cafes resume business soon. But Downing Street played down suggestions that the government was preparing to accelerate its phased blueprint for restarting the economy. Boris Johnson\u2019s official spokesman said the government\u2019s roadmap \u201csets out our ambition to reopen open pubs, bars and cafes as soon as possible; but the date in the roadmap is from 4 July, subject to advice at the time.\u201d However, ministers have been examining changes to regulations, such as those governing which businesses can put chairs and tables out on pavements. Relaxing these rules could make it easier for more outlets to provide the takeaway services permitted throughout the lockdown. Proposals to allow beer gardens to open from 22 June were first reported on Sunday night in the Financial Times, which cited three Whitehall officials. But the Guardian understands that the pubs industry was not told of any such plan and has since informed the government that most pubs would not be ready within a fortnight anyway due to the length of time it takes to brew beer to supply the pubs, as well as the complexity of bringing staff back to work, arranging deep cleans and getting rid of out-of-date beer. Beer that has gone off has to be thrown away but this often involves discussions with local water boards, while the process has to be recorded to verify the amount being disposed of, so that pubs can claim the right amount of beer duty back from brewers. The decision on reopening pubs is further complicated by rules on social distancing. No 10 is understood to have told senior figures in the hospitality industry that cutting social distancing requirements from 2 metres to 1m would be discussed at Tuesday\u2019s cabinet meeting, amid concern about job losses in the hospitality industry. Trade bodies such as UK Hospitality and the British Beer &amp; Pubs Association (BBPA) have submitted estimates showing escalating numbers of closures and job losses based on social distancing at 1m, 1.5m and 2m. If the required distance is not reduced, so-called \u201cwet-led\u201d pubs, which rely more on the sale of alcohol than food, are likely to be particularly hard hit, because they rely on packing in drinkers in large numbers. The BBPA has also voiced concern at the prospect that pubs could lose access to the furlough scheme and grant support if they are technically allowed to open, even though the reality of social distancing rules means many cannot. The trade body wants the government to provide financial backing to any pubs that are rendered unviable as a result. If ministers agree to provide that support, maintaining social distancing at 2m would mean many more pubs, bars and restaurants would draw on the funding, increasing the cost to the Treasury.",

      "bodyText": "While Asian markets rose for a ninth session, stock markets across Europe and the US are a sea of red, ahead of the two-day Fed meeting. The losses come after a strong first week in June, and a stellar day for US stocks yesterday. A collapse in German and French trade appears to have sparked the sell-off, and news that the eurozone shrank by 3.6% in the first quarter, rather than 3.8% as initially thought, did little to calm nerves. It was still the worst decline on record, and the detail revealed that household spending, investment and exports all plummeted by more than 4% between January and March. Some analysts warn that the second quarter will be even worse. Thank you for reading. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at trading platform Spreadex, says: All this comes after a stellar Monday session in the US, one that saw the Nasdaq hit an all-time high and the Dow Jones reach a 15-week peak. Those long- and short-term records, however, may well have inspired Tuesday\u2019s losses. Investors might be questioning the wisdom of such highs in a world still very firmly in the middle of a pandemic. Wall Street has fallen at the open, ahead of the Fed meeting. Dow Jones is down 355 points, or 1.92%, at 27,217 Nasdaq down 58 points, or 0.59%, at 9,866 S&amp;P 500 down 34 points, or 1.08%, at 3,197 Over here, the sell-off in stocks has gathered pace. The FTSE is down 2% while Germany\u2019s Dax has lost 1.66%, France\u2019s CAC has slid 1.5% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB is 1.75% lower. Gold \u2013 regarded as a safe-haven investment \u2013 is climbing for a second day, as stock markets are sliding. Spot gold gained 1.2% to $1,715 an ounce. Last Friday, gold fell to $1,670, the lowest level in more than a month, after the surprise 2.5m jump in US jobs in May sparked a strong rally in stocks. However, other precious metals are not in demand \u2013 silver lost 1.4% and palladium was down 5.05%. Palladium is used in autocatalysts and demand from the car industry has fallen because of the coronavirus crisis. The global airline industry is heading for losses of $84bn in 2020\u2013 the \u201cworst year in the history of aviation\u201d\u2013 according to the main international industry body. The coronavirus pandemic forced airlines around the world to ground their fleets. The International Air Transport Association has updated its forecasts and predicted a further $15.8bn loss next year, taking total losses caused by the pandemic to $100bn. Iata believes that air traffic will be slow to recover and airlines will have to slash their fares to lure back passsengers. Iata is predicting that passenger numbers will rise 55% next year but still remain 29% below last year\u2019s level. It argues that making wearing face masks mandatory on board and other safety measures will be enough to ensure a safe return to flying. The UK government\u2019s 14-day quarantine for international air arrivals took effect yesterday, but Iata director general Alexandre de Juniac said: These measures should give governments the confidence to open borders without quarantine measures. Gareth Baker, energy partner at the law firm Gowling WLG, says: With the continuing reduction in commercial and industrial demand caused by COVID-19, combining with high wind speeds and sunny days, coal was always going to be the loser in our energy mix. Whilst this is part of a long-term trend, the system has coped with the substantial increase in renewable generation remarkably well. The next challenge is how the network balances and manages intermittency and energy storage has to become a substantial part of the solution. In a more positive milestone, Britain will tomorrow reach two consecutive months without using electricity from coal-fired power stations for the first time since the industrial revolution in the 19th century, according to the National Grid, Reuters reports. Britain opened its first coal plant in the 1880s and coal became the main source of electricity over the next century. But coal plants emit almost double the amount of carbon dioxide (which is blamed for global warming) as gas-fired power plants, and use of (near) zero carbon sources such as wind and solar is steadily growing. The UK intends to shut its coal plants by 2024 as part of efforts to hit its net zero emissions goal by 2050. France also released trade data this morning. Exports fared even worse than in Germany, falling by 32% in April from March, compared with a 25% drop in imports. However, business surveys from the Banque de France showed a rebound in sentiment in industry, services and construction in May, roughly offsetting a third of the loss recorded since February, noted Oxford Economics analyst Moritz Degler. Turning to the eurozone GDP figures, he said: With lockdowns only introduced around mid-March and extended through April and some of May in most countries, it is clear that Q2 growth will be hit much harder than Q1. We expect eurozone GDP to decline 11% q/q in Q2 before starting to recover in Q3. The Fed will issue economic forecasts for the first time since December at the end of its meeting tomorrow, but is not expected make any major policy announcements. The central bank\u2019s policy makers will discuss the unexpectedly strong employment data released last Friday, which showed a surprise gain of more than 2.5m jobs last month while the unemployment rate fell. The Covid-19 pandemic prompted the Fed to cut interest rates to near zero and to launch a number of credit programmes to prop up the economy at emergency meetings in March, but no major moves are expected tomorrow. It will release its policy statement at 2pm EDT (7pm BST), followed by a news conference with Fed chair Jerome Powell. Back in the markets, things are looking less rosy. Europe\u2019s main stock markets in Germany, France and Italy have fallen more than 2% and the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 is down 1.8%. US stock futures are pointing to a lower open on Wall Street later, bringing the recent rally to an end ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s two-day meeting. Oil prices are also sliding, dragged down by a stronger dollar and oversupply worries after a trio of Gulf producers said they would end voluntary output cuts. Brent crude has lost 1.89% to $40.03 a barrel and US light crude has fallen 2.49% to $37.24. The Opec oil cartel, along with Russia and other producers, a group known as Opec+, on Saturday agreed to extend record production cuts of 9.7m barrels a day until the end of July. But it then emerged that Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates would not extend extra cuts of 1.18m barrels per day they are currently making on top of the Opec+ target. Sterling has fallen below $1.27 as the dollar strengthened against a basket of currencies, and amid continued Brexit uncertainty. The eurozone shrank by 3.6% in the first quarter, less than first thought but nonetheless the worst contraction on record. Household spending, investment and exports all plummeted because of the Covid-19 pandemic. German trade data for April were grim, showing a 24% slump in exports and a sharp decline in the country\u2019s trade surplus to \u20ac3.2bn in April from \u20ac12.8bn in March. Customers of the holiday letting company that owns Hoseasons and Cottages.com have reason to be cheerful. Vacation Rentals has agreed to give customers refunds for stays that were cancelled because of the coronavirus crisis, after it was reported to the competition watchdog, Joanna Partridge reports. Vacation Rentals, which has a range of holiday brands and accommodation websites, including Welcome Cottages and Landal GreenParks, had originally refused to give money back to customers. The outlook for UK jobs is the gloomiest in almost three decades, according to the latest employment survey by recruitment firm ManpowerGroup, writes my colleague Joanna Partridge. It found that companies in all big sectors of the economy are more likely to cut jobs than to hire people over the next three months, from July to September, the weakest forecast since records began in 1992. The survey comes as companies prepare to start weaning themselves off the government\u2019s furlough scheme, which covers the wage bill of almost 9 million workers. Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said the impact of the coronavirus pandemic had not yet been felt in that period. The share of mortgages advanced to borrowers requiring a loan-to-value greater than 90% was 5.2%, an increase on the previous year, illustrating the level of demand for high LTV deals. With lenders including Accord, Clydesdale and Virgin Money pulling out of the 90% LTV market this week owing to high demand, after only recently returning when physical valuations were once again allowed, there is clearly a need for the big lenders to commit to this market. The number of people taking out high LTV mortgages in the second quarter is likely to fall considerably, not due to lack of demand but lack of products available. The latest mortgage lending data from the Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority showed: The outstanding value of all residential mortgages loans was \u00a31,509bn at the end of 2020 Q1, 3.9% higher than a year earlier. The value of gross mortgage advances in 2020 Q1 was \u00a365.8bn, 3.8% higher than in 2019 Q1. The value of new mortgage commitments (lending agreed to be advanced in the coming months) was 6.1% higher than a year earlier, at \u00a367.6bn. Back in the UK, the government saw near-record demand for its new 30-year bond. It sold \u00a39bn of the October 2050 gilts, which pay a coupon of 0.625%. It received more than \u00a370bn in demand, not far off the record \u00a384bn in orders last month when it sold a new 10-year gilt, Reuters reported. While the eurozone GDP number is slightly better than expected, European stock markets continue to slide after last week\u2019s rally. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index down 92 points, or 1.4% Germany\u2019s Dax down 2.o8% France\u2019s CAC down 1.89% Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 1.89% US stock futures are pointing to a lower open on Wall Street later. The Dow futures are down about 1% while the Nasdaq futures are 0.5% lower. The number of people employed fell by 0.2% in the first quarter compared with the previous quarter, marking the first decline since the spring of 2013, according to Eurostat figures. France, Italy and Spain were the worst hit economies, the GDP stats show. The sharpest declines were in trade, transport, hotels and restaurants, followed by the arts and entertainment industries. Agriculture posted the smallest fall, of 0.8%. Sharp declines in household spending and investment dragged down economic growth in the eurozone in the first quarter, but the fall was slightly smaller than previously estimated. Eurostat, the EU\u2019s statistics office, said eurozone GDP fell 3.6% from the previous quarter between January and March, compared with its initial estimate of a 3.8% decline. Even so, it was the biggest decline ever recorded. GDP in the EU fell by 3.2%, also the biggest fall on record. Household spending plunged 4.7% in the eurozone as shops, restaurants, cafes and bars shut because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Investment fell 4.3% and exports were down 4.2%. Small firms in Britain have borrowed nearly \u00a324bn under a government scheme that offers 100% state guarantees for banks providing the loans \u2013 more than other Covid-19 support schemes. According to figures from the Treasury, total lending under the Bounce Back Loan Scheme rose to \u00a323.8bn by 7 June from \u00a321.3bn by 31 May. Some 782,246 firms benefited. Businesses borrowed \u00a39.6bn under the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS), which carries an 80% government guarantee, up from \u00a38.9bn. The number of jobs furloughed in the UK rose to 8.9m from 8.7m, and employers claimed \u00a319.6bn under the job retention scheme, up from \u00a317.5bn a week earlier. Sterling is sliding against the dollar and the euro. After hitting a new three-month high of $1.2757 overnight, it fell below $1.27 against the dollar. Following eight days of gains, the pound is now trading around $1.2633, down 0.7%. The dollar is pushing higher against a basket of currencies. Ulrich Leuchtmann, head of foreign exchange and commodity research at Commerzbank, told Reuters: Sterling is highly sensitive to these changes in risk sentiment \u2013 it\u2019s a more risky currency than it was a couple of months ago and some years ago. Markets are waiting for more news on the easing of lockdown measures in the UK. Uncertainty about Brexit is also weighing on the currency. A fourth round of trade talks between the UK and the EU finished with both sides saying little progress had been made. The UK has until the end of July to request an extension to the transition period, which is due to expire after 31 December. European stock markets are extending losses. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 down 1.6%, or 102 points, at 6,370 Germany\u2019s Dax down 1.25% France\u2019s CAC down 1.39% Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 2.07% Oil prices are heading lower as well. Brent crude has lost 30 cents to $40.54 a barrel, a 0.6% drop, while US light crude is 35 cents lower at $37.84, a 0.9% decline. Relief that the Opec oil cartel and its allies extended production cuts into July has given way to disappointment that Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s biggest oil producer, along with the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, hasn\u2019t committed to extra supply cuts. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index is down 0.27%, dragged lower by banking stocks, which have fallen 4% after six days of gains. In London, British American Tobacco, down 2.4%, is weighing on the FTSE 100. The maker of Dunhill and Lucky Strike cigarettes cut its annual profit and revenue forecasts this morning. It pointed to longer-than-expected Covid-19 lockdowns in South Africa, Mexico and Argentina, and said sales had also been hit by the pandemic in countries like Bangladesh, Vietnam and Malaysia. Faced with a long-term decline in traditional cigarette sales, the world\u2019s second-biggest tobacco group is pushing into vapour and oral products such as moist snuff, but said some new product launches had been delayed. It now aims to achieve \u00a35bn in sales from these new categories in 2025, rather than 2023-24. All major European indices are now in the red. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 down 48 points, or 0.75%, at 6,425 Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.6% at 12,736 France\u2019s CAC 40 down 0.3% at 5,157 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 1.8% at 19,867 Spain\u2019s Ibex down 1.05% at 7,812 Bellway, one of the UK\u2019s biggest housebuilders, said that it sold 6,721 homes between the start of August and the end of May, nearly 1,000 fewer than in the year-earlier period. Its shares fell nearly 3%. Like other builders, the company temporarily shut its sites at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, but work has restarted on 230 sites and all sales offices reopened on 1 June. Productivity is reduced (because of physical distancing and other safety rules) and work is still limited to homes which are nearing completion. Bellway expects to slowly increase the number of completions through the late summer and autumn months. Its order book comprises 6,038 homes, down slightly from 6,312 homes this time last year, although the value has edged up to \u00a31.57bn. Bellway\u2019s bigger rival Taylor Wimpey said last week it saw interest from customers surge when its sales centres and show homes reopened. Germany\u2019s Dax has dipped into negative territory while the FTSE 100 in London is down nearly 30 points, or 0.45%, at 6,443. Germany\u2019s Ifo institute says that 24% of companies it polled needed liquidity aid in May to help them get through the coronavirus crisis, the same proportion as in April. European shares are mixed at the open. The FTSE 100 index in London is down some 15 points, or 0.2%, at 6,458, and Spain\u2019s Ibex also slipped 0.2%. Germany\u2019s Dax is up 0.3%, France\u2019s CAC gained 0.2% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB has opened 0.16% higher. The only upside from this morning\u2019s German trade numbers is that in terms of monthly economic data, the worst should now be behind us, says Carsten Brzeski, chief eurozone and global economist at ING. In the midst of the financial crisis, it took German exports five months to shrink by a total of 26%. In the Covid-19 crisis it only took the month of April to get practically the same result. In March and April, exports have now shrunk by almost 36%. The export sector is probably the most exposed to the crisis, suffering from the domestic lockdown measures as much as from lockdowns across the world and supply chain disruptions. Looking ahead, while April was the worst month ever in terms of most economic data releases, the month of May could become one of the best months ever. With the worst now behind us, things will start to brighten. In past recoveries, the German economy could always count on exports to kickstart the recovery. After the 2008/9 crisis, it was the Asian countries and strong demand for German investment goods which helped the German economy to overcome the recession swiftly. This time around, the economy will have to look to something other than exports to stimulate growth. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets and business. The main European markets finished lower yesterday while Wall Street had a bullish day, after the much better-than-expected US jobs report on Friday added to growing economic optimism. The tech-heavy Nasdaq set a new record close, up 1.1% to 9,924.74, the Dow Jones rose 1.7% and the S&amp;P 500 index gained 1.2%. The S&amp;P 500 is now slightly ahead for the year. In Asia, the Australian stock market jumped 2.4% (it was closed yesterday), Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng climbed 1.77% and China\u2019s CSI 300 gained 0.48%. Japan\u2019s Nikkei bucked the trend, falling 0.38%. Asian stocks, as measured by MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan, rose for the ninth session in a row, adding 0.28%. Stock futures are pointing to a higher open in Europe. Last night Jerome Powell, the head of the US Federal Reserve, set out the strategy for the Main Street Lending facility that will provide loans to small and medium-sized firms, noted David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK. He said the scheme is \u201cdays away\u201d from issuing its first loans. The minimum loan size has halved to $250,000, while the maximum loan size might be set at $300m, higher than $200m previously. The repayment period has been extended to five years from four. Oil prices fell by over 3% yesterday reversing earlier gains when it emerged that Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait will not be committing to any extra production cuts, after the Opec oil cartel and its allies extended previous deep production cuts into July. Oil is up again this morning: Brent crude is trading 0.76% higher at $41.11 a barrel while US light crude is 1.1% ahead at $38.61. German trade data for April this morning were grim, with a 24% monthly slump in exports in April, at the height of the coronavirus crisis. Germany\u2019s trade surplus shrank much more than expected, to \u20ac3.2bn from \u20ac12.8bn in March, as imports dropped less than exports, by 16.5%. European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde defended the central bank\u2019s enormous stimulus package yesterday before the European parliament\u2019s economic and monetary affairs committee. Madden says: The central banker was under attack from some EU lawmakers who fear for the rising debt levels of many eurozone nations. Ms Lagarde claimed the colossal stimulus package was proportionate to the size of the crisis facing the currency bloc. The update was a fine example of the ECB\u2019s willingness to keep the show on the road at all costs.

      "body": "<p>The coronavirus lockdown has virtually halted international travel and tourism, hitting airlines and other travel companies, aerospace and auto manufacturers and oil companies hard.</p> <p>As these businesses adjust to dramatically reduced revenue projections, job losses are starting to mount alarmingly. More than 40,000 redundancies have already been announced across these sectors, with more than 10,000 likely to be in the UK.</p> <h2>Rolls-Royce</h2> <p>The jet-engine manufacturer has confirmed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/03/rolls-royce-locations-uk-job-losses-derby-redundancy\">3,000 job cuts</a>, of a planned 9,000 worldwide, will be made in the UK. Rolls-Royce will make the first round of redundancies through a voluntary programme, with about 1,500 posts being lost at its headquarters in Derby, as well as 700 redundancies in Inchinnan, near&nbsp;Glasgow, another 200 at its Barnoldswick site in Lancashire, and 175 in Solihull, Warwickshire.</p> <h2>Bentley</h2> <p>The luxury carmaker intends to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/05/bentley-to-cut-nearly-a-quarter-of-its-workforce\">shrink its workforce by almost a quarter</a>, slashing 1,000 roles through a voluntary redundancy scheme. The majority of Bentley\u2019s 4,200 workers are based in Crewe in Cheshire.</p> <h2>Aston Martin Lagonda</h2> <p>The Warwickshire-based luxury car manufacturer has also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/04/car-dealer-lookers-cuts-1500-jobs-and-closes-12-showrooms\">announced 500 redundancies</a>.</p> <h2>BP</h2> <p>The oil company plans to make<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/08/bp-to-cut-10000-jobs-worldwide-amid-huge-drop-in-demand-for-oil-covid-19\"> 10,000 people redundant worldwide</a>, including an estimated 2,000 in the UK, by the end of the year.

      "bodyText": "The coronavirus lockdown has virtually halted international travel and tourism, hitting airlines and other travel companies, aerospace and auto manufacturers and oil companies hard. As these businesses adjust to dramatically reduced revenue projections, job losses are starting to mount alarmingly. More than 40,000 redundancies have already been announced across these sectors, with more than 10,000 likely to be in the UK. Rolls-Royce The jet-engine manufacturer has confirmed that 3,000 job cuts, of a planned 9,000 worldwide, will be made in the UK. Rolls-Royce will make the first round of redundancies through a voluntary programme, with about 1,500 posts being lost at its headquarters in Derby, as well as 700 redundancies in Inchinnan, near Glasgow, another 200 at its Barnoldswick site in Lancashire, and 175 in Solihull, Warwickshire. Bentley The luxury carmaker intends to shrink its workforce by almost a quarter, slashing 1,000 roles through a voluntary redundancy scheme. The majority of Bentley\u2019s 4,200 workers are based in Crewe in Cheshire. Aston Martin Lagonda The Warwickshire-based luxury car manufacturer has also announced 500 redundancies. BP The oil company plans to make 10,000 people redundant worldwide, including an estimated 2,000 in the UK, by the end of the year. The BP chief executive, Bernard Looney, said that the majority of people affected would be those in office-based jobs, including at the most senior levels. BP said it would reduce the number of group leaders by a third, and protect the \u201cfrontline\u201d of the company, in its operations. British Airways The UK flag carrier is holding consultations to make up to 12,000 of its staff redundant, a reduction of one in four jobs at the airline. BA intends to cut roles among its cabin crew, pilots and ground staff, while significantly reducing its operations at Gatwick airport. Virgin Atlantic Richard Branson\u2019s airline is to cut more than 3,000 jobs, more than a third of its workforce, and will shut its operations at Gatwick. EasyJet The airline has announced plans to cut 4,500 employees, or 30% of its workforce. Ryanair The Irish airline intends to slash 3,000 roles and reduce staff pay by up to a fifth. P&amp;O Ferries The shipping firm intends to cut more than a quarter of its workforce, a loss of 1,100 jobs. The company, which operates passenger ferries between Dover and Calais, and across the Irish Sea, as well as Hull to Rotterdam and Zeebrugge, will initially offer employees voluntary redundancy.",

The home secretary, Priti Patel, described the event as an act of vandalism. The reality was a much more complex history, in which a very specific local past and a present marred by decades of appalling racial and social inequalities finally collided. What happens next is unclear: many other slave traders are still celebrated in Bristol, while poverty, racism and all forms of inequalities are, more than ever, in urgent need of being tackled. \u2022 Olivette Otele is professor of history and memory of slavery at the University of Bristol. Her forthcoming book is entitled African Europeans: An Untold History (Hurst, 2020)",

Steve Turner, the Unite assistant general secretary for manufacturing, said:&nbsp;\u201cThe French government is absolutely right to act to protect French aerospace and aviation skills and jobs while also delivering on climate change commitments. This is precisely the sort of intervention we quickly need to see from the UK government to preserve jobs.\u201d</p> <p>Cathay Pacific has become the latest airline to receive a state bailout to survive the coronavirus pandemic, with the Hong Kong government taking a stake in the carrier as part of a HK$40bn (\u00a34bn) rescue plan.</p> <p>Cathay was one of the first airlines to suffer a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/17/cathay-pacific-issues-profit-warning-after-coronavirus-hits-service\">collapse in traffic as coronavirus emerged</a> in China, where most of its flights operate. A new government-controlled company will take a 6% stake as part of a share offering, and it will also loan the carrier a further HK$7.8bn.</p> <p>About 90% of staff at the embattled carrier have taken unpaid leave while 600 head office jobs were cut last month, after Cathay grounded the majority of flights earlier in the year. Its business was already hit by falling passenger numbers in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/28/cathay-pacific-denounced-for-firing-hong-kong-staff-on-china-orders\">wake of the pro-democracy protests</a> last year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today\u00a0email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden\u00a0email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hong Kong\u2019s financial secretary, Paul Chan, said the government did not intend to be a long-term shareholder in Cathay and would not get involved in the operations and management of the airline. </p> <p>According to figures released on Tuesday by the global aviation body, Iata, bailouts have contributed to airline debts that have risen by $120bn during the crisis to a total $550bn (\u00a3432bn).</p> <p>Iata warned that airlines were heading for a collective loss of $84.3bn in 2020, the biggest in the sector\u2019s history.</p>",

      "bodyText": "France has unveiled a \u20ac15bn (\u00a313bn) rescue plan for its aerospace industry, in an attempt to preserve hundreds of thousands of jobs and shore up the manufacturer Airbus and the national carrier, Air France. Ministers said companies would have to ramp up investment in alternative technologies such as electric and hydrogen planes as part of the bailout. The plan includes \u20ac7bn already announced for Air France, whose fleet was almost entirely grounded during the pandemic, and whose partner KLM is being backed by the Dutch government. The finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said the government would do \u201ceverything to support this French industry that is so critical for our sovereignty, our jobs and our economy\u201d, as he launched the plan alongside the transport, defence and environment ministers. Le Maire said the deal would prevent decline and help keep Airbus competing with its US rival Boeing, as well as China\u2019s Comac, which has threatened the global duopoly. The bailout will help push through Air France orders of new Airbus planes, while it also includes new defence spending by the government on Airbus military products. Unions in the UK called for a similar bailout to protect up to 1.2 million British jobs. Steve Turner, the Unite assistant general secretary for manufacturing, said: \u201cThe French government is absolutely right to act to protect French aerospace and aviation skills and jobs while also delivering on climate change commitments. This is precisely the sort of intervention we quickly need to see from the UK government to preserve jobs.\u201d Cathay Pacific has become the latest airline to receive a state bailout to survive the coronavirus pandemic, with the Hong Kong government taking a stake in the carrier as part of a HK$40bn (\u00a34bn) rescue plan. Cathay was one of the first airlines to suffer a collapse in traffic as coronavirus emerged in China, where most of its flights operate. A new government-controlled company will take a 6% stake as part of a share offering, and it will also loan the carrier a further HK$7.8bn. About 90% of staff at the embattled carrier have taken unpaid leave while 600 head office jobs were cut last month, after Cathay grounded the majority of flights earlier in the year. Its business was already hit by falling passenger numbers in the wake of the pro-democracy protests last year. Hong Kong\u2019s financial secretary, Paul Chan, said the government did not intend to be a long-term shareholder in Cathay and would not get involved in the operations and management of the airline. According to figures released on Tuesday by the global aviation body, Iata, bailouts have contributed to airline debts that have risen by $120bn during the crisis to a total $550bn (\u00a3432bn). Iata warned that airlines were heading for a collective loss of $84.3bn in 2020, the biggest in the sector\u2019s history.",

The origins of Covid-19, which was first detected in a cluster of cases associated with the Huanan seafood market in late December, has become an increasingly sensitive question as China fights off accusations that it should be blamed for the pandemic, which has killed more than 400,000 people around the world.

It has been replicated \u2013 albeit more mildly \u2013 in subsequent flu pandemics.</p>\n    <p>How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there evidence of coronavirus coming back in a second wave?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/singapore-coronavirus-increase-revives-fears-of-post-lockdown-surge\">resurgence in infections</a>&nbsp;despite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.</p>\n    <p>Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/singapores-cramped-migrant-worker-dorms-hide-covid-19-surge-risk\">cramped dormitory accommodation</a>&nbsp;used by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.</p>\n    <p>Singapore\u2019s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are experts worried about?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.</p>\n    <p>The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.</p>\n    <p>In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune individuals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave.

      "bodyText": "Ministers need to rebuild public trust in their handling of the coronavirus outbreak and compensate people for lost earnings when asked to self-isolate to prevent a resurgence of the epidemic, leading scientists have warned. Prof Susan Michie, a psychologist on a subgroup of the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage), said public confidence in the UK\u2019s handling of the crisis had fallen in recent weeks and that repairing the damage was \u201ccentral\u201d to ensuring people followed advice to contain the epidemic as the country emerged from lockdown. \u201cThere has been a dent in trust of the government to manage the pandemic over the last month, but especially over the last couple of weeks, and building that up is going to be central to managing a second wave,\u201d Michie told the Lords science committee. As restrictions ease across the UK, health officials will look to the new test-and-trace system to help contain the virus. Under the system, close contacts of people who develop symptoms and test positive will be asked to stay at home for 14 days. But Prof Lucy Yardley, a member of the Sage committee of experts, told the Lords hearing that people had not generally been good at self-isolating even at the start of the epidemic. \u201cWe have data showing that when people thought or said they were adhering, they were nevertheless leaving the home while symptomatic,\u201d she said. In many cases, people who were meant to be self-isolating with Covid-19 symptoms left home because they did not have others to buy shopping or collect prescriptions, or simply because they needed to work. In England, Department of Health tracking data suggests that only half of people who developed a cough or fever abided by the rules to self-isolate. \u201cWe already know there are going to be big difficulties with self-isolation if people are going to be asked to stay at home for 14 days and not go to work,\u201d Michie told the hearing. \u201cThis is a big financial penalty, so unless people are financially compensated, it\u2019s going to be a big disincentive for taking part in it at all.\u201d Michie, who told the committee there was a lack of transparency in how scientific advice flowed through to policy, said the government was not helping by calling the system \u201ctest and trace\u201d instead of adopting the World Health Organization\u2019s terminology of \u201ctest, trace and isolate\u201d. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t have it on the label, it\u2019s not communicating that this is a vital part of it,\u201d she said. \u201cWithout isolation, all the rest of it is for nothing.\u201d Other scientists who gave evidence to the peers raised further doubts about the government\u2019s strategy to contain the epidemic.

      "bodyText": "A total of 14 states and the US territory of Puerto Rico have recorded their worst week yet for new coronavirus infections, with Texas hitting a record high in Covid-19 hospitalizations, all while restrictions to curb the pandemic are being relaxed across America. A resurgence in new infections has been detected in states including Florida, Texas and California, as authorities allow certain businesses and public places to reopen. According to data tracked by the Washington Post, since the start of June, 14 states and Puerto Rico have experienced their highest seven-day average of new coronavirus cases since the pandemic began. The states are Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Florida, Kentucky, New Mexico, North Carolina, Mississippi, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Utah. The surge in cases, which public health experts have described as worrying, and had warned about repeatedly, shows that while Covid-19 is now in retreat in New York City and other major urban centres, it is sweeping across rural areas, infecting smaller towns. Figures from the Texas department of state health services showed that 1,935 people were hospitalized for coronavirus-related reasons on Monday, up from a previous record of 1,888 on 5 May. Officials in Dallas said the city hit its highest ever one-day total for new infections on Thursday, at 285, while Houston has also recorded climbing numbers. On Sunday, Florida recorded more than 1,000 newly diagnosed Covid-19 cases for the fifth day of the previous week, with Thursday\u2019s total of 1,413 the highest since the state started providing daily updates in March. California saw a 40% rise in cases last week, with large cities including Los Angeles, which has the highest number of cases in the state, and San Francisco lifting restrictions on travelling and access to beaches. Arizona, meanwhile, has seen one of the largest jumps in the country, with the daily total in new cases breaking the state record on four separate occasions over the past week. Doug Ducey, the Arizona governor, who relaxed restrictions two weeks ago, has put the increase down to an increase in testing and insisted that his approach on reopening has been prudent. The overall number of new cases recorded each day across the US is hovering around 20,000, down from a peak of 30,000 in April, but this decrease is mainly due to the improving situation in the worst-hit states, such as New York and New Jersey. As states in the north-east experience drops in new cases, states across the south and California are seeing increases even as they loosen social distancing rules designed to prevent person-to-person transmission of the virus. Donald Trump has mostly left pandemic response to individual states and has not addressed the crisis in a major way even as the death rate passed 100,000 Americans. Given the lag in incubation times of the virus, it appears the rise in cases has occurred around the time states started to lift restrictions, leading to scenes in the weekend of the 25 May Memorial Day holiday of people flocking to beaches and lakes and in many cases not practicing social distancing. \u201cWe\u2019re very concerned that our public health message isn\u2019t resonating,\u201d admitted Robert Redfield, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in a congressional hearing last week. \u201cWe continue to try to figure out how to penetrate the message with different groups.\u201d Florida is pushing ahead with the second phase of reopening, where bars and movie theatres can accept customers, in what Governor Ron DeSantis has called a \u201csafe, smart, step-by-step approach\u201d, while Texas is now allowing almost any business to operate at 50% capacity. Epidemiologists have warned the onward march of reopening will make it difficult to keep a lid on infections if an American public weary of lockdown is again asked to isolate themselves. \u201cThe worrisome thing for me is that there\u2019s a lot of fatigue in the population overall,\u201d said Wafaa El-Sadr, professor of epidemiology at Columbia University. \u201cPeople feel they have done distancing and they are thirsting to get outside and connect with each other. If this surge requires us taking a step back, how do we convince people to do that? I feel we\u2019ve made five steps forward and now maybe one step back.\u201d The uptick is likely to be exacerbated by the large protest gatherings across the US in recent weeks over the death of George Floyd at the hands of police. It is unclear how strong the latest outbreak will be, although experts point out most states have helped encourage new social distancing or mask-wearing behaviours, as well as shielding the most vulnerable people. Testing rates have also ramped up over the past month, although states still lack a comprehensive system to track, trace and isolate those who have come into contact with an infected person. \u201cAll the modeling has shown if you reopen without extensive testing and contract tracing, you\u2019ll see an increase in the epidemic,\u201d said Ira Longini, professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida. \u201cThat activity is not happening in an organized way in Florida, it\u2019s haphazard.

      "body": "<p>Summer has arrived, once more delivering its sensorial pleasures: the clink of glasses out on a patio, the sound of music drifting from open windows, the sight of barbecue smoke billowing. But this year, you may notice something else on the summer breeze: the stench of urine.</p> <p>Since lockdown was relaxed in the UK, tales of overcrowded parks lined with men urinating into bushes have abounded. So, too, have stories of beaches peppered with dirty pants, or forests sullied with babies\u2019 wet wipes.</p> <p>Arguably, such scenarios are inevitable. <a href=\"https://www.gloucestershirelive.co.uk/news/gloucester-news/google-tracking-data-shows-how-4188948\">Google data for the warm May bank holiday weekend showed an 136% uptick in visits to parks and open spaces</a>. Yet public toilets have been closed over concerns about Covid-19 transmission in such shared, confined spaces. With limited public toilets available \u2013 and cafes, shops and pubs also closed \u2013 it is perhaps no surprise that many Brits have answered nature\u2019s call outside. But is there a responsible way to wee in the wild?</p> <p>According to Lisa Ackerley, a chartered environmental health practitioner, the answer is a comprehensive no. She says that although one person doing it once may be harmless, at scale it will inevitably start ruining public spaces. \u201cIf everybody did it in parks, there\u2019d be nowhere to sit. People are already saying that the stench in certain places is unbearable. Then there\u2019s the fact that people aren\u2019t just peeing, they\u2019re pooing \u2013 and they\u2019re not going to be washing their hands in the park. That\u2019s irresponsible.\u201d</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/gpsc/5may/Hand_Hygiene_Why_How_and_When_Brochure.pdf\">World Health Organization, hand hygiene is the single most important measure for public health</a>, says Ackerley: \u201cWe\u2019re thinking a lot about coronavirus, but people could carry other illnesses and not realise.\u201d She cites norovirus, for example.</p> <p>Meanwhile, says Ackerley: \u201cEven the smallest amount of poo on a beach can severely affect water quality.\u201d And, although going to the toilet in the sea is relatively harmless, it can be a problem in smaller bodies of water. <a href=\"https://newsfeed.time.com/2012/05/14/are-people-peeing-in-lake-killing-fish/\">In 2012, Time</a> described how a lake in Germany had to close when urination caused an algae bloom that poisoned all the fish.</p> <p>People need to think about toilets before they go out, says Ackerley: \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of planning. If you think you won\u2019t be able to go to the toilet because you\u2019re too far away from home, and there are no public toilets open, perhaps you shouldn\u2019t be going to that place.\u201d</p> <p>But plans can go awry, and, in a pinch, people may be left with no other choice. Dylan, 28, intended to use the public toilets on a long walk through London, but discovered they were closed. \u201cI found an area of thick bushes and made sure I was totally out of view. When I was halfway through peeing, I heard a bleep and turned to see two guys in hi-vis jackets standing behind me. They weren\u2019t police; they were park officers I think. They scanned my ID, and gave me a fine.\u201d The fine of \u00a3195 was reduced to \u00a395 when Dylan explained that he was out of work and waiting for universal credit. \u201cBut that is my current food budget for the month. It seems excessive.\u201d</p> <p>He explained to the council that he had no alternative and that the toilets were closed. \u201cThey said it\u2019s not their responsibility to provide the public with the place to urinate, but I actually kind of think it is.\u201d That is not a legal obligation, however, which is partly why there is just one public toilet per 12,500 people in England.</p> <p>Then there is the issue of safely using whichever scant facilities are available. A survey by Unilever found that 87% of people across Britain are worried about contracting Covid-19 from surfaces they touch in public places, with a third needing particular assurances about small businesses and independent venues.</p> <p>Currently, residents of England are able to use the toilets of friends and families during visits to their gardens, if unavoidable. In these circumstances, the government advice is to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing#activity-outside-the-home\">\u201cavoid touching surfaces and if you use the toilet wash your hands thoroughly, wipe down surfaces, use separate or paper towels and wash or dispose of them safely after use.\u201d</a> Ackerley says this advice should be used when visiting any shared toilet. Social distancing should also be observed in toilet queues.</p> <p>As far as reopening toilets goes, there is a lot to consider. Smaller venues with just a few toilets may not be able to keep them all open if the distance between cubicles is less than 2 metres. Then there is the greater need for handwashing facilities. Could coronavirus signal the end of the public urinal to make way for cubicles with sinks? Ackerley is not so sure.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see better design of public toilets so that you don\u2019t have to go through a myriad of doors to get to them. In France you used to have pissoirs [public urinals], where people could walk in without touching anything. I think it\u2019s the time to think about that more. If you\u2019re a bloke and you need to pee, you could just walk into a pissoir. That\u2019d be so much better than going against a tree, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>Particularly when you consider that increasingly it\u2019s not just men going against the tree. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/04/the-penny-drops-at-last-a-female-urinal-for-the-festival-crowd\">Sheewee</a>, a device that helps women to urinate standing up without exposing themselves, <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/health/buy-a-shewee-what-is-it-sales-increase-a4454311.html\">has seen sales increase by 700% during the lockdown</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe could even have some of the old squatting toilets that they have in other countries,\u201d says Acklerley. These are hands-free systems, where the flush is a pedal on the floor. \u201cWe need to rethink toilets and not dismiss some of the things we used to use. A lot of the older ways may well have been very good.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Summer has arrived, once more delivering its sensorial pleasures: the clink of glasses out on a patio, the sound of music drifting from open windows, the sight of barbecue smoke billowing. But this year, you may notice something else on the summer breeze: the stench of urine. Since lockdown was relaxed in the UK, tales of overcrowded parks lined with men urinating into bushes have abounded. So, too, have stories of beaches peppered with dirty pants, or forests sullied with babies\u2019 wet wipes. Arguably, such scenarios are inevitable. Google data for the warm May bank holiday weekend showed an 136% uptick in visits to parks and open spaces. Yet public toilets have been closed over concerns about Covid-19 transmission in such shared, confined spaces. With limited public toilets available \u2013 and cafes, shops and pubs also closed \u2013 it is perhaps no surprise that many Brits have answered nature\u2019s call outside. But is there a responsible way to wee in the wild? According to Lisa Ackerley, a chartered environmental health practitioner, the answer is a comprehensive no. She says that although one person doing it once may be harmless, at scale it will inevitably start ruining public spaces. \u201cIf everybody did it in parks, there\u2019d be nowhere to sit. People are already saying that the stench in certain places is unbearable. Then there\u2019s the fact that people aren\u2019t just peeing, they\u2019re pooing \u2013 and they\u2019re not going to be washing their hands in the park. That\u2019s irresponsible.\u201d According to the World Health Organization, hand hygiene is the single most important measure for public health, says Ackerley: \u201cWe\u2019re thinking a lot about coronavirus, but people could carry other illnesses and not realise.\u201d She cites norovirus, for example. Meanwhile, says Ackerley: \u201cEven the smallest amount of poo on a beach can severely affect water quality.\u201d And, although going to the toilet in the sea is relatively harmless, it can be a problem in smaller bodies of water. In 2012, Time described how a lake in Germany had to close when urination caused an algae bloom that poisoned all the fish. People need to think about toilets before they go out, says Ackerley: \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of planning. If you think you won\u2019t be able to go to the toilet because you\u2019re too far away from home, and there are no public toilets open, perhaps you shouldn\u2019t be going to that place.\u201d But plans can go awry, and, in a pinch, people may be left with no other choice. Dylan, 28, intended to use the public toilets on a long walk through London, but discovered they were closed. \u201cI found an area of thick bushes and made sure I was totally out of view. When I was halfway through peeing, I heard a bleep and turned to see two guys in hi-vis jackets standing behind me. They weren\u2019t police; they were park officers I think. They scanned my ID, and gave me a fine.\u201d The fine of \u00a3195 was reduced to \u00a395 when Dylan explained that he was out of work and waiting for universal credit. \u201cBut that is my current food budget for the month. It seems excessive.\u201d He explained to the council that he had no alternative and that the toilets were closed. \u201cThey said it\u2019s not their responsibility to provide the public with the place to urinate, but I actually kind of think it is.\u201d That is not a legal obligation, however, which is partly why there is just one public toilet per 12,500 people in England. Then there is the issue of safely using whichever scant facilities are available. A survey by Unilever found that 87% of people across Britain are worried about contracting Covid-19 from surfaces they touch in public places, with a third needing particular assurances about small businesses and independent venues. Currently, residents of England are able to use the toilets of friends and families during visits to their gardens, if unavoidable. In these circumstances, the government advice is to \u201cavoid touching surfaces and if you use the toilet wash your hands thoroughly, wipe down surfaces, use separate or paper towels and wash or dispose of them safely after use.\u201d Ackerley says this advice should be used when visiting any shared toilet. Social distancing should also be observed in toilet queues. As far as reopening toilets goes, there is a lot to consider. Smaller venues with just a few toilets may not be able to keep them all open if the distance between cubicles is less than 2 metres. Then there is the greater need for handwashing facilities. Could coronavirus signal the end of the public urinal to make way for cubicles with sinks? Ackerley is not so sure. \u201cI\u2019d like to see better design of public toilets so that you don\u2019t have to go through a myriad of doors to get to them. In France you used to have pissoirs [public urinals], where people could walk in without touching anything. I think it\u2019s the time to think about that more. If you\u2019re a bloke and you need to pee, you could just walk into a pissoir. That\u2019d be so much better than going against a tree, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d Particularly when you consider that increasingly it\u2019s not just men going against the tree. The Sheewee, a device that helps women to urinate standing up without exposing themselves, has seen sales increase by 700% during the lockdown. \u201cWe could even have some of the old squatting toilets that they have in other countries,\u201d says Acklerley. These are hands-free systems, where the flush is a pedal on the floor. \u201cWe need to rethink toilets and not dismiss some of the things we used to use. A lot of the older ways may well have been very good.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The bosses of Unilever, HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland are among 150 business, charity and trade body leaders urging Boris Johnson to put UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) at the centre of the UK\u2019s Covid-19 recovery plans. In a letter addressed to the prime minister, they called on the UK government to view the crisis as an \u201copportunity\u201d to tackle looming problems including inequality and the climate crisis. \u201cIt is clear that many aspects of our lives will never be the same again. Some industries may never recover from this crisis. We must use this challenging situation as an opportunity to work together with our global and national partners alike, to build a stronger and more resilient economy with the SDGs at its heart,\u201d the letter said. The sustainable development goals, which were set by the UN in 2015, aim to achieve 17 core goals by 2030. They include eradicating poverty and hunger, achieving gender equality, protecting the oceans and taking urgent action to combat the climate crisis. The letter, which was coordinated by the UN Global Compact Network UK and UK Stakeholders for Sustainable Development, said the UK should use the SDGs to promote plans for a more resilient economy, address regional and social inequalities and build \u201ccoherent policies\u201d to help reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. \u201cCovid-19 has exposed the depth of inequalities and risks exposing more families to income deprivation and its consequences \u2026 We need to ensure that our recovery from the pandemic leaves no one behind and puts the health and wellbeing of current and future generations first,\u201d signatories said. \u201cThe pandemic has also highlighted the risks the world faces due to biodiversity and habitat loss, as well as the climate crisis,\u201d the letter added. \u201cWe must balance social and economic needs with the needs of our planet, protecting and managing nature and reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. These goals do not have to be in conflict.\u201d Business leaders backing the letter include the chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland, Alison Rose, HSBC\u2019s chief, Noel Quinn, Standard Life Aberdeen\u2019s boss, Keith Skeoch, the head of education group Pearson, John Fallon, the chief of InterContinental Hotels Group, Keith Barr, and the chief executive of advertising giant WPP, Mark Read.

      "bodyText": "Moscow has partially lifted its lockdown despite Russia reporting thousands of new daily cases and Spain\u2019s government said face masks would remain mandatory in public as Europe continued to emerge from the first phase of its struggle against Covid-19. Concern mounted, however, over the spread of coronavirus in Africa and elsewhere, with Nigeria confirming 600 deaths from a previously undetected outbreak and South Africa warning its pandemic could last up to two years. Spain\u2019s health minister, Salvador Illa, said the country would \u201chave to learn to live alongside the virus\u201d and masks would remain compulsory on the street, in open and enclosed public spaces and on public transport where people could not keep 1.5 metres apart. The government said on Tuesday there was \u201cno room for complacency\u201d as it outlined \u201cthe new normality\u201d once the state of emergency ended on 22 June. \u201cUntil there is a vaccine or a treatment, the virus remains a threat,\u201d the finance minister, Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Montero, said. \u201cThe message is one of prudence and caution.\u201d Life for Moscow\u2019s 13 million residents resumed a semblance of normality after two months of lockdown as some restrictions in Russia\u2019s capital were lifted even though it is is still reporting more than 1,000 new infections a day. Muscovites are now free to go outside when they want, use public transport and travel across the city in their own vehicles without any restrictions or digital passes after the mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, said the pandemic was receding in the city. He cited a recent steady fall in new cases, but critics accused him of rushing to ease the lockdown to allow a Red Square military parade later this month and a 1 July nationwide vote that could extend President Vladimir Putin\u2019s rule until 2036. Russian authorities said on Tuesday they had recorded 8,595 new cases nationwide in the past 24 hours, pushing its total tally to 485,253 \u2013 the third highest in the world after the US and Brazil. Its official death toll remains relatively low at 6,142. In France, the Paris prosecutor launched an open investigation \u2013 targeting neither the president, Emmanuel Macron, nor government ministers \u2013 into the state\u2019s handling of the crisis. Possible charges include involuntary homicide and endangering life. Beyond Europe, Nigeria\u2019s health ministry said 50% to 60% of 979 \u201cmysterious\u201d deaths in Kano, the country\u2019s second largest city, were linked to the virus, with most happening in a single week in April. Similar investigations are under way in eight other states that reported unexplained deaths. Officials in South Africa said there were now almost 51,000 confirmed cases in the continent\u2019s most industrialised nation, with 1,080 deaths, most of them concentrated in and around Cape Town and more than 80% involving people aged over 50. South Africa, which lifted some restrictions earlier this month, was widely praised for its strict early lockdown and testing programme, but although nearly a million tests have been carried out there have been long delays before results are known. Afghanistan\u2019s deputy health minister, meanwhile, said the country\u2019s actual number of infections was higher than the official figure as 542 new cases were reported on Tuesday. Fifteen more patients died overnight, meaning the country\u2019s Covid-19 death toll stands at 384. In India, authorities have warned there could soon be half a million Covid-19 cases in Delhi, with transmission forecast to increase almost 20-fold in the coming weeks. The world\u2019s second most populous nation has recorded 270,000 infections, the fifth highest tally in the world, including almost 10,000 in the past 24 hours. The capital\u2019s deputy chief minister, Manish Sisodia, said the city of 20 million people was expected to need 80,000 hospital beds, compared with the 9,000 it currently has available for coronavirus patients. Indonesia reported its biggest daily rise in infections on Tuesday: more than 1,043 new cases in the past 24 hours, bringing its total to 33,076. In Vietnam, however, which has reported just 332 cases and no deaths, flights are set to resume to and from countries that have had no new cases for 30 days. In Latin America a supreme court judge in Brazil ordered Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s government to resume publishing full Covid-19 statistics following outrage at its decision to delete historical data and stop publishing the cumulative death toll. Brazil is set to overtake the UK this week as the country with the second highest number of deaths. The WHO\u2019s Maria Van Kerkhove clarified on Tuesday that it was not clear to what extent the global population was infected by people with no symptoms. Modelling has estimated anything from 6% to 40%, but Kerkhove said the few actual studies following real asymptomatic people had found such transmission to be rare. In other developments worldwide: Coronavirus has infected more than 7,155,000 people worldwide and killed more than 407,000, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. Nearly one in five Iranians \u2013 15 million \u2013 may have been infected with the virus since the country\u2019s outbreak started in February, a health official said. Israel\u2019s internal security service, Shin Bet, has halted its controversial mobile phone tracking of virus carriers, saying the method was no longer required. The virus may have been present and spreading in Wuhan, China, as early as last summer, according to US researchers who found a \u201csteep increase\u201d in cars parked outside the city\u2019s hospitals between August and December 2019. Spain is not discussing any travel corridor with the UK, a foreign ministry source said, but it hopes the EU will agree on common criteria to allow tourists to travel. Slovakia is to reopen its borders to 16 more European countries from 10 June and will no longer require people to wear face masks outside. A UN expert said food insecurity in North Korea, which has yet to confirm a case, was deepening and some people were \u201cstarving\u201d due to its Covid-19 measures.",

      "bodyText": "Great Britain will on Wednesday be able to celebrate not having generated any coal-powered electricity for two months \u2013 the longest period since the 1880s. Great Britain, which introduced coal-powered electricity to the world in the 1880s, has run its electricity network without burning coal since midnight on 9 April, according to National Grid. A collapse in energy demand because of the coronavirus lockdown and the sunniest May on record has enabled the country to increase its reliance on solar power and other renewable energy sources such as wind. \u201cThe exact two-month mark is midnight tonight (00:00 on Wednesday 10 June), which will mark 61 days (or 1,464 hours) since the last coal generator came off the system,\u201d a spokesman for National Grid\u2019s Electricity System Operator said. The coal-free period beats the previous record of 18 days, six hours and 10 minutes set in June 2019. The figures apply to Great Britain \u2013 England, Wales and Scotland \u2013 only, as Northern Ireland is not part of National Grid. Low power prices caused by reduced industrial demand, because of the lockdown and levies on carbon emissions, has made it increasingly unprofitable to run coal-fired power stations. Great Britain hopes to close all coal plants by 2024 as part of efforts to reach the government\u2019s net zero emissions goal by 2050. Coal plants emit almost double the amount of carbon dioxide \u2013 a key cause of global heating \u2013 as gas-fired power plants. A decade ago, about 40% of the country\u2019s electricity came from coal. Use of renewable power, such as wind and solar, has soared during the lockdown as it often has lower running costs than gas and coal plants and there have been favourable weather conditions. May was the greenest-ever month for electricity production, with the lowest average carbon intensity on record at 143 grams of CO2 per kilowatt hour, National Grid said. Carbon intensity is a measure of how much carbon dioxide is emitted for each kilowatt hour of electricity produced. Renewable energy use has also overtaken coal in the US for the first time in more than 130 years. The US government said renewables overtook coal as the primary energy source in 2019. Coal had been the main energy source for the US every year since it surpassed wood in 1885. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 June 2020 because an earlier version referred to Great Britain \u201cnot having used any coal-powered electricity for two months\u201d. That should have said not having generated any coal-powered electricity.",

There\u2019s so many clubs in League One that could have gone up. I cannot understand how the EFL has come up with this solution and, most of all, I cannot believe so many clubs voted for PPG to end the season because it\u2019s so, so unfair. We had one of the division\u2019s best records at home and five of our remaining nine games were at home, seven of which were against bottom-10 clubs.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been in the game 60 years \u2013 at Peterborough for nearly 25 \u2013 and I\u2019ve got the greatest respect for our game, from non-league all the way through, but this is the worst day of my life because I think we\u2019ve been cheated out of a place in the play-offs. I feel sorry for [the co-owner] Darragh [MacAnthony] and [manager] Darren Ferguson, who has built a squad and had a team challenging for promotion. It\u2019s a disgrace.\u201d</p> \n<p>Wycombe, who jump from eighth to third, are joined in the play-offs by Oxford, Portsmouth and Fleetwood. Tranmere, three points behind AFC Wimbledon with a game in hand, are relegated with Bolton and Southend. Four clubs voted to continue.</p> \n<p>League Two clubs agreed to use the same method to end their season, with only Forest Green Rovers voting in favour of playing on. Swindon are the champions, with Crewe and Plymouth also promoted. The two-leg play-offs, which in League Two will be contested by Exeter, Cheltenham, Colchester and Northampton, start on 18 June and both finals are set to be at Wembley.</p> \n<p>One club are due to be relegated to the National League but the situation is complicated by disciplinary proceedings brought by the league against Macclesfield, who are three points above the bottom club Stevenage but stand to be deducted points if found guilty by an independent commission. A suspended two-point penalty would be triggered if Macclesfield are found guilty, and any further points deduction would relegate them. The club are contesting the three charges, which include failing to pay several players their March wages on time.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c6a3fab3-1f06-4b44-9693-fb9255dfd91c\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KhNyHIh7Euk?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The EFL said relegation would be implemented only if the National League provides assurances it will start the 2020-21 season. The National League board is set to convene on Wednesday to determine the final table. It is likely it will follow the EFL in using a points-per-game model, and it is understood there remains clamour for the play-offs. Points per game could promote two teams in the event that play-offs are not played.</p> \n<p>Forest Green\u2019s owner, Dale Vince, said: \u201cThe vote didn\u2019t take too long. It wasn\u2019t a surprise because I think the decision had been made by most clubs over a month ago but this was just confirming it. We know where we stand now. We\u2019ve been looking at what things will look like next year.\u201d<br><br>Vince said the club were considering following Hibernian in operating a cashless stadium and were hopeful of reaching fans despite being resigned to matches being played behind closed doors until the turn of the year. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a growing global fan-base that we want to do more for,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The EFL votes came after the 71 league clubs agreed to adopt the EFL board\u2019s framework, rejecting alternatives from Barnsley and Tranmere. Championship clubs agreed to relegate three teams if their season, due to resume on 20 June, is not completed. Amendments to the EFL board\u2019s framework put forward by Ipswich, Lincoln and Stevenage were rejected.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"43d5c315-7d2b-402e-82c5-7fdc0da5f111\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>League One and League Two to be settled on points per game after the seasons were ended</b>.</p>\n    <p><b>League One</b></p>\n    <p><b>Promoted:</b> Coventry City (champions), Rotherham United</p>\n    <p><b>Play-offs</b>: Wycombe Wanderers v Fleetwood Town, Portsmouth v Oxford United (dates tbc)</p>\n    <p><b>Relegated:</b> Tranmere Rovers, Southend United, Bolton Wanderers</p>\n    <p><b>League Two</b></p>\n    <p><b>Promoted:</b> Swindon Town (champions), Crewe Alexandra, Plymouth Argyle</p>\n    <p><b>Play-offs:&nbsp;</b><b>Thursday, 18 June: Semi-final first legs&nbsp;<br></b>Colchester United v Exeter City (17:15 BST) Northampton Town v Cheltenham Town (19:45 BST)</p>\n    <p><b>Monday, 22 June: Semi-final second legs</b><br>Exeter City v Colchester United (17:15 BST) Cheltenham Town v Northampton Town (20:00 BST)</p>\n    <p><b>Final:</b>&nbsp;Wembley, 29 June</p>\n    <p><b>Relegated:</b> Stevenage*<br>*Macclesfield may go down instead if they receive a points deduction</p>\n    <p><b>League 1 play-off details to be confirmed</b><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The shadow sports minister, Alison McGovern, and shadow secretary of state, Jo Stevens, have called for an urgent meeting with the government and EFL.

      "bodyText": "Peterborough and Tranmere were left incensed after League One clubs voted to curtail the season because of coronavirus, with promotion and relegation decided according to points per game and play-offs to be held. Coventry have been promoted as champions and Rotherham as runners-up but Peterborough were bumped out of the play-off positions by 0.02 points and the club\u2019s director of football, Barry Fry, said adopting such a \u201cMickey Mouse\u201d framework was a \u201cdisgrace\u201d and called it the worst day of his 60 years in football. \u201cHow the hell can you apply PPG willy-nilly without looking at the fixtures, and whether a team plays home or away?\u201d Fry said. \u201cIt\u2019s Mickey Mouse. There\u2019s so many clubs in League One that could have gone up. I cannot understand how the EFL has come up with this solution and, most of all, I cannot believe so many clubs voted for PPG to end the season because it\u2019s so, so unfair. We had one of the division\u2019s best records at home and five of our remaining nine games were at home, seven of which were against bottom-10 clubs. \u201cI\u2019ve been in the game 60 years \u2013 at Peterborough for nearly 25 \u2013 and I\u2019ve got the greatest respect for our game, from non-league all the way through, but this is the worst day of my life because I think we\u2019ve been cheated out of a place in the play-offs. I feel sorry for [the co-owner] Darragh [MacAnthony] and [manager] Darren Ferguson, who has built a squad and had a team challenging for promotion. It\u2019s a disgrace.\u201d Wycombe, who jump from eighth to third, are joined in the play-offs by Oxford, Portsmouth and Fleetwood. Tranmere, three points behind AFC Wimbledon with a game in hand, are relegated with Bolton and Southend. Four clubs voted to continue. League Two clubs agreed to use the same method to end their season, with only Forest Green Rovers voting in favour of playing on. Swindon are the champions, with Crewe and Plymouth also promoted. The two-leg play-offs, which in League Two will be contested by Exeter, Cheltenham, Colchester and Northampton, start on 18 June and both finals are set to be at Wembley. One club are due to be relegated to the National League but the situation is complicated by disciplinary proceedings brought by the league against Macclesfield, who are three points above the bottom club Stevenage but stand to be deducted points if found guilty by an independent commission. A suspended two-point penalty would be triggered if Macclesfield are found guilty, and any further points deduction would relegate them. The club are contesting the three charges, which include failing to pay several players their March wages on time. The EFL said relegation would be implemented only if the National League provides assurances it will start the 2020-21 season. The National League board is set to convene on Wednesday to determine the final table. It is likely it will follow the EFL in using a points-per-game model, and it is understood there remains clamour for the play-offs. Points per game could promote two teams in the event that play-offs are not played. Forest Green\u2019s owner, Dale Vince, said: \u201cThe vote didn\u2019t take too long. It wasn\u2019t a surprise because I think the decision had been made by most clubs over a month ago but this was just confirming it. We know where we stand now. We\u2019ve been looking at what things will look like next year.\u201d Vince said the club were considering following Hibernian in operating a cashless stadium and were hopeful of reaching fans despite being resigned to matches being played behind closed doors until the turn of the year. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a growing global fan-base that we want to do more for,\u201d he said. The EFL votes came after the 71 league clubs agreed to adopt the EFL board\u2019s framework, rejecting alternatives from Barnsley and Tranmere. Championship clubs agreed to relegate three teams if their season, due to resume on 20 June, is not completed. Amendments to the EFL board\u2019s framework put forward by Ipswich, Lincoln and Stevenage were rejected. The shadow sports minister, Alison McGovern, and shadow secretary of state, Jo Stevens, have called for an urgent meeting with the government and EFL. A letter to the secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport, Oliver Dowden, expressed grave concern at the \u201cacute\u201d challenges facing lower-league clubs. \u201cI fear a lot of clubs will go out of business now,\u201d Fry said. \u201cClubs cannot compete without any gate receipts\u2026 For us 20-35% of our income is gate receipts. And now we can\u2019t play in front of anybody for who knows how long.\u201d",

But our lives haven\u2019t been that for some time now. And the extent to which football actually does sustain us is a question plenty have been pondering these last few months. The pause in the AFL season has lasted long enough to perhaps have fundamentally changed the relationship between the game and its supporters, a bond the strength of which has always been a given. But maybe even that can no longer be taken for granted. And that could prove every bit as much of a challenge to the AFL as anything which lies ahead on the field for its 18 constituent clubs. Follow the build up to the season restart and the game between Richmond and Collingwood with the Guardian\u2019s liveblog from 3pm AEDT on Thursday.",

But Blair has not lost interest in the concept and, at an event today, he said that coronavirus made the case for digital ID more compelling than ever.</p> <p>As PA Media reports, Blair said that only if people can show easily whether they are clear of coronavirus will industries like international travel be able to restart. Speaking at the virtual CogX technology conference, Blair said that such a system would operate alongside track and trace programmes as the economy reopens. He explained:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You can create a digital ID today that is much more easily protected so you can deal with a lot of the privacy and surveillance issues that worry people.</p> <p>It is a natural evolution of the way that we are going to use technology in any event to transact daily life and this Covid crisis gives an additional reason for doing that.</p> <p>I think people\u2019s disease status - have they been tested, what is the result of that test and have they had the disease, do they have the disease - unless you are able to record some of this data in a way people can use, it is going to be difficult to go back to anything like a near normal in things like transport.</p> <p>If you are going to start international travel again, how can you do that unless people can be easily tested and have some record of that test?</p> <p>There has always been a good case for introducing some form of digital ID but I think that case is even more powerful today.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1dbdf7433424286c8cd5311005866baf8ee3750f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1dbdf7433424286c8cd5311005866baf8ee3750f/0_184_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Blair.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Blair.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-09T15:32:15.682Z\">at 4.32pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5edfa64b8f08758335228acd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-09T15:13:08.701Z\">4.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>At the press conference to launch the report on the test and trace system from the Independent Sage pressure group (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jun/09/uk-coronavirus-live-covid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5edf5a458f08bd75dbb64ce1#block-5edf5a458f08bd75dbb64ce1\">11.25am)</a>, its chair, <strong>Sir David King</strong>, a former government chief scientific adviser, suggested there had been a \u201closs of moral authority\u201d on the test and trace issue.

Independent Sage is <a href=\"https://www.independentsage.org/who-is-on-the-independent-sage/\">a group of 12 senior scientists (mostly professors)</a>, set up to shadow the official Sage, the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. They have already published <a href=\"https://www.independentsage.org/\">other reports critical of the government\u2019s coronavirus policy</a>, although today\u2019s is probably the harshest. Ministers have until now largely ignored them, treating them as minority voices in the science community. But it is hard to dismiss them as not credible. Independent Sage is chaired by <strong>Sir David King</strong>, who was the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser (ie, one of Sir Patrick Vallance\u2019s predecessors) between 2000 and 2007.</p> <p>The report should be on <a href=\"https://www.independentsage.org/\">the Independent Sage website </a>shortly. But here\u2019s an extract from its news release.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The new report from the Independent Sage ... says the virus will only be contained if 80% of contacts of infected people are traced. It describes this as \u2018impossible\u2019 under the current system and says a radical restructuring is necessary with responsibility handed over to local public health directors.</p> <p>The report expresses particular concern that the erosion of trust in government in recent weeks is likely to have a major effect on compliance and that no attempt has so far been made to engage with local communities. BAME communities, in particular, it says have suffered \u2018a disproportionate loss of trust\u2019.</p> <p>Currently, the government is using a centralised system of \u2018test, track and trace\u2019 led by Baroness Dido Harding with private contractors providing 25,000 contact tracers. The report notes that New Zealand has shown that eliminating the virus is possible but that containing it depends on tracing at least 80% of contacts who then must remain isolated for 14 days. \u2018This is clearly not happening,\u2019 the report says and urges the government to adopt an existing approach used by public health authorities, \u2018Find, Test, Trace, Isolate and Support\u2019 (FTTIS).</p> <p>Individuals must be supported, the report says, financially and in other ways as surveys from late May have shown that compliance with government guidelines decreased. Noting a \u2018background of decreasing confidence in the government\u2019s management of the pandemic,\u2019 it says that incentives must be introduced as currently people are reporting leaving home when they have symptoms.</p> </blockquote> <p>The report makes five recommendations. They are:</p> <p><strong>1. Local directors of public health (who work for councils) should take the lead in test and trace, the report says.</strong> A local approach would be \u201cmost effective\u201d it says.</p> <p><strong>2. There should be effective community engagement to build trust in the scheme, the report says.</strong></p> <p><strong>3. Test and trace data should be embedded within NHS and council data, the report says.</strong></p> <p><strong>4. Material support, including food and money, should be available for people asked to isolate, the report says. It is this is \u201ccritical\u201d if FTTIS is going to work.</strong></p> <p><strong>5. Key performance data should be published weekly, the report says.</strong></p> <p>Commenting on his report, King said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>The government has placed huge emphasis on their test, track and trace system in recent weeks, even labelling it \u2018world beating\u2019. It is clear from our research that this simply isn\u2019t the case, indeed the system as it stands is not fit for purpose. This is the critical moment for the government to act now or risk further spikes. We believe that a new approach is required, one that moves away from a centralised system that utilises a local first approach. We are calling on the government to urgently rethink their course to ensure that we have a system in place that will help and not hinder the country\u2019s recovery.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Later today Independent Sage is holding a public consultation, followed by a press conference at 1.45pm.</p> <p><em>UPDATE: </em>The Independent Sage criticisms largely relate to how test and trace operates in England.

Geoff Barton, its general secretary, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The \u2018ambition\u2019 to bring back all primary year groups for a month before the end of the summer term was a case of the government over-promising something that wasn\u2019t deliverable.

The government expects children to be able to return to early years settings, and for reception, year 1 and year 6 to be back in school in smaller sizes, from this point. This aims to ensure that the youngest children, and those preparing for the transition to secondary school, have maximum time with their teachers. Secondary schools and further education colleges should also prepare to begin some face to face contact with year 10 and 12 pupils who have key exams next year, in support of their continued remote, home learning. The government\u2019s ambition is for all primary school children to return to school before the summer for a month if feasible, though this will be kept under review. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong><br></strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5edf512a8f0883ec2fc1daa5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sallyweale\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-09T09:07:22.399Z\">10.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The National Education Union has called for a national recovery plan for education</strong>, similar to the jobs recovery plan, warning that the consequences of the pandemic would affect schools for months to come.</p> <p>Dr Mary Bousted, NEU joint general secretary, said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It has taken the government some time to recognise what was obvious to most.

But even that date cannot, as Matt Hancock has recognised, be taken for granted. What is needed, now, is a national plan for education, along the lines being developed by the Scottish government.</p> <p>This should cover all possible scenarios and focus on blended learning, at home and at school; greatly increased support for disadvantaged children, including free internet access so that they can access online teaching and learning, and the requisitioning of local public spaces, such as community centres and libraries, so that pressure on school space is lessened and more children are able to return to school in safe environments.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5edf4d008f083999a26dce55\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-09T09:02:18.422Z\">10.02am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK excess deaths associated with coronavirus have now reached around 64,000, says ONS</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Nick Stripe</strong>, head of the health analysis and life events division at the ONS, has posted a useful Twitter thread on today\u2019s death figures.

      "bodyText": "Alok Sharma, the business secretary, has confirmed that non-essential shops in England can open from Monday, saying the move will \u201callow high streets up and down the country to spring back to life\u201d. Hundreds more deaths from Covid-19 in the north-west of England and in care homes have driven up the number of excess fatalities since the UK went into lockdown to more than 63,000, a toll believed to be greater than anywhere else except the US. Only one in four children returned to schools in England last week, wrecking Boris Johnson\u2019s ambitions for a phased reopening of schools to allow parents back to work to boost the economy. The Department for Education released the figures as Gavin Williamson, the education secretary for England, confirmed that primary schools will not have to take any more pupils before the end of the summer term. Williamson also told MPs that it would take a year or more to repair the damage done to pupils\u2019 education by the time spent in lockdown. (See 2.30pm.) Ministers need to rebuild public trust in their handling of the coronavirus outbreak and compensate people for lost earnings when asked to self-isolate to prevent a resurgence of the epidemic, leading scientists have warned. The UK government\u2019s testing and contact-tracing system is not fit for purpose and will not be able to keep coronavirus in check as other countries have done, according to an independent group of scientists. That\u2019s all from us for tonight. But the coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. This is from Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, on the announcement that non-essential shops in England can open next Monday. She said: Retailers who are not yet open have been working hard to install perspex screens, hygiene systems and apply social distancing measures. We hope the public will take the opportunity from next week to go out and support millions of stores up and down the country. Nonetheless, the challenge for these stores is not over. Many firms will continue to struggle as the 2-metre rule will limit sales while retailers continue to face the same rent and other fixed costs. If the government is to limit retailers in this way, it must be prepared to provide an ongoing package of support to address the economic difficulties they will face. Perhaps it\u2019s a good thing that schools are not reopening fully before the summer holidays. According to some new research from academics at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and elsewhere, \u201cif schools reopen fully or in phases in June or July without a large-scale and effective [test-and-trace] strategy, a second wave would be around 2.2-2.5 times larger than the first Covid-19 wave in the UK.\u201d The paper defines an effective test-and-trace strategy as one in which at least 50% of those with symptomatic infections are tested, and at least 40% of their contacts are traced. The government has not published any data yet on its new test-and-trace system, and so it is impossible to know whether or not it is working well enough to meet the LSHTM benchmark for efficiency. Q: Are local R rates being calculated? Will they be published, and could they lead to local lockdowns? Sharma says the government will take action to address local flare-ups. That has happened in Weston-super-Mare, he says. And that\u2019s it. The press conference is over. Q: Will the national security and investment bill address concerns about China\u2019s involvement in UK infrastructure? Sharma says the government is committed to the bill. But he won\u2019t say any more about what may or may not be in it. Q: Prof Chris Whitty said last week the 2-metre rule would stay for the whole of the pandemic. Was he right? Sharma says it will be kept under review. Q: What factors will be taken into account before a decision to change it? Sharma says government will look at factors like the infection rate. Albon says science clearly shows that, at 2 metres, the risk of an infection is significantly lower than at 1 metre. So the prevalence of the illness becomes relevant, she says. Sharma says factors like being side by side, not face to face, can help. Q: Thousands of people submitted material to the BAME coronavirus review that was not published (relating to structural racism). Why was that not published? Sharma says the report was published. He summarises what it said. Q: But the communities engagement bit was missing. Sharma says the report was published. Q: You promised a review of the 2-metre rule ahead of the reopening of shops on 15 June. Has it been reviewed and will it be reduced? Sharma repeats the point about this being under review. He says he understands why business wants it reduced. But the government will only change it when it is safe to do so. Q: It is estimated that sticking with 2 metres could cost 1m jobs. Are you resigned to losing those jobs? Sharma again says this is being kept under review. Q: The PM promised a review by 15 June. Where is it? Like a stuck record, Sharma is back to saying this is being kept under review. Q: So when will the review be published? Sharma says the rule will only be changed when it is safe to do so. Q: Are you arguing to replace the 2-metre rule with a 1-metre rule? Sharma says the 2-metre rule remains in place. But it is kept under review. Some countries use one metre. But they are further down the recovery. Q: When might it be changed? Sharma says he cannot say. He says it is vital not to sacrifice the gains made so far. Another member of the public asks if the government will submit to supporting new innovative start-ups. Sharma says the Treasury has announced a scheme already. More measures are planned. Alison from London asks the first question. When can people book UK holidays and stay overnight? Sharma says he understands why people want to know the answer. But the economy is being opened in a phased manner. He sums up what has been announced already, but does not address Alison\u2019s question. Sharma says that after the crisis the government wants to rebuild an economy that is greener, fairer and more dynamic. He will chair five roundtables looking at this project. They will feed into government policy making. Sharma says his department has provided guidance that will allow shops to open safely. If they can follow the Covid-19 secure guidelines, shops will be allowed to open. But they will have to complete a coronavirus risk assessment. They should display a notice saying they have done this. If shops open without taking these measures, they could be subject to enforcement notices. Some places will still have to remain closed, he says, and pubs, restaurants, barbers and hairdressers will get further guidance on when they can open in due course. Sharma says the government is opening parts of the economy in a careful manner. He says the government is still meeting its five tests, and the reproduction number, R, is below 1. So, he says, he can confirm that non-essential shops will be allowed to open from Monday 15 June. (He is talking about England, although he does not say so.) Sharma is now going through the daily slides. Here is the slide with the death figures. In fact, Sharma is here with an expert. I was misled. He is here with Sarah Albon, the chief executive of the Health and Safety Executive. Alok Sharma, the business secretary, is taking the UK government\u2019s daily press conference. It will be starting shortly. He will be appearing on his own. (No 10 has in recent days stopped putting up scientists to appear alongside the ministers at this event. No 10 claims this is not because they have been banned for good. See 1.20pm. But the move has coincided with government policy increasingly diverging from the scientific advice. For example, Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, has refused to publicly back the quarantine policy, and Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical adviser, has refused to agree to lower the coronavirus threat level - which was supposed to be a precondition for lockdown measures being eased. Ministers are easing them anyway.) According to BBC News, today marks the days when pubs in the UK have been shut for more days this year than they have been open. The UK has recorded an extra 286 coronavirus deaths today. (See 4.38pm.) For the record, here are the equivalent figures for the last two weeks for comparison. Tuesday 26 May - 134 Wednesday 27 May - 412 Thursday 28 May - 377 Friday 29 May - 324 Saturday 30 May - 215 Sunday 31 May - 113 Monday 1 June - 111 Tuesday 2 June - 324 Wednesday 3 June - 359 Thursday 4 June - 176 Friday 5 June - 357 Saturday 6 June - 204 Sunday 7 June - 77 Monday 8 June - 55 Here are the latest UK coronavirus death figures. A further 286 people are recorded as having died, taking the total to 40,883. These numbers record the deaths of people who have tested positive for coronavirus. The real number of coronavirus deaths will be higher. That\u2019s because these figures do not include cases where there was no positive test but where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate (included in the ONS figures), and cases where coronavirus was to blame but doctors did not realise. When Tony Blair was prime minister his government legislated to introduce an identity card scheme. The plan was hugely controversial, by the time the law got passed the scheme had been watered down and was to a large extent voluntary, and later it was enthusiastically repealed by David Cameron\u2019s coalition government. But Blair has not lost interest in the concept and, at an event today, he said that coronavirus made the case for digital ID more compelling than ever. As PA Media reports, Blair said that only if people can show easily whether they are clear of coronavirus will industries like international travel be able to restart. Speaking at the virtual CogX technology conference, Blair said that such a system would operate alongside track and trace programmes as the economy reopens. He explained: You can create a digital ID today that is much more easily protected so you can deal with a lot of the privacy and surveillance issues that worry people. It is a natural evolution of the way that we are going to use technology in any event to transact daily life and this Covid crisis gives an additional reason for doing that. I think people\u2019s disease status - have they been tested, what is the result of that test and have they had the disease, do they have the disease - unless you are able to record some of this data in a way people can use, it is going to be difficult to go back to anything like a near normal in things like transport. If you are going to start international travel again, how can you do that unless people can be easily tested and have some record of that test? There has always been a good case for introducing some form of digital ID but I think that case is even more powerful today. At the press conference to launch the report on the test and trace system from the Independent Sage pressure group (see 11.25am), its chair, Sir David King, a former government chief scientific adviser, suggested there had been a \u201closs of moral authority\u201d on the test and trace issue. He said: What is really needed now is to renew the system and this means admitting that this system is not functioning. Every single day that passes with a dysfunctional system means longer before we recover from this pandemic and get back to economic stability ... I think we actually need the leaders in the country to regain moral authority by saying \u2018yes, we agree, this is not functioning and we need to go back and use the local systems that we\u2019ve been talking about\u2019. The Conservative party received the highest amount of donations in the first quarter of the year compared to other major UK political parties, according to the Electoral Commission. As PA Media reports, the 17 political parties registered in Great Britain and Northern Ireland reported accepting a total of \u00a311.79m during the year\u2019s first quarter, up from \u00a39.16m during the same period in 2019. The Tories reported receiving \u00a34.04m, a mix of donations and public funds, between 1 January 1 and 31 March 2020. Labour declared that it received \u00a33.88m, the Liberal Democrats \u00a31.27m and the Scottish National Party \u00a3418,305. Here is a comment from Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, chair of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at the University of Cambridge, on the implications of the latest death figures from the ONS. Conclusion: Covid-19 deaths have represented a temporary 50% increased risk of death in the over 45s, considerably less in younger age groups, and had an extremely small impact on school children. The full statement from Spiegelhalter is here, on the Science Media Centre website. The number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 among prisons in England and Wales continues to rise, Ministry of Justice figures shows. As at 5pm on Monday, 486 prisoners had tested positive for the coronavirus across 80 prisons, a rise of less than 0.5% in 24 hours, while there were 956 infected staff across 105 prisons, another rise of less than 0.5% in the same period. There are around 79,800 prisoners across 117 prisons in England and Wales, and around 33,000 staff working in public sector prisons. The population was last below 80,000 in January 2008. At least 23 prisoners and nine staff are known to have died, as well as one prison escort driver and one NHS trust employee working in a secure training centre. Will the coronavirus pandemic and governments\u2019 reaction to it change society for the better? Research from the Co-operative party suggests the desire for change is there. The report, Owning the Future, suggests 10% of people felt wealth was shared fairly before the crisis but nearly two-thirds believe it should be a priority of the recovery. It found that 69% of people think that the coronavirus recovery should give communities more of a say in how businesses and the economy are run, rising to 73% in former \u201cred wall\u201d areas. The Co-operative party, which is allied to the Labour party and effectively operates within it (many MPs stand as joint Labour and Co-operative party candidates), is calling for: A new law to allow the workers in companies at risk of closure to buy out the business and run it as an employee-owned co-operative A Co-operative recovery development fund A scheme to write off coronavirus business interruption scheme loan repayments for firms that come under employee ownership A requirement for companies getting taxpayer bailout to end the use of tax havens New co-operative regional banks to rebalance the economy Labour\u2019s Jim McMahon, who chairs of the Co-operative party parliamentary group, said: Owning the Future builds on what we already know \u2013 that countries which embrace the co-operative model are fairer, more community-minded and more productive places to live and work. In planning for our recovery we must not repeat the mistakes which followed the financial crash and a lost decade of austerity which deepened inequality and left us weaker to deal with Covid-19. This report gives us a great opportunity to seize the renewed community spirit we saw emerge during lockdown, and build on its ideas to develop innovative solutions as we emerge from this crisis. The outlook for UK jobs is the gloomiest in almost three decades, according to the latest employment survey by recruitment firm ManpowerGroup. My colleague Joanna Partridge has the full story. Public Health Wales said a further nine people have died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths in Wales to 1,410. The latest Guardian Science Weekly podcast is out. Nicola Davis speaks to Prof John Drury about the psychology of physical distancing and why we like to be near those we feel emotionally close to. No new deaths with coronavirus have been reported in Northern Ireland for a third day. According to Department of Health figures, which refer mostly to deaths in hospital, the number who have died with coronavirus remains at 537. Only one in four children returned to schools in England last week, wrecking Boris Johnson\u2019s ambitions for a phased reopening of schools to allow parents back to work to boost the economy, my colleague Sally Weale reports. NHS England has announced a further 129 people have died in hospital after testing positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number in England to 27,618. The full details are here. Those who died included two people aged between 20-39, two aged 40-59, 38 aged 60-79 and 87 people aged 80 or above. Robert Halfon, the Tory chair of the Commons education committee, has welcomed what Gavin Williamson said about the catch-up support for pupils after the lockdown lasting well beyond the summer. (See 2.30pm.) In response to questions from MPs, Gavin Williamson, the education secretary for England, has repeatedly said that his department will be taking action to help compensate pupils for the lack of education that they have had this summer. He has not given many details, but he has stressed that this it will take a long time \u2013 more than a year \u2013 to repair the damage done. This is what he said to the Conservative MP Robert Halfon on this topic. We do need a long-term plan. That is what we are doing. We recognise that the learning loss is not something that is going to be corrected over a few weeks, but this is action that needs to be taken over a long period of time, and that is the approach we are taking. This is what Williamson said to Labour\u2019s Meg Hillier. And in terms of catch-up planning, this isn\u2019t about something that is just over a few weeks. This has got to be an approach over a full year and more. That is what we are putting in place. That is how we are going to be supporting children into the long term. And this is what he said to the Conservative MP Tim Loughton, who (like Halfon) asked about the possibility of running catch-up schemes over the summer holidays. Williamson said: This is certainly what we are looking at but we are looking at something much more wide and much more long-term because we don\u2019t believe that actually just purely looking at the summer period is enough in order to be able to assist children to get the catch-up that they truly need. Independent Sage has been posting some highlights from the press conference it held at lunchtime to publicise its report criticising the test and trace system on Twitter. (See 11.25am.) Here\u2019s one of their tweets. At her daily briefing Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, said that she \u201cdeeply regretted\u201d that restrictions on people who are shielding will not be eased until the end of July, but insisted that the current guidance is constantly being monitored and that some changes will be made in some cases by July 18, to let people leave their homes for exercise. Regarding pleas from the Scottish tourist industry to reduce the 2 metre rule, she said that she had not seen any evidence either coming to the Scottish or UK government to suggest that this distance should be reduced. Asked whether, under the new track and trace system, it would be made public if someone who had attended one of the Black Lives Matter protests had subsequently tested positive for coronavirus, interim chief medical officer Gregor Smith said that in such a scenario an incident team would be set up which would assess whether this was necessary. Sturgeon also announced that she was establishing an expert reference group on the impact of the virus on minority ethnic communities in Scotland. The Trades Union Council (TUC) is calling for an urgent rescue package for the childcare sector similar to that put in place in Germany and an extension to the furlough scheme for parents who can\u2019t access childcare. The TUC says more than 700 new mothers have replied to a survey saying they cannot return to work because of a lack of childcare, with lower income parents harder hit because they cannot call on grandparents to help. TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady said many working mothers currently on maternity leave faced being stranded without childcare or financial support. \u201cThat is not right,\u201d she said. She went on: Ministers must extend the cut off for the furlough scheme for mums who cannot find childcare. And they must ensure that a proper rescue plan is put in place for the childcare sector. If they don\u2019t, thousands of women will be locked out of the jobs market. Robert Halfon, the Conservative chair of the education committee, asks why it is so hard to reopen schools. What is being done to avoid a decade of educational poverty? And what will be done to ensure pupils get free school meals over the summer. Williamson says 100,000 laptops have already been distributed to the most vulnerable pupils. A further 75,000 pupils are being distributed to schools in the next few weeks. But he says Halfon is right to say a long-term plan is needed to address the \u201clearning loss\u201d. Williamson is responding to Long-Bailey. He says they both want what is best for pupils. But pupils need to go back, he says. If it were up to Long-Bailey, she would not bring pupils back until that was agreed by the National Education Union, he says. He says he will work with local authorities. Where they have concerns about opening schools, the government will ensure they get the best advice, he says. If the government subsequently has to close schools in small clusters, it will do so, he says. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow education secretary, says she is glad the government has followed Labour\u2019s advice and abandoned plans to get all primary school pupils back before the summer holidays. But she is dismayed by how this has been handled, she says. And she says she is concerned about the damage being done to children by miissed education. The government should be setting up summer schools to help pupils catch up, she says. And she calls for a national plan for education. She says Williamson has met with the relevant groups. But that is not the same as involving them in a national plan. She says all pupils should get a one-on-one meeting with a teacher before the summer. And she says the decision not to run the free school meal voucher scheme over the summer is \u201cdeeply callous\u201d. Williamson says the government has published detailed guidance on the protective measures schools need to take. The safety of young people and staff is his top priority, he says. They will qualify for testing. The government continues to follow \u201cthe best scientific advice\u201d, he says. He says he accepts all primary children cannot return before the summer, We will not be able to welcome all primary school children back for a full month before summer ... but we would like to see schools who have capacity to bring back more children in smaller class sizes [do so if they are able before the summer holidays]. The government will work with schools on what happens next, he says. He goes on: We will be working to bring all children back to school in September. He also says exams will take place next year. Williamson says it is not more than two and a half months since schools were closed for most pupils. He says it is vital pupils get back to school as soon as possible. And he says he was very pleased some pupils were able to go back in England last week. He says 97% of schools that submitted data were open last week. And he says 50% of schools were taking pupils in the year groups proposed by the government (see 1.35pm), rising to 70% yesterday. Last week we saw the number of primaries taking nursery, reception and year one or year six pupils steadily rise as part of a phased, cautious, wider reopening of schools. By the end of the week more than half of primary schools were taking pupils from these year groups and as of yesterday that had risen to over 70% of primaries that had responded. He says he knows some schools are worried that the local reproduction number, R, is above 1. But nationally it is below 1, he says. And if there are local problems, the government will address them, he says. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary for England, is about to make his statement to MPs confirming that not all primary school pupils will be able to return to the classroom before the end of summer. And here is a fuller quote from the Department for Education statistical bulletin (pdf) out today saying that only around half of primary schools in England re-opened last week in accordance with government plans for pupils in reception, year 1 and year 6 to go back to class. (See 10.32am.) From 1 June, the government asked schools to welcome back children in nursery, reception and years 1 and 6, alongside children of critical workers and vulnerable children. Approximately 91% of settings were open in some capacity on 4 June, up from 80% on 21 May. Around half of settings (52%) that normally accept at least one of these year groups were estimated to be open to children in nursery, reception, year 1 or year 6 on 4 June. This is expected to increase during the week commencing 8 June - a number of schools who reported that they were closed to these year groups last week indicated that they expected to be open to at least one of them on 8 June. From the Times\u2019 George Grylls The DfE statistical bulletin is here (pdf). A new report by academic think tank UK in a Changing Europe warns of the implications of going into 2021 without a Brexit deal on trade and future relationship issues. Crashing out would strain future relations with the EU and, according to law professor Catherine Barnard, present \u201csignificant legal trouble\u201d. While some believe that Boris Johnson is minded to bury the economic and business pain of no deal in the Covid crisis, Jonathan Portes, one of the authors, says he did not think the economic shock of the pandemic would \u201cprovide much of a smokescreen, as it were for the economic impacts of what happens in January\u201d. He said: Covid-19 pandemic and Brexit are major shocks for the UK economy. The interaction of the two is complex and unpredictable, with the potential to amplify some impacts while moderating others. On balance, the pandemic probably does make the economic risks of exiting transition on January 2021 without a trade deal larger, but considerable uncertainties remain. Senior fellow Jill Rutter said the politics of crashing out at the end of the year without the trade deal promised \u201care a bit underplayed at the moment\u201d with a price expected to be exacted by Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour if a deal does not emerge in the autumn. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary for England, is due to address MPs shortly to confirm that not all primary school pupils will be able to return to the classroom before the end of summer. This is from Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, on the consequences of this. And here are some further lines from the Downing Street lobby briefing. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman hinted that Alok Sharma, the business secretary, will make an announcement to confirm the reopening of non-essential shops in England next week at the press conference at 5pm this afternoon. The spokesman said that getting all primary school pupils to return to school before the summer holidays had always just been an ambition. The policy was always being kept under review, he says. (That\u2019s true; the passage on primary schools in the coronavirus recovery plan specifically described the policy as an ambition that was being kept under review. See 10.32am.) The spokesman said it was wrong to say that scientists were no longer appearing at the daily government press conference. He was responding to a question pointing out that in recent days scientists have not been there. The spokesman refused to confirm the claim that the travel industry has been privately assured that air corridors will be in place from 29 June. (See 10.41am.) He just confirmed that talks about this were ongoing. The cabinet did not participate in the one minute\u2019s silence for George Floyd, the spokesman indicated. He said that at that point they were discussing the anger his death had generated around the world. The Downing Street lobby briefing has finished. And it was striking that Boris Johnson used cabinet this morning to reset his response to the Black Lives Matter protests, reinforcing the message he conveyed in a video message last night. In a tweet on Sunday night, after BLM protesters tore down the Edward Colston statue in Bristol and a minority of BLM protesters in London got involved in clashes with the police, Johnson posted this on Twitter. Since then No 10 has recalibrated its response, and the prime minister\u2019s spokesman gave this account of what was said in cabinet this morning. The spokesman said: The PM began cabinet by discussing the anger and the grief felt not just in the US but around the world following the death of George Floyd. He said those who lead and govern simply cannot ignore the depth of emotion that has been triggered. He said there was an undeniable feeling of injustice and that people from black and minority ethnic groups do face discrimination, in education, in employment and in the application of criminal law. He said we are a much, much less racist society than we were, but we must also frankly acknowledge that there is so much more to do in eradicating prejudice and creating opportunity. Cabinet reiterated its commitment to that effort. The PM said his message to all those who protested lawfully was \u2018I hear you and I understand\u2019. However, he said this cause is not an acceptable [reason] for violence or [relaxing the rules] regarding to social distancing. He said those who attack public property or the police are undermining the cause they claim to represent and will face the full force of the law. This also suggests that No 10 has now crafted what it views as a better response to the question \u2018Is Britain racist?\u2019 Matt Hancock, the health secretary, was asked this on Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday at the weekend and he said that it wasn\u2019t, although he said there was still injustice that needed to be tackled. At the No 10 lobby briefing yesterday, in response to the same question, the spokesman said that Johnson did not think the UK was a racist country. Now the line is that the UK is \u201cmuch, much less racist\u201d than it was. At today\u2019s briefing the spokesman was also asked if Johnson felt that any of his various racially offensive comments in the past had contributed to the UK\u2019s problems in this regard. The spokesman refused to engage, just saying that Johnson had addressed these questions during the election campaign. The Welsh government is recommending that people in Wales wear three-layer face coverings in situations where social distancing is not possible. Health minister Vaughan Gething said the government was following updated advice from the World Health Organisation (WHO). Gething said it would not be mandatory to wear such face coverings and it would not be enforced. He said the evidence remains clear that maintaining a two-metre distance and good hand hygiene was the most effective way to protect against Covid-19. He stressed the advice only applied to people who are not showing symptoms of coronavirus. People who are symptomatic must self-isolate for seven days and get a test. Gething said: To be crystal clear, wearing a face covering does not replace the need for social distancing or washing your hands regularly. Further scientific evidence is needed on the benefits to the wider public of wearing face coverings, but observational findings so far suggest that homemade or purchased three-layer face-coverings might reduce transmission from one person to another if made, worn, handled and disposed of properly. Therefore, on balance, we are recommending to the people of Wales that three-layer face-coverings should be used in situations where social distancing measures can be more difficult to achieve, for example, on public transport. We are not recommending their use outdoors. A total of 2,422 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus, up by seven from 2,415 on Monday, the Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon said at her daily briefing. This is the first rise in deaths in Scotland since Saturday. Sturgeon said said 15,653 people have tested positive for the virus in Scotland, up by 14 from 15,639 the day before. There are 1,011 people in hospital with confirmed or suspected Covid-19, a decrease of 31. Of these patients, 21 were in intensive care, a decrease of three. Sturgeon said that the new death figures were \u201cnot what we would have wanted to have but it\u2019s important to stress they are not a surprise. We know that there is a weekend lag ...and today\u2019s figures are still further evidence of a downward trend in the number of people losing their lives to this virus.\u201d Devi Sridhar, professor of global public health at Edinburgh University, has posted a useful thread on Twitter about why scientists are divided on the prospects of a second wave of infections. It starts here. The government will not succumb to EU demands to access British fishing waters, the former environment secretary Theresa Villiers has said. \u201cWe are not going to see the compromises coming from Boris\u2019s government,\u201d she said arguing that the current common fisheries policy (CFP) is \u201cgrossly unfair\u201d. Her comments come just days after Brexit talks over a future trade deal hit the buffers with four major areas of disagreement including access to British seas for EU boats. \u201cI just don\u2019t see that the UK government is going to just shift in any substantive way from what is put on the table already,\u201d Villiers told an Institute for Government webinar this morning. She went on: Also there are important matters in relation to the union, we are intensely conscious of how crucial fisheries are to the Scottish economy, to the communities and we feel very strongly that we need to defend those interests as well. So, for all sorts of reasons I, I think that we are not going to see the compromises coming from Boris\u2019s government. provide these coming from our system. Plans for wider reopening of schools may be in disarray, but the government has announced that a new study is being launched to monitor the prevalence of Covid-19 among pupils and teachers in schools in England. Parents and guardians will be asked to provide consent for pupils in pre-school, primary and secondary school to be swab tested, together with their teachers, as part of a surveillance study to increase understanding of the rates of transmission within schools. Public Health England plans to collect data from up to 100 schools across England, targeting 200 staff and children in each school. Participation is voluntary and results will be available over the summer, with plans for a second phase in September. Researchers will test to see who has the virus at the schools selected and a small proportion of those schools will also be offered antibody tests which will require blood tests to see who has already had the virus. Health secretary Matt Hancock said: This study will help us better understand how common asymptomatic and mild cases of COVID-19 are so that we can support parents, pupils and teachers and support staff, and inform our ongoing response to this new virus. Dr Shamez Ladhani, paediatric infectious diseases consultant at Public Health England, added: The results of this study will play an important role in informing wider surveillance planned for educational settings in the autumn term. Through active surveillance, contact tracing and the close monitoring of any clusters of cases, we are committed to ensuring the safety of students and staff returning to school in the coming weeks and months. We\u2019ve published a lovely picture essay today by the photojournalist Jonny Weeks about patients recovering from coronavirus. Do take a look. The government\u2019s test and trace system is \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d, the so-called Independent Sage is saying this morning. Independent Sage is a group of 12 senior scientists (mostly professors), set up to shadow the official Sage, the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. They have already published other reports critical of the government\u2019s coronavirus policy, although today\u2019s is probably the harshest. Ministers have until now largely ignored them, treating them as minority voices in the science community. But it is hard to dismiss them as not credible. Independent Sage is chaired by Sir David King, who was the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser (ie, one of Sir Patrick Vallance\u2019s predecessors) between 2000 and 2007. The report should be on the Independent Sage website shortly. But here\u2019s an extract from its news release. The new report from the Independent Sage ... says the virus will only be contained if 80% of contacts of infected people are traced. It describes this as \u2018impossible\u2019 under the current system and says a radical restructuring is necessary with responsibility handed over to local public health directors. The report expresses particular concern that the erosion of trust in government in recent weeks is likely to have a major effect on compliance and that no attempt has so far been made to engage with local communities. BAME communities, in particular, it says have suffered \u2018a disproportionate loss of trust\u2019. Currently, the government is using a centralised system of \u2018test, track and trace\u2019 led by Baroness Dido Harding with private contractors providing 25,000 contact tracers. The report notes that New Zealand has shown that eliminating the virus is possible but that containing it depends on tracing at least 80% of contacts who then must remain isolated for 14 days. \u2018This is clearly not happening,\u2019 the report says and urges the government to adopt an existing approach used by public health authorities, \u2018Find, Test, Trace, Isolate and Support\u2019 (FTTIS). Individuals must be supported, the report says, financially and in other ways as surveys from late May have shown that compliance with government guidelines decreased. Noting a \u2018background of decreasing confidence in the government\u2019s management of the pandemic,\u2019 it says that incentives must be introduced as currently people are reporting leaving home when they have symptoms. The report makes five recommendations. They are: 1. Local directors of public health (who work for councils) should take the lead in test and trace, the report says. A local approach would be \u201cmost effective\u201d it says. 2. There should be effective community engagement to build trust in the scheme, the report says. 3. Test and trace data should be embedded within NHS and council data, the report says. 4. Material support, including food and money, should be available for people asked to isolate, the report says. It is this is \u201ccritical\u201d if FTTIS is going to work. 5. Key performance data should be published weekly, the report says. Commenting on his report, King said: The government has placed huge emphasis on their test, track and trace system in recent weeks, even labelling it \u2018world beating\u2019. It is clear from our research that this simply isn\u2019t the case, indeed the system as it stands is not fit for purpose. This is the critical moment for the government to act now or risk further spikes. We believe that a new approach is required, one that moves away from a centralised system that utilises a local first approach. We are calling on the government to urgently rethink their course to ensure that we have a system in place that will help and not hinder the country\u2019s recovery. Later today Independent Sage is holding a public consultation, followed by a press conference at 1.45pm. UPDATE: The Independent Sage criticisms largely relate to how test and trace operates in England. Sorry, I should have made that clear earlier. A group called the Quash Quarantine coalition, which says it represents more than 500 travel and hospitality firms opposed to the quarantine regulations that came into force yesterday, says it has received \u201cprivate assurances from senior government sources\u201d that travel corridors will be introduced from 29 June. Also known as \u201cair bridges\u201d, these would be bilateral agreements exempting certain countries from the quarantine rules. But the group wants the government to say this publicly (which would make people feel more confident about booking foreign holidays). Paul Charles, its spokesman, said: \u201cWe urge the government to signal to the travel industry publicly and urgently that this is the case, as well as amend FCO (Foreign and Commonwealth Office) advice on non-essential travel.\u201d Another teaching union, the Association of School and College Leaders, has welcomed the government\u2019s decision to ditch plans to bring all primary school pupils in England back before the end of the summer time. Geoff Barton, its general secretary, said: The \u2018ambition\u2019 to bring back all primary year groups for a month before the end of the summer term was a case of the government over-promising something that wasn\u2019t deliverable. It isn\u2019t possible to do that while maintaining small class sizes and social bubbles, so we aren\u2019t surprised that the policy has been jettisoned. The National Education Union (see 10.07am) and the NASUWT (see 9.02am) have said much the same thing. For reference, this is what the UK government said about reopening primary schools for all pupils in its coronavirus recovery plan (pdf) published last month. Schools should prepare to begin to open for more children from 1 June. The government expects children to be able to return to early years settings, and for reception, year 1 and year 6 to be back in school in smaller sizes, from this point. This aims to ensure that the youngest children, and those preparing for the transition to secondary school, have maximum time with their teachers. Secondary schools and further education colleges should also prepare to begin some face to face contact with year 10 and 12 pupils who have key exams next year, in support of their continued remote, home learning. The government\u2019s ambition is for all primary school children to return to school before the summer for a month if feasible, though this will be kept under review. The National Education Union has called for a national recovery plan for education, similar to the jobs recovery plan, warning that the consequences of the pandemic would affect schools for months to come. Dr Mary Bousted, NEU joint general secretary, said: It has taken the government some time to recognise what was obvious to most. The government\u2019s social distancing rules made it impossible for primary schools to admit all pupils before the summer holidays. Primary schools and secondary schools will not re-open to all pupils until September at the earliest. But even that date cannot, as Matt Hancock has recognised, be taken for granted. What is needed, now, is a national plan for education, along the lines being developed by the Scottish government. This should cover all possible scenarios and focus on blended learning, at home and at school; greatly increased support for disadvantaged children, including free internet access so that they can access online teaching and learning, and the requisitioning of local public spaces, such as community centres and libraries, so that pressure on school space is lessened and more children are able to return to school in safe environments. Nick Stripe, head of the health analysis and life events division at the ONS, has posted a useful Twitter thread on today\u2019s death figures. (\u201cLife events\u201d include dying.) He says the figure for excess deaths in the UK is now around 64,000. Excess deaths are beyond what you would expect, given the five-year average for this time of years. They include deaths directly attributed to coronavirus, deaths probably caused by coronavirus, even if this was not stated on the death certificate, and deaths caused as a wider consequence of the crisis (for example, as a result of people not getting life-saving medical treatment). Government scientists and ministers have repeatedly said that all-cause excess mortality is the best measure of the overall impact of the crisis. The Office for National Statistics has published its latest weekly death figures for England and Wales. They run to the final week of May, ending on Friday 29 May (or week 22, as ONS calls it). Here are the key points. The number of deaths at the end of May (in week 22) was down on the previous week, but still 20.2% higher than the five-year average for that week. That 20.2% amounts to 1,653 excess deaths. Overall there were 9,824 deaths in week 22, 2,464 fewer than in the previous week. 18.5% of deaths in week 22 were directly linked to coronavirus (ie, it was mentioned on the death certificate). There were 1,822 coronavirus deaths overall - the lowest figure in the past eight weeks. Care home deaths in week 22 were above the five-year average (by 819). But hospital deaths were below the five-year average (by 30). Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, joining the blog for the day. Here is the agenda showing what\u2019s coming up. 9.30am: The Office for National Statistics publishes its weekly death figures for England and Wales. 9.30am: The Resolution Foundation, the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Institute for Government give evidence to the Commons Treasury committee about coronavirus and the economy. 10am: Behavioural scientists including Sage member Prof David Halpern give evidence to the Lords science committee. Morning: Boris Johnson chairs cabinet. 12pm: Tony Blair, the former prime minister, speaks at a CogX leadership summit. 12.30pm: The Scottish and Welsh governments hold their daily coronavirus briefings. 12.30pm: Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, answers a Commons urgent questions on the Brexit talks. 1pm: Downing Street is expected to hold its daily lobby briefing. 1pm: The independent Sage group of scientists publishes an interim report on test and trace. After 1pm: Gavin Williamson, the education secretary for England, gives a Commons statement on the opening of schools. 5pm: The UK government holds its daily press conference. Teaching unions have welcomed the government\u2019s U-turn on wider reopening of primary schools, and called on ministers to address the concerns of teachers already struggling to maintain safe working practices in schools where provision has already been extended. Dr Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT teachers\u2019 union, said: It has been abundantly clear for some time that the announcement by the government of arbitrary dates for the wider reopening of schools was ill-considered, premature and unworkable. The government\u2019s rush to seek to reopen schools as part of wider efforts to restart the economy has been in the face of deep concerns and mounting evidence that this would contribute to a second wave of infections and deaths from the coronavirus. With the \u201cR\u201d Rate close to or above 1 in a number of areas of the country, decisions to reopen schools more widely could be extremely damaging to public health as well as to the health and safety of children and adults in schools. The overwhelming majority of teachers remain extremely worried that with schools opening to more children whilst safe social distancing and PPE continue to be major concerns, wider school reopening is simply not safe. In the absence of definitive guidance from the government, many schools have struggled to understand what they need to do in order to meet appropriate health and safety standards when they do reopen. The government must now accept that its plans for wider reopening of schools are no longer credible. The government must also make clear to schools that they should revisit their plans and take all appropriate steps to protect the welfare of staff and pupils even if that means pausing planned reopening or closing wider provision in the interests of safety and public health. Tory MP Robert Halfon has the UK is a \u201cstrange country\u201d for prioritising reopening pubs over ensuring children could continue their learning in school on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme this morning. The Commons education committee chairman said he was \u201csympathetic\u201d to children\u2019s commissioner Anne Longfield, who said the country should put the same effort it had into reopening pubs as thinking of ways to allow schools to operate safely. He said: I think we\u2019re a strange country in which we turn a blind eye to mass demonstrations all over in every city, we campaign for pubs and cafes to open and yet we say to open schools before September is too risky when all the evidence - from the World Health Organisation, from many other European countries, from the chief medical officer in the UK - suggests otherwise. We are potentially damaging children\u2019s life chances. Care minister Helen Whately won\u2019t be delighted that she\u2019s trending on Twitter, mainly because of this exchange during her interview with Kay Burley on Sky News this morning when she very quickly backtracked. On care home deaths, care minister says \u2018I can\u2019 [stick this on the scientists], and then immediately corrected herself. Burley remorseless this morning Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour\u2019s shadow education secretary, has said that a decision not to force the reopening of schools before summer would be \u201cwelcome\u201d. She said: For weeks headteachers, education unions, school staff and many parents have stated that the plans to open whole schools before the summer could compromise any safety measures a school had been able to implement with reduced pupil numbers. The government has completely failed to show leadership. They should have brought together all those who needed confidence in their plans, from education unions and local authorities through to parents\u2019 associations. The government must now give answers on what resources it will provide to adequately support home learning, from the provision of digital devices to all pupils who need one through to targeted online tuition. Minister for care Helen Whately said the Government is \u201cfollowing the scientific guidance on what is the safe thing to do and the right thing to do\u201d when it comes to getting children back to school. She told BBC Breakfast that getting children back to school is \u201cnot easy\u201d, adding: Asking children to social distance for instance is not a straightforward thing to do. Whately, who has two children in primary school, said the public will hear more later from education secretary Gavin Williamson \u201cabout the plans over the coming weeks\u201d. She said the government does not want to take risks that might increase the infection rate, but is also mindful of the disadvantages of children not being in school, adding that the aim is to \u201cget the balance right between those things\u201d. Whately said getting children back to school is \u201cnot something that is easily done\u201d, adding: We must of course be listening to the teachers and the head teachers who are having to do this in practice. Asked about social distancing at anti-racism protests she said it was \u201csuch a difficult question\u201d. Of course, it is a moment that will trigger people\u2019s reaction, and the right to protest is such an important, to peacefully protest, is such an important part of being in a democracy. The problem we face right now is it coincides with a pandemic. She said that now coronavirus is \u201con the retreat\u201d, she does not want to risk the infection rate going up. The problem is with protesting is it\u2019s very hard to do that in a socially distanced way, so what would be better is if people can find ways to protest that don\u2019t involve coming together in large numbers, just because we just don\u2019t want the pandemic to take off again. We want to keep it under control. Whately acknowledged that there is still discrimination in the UK and insisted \u201cwe must make it better\u201d. She said: I think our country is much better now than it was a few decades ago. But there is still discrimination, there is still injustice, we must tackle this. Right now, Kemi Badenoch, the equalities minister, is taking forwards work following the Public Health England report into the impact of Covid-19 on different ethnic minorities. So we need to get to the bottom of that and understand how we can tackle those risks. But no, as a whole society, this is absolutely discrimination, and injustice cannot be accepted and we must, we must make it better. So, ok, ok, ok, I know this is the UK liveblog but if you are missing hugs as much as I am, this piece from New Zealand is heartening. More on the holiday front (and who isn\u2019t wasting many hours fantasising about their dream holiday right now). The holiday rentals firm behind Hoseasons and Cottages.com has agreed to give customers refunds for cancelled trips due to the coronavirus crisis after a probe by the competition watchdog. PA reports: The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said Vacation Rentals had changed its policy after originally refusing to give money back to customers whose stays had been cancelled. Vacation Rentals has now given the CMA a formal commitment that it will give affected customers the option of a full refund. It was one of a number of firms reported to the CMA\u2019s Covid-19 taskforce, but other holiday companies are still refusing to offer refunds and the watchdog said its investigations into the sector are ongoing. If you\u2019re thinking of ditching your camping trip in France this summer and are considering a staycation instead, best get booking. According to travel firm Kuoni, many holidaymakers are planning staycations this year because they see foreign trips as \u201ctoo risky\u201d and want to splash out in 2021. The company reported a \u201cclear upturn\u201d in demand for holidays next year, with more than half of customers heading to the white sand beaches of the Maldives. Half! The company has also seen strong sales for Mauritius, Thailand, Spain and India. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office currently advises against non-essential overseas travel, while a 14-day quarantine policy for international arrivals came into force on Monday. Kuoni chief executive Derek Jones said: Whilst there is still so much uncertainty around plans to open borders, the 14-day quarantine and social distancing, people are telling us that they\u2019d rather plan ahead for next year and save to make the trip an extra special one, upgrading what they\u2019d normally do. UK campsites are experiencing a surge in bookings, while Auto Trader recently said interest in online adverts for caravans was up nearly a fifth compared with the same time last year. Children\u2019s commissioner Anne Longfield has this morning aid the government should look at what Wales is doing regarding schools. She told BBC Breakfast: First of all, when we look at Wales, they\u2019re running a very different model where actually children are coming into school for a third of the week before the summer, which I think is interesting and government should look at. And the other is that children will still need to learn during this period and there will need to be mitigation to compensate for the fact they\u2019re not in school through online learning but also potentially catch up and summer camps to help them emotionally. She said it is \u201cdeeply worrying\u201d that there is a possibility secondary schools may not open until beyond September. We\u2019ve seen the great things that can be achieved when everyone puts their mind to it - you know the job scheme, the business continuity scheme, the Nightingale hospitals. It\u2019s of this scale of challenge, and it\u2019s this level of determination that I think government now really needs to focus on. We\u2019re getting more reactions to the news that ministers look set to abandon plans for all primary school children to return to classrooms before the academic year is out. Ian Robinson, chief executive of the Oak Partnership Trust which runs three primary schools and a special school in Taunton, Somerset, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: I do welcome this announcement that is hopefully going to be made today. It demonstrates that the secretary of state and the Department for Education are listening to the profession - I believe they have listened to the profession and this is a really positive step forward. I think they are saying if you can extend your provision to other year groups then you can go ahead, but you still have to do it within the measures of control that are in place. And from my own trust\u2019s point of view, it is all about simple practicalities, it is not about whether you want children in schools or not. We simply don\u2019t have enough physical space for any more year groups and we don\u2019t have any more human resources for any more year groups. Pubs are -under current plans - set to reopen on July 4. But a group of cabinet ministers nicknamed the \u201cSave Summer Six\u201d are reportedly considering proposals to allow beer gardens in England to host drinkers from as early as 22 June, as part of an effort to avert 3.5m job losses in the struggling hospitality sector. But publicans, brewers and the pub industry trade body have urged the government to clarify \u201chalf-baked\u201d plans to reopen beer gardens, amid confusion over whether some will be permitted to serve drinks before the end of the month. They have said many would struggle to be ready in under three weeks and called for certainty about the government\u2019s timetable. Read the full story here: Welcome to the UK coronavirus liveblog, here is a quick update on our top stories this morning: Plans to push ahead with reopening schools in England are in disarray, after the government admitted that not all primary school pupils will be able to return to the classroom before the end of summer. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, is to give an update on the progress of schools reopening on Tuesday. In a further confirmation of the difficulties that teachers face, Matt Hancock hinted at Monday\u2019s Downing Street press briefing that even a full return in September may be difficult. Ministers are facing a high court legal challenge after they refused to order an urgent investigation into the shortages of personal protective equipment faced by NHS staff during the coronavirus pandemic. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said coronavirus is \u201cin retreat across the country\u201d as the number of recorded deaths among people testing positive for Covid-19 fell to the lowest daily level since before the lockdown was announced. A further 55 people died after contracting the virus in the UK, the lowest daily total reported since 22 March. Police will have a \u201climited\u201d role in enforcing coronavirus quarantine restrictions, with officers taking action against people who breach the rules only as a last resort, according to a briefing plan for police forces.

Boris Johnson\u2019s goal, however, was that all primary school children in England should be back in class for a month before the summer holiday.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, admitted that not all children would be able to return before the summer, with some having to wait until September. It is a serious blow for the the government\u2019s strategy to bring the country out of lockdown, but an even greater blow for children \u2013 particularly disadvantaged pupils \u2013 who are losing out on months of their education because of Covid-19 restrictions.</p> <h2><strong>Why did ministers change their minds?</strong></h2> <p>Headteachers and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/21/tuc-lack-planning-risks-chaotic-reopening-schools-england\">teaching unions</a> had been telling the government for weeks that the reopening plan was unworkable because of physical distancing requirements, space constraints and staff shortages. On Tuesday, the government had to admit they were right.</p> <p>The government\u2019s own guidance says schools should teach pupils in protective bubbles of no more than 15, half the normal class size, to limit risk of transmission of the virus. The maths is simple enough for a primary school child \u2013 if the usual classes of 30 are halved, a school will need double the number of classrooms and not even the most energetic and ingenious of headteachers can manage that.</p> <p>In addition, many parents are still not ready to send their children back to school. Just one in four of those pupils eligible to return last week did so, and only 52% of primary schools felt safe enough to open to more pupils, though those numbers are increasing significantly, according to the government.</p> <h2><strong>So what will happen now?</strong></h2> <p>Ministers are going to leave it to the experts. Williamson has said he would like schools that have the capacity to welcome back more children before the summer break, but headteachers will be given the flexibility to decide for themselves if and when to admit more pupils. Schools in England come in all shapes and sizes \u2013 some are old Victorian buildings with small classrooms and limited outdoor space, while others can be adapted more easily to cater for multiple groups of smaller classes.</p> <h2><strong>What about secondary school pupils?</strong></h2> <p>Secondary schools in England, like primary schools, will remain open to children of key workers and vulnerable pupils, and students preparing to take GCSEs and A-levels next summer will \u2013 ideally \u2013 get some face-to-face time with their teachers. Otherwise, most secondary school pupils will continue with online lessons until the end of term.</p> <h2><strong>Will all pupils be back in September?</strong></h2> <p>Williamson told MPs the government was \u201cworking to bring all children back to school in September\u201d. He also said exams would take place as normal next summer. Teachers are more circumspect and warn that if physical distancing is still required by the end of the summer, schools may have to offer a combination of online lessons and face-to-face teaching, limiting the number of pupils on site at any one time.</p> <h2><strong>What about in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland?</strong></h2> <p>Education is a devolved issue. Wales has waited to reopen its schools until 29 June, but will only allow a third of pupils on site at any school and only for a limited period. The summer term will be extended for a week to help pupils adapt, and the Welsh government has said some remote learning will continue next term.</p> <p>In Scotland, the majority of pupils <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/nicola-sturgeon-eases-coronavirus-lockdown-rules-in-scotland\">will not </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/nicola-sturgeon-eases-coronavirus-lockdown-rules-in-scotland\">return until 11 August</a>, after their summer holiday, and they will receive a blended model of in-school and at-home learning.

While they have been entitled to attend school throughout the closures, many have not and formal teaching has been suspended. There are fears the attainment gap will widen and disadvantaged children who have not been able to access online resources from home will fall further behind. There have been calls for summer camps, but planning appears to be at an early stage and the education secretary has acknowledged it will take more than a few weeks to help close the gap.</p>",

      "body": "<p>There are limits to how you can fiddle the science. Only yesterday Matt Hancock had come up with the brilliant idea that the reproduction rate \u2013 the R rate \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/08/hancock-plays-hide-and-seek-behind-an-ever-changing-science\">didn\u2019t much matter anyway</a> after it had stubbornly refused to drop from between 0.7 and 0.9. Today, though, Gavin Williamson had to bow to the inevitable. No matter how he looked at it 2 metres was never going to be less than 2 metres. Not even if, as Jacob Rees-Mogg had suggested, you try turning it into feet and inches.</p> <p>The education secretary had even pleaded with his scientific advisers, begging them to say that 2 metres were actually only 1 metre. Or at a push 1.5 metres. But after months of finding their work being corrupted by the government to suit its own ends, the scientists dug their heels in. The social-distancing requirement would still be set at 2 metres.</p> <p>On a few occasions in the past, Williamson has given flashes of the panache that won him fireplace salesman of the year in two consecutive years in 2006 and 2007, but today he was very much the bullied chemistry supply teacher as he had to explain to the Commons that he had badly miscalculated how quickly some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jun/09/plans-to-reopen-english-primary-schools-before-summer-in-disarray\">children would be returning to school</a>. His promise that all primary school children would get at least some time in school before the summer holidays had been an error.</p> <p>When Gavin had done the maths, he had been certain he could get at least 30 children into a classroom; but that was before he had learned that it wasn\u2019t practical to suspend at least half the class from the ceiling in order for all the children to maintain a safe social distance from each other. So now he was having to work on the basis of just 15 children at most in any one classroom at any given time, which meant that at least half the rest of the kids would have to stay at home. Which rather put the kibosh on the rest of the summer term for all those year groups not in the first wave of returnees. Not that all those who had been due to restart school the previous week had done so, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jun/09/school-reopening-plans-in-tatters-as-only-25-of-pupils-in-england-return\">but that was another story ...</a></p> <p>Let\u2019s deconstruct the extent of Gavin\u2019s idiocy a little further. Donald Rumsfeld struggled with both the known unknowns and the unknown unknowns. The education secretary failed to even get to grips with the known knowns. Williamson knew back in March that there was a coronavirus pandemic that had caused all schools to close. He knew that meant that all children would have to be home-schooled after a fashion and that the vulnerable and less well-off would be likely to fall behind their peers. Gavin also knew that at some point the lockdown measures would be eased gradually. The only thing he didn\u2019t know was that 2 metres could not be rounded down to 3ft. Which is the one thing that almost every primary school-aged kid did know.</p> <p>So how did the education secretary use the two-and-a-half months to prepare for schools reopening? By doing next to nothing. All Ga had to say for himself was that he would be following the science, he hoped more kids would get back to school once teachers had had more time to prepare and that with any luck all schools would be fully open again by September. Though nobody should bank on it.</p> <p>The shadow education secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, was almost lost for words in reply. Where to start? An <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/14/teachers-can-legally-refuse-to-return-over-risk-to-health-union-warns\">apology to the teaching unions</a> who the government had blamed last week for so many schools failing to open on time for the three years groups due back. Headteachers had been screaming about the difficulties of social distancing for weeks but no one had listened. Even parents had been more clued up than the department of education and had refused to allow their kids back until they were sure it was safe.</p> <p>But we were where we were, so Long-Bailey did try to offer some useful tips on what to do next. More localised support for children whose schools might be locked down again if the R rate went above 1 in their areas. A full programme of summer schools, free access to the internet, free school meals over the summer holidays. Anything to reduce the inevitable growth in inequality that six months and more of missed formal education would bring about.</p> <p>A few sycophantic stooges, such as Tory Danny Kruger, apart, MPs from all sides piled in. Just how had the education secretary let things get this bad? This wasn\u2019t just bad management, it was a national humiliation that would affect kids for years to come. Ga looked more crest-fallen than apologetic. The natural response of someone who still wasn\u2019t quite aware of just how awful things really were.</p> <p>There would be some kind of summer school but he probably wouldn\u2019t be able to say what exactly until the autumn. He wouldn\u2019t be offering free school meals because it would be good for kids to either lose weight or learn useful shoplifting skills. And exams would definitely be taking place next summer regardless of how much schooling anyone had got. The GCSE maths syllabus would include a question on what percentage of children could be expected to know stuff they hadn\u2019t been taught.</p> <p>But all was not lost, Gavin said desperately. He had already handed out 100,000 free laptops and was planning to dole out another 230,000 in the coming months by which time it would hopefully be too late for some kids to catch up on lessons they had missed. \u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d said Lib Dem Layla Moran. But the chair of the education select committee had already pointed out there were 700,000 children with no access to laptops. So by her reckoning that still left 370,000 kids education-free.</p> <p>Ga opened and closed his mouth, before saying nothing. Moran just shook her head. She was wasting her breath. Given that the education secretary can barely count to two, it was expecting far too much of him to cope with subtracting large numbers.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There are limits to how you can fiddle the science. Only yesterday Matt Hancock had come up with the brilliant idea that the reproduction rate \u2013 the R rate \u2013 didn\u2019t much matter anyway after it had stubbornly refused to drop from between 0.7 and 0.9. Today, though, Gavin Williamson had to bow to the inevitable. No matter how he looked at it 2 metres was never going to be less than 2 metres. Not even if, as Jacob Rees-Mogg had suggested, you try turning it into feet and inches. The education secretary had even pleaded with his scientific advisers, begging them to say that 2 metres were actually only 1 metre. Or at a push 1.5 metres. But after months of finding their work being corrupted by the government to suit its own ends, the scientists dug their heels in. The social-distancing requirement would still be set at 2 metres. On a few occasions in the past, Williamson has given flashes of the panache that won him fireplace salesman of the year in two consecutive years in 2006 and 2007, but today he was very much the bullied chemistry supply teacher as he had to explain to the Commons that he had badly miscalculated how quickly some children would be returning to school. His promise that all primary school children would get at least some time in school before the summer holidays had been an error. When Gavin had done the maths, he had been certain he could get at least 30 children into a classroom; but that was before he had learned that it wasn\u2019t practical to suspend at least half the class from the ceiling in order for all the children to maintain a safe social distance from each other. So now he was having to work on the basis of just 15 children at most in any one classroom at any given time, which meant that at least half the rest of the kids would have to stay at home. Which rather put the kibosh on the rest of the summer term for all those year groups not in the first wave of returnees. Not that all those who had been due to restart school the previous week had done so, but that was another story ... Let\u2019s deconstruct the extent of Gavin\u2019s idiocy a little further. Donald Rumsfeld struggled with both the known unknowns and the unknown unknowns. The education secretary failed to even get to grips with the known knowns. Williamson knew back in March that there was a coronavirus pandemic that had caused all schools to close. He knew that meant that all children would have to be home-schooled after a fashion and that the vulnerable and less well-off would be likely to fall behind their peers. Gavin also knew that at some point the lockdown measures would be eased gradually. The only thing he didn\u2019t know was that 2 metres could not be rounded down to 3ft. Which is the one thing that almost every primary school-aged kid did know. So how did the education secretary use the two-and-a-half months to prepare for schools reopening? By doing next to nothing. All Ga had to say for himself was that he would be following the science, he hoped more kids would get back to school once teachers had had more time to prepare and that with any luck all schools would be fully open again by September. Though nobody should bank on it. The shadow education secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, was almost lost for words in reply. Where to start? An apology to the teaching unions who the government had blamed last week for so many schools failing to open on time for the three years groups due back. Headteachers had been screaming about the difficulties of social distancing for weeks but no one had listened. Even parents had been more clued up than the department of education and had refused to allow their kids back until they were sure it was safe. But we were where we were, so Long-Bailey did try to offer some useful tips on what to do next. More localised support for children whose schools might be locked down again if the R rate went above 1 in their areas. A full programme of summer schools, free access to the internet, free school meals over the summer holidays. Anything to reduce the inevitable growth in inequality that six months and more of missed formal education would bring about. A few sycophantic stooges, such as Tory Danny Kruger, apart, MPs from all sides piled in. Just how had the education secretary let things get this bad? This wasn\u2019t just bad management, it was a national humiliation that would affect kids for years to come. Ga looked more crest-fallen than apologetic. The natural response of someone who still wasn\u2019t quite aware of just how awful things really were. There would be some kind of summer school but he probably wouldn\u2019t be able to say what exactly until the autumn. He wouldn\u2019t be offering free school meals because it would be good for kids to either lose weight or learn useful shoplifting skills. And exams would definitely be taking place next summer regardless of how much schooling anyone had got. The GCSE maths syllabus would include a question on what percentage of children could be expected to know stuff they hadn\u2019t been taught. But all was not lost, Gavin said desperately. He had already handed out 100,000 free laptops and was planning to dole out another 230,000 in the coming months by which time it would hopefully be too late for some kids to catch up on lessons they had missed. \u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d said Lib Dem Layla Moran. But the chair of the education select committee had already pointed out there were 700,000 children with no access to laptops. So by her reckoning that still left 370,000 kids education-free. Ga opened and closed his mouth, before saying nothing. Moran just shook her head. She was wasting her breath. Given that the education secretary can barely count to two, it was expecting far too much of him to cope with subtracting large numbers.",

      "bodyText": "Georgia voters immediately encountered hours-long lines and equipment malfunctions as they showed up to vote in person in the state\u2019s primary races on Tuesday. Today is the latest high-stakes test of whether a state can hold an election during the Covid-19 pandemic. Tuesday also marked the first time Georgia was using new voting equipment, and voters reported malfunctions on Tuesday morning. The Atlanta mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms, tweeted that at some precincts no machines were working. Voters snaked around the parking lot of the Lions Club community center in Cobb county, where many said around noon that they had been waiting in line for two to three hours. At least half of the voters appeared to be wearing masks, and some voters carried umbrellas to shield themselves from the sun. Chloe Mexile Benard, 33, said she had been waiting since 7.30am to vote. She reached the front of the line around noon, cheering as she was finally ushered in by a volunteer. She came to vote for the presidential primary, but also to choose the county commissioner and county sheriff, she said. Asked why she didn\u2019t vote with a mail-in ballot, Benard, whose T-shirt said \u201cDreams don\u2019t expire,\u201d said she doesn\u2019t trust them. \u201cI requested it. I received it, but I don\u2019t trust anybody,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t trust them to count it.\u201d Benard said there were just two voting machines at the station when she arrived. Then, \u201ctwo more appeared, magically,\u201d she said. Geraldine Aldridge, a polling manager at the site, said seven machines including one for handicapped voters, were working at noon. Amid the equipment failures, some voters in Atlanta were being told to vote on back-up provisional ballots, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. But at least one precinct told the paper that they did not have access to provisional ballots. The problems in Georgia add to mounting concerns over whether states are prepared to hold elections in November. Like many other states, Georgia encouraged voters to cast their ballot by mail, but was plagued by delays in getting voters ballots and still saw extremely long lines at the polls. Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Washington DC have all seen similar problems in their recent primaries. In Fulton county, Simone Alisa, 66, said she requested a mail-in ballot but never received one. Two voters in line next to her said they did not receive their ballots either. Alisa said she waited for close to three hours to cast her vote for the presidential primary, district attorney and state court judges. \u201cThis isn\u2019t normal,\u201d said Alisa, who says she has voted in Fulton county for the past 10 years. She said she has never waited for more than 30 minutes to cast her ballot. By November, Alisa hopes to see improvements. \u201cEither we receive our absentee ballot,\u201d she said. \u201cBy that time, I would think we can have more people facilitate the voting.\u201d On their way out of the Central Park Recreation Center, where the voting took place, Ashraf and Laurel Hussain, 37 and 48, said they had waited four and a half hours before entering the building. The pair said they were worried about the coronavirus after seeing that none of the touchscreens used to cast votes were sanitized by poll workers. The pair said they had requested mail-in ballots in late April, but never received them. \u201cWe wanted to avoid having to interact in the Covid situation, but unfortunately we were kind of forced to,\u201d Ashraf said. Like other voters, they said they were grateful for the volunteers (some of whom were candidates themselves) offering bottled water and snacks to those standing in line. \u201cFrom a local level, they\u2019re doing everything they can do. But it seems like they weren\u2019t necessarily given the tools to do what they needed to do,\u201d said Ashraf. Polling hours were extended until 9pm in Fulton county and until 8pm at several locations in Cobb county because of issues Tuesday, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Some polling places will also have extended hours in Gwinnett, Muscogee, and Chatham counties. Vice-President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign released a statement Tuesday afternoon calling the meltdown in Georgia \u201cunacceptable\u201d. \u201cFree and fair elections are the cornerstone of our democracy. What we see in Georgia today, from significant issues with voting machines to breakdowns in the delivery of ballots to voters who requested to vote absentee, are a threat to those values,\u201d Rachana Desai Martin, the campaign\u2019s voter protection director, said in a statement. Elections officials across the state consolidated polling locations as they faced poll worker shortages. More than 10% of polling locations throughout Georgia have been relocated because of the pandemic, forcing upwards of 10,000 voters to be reassigned to new locations. Georgia\u2019s presidential primary was originally supposed to take place in March, but has been twice delayed because of Covid-19. Brad Raffensperger, the state\u2019s top election official, encouraged people to vote by mail, and an unprecedented 1.5 million Georgians requested absentee ballots for the election. But some counties reported severe delays in processing the requests and some voters in the state reported never receiving the ballots they requested, forcing them to go to the polls to vote in person. The absentee ballot delays and polling consolidations created a toxic mix for voters, resulting in long lines. Some voters reported waiting upwards of four hours to vote on Friday in Atlanta, the final day of early voting there. Yolanda Pryor-Glenn, a 52-year old retiree, said she came to vote for the Cobb county superior court seat which is up for grabs. Pryor-Glenn said the long-lines and lack of resources deployed at the polling station seemed like \u201ca different version of suppression\u201d. \u201cWhy were there only four machines when you could have had 10?,\u201d she said. \u201cDo better, Georgia,\u201d Benard said. Raffensperger told the Washington Post many of the problems appeared to be focused in Fulton county, which includes Atlanta and its suburbs. And at least seven polling locations in the Atlanta metro area did not open on time, said Seth Bringman, a spokesman for Fair Fight Action, the voting rights group started by Stacey Abrams. Raffensperger\u2019s office blamed the delays on human error. \u201cSo far we have no reports of any actual equipment issues.

He said Segro was already in \u201cadvanced negotiations\u201d to spend about \u00a3600m on new warehouse projects this year. Segro\u2019s shares closed down 3% at 858.8p before the announcement on Tuesday. The shares have recovered to roughly the level seen before the crisis, having fallen as low as 660p in March.",

      "body": "<p>A patient is at serious risk of dying after his cancer went undetected when the suspension of many NHS services due to the coronavirus pandemic meant he had to wait months for a scan.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fighting for my life because I didn\u2019t have a scan. I should have had the scan months earlier, but didn\u2019t because normal NHS care was suspended because of the coronavirus. I started asking for one in early March but didn\u2019t finally get one until last week,\u201d Sherwin Hall told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m angry, frustrated and disappointed. And I\u2019m devastated that I might lose my life to cancer that could have been cured if they had done what they were supposed to do [more quickly].\u201d</p> <p>The scan revealed Hall had a tumour measuring 14cm in his pelvis and 30 small tumours in his lungs, which he believes developed during the time he could not get a scan. Doctors say the 27-year-old delivery driver\u2019s cancer is particularly aggressive and fast-growing.</p> <p>Patient safety campaigners, health charities and medical negligence lawyers warn that growing numbers of cases like Hall\u2019s are emerging, in which patients are at risk from life-threatening illnesses because they missed out on diagnostic tests or surgery while hospitals were concentrating on treating Covid-19 patients.</p> <p>Hall began seeking care at Leeds General Infirmary and the city\u2019s St James\u2019s hospital days before before the lockdown began on 23 March. But doctors diagnosed his pain as being caused by<a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/prostatitis/\"> a condition called prostatitis</a>, in which the prostate gland becomes inflamed.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t believe them. I did my own research and knew it was something else. I kept begging them in April and May to give me an MRI scan but I didn\u2019t have one until last week. Both my GP and my consultant told me that I couldn\u2019t get one because scanning services were slowed down because of the coronavirus,\u201d said Hall, whose case was highlighted on ITV News on Tuesday evening.</p> <p>His pain became excruciating and at one point was so debilitating that he considered taking his own life, he said. His chances of surviving cancer remain unclear.</p> <p>Hall has instructed Mary Smith, a lawyer at Novum Law solicitors, to investigate his care and the possibility of him suing the NHS.

      "bodyText": "A patient is at serious risk of dying after his cancer went undetected when the suspension of many NHS services due to the coronavirus pandemic meant he had to wait months for a scan. \u201cI\u2019m fighting for my life because I didn\u2019t have a scan. I should have had the scan months earlier, but didn\u2019t because normal NHS care was suspended because of the coronavirus. I started asking for one in early March but didn\u2019t finally get one until last week,\u201d Sherwin Hall told the Guardian. \u201cI\u2019m angry, frustrated and disappointed. And I\u2019m devastated that I might lose my life to cancer that could have been cured if they had done what they were supposed to do [more quickly].\u201d The scan revealed Hall had a tumour measuring 14cm in his pelvis and 30 small tumours in his lungs, which he believes developed during the time he could not get a scan. Doctors say the 27-year-old delivery driver\u2019s cancer is particularly aggressive and fast-growing. Patient safety campaigners, health charities and medical negligence lawyers warn that growing numbers of cases like Hall\u2019s are emerging, in which patients are at risk from life-threatening illnesses because they missed out on diagnostic tests or surgery while hospitals were concentrating on treating Covid-19 patients. Hall began seeking care at Leeds General Infirmary and the city\u2019s St James\u2019s hospital days before before the lockdown began on 23 March. But doctors diagnosed his pain as being caused by a condition called prostatitis, in which the prostate gland becomes inflamed. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe them. I did my own research and knew it was something else. I kept begging them in April and May to give me an MRI scan but I didn\u2019t have one until last week. Both my GP and my consultant told me that I couldn\u2019t get one because scanning services were slowed down because of the coronavirus,\u201d said Hall, whose case was highlighted on ITV News on Tuesday evening. His pain became excruciating and at one point was so debilitating that he considered taking his own life, he said. His chances of surviving cancer remain unclear. Hall has instructed Mary Smith, a lawyer at Novum Law solicitors, to investigate his care and the possibility of him suing the NHS. He is also trying to crowdfund the cost of seeking medical treatment in the US, and is finally starting chemotherapy later this week in Leeds. More patients are coming forward whose health has suffered because they could not access NHS care, said Smith. \u201cThis is a fairly widespread problem. The concern at the moment is that for non-Covid patients, the healthcare system in parts of the UK has entered a state of paralysis and this really cannot be allowed to continue because people are suffering harm. \u201cFor patients to be denied potentially life-saving diagnostics and treatment when hospitals are empty or running far below normal capacity, and so many doctors and other healthcare workers are able and willing to treat them, is a clear breach of the government\u2019s systemic duty under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights to have a properly functioning healthcare framework in place to protect patients\u2019 lives. It is indefensible.\u201d Peter Walsh, the chief executive of the patient safety charity Action against Medical Accidents, said Hall\u2019s case was not unique. \u201cSadly, there are many other patients with various potentially life-threatening conditions who have also been missing out, often with serious consequences.\u201d He said the NHS should use its mothballed Nightingale hospitals, and also private sector hospitals, to give the growing backlog of patients the tests and treatment they needed as a matter of urgency. \u201cNot to do so is running the risk of creating a second catastrophe affecting thousands of patients.\u201d Other cases emerging where the pandemic prevented treatment include: A woman in her 40s whose breast cancer spread into her blood and bones when her treatment was delayed. A woman suffering severe depression when she could not have surgery to fix a badly broken arm that had not healed properly. A young woman with severe dental problems who ended up with severe depression when she could not get treated. A spokesperson for NHS England said cancer services were quickly returning to normal. \u201cCoronavirus has turned millions of lives upside down. NHS staff have made huge efforts to ensure that patients continue to get treatment. Cancer services are largely now open, ready and able to receive all patients who need care. Anyone concerned about a possible cancer symptom should contact their GP practice and come forward for a check-up.\u201d Dr Phil Wood, the chief medical officer at Leeds teaching hospitals NHS trust, which runs the two hospitals where Hall sought help, said: \u201cWe are extremely sorry to hear about Mr Hall\u2019s circumstances, and we are looking into Mr Hall\u2019s case to understand the background. \u201cWe have maintained MRI scanning for all urgent interventions, clinically prioritising those patients who have been referred by a GP with a suspected cancer diagnosis, or those presenting in our emergency department where MRI was considered appropriate. All our urgent referral pathways have remained open during the pandemic. \u201cThroughout the Covid-19 outbreak we have continued to follow Nice guidelines by clinically triaging cases into high, intermediate and low risk of cancer.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The business secretary, Alok Sharma, has said the 2 metre distancing rule remains under review in England, despite the prime minister\u2019s hope that his scientific advisers would give the green light to relax it imminently. Boris Johnson has made clear that he is keen to ease the rule, as the government battles to prevent thousands of hospitality businesses collapsing in the coming months. No 10 is understood to have told senior figures in the sector that the idea of reducing physical distancing to 1 metre would be discussed at Tuesday\u2019s cabinet meeting. Cabinet also received an update on the virus from chief medical officer Chris Whitty and the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance. It came as Sharma confirmed that non-essential shops could open from Monday, saying the move would \u201callow high streets up and down the country to spring back to life\u201d. Last week, Johnson was alarmed by warnings that more than 3 million jobs could be lost if the guidelines remained unchanged, making it impossible for many pubs and restaurants to reopen. Ministers including Sharma and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, point to the 1 metre limit recommended by the World Health Organization and followed by France, while the rule is 1.5 metres in countries including Germany and Australia. But the government\u2019s scientific advisers have repeatedly expressed caution about changing the simple, across-the-board guidance, which has been a key part of the approach to limiting the spread of the virus. Whitehall sources suggested one proposal under discussion was a compromise, in which the strict 2 metre minimum would be relaxed where other precautions, such as face coverings, seating people back to back and limiting face-to-face interactions, could be put in place. Dr Shaun Fitzgerald, of Girton College, Cambridge, who sits on Sage\u2019s environmental working group, said: \u201cAs a scientist, it would absolutely make sense to me that if you can\u2019t maintain 2 metre distancing at all times, then consider other factors which influence risk and introduce some other measures.\u201d But he added: \u201cThe 2 metre guidance rule in the way it has been set out has been really helpful, because there is elegance in the simplicity of a message. Just saying 2 metres is something we can all relate to, we can all understand.\u201d The prime minister told MPs at the liaison committee last month: \u201cMy own hope is that as we make progress in getting the virus down, in reducing the incidence, we will be able to reduce that distance, which I think will be particularly valuable in transport and clearly the hospitality sector.\u201d But Whitty struck a more cautious tone on Wednesday, saying measures including handwashing, \u201cgood cough etiquette\u201d, the use of face coverings and the 2 metre rule were \u201cgoing to carry on really for as long as this epidemic continues\u201d. Whitty\u2019s appearance was the last time scientists accompanied ministers at the daily press conference. Johnson will present Wednesday\u2019s briefing, and one Whitehall source suggested he had been expected to make an announcement on the distancing rule. Trade bodies such as UK Hospitality and the British Beer &amp; Pubs Association (BBPA) have submitted estimates showing escalating numbers of closures and job losses based on social distancing, at 1m, 1.5m and 2m. If the required distance is not reduced, so-called \u201cwet-led\u201d pubs, which rely more on the sale of alcohol than food are likely to be particularly hard hit, because they need to pack in drinkers in large numbers. The BBPA has also voiced concern at the prospect that pubs could lose access to the furlough scheme and grant support if they are technically allowed to open, even if the reality of physical distancing rules means that many cannot. The trade body wants the government to provide financial backing to any pubs that are rendered unviable as businesses as a result.

Protesters sat in silence for several minutes before chanting \u201cdecolonise\u201d at Oxford University, whose building the statue adorns.

About 50 people then marched to Downing Street, some carrying \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d signs, and chanted \u201cwe want Boris\u201d and \u201cjustice for Windrush\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>All Labour councils in England and Wales \u2013 including London and Manchester \u2013 vowed to review their statues and public monuments amid rising concern about the celebration of historical industrialists with links to the slave trade</strong>. The effect of the toppling of Edward Colston\u2019s statue in Bristol on Sunday rippled across the country, with hundreds of local authorities now expected to consider renaming public monuments.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Museum for London said it was working with partners to remove the statue of 18th century slave owner Robert Milligan</strong>. The monument has become a focus of protest since it was targeted at the weekend.</li> \n   <li><strong>A statue of King Leopold II in Belgium was taken down after being vandalised and set on fire by protesters</strong>.

He says it was striking that <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> used cabinet this morning to reset his response to the <strong>Black Lives Matter</strong> protests, reinforcing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/08/i-hear-you-boris-johnson-to-black-lives-matter-protesters\">the message he conveyed in a video message last night.</a></p> \n  <p>In a tweet on Sunday night, after BLM protesters tore down the <strong>Edward Colston</strong> statue in Bristol and a minority of BLM protesters in London got involved in clashes with the police, Johnson posted this on Twitter.</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>Boris Johnson #StayAlert<strong>\u2714</strong>@BorisJohnson</p> \n   <p>People have a right to protest peacefully &amp; while observing social distancing but they have no right to attack the police.

The spokesman said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The PM began cabinet by discussing the anger and the grief felt not just in the US but around the world following the death of George Floyd. He said those who lead and govern simply cannot ignore the depth of emotion that has been triggered.</p> \n   <p>He said there was an undeniable feeling of injustice and that people from black and minority ethnic groups do face discrimination, in education, in employment and in the application of criminal law.</p> \n   <p>He said we are a much, much less racist society than we were, but we must also frankly acknowledge that there is so much more to do in eradicating prejudice and creating opportunity. Cabinet reiterated its commitment to that effort.</p> \n   <p>The PM said his message to all those who protested lawfully was \u2018I hear you and I understand\u2019. However, he said this cause is not an acceptable [reason] for violence or [relaxing the rules] regarding to social distancing. He said those who attack public property or the police are undermining the cause they claim to represent and will face the full force of the law.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This also suggests that No 10 has now crafted what it views as a better response to the question \u2018Is Britain racist?\u2019. <strong>Matt Hancock</strong>, the health secretary, was asked this on Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday at the weekend and he said that it wasn\u2019t, although he said there was still injustice that needed to be tackled. At the No 10 lobby briefing yesterday, in response to the same question, the spokesman said that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/08/uk-coronavirus-johnson-says-anti-racist-protests-were-subverted-by-thuggery-live-news-covid19-updates?page=with:block-5ede2ee48f0883ec2fc1cf7e#block-5ede2ee48f0883ec2fc1cf7e\">Johnson did not think the UK was a racist country. </a>Now the line is that the UK is \u201cmuch, much less racist\u201d than it was.</p> \n  <p>At today\u2019s briefing the spokesman was also asked if Johnson felt that any of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/boris-johnson-record-sexist-homophobic-and-racist-comments-bumboys-piccaninnies-2019-6?r=US&amp;IR=T\">his various racially offensive comments in the past</a> had contributed to the UK\u2019s problems in this regard.

I understood the arguments, it certainly seems anachronous, and while the thoughts of its removal in no way concerned me, I simply considered it someone else\u2019s decision to make. On reflection I think this attitude was probably a fault and an act of complicity in allowing the damage of Rhodes\u2019 actions during his lifetime, and the century of their legacy to go unchallenged. I believe now is the time to remove the statue from the college and that is it is in all our interest that is done proactively and peacefully.

      "bodyText": "A statue of 18th-century slave owner Robert Milligan has been removed from its place in London\u2019s docklands. The Canal and River Trust earlier said it was working with local authorities and a local museum to organise its safe removal. As the protest in Oxford continues, here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s developments on the UK anti-racism demonstrations. About 1,000 demonstrators gathered in Oxford to peacefully demand the removal of a statue of Cecil Rhodes, a 19th century imperialist who critics say is steeped in colonialism and racism. Protesters sat in silence for several minutes before chanting \u201cdecolonise\u201d at Oxford University, whose building the statue adorns. Organisers have announced a Black Lives Matter protest in the city on Saturday. Students of the Oxford University college at the centre of the Rhodes protest said the institution\u2019s silence was \u201cequal to complicity in the perpetuation of white privilege and supremacy\u201d. Undergraduates at Oriel College said the university had \u201cfailed to address its own issues of racial inequality and history of colonialism\u201d. The leader of Oxford city council wrote to Oxford University inviting it to apply for planning permission to remove the statue. The college, which has resisted pressure to remove the statue for years, said it opposes racism and discrimination in all its forms and that it was committed to \u201cdebate and discuss\u201d the issues raised by the monument. Dozens of people descended on Parliament Square to pay their respects to George Floyd, who was killed by a US police officer and whose funeral took place in Houston, Texas, on Tuesday night. About 50 people then marched to Downing Street, some carrying \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d signs, and chanted \u201cwe want Boris\u201d and \u201cjustice for Windrush\u201d. All Labour councils in England and Wales \u2013 including London and Manchester \u2013 vowed to review their statues and public monuments amid rising concern about the celebration of historical industrialists with links to the slave trade. The effect of the toppling of Edward Colston\u2019s statue in Bristol on Sunday rippled across the country, with hundreds of local authorities now expected to consider renaming public monuments. The Museum for London said it was working with partners to remove the statue of 18th century slave owner Robert Milligan. The monument has become a focus of protest since it was targeted at the weekend. A statue of King Leopold II in Belgium was taken down after being vandalised and set on fire by protesters. The bust of the brutal colonialist is now expected to be retired to a museum in Antwerp. Organisers of the Oxford rally have announced a Black Lives Matter protest in the city on Saturday. The killing of George Floyd has triggered a wave of activism around the world. It has seen the historic removal of statues \u2013 by force, at first, then by persuasion \u2013 and continued in waves from Minneapolis across Europe to Australia, New Zealand and remote islands inbetween. Take a look at this short film on an extraordinary fortnight in the fight for racial equality. The Museum for London has confirmed it is working with partners to remove the statue of 18th century slave owner Robert Milligan, which we reported on earlier. It says: At the Cecil Rhodes rally, a speaker who introduced himself as one of seven black professors at Oxford University \u2013 to huge cheers and applause from the crowd \u2013 has said the phrase \u201cblack lives matter\u201d resonated because of \u201ca history of white supremacy that has denigrated, exploited and subjugated black lives\u201d. He said the campaign group Rhodes Must Fall, which he joined in 2015, had been started by student activists in South Africa who were \u201ctired of colonial iconography, tired of white supremacy in our curriculums, tired of the crisis of representation of black and other minority ethnic people in our institutions\u201d. Another speaker, from Oxford city council, repeated its invitation to the university to apply for planning permission to remove the Rhodes statue: Labour MPs take the knee outside the Houses of Parliament in solidarity with anti-racism protestors: The campaign group Rhodes Must Fall, which is leading the protest against the Cecil Rhodes statue, is calling on Oxford\u2019s Oriel College to make an \u201cofficial, public and permanent acknowledgement of the colonial violence upon which [the college] is built\u201d and to establish a \u201creparatory scholarship scheme for southern Africans of African descent\u201d to begin next year. See its other demands below: Neil Misra, vice-president of Oxford Student Union for graduates, said such a \u201cracist and imperialist symbol\u201d as the Cecil Rhodes statue \u201chas no place on the front facade of Oriel College\u201d. He added: \u201cThe statue is an affront to our students of colour and our university community.\u201d Misra said he has put forward a motion to the graduate study body which endorses the removal of the statue: It is essential that we as students make it explicitly clear to the college that we find the continued displaying of the statue on the college\u2019s facade inappropriate and repugnant. Moreover, it is our duty to push the college to accept the council\u2019s invitation at the earliest possible juncture. Ndjodi Ndeunyema, one of the Oxford protest organisers, told the crowd of about 1,000 people they were showing \u201csolidarity with humanity\u201d. He said: We are here to shame the college that seeks to venerate and glorify someone who is not worthy of glorification or veneration. We demand an official and public acknowledgement of the colonial violence on which Oriel is built. We demand the immediate removal of the statue of Cecil Rhodes. Addressing the university, Ndeunyema added: \u201cPeople will constantly remind you of your shameful history that you refuse to confront.\u201d Oxford\u2019s high street has been brought to a standstill by the rally to remove the statue of Cecil Rhodes. Mounted police are at the scene but the protest has been wholly peaceful, with demonstrators sitting for several minutes in silence before directing chants at Oxford University. The geology society at Imperial College in London is to change its name following complaints it honoured a slave owner. The De La Beche Society is named after Henry De La Beche, a geologist and palaeontologist who contributed to the founding of the Royal School of Mines but also ran a slave plantation. \u201cThe society has decided to distance itself from De La Beche\u2019s legacy as slaveowner and to temporarily change its name to Imperial College Geology Society,\u201d the Imperial College Union said in a statement. A public consultation will be run to gather ideas for a new permanent name. My intrepid colleague Archie Bland has been on the trail of the sculpture of a black man with exaggerated features that was taken down by locals in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, last night following a huge petition to remove the \u201cracist\u201d bust. The wooden sculpture is being kept in \u201ca secret location\u201d \u2013 which may or may not be a Conservative councillor\u2019s garage \u2013 for safe-keeping while the council decides what to do with it. You can read Archie\u2019s story here. In London, racial justice protesters have marched from Nelson Mandela\u2019s statue in Parliament Square to Downing Street. Around 50 activists, some carrying \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d signs, chanted \u201cwe want Boris\u201d and \u201cjustice for Windrush\u201d at the gates to Number 10, reports PA Media. They had gathered at 5pm to observe a minute\u2019s silence on their knees in memory of George Floyd, who died in the US on 25 May. \u201cWe will beg no more. We will beg no more. We want it down. We are not asking, we\u2019re telling you that this does not represent Oxford. We are an anti-racist city and we want it down!\u201d Protestors are chanting \u201cdecolonise\u201d at Oxford university in front of the Cecil Rhodes statue. Labour councils across England and Wales will begin reviewing monuments and statues in their towns and cities following the tearing down of the Edward Colston statue in Bristol. The Local Government Association\u2019s (LGA) Labour group announced on Tuesday it has asked Labour council leaders to work with their communities to review \u201cthe appropriateness\u201d of monuments and statues in their areas. It tweeted: The University of Liverpool has agreed to rename one of its halls of residence after a group of students called on it to remove former prime minister William Gladstone\u2019s name due to \u201chis views on slavery\u201d. The issue first reared its head in 2017 when students pointed out that Gladstone\u2019s father, the merchant John Gladstone, was one of the biggest slaveholders in the West Indies, owning more than 2,500 at the time of the abolition of slavery. In a statement on Tuesday, the university said it wanted to send a clear message to its black, Asian and minority ethnic students and staff that it would work with them to \u201cagree an appropriate alternative name for the hall.\u201d. The Oxford protestors have sat down in the middle of the high street for a moment of silence: Hundreds of protestors have gathered outside Oriel College in Oxford to demand the removal of a statue of imperialist Cecil Rhodes, my colleague Aamna Mohdin reports. This picture by Enda Brady, the Sky News reporter, shows the mass of demonstrators, some carrying placards saying \u201cNo justice, no peace\u201d and \u201cEnd racism now\u201d. One slight hiccup with the possible removal of the Robert Milligan statue on London\u2019s West India Quay: it appears the removal truck is too heavy for the dock. Femi Nylander, an organiser for Rhodes Must Fall, welcomed the support the campaign had received from the local council, MP and the thousands who signed the petition to remove the statue of Cecil Rhodes. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s good to see public consciousness is changing. We are seeing a paradigm shift. You can see that everywhere.\u201d He added that he hopes today\u2019s protest will see the resurgence of the Rhodes Must Fall movement in Oxford. Ndjodi Ndeunyema, 30, a PhD student, said: We reject this narrative that Cecil Rhodes is a complicated character. No, he is a genocidaire, he is someone who planned an assault on Africa and he is not worthy of exaltation, he does not deserve to be on a high street looking down on us. That history will never be erased, it\u2019s a lived reality for people in Southern Africa, but it needs to be contextualised, it needs to be accurately represented and not glorified in the way it is today. He added that this protest goes much further than calling for the removal of the statue, it\u2019s also about meaningful equality: For the black community, given the moment we are in, but also people of colour and people on the social and economic fringes of any society. He called for justice for the Windrush generation, describing the scandal as as \u201csubstantive policy manifestation of anti-blackness\u201d. Just a reminder on the position of Oriel college, the Oxford university institution facing protests tonight. In a statement earlier today (see 2.12pm update), the college said it \u201cabhors racism and discrimination in all its forms\u201d. The university has previously refused to remove the Cecil Rhodes statue but said it could be modified to \u201cdraw attention to this history [and] do justice to the complexity of the debate\u201d. It said on Tuesday that it would \u201ccontinue to debate and discuss the issues raised by the presence on our site of examples of contested heritage relating to Cecil Rhodes\u201d. Students of the Oxford University college at the centre of the Cecil Rhodes statue protest have said the institution\u2019s silence was \u201cequal to complicity in the perpetuation of white privilege and supremacy\u201d. A protest against the statue of the 19th century imperialist is getting underway right now as one of several demonstrations sparked by the death of George Floyd in US police custody. Oriel College, where the monument is based, has for years resisted pressure to remove it despite repeated campaigns. In a statement, Oriel undergraduates said Oxford University had \u201cfailed to address its own issues of racial inequality and history of colonialism\u201d. They add: Oriel College must not be blind to its legacy of colonialism and racism in association with Cecil Rhodes. Despite claims that clear historical context about the Cecil Rhodes statue would be provided in order to acknowledge and educate our students on the imperialist past, the subject remains taboo and Oriel\u2019s continuing silence [is] equal to complicity in the perpetuation of white privilege and supremacy. Our JCR [junior common room] pledges to educate each incoming year on the legacy of Cecil Rhodes and support black students by openly challenging racial discrimination. A public square in Plymouth named after the 16th-century slave trader Sir John Hawkins is to be renamed, the city council has said. The council said: \u201cWe have already removed the signs on the square and will start the renaming process, which involves an opportunity for people to give their views. We are doing this because we have listened to views and recognise it causes particular offence due to Hawkins\u2019 close involvement in the slave trade.\u201d However, it does not intend to remove the statue of Sir Francis Drake from The Hoe despite his role in the slave trade. The council said: \u201cWe will continue to acknowledge the important role Drake played in this nation\u2019s history, as well as in the history and development of Plymouth, while always also acknowledging that he was involved in privateering and the terrible practice of trading slaves. \u201cRather than remove the statue we feel we have a duty to tell the full story of what he did and use this to help remember those who suffered as a result of the slave trade.\u201d Manchester has taken a leaf out of London\u2019s book and said it will review all of its statues following the toppling of the Edward Colston monument in Bristol. Councillor Luthfur Rahman said it was important \u201cthat we do not shy away from the darker moments in our country\u2019s history and the difficult conversations attached to them\u201d. He said he hoped the city-wide review would \u201cbe an opportunity for education and debate around those who have been memorialised\u201d and added: The weight of emotion around the symbolism attached to public statues has been palpable this week \u2013 and not without good reason. However, it\u2019s also true to say that most of us do not know the people represented in the city\u2019s statues, nor the history as to why they were chosen. We also want to take this opportunity to ask the public who is missing \u2013 who should be celebrated but is not \u2013 with particular thought around representing the proud BAME history of Manchester and help to reflect the shared story of our diverse and multicultural city. People are gathering in Parliament Square in London to commemorate the life of George Floyd at 5pm, the time when his body will be laid to rest in Houston, Texas, where he grew up. In the capital, police officers were pictured protecting the Winston Churchill statue that was defaced on Sunday, while a growing number of people gathered to pay tribute to Floyd. These pictures are just in from the Reuters photographer Toby Melville: The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, and deputy leader, Angela Rayner, have been photographed kneeling in solidarity with anti-racism protesters. Posting the image on Twitter, Starmer wrote: \u201cWe kneel with all those opposing anti-Black racism. BlackLivesMatter.\u201d My colleague Aamna Mohdin is on the ground for us in Oxford and will be reporting live when the protest against the Cecil Rhodes statue gets under way at 5pm. She has just sent me the below: There is a significant police presence at Oxford\u2019s Rhodes Must Fall campaign that was called after the dramatic toppling of a statue of the slave trader Edward Colston at a Black Lives Matter protest in Bristol. As well as several police vans, there are six police officers on horses at the protest that is expected to start in less than an hour. King Leopold of Belgium has become the latest historical figure whose statue has been toppled by the rising tide of public anger. Officials in the Belgian city of Antwerp removed Leopold II\u2019s monument on Tuesday morning, days after it was vandalised and set on fire during protests over the killing of George Floyd. Leopold II, who was king of Belgium from 1865 until his death in 1909, was known for widespread atrocities against colonial subjects and his brutal rule over the Congo, where his forced labour system is estimated to have cost around 10 million lives. A spokesman for the Antwerp mayor, Bart De Wever, told the Brussels Times the statue would be \u201ctemporarily housed in the sculpture collection of the Middelheim museum, where it will be restored\u201d. The spokesman said it would probably stay in the museum permanently. Another Leopold II bust in Ghent has been splashed in red paint and marked \u201cI can\u2019t breathe,\u201d the final words of George Floyd. As protests spread across the UK, a petition has been launched in Dunoon, a small town on the Cowal peninsula, on the west coast of Scotland, to remove a notorious local fixture known as the \u201cJim Crow rock\u201d, which is painted to depict a stereotypical blackface. The petition, which describes the rock as \u201cblatantly racist and offensive\u201d, has gathered thousands of signatures and the local MSP, Mike Russell, has stepped in to reassure locals that the rock \u2013 which was painted over with the acronym BLM at the weekend \u2013 will be \u201cdealt with in a way that unites the town\u201d. Russell confirmed there is a competition under way for local schoolchildren to come up with a new design for the rock, as well as a commitment to create a plaque or noticeboard near the rock which can explain its history and the decision to change it now. As the writer Layla-Roxanne Hill says: \u201cAs a black and mixed-race person raised in Dunoon, my uneasiness with the Jim Crow rock grew as I did. When I came to understand what Jim Crow was, I felt too wee and powerless to be able to voice my feelings and ask for change, never mind make change.\u201d The Labour MP Clive Lewis has said it would be a \u201cwaste of police time\u201d to prosecute the protesters who pulled down the Edward Colston statue. Appearing on BBC Radio 5 live\u2019s Emma Barnett show, the former Labour leadership contender said the police had \u201cbetter things to be getting on with\u201d than tackling the Bristol demonstrators: He said: I personally think that there are more important things to be getting on with. So no, I don\u2019t think they should. I think it would be a waste of police time if I\u2019m quite frank. Given that most people in this country, now knowing what the individual whose statue was pulled down represents, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good use of police resources personally. Most of them were law-abiding citizens who basically said that this statue is an affront to millions of people who died during the slave trade and to the millions of black people who have contributed so much to this country who have to walk past this statue every day and know of its existence. A statue of the 18th century Scottish merchant and slave owner Robert Milligan could soon be removed from London\u2019s Docklands amid growing concern about the celebration of controversial British industrialists. The Canal and River Trust has said it is committed to working with Tower Hamlets council and other partners \u201cto organise its safe removal as soon as possible\u201d: Milligan was the driving force behind the construction of London\u2019s West India Docks. He is estimated to have enslaved more than 500 people on his family\u2019s sugar plantations in Jamaica. A statue of Milligan was unveiled four years after his death, in 1809, and currently stands in front of the Museum of London Docklands. Local councillors have called for the monument to be removed permanently. Labour councillor Ehtasham Haque described the Canal and River Trust statement as \u201cexcellent news\u201d, having earlier called the statue an \u201cinsult to humanity\u201d. Ahead of the Cecil Rhodes demonstration in Oxford later, the leader of the city council has written to Oxford University to invite it to apply for planning permission to remove the controversial statue. Susan Brown, a Labour councillor, said the monument would be better placed in a museum and that her views are shared by the majority of the city\u2019s councillors. She added: I have today written to Oriel College to invite them to apply for planning permission to remove the statue, as it is a Grade II* listed building. Typically such actions are only allowed in the most exceptional of circumstances. But these are exceptional circumstances, and as a city council we are keen to work with Oriel to help them find the right balance between the laws that protect our historic buildings and the moral obligation to reflect on the malign symbolism of this statue. The Oxford University college at the centre of today\u2019s planned protest over its Cecil Rhodes statue has said it \u201cabhors racism and discrimination in all its forms\u201d. In a statement, Oriel College said it would \u201ccontinue to debate and discuss the issues raised by the presence on our site of examples of contested heritage relating to Cecil Rhodes\u201d. Its full statement is below. The university has previously insisted that the statue would stay, with modifications that \u201cdraw attention to this history [and] do justice to the complexity of the debate\u201d. At 5pm, protesters are expected to gather in front of the Rhodes statue where a list of demands from the campaign group Rhodes Must Fall will be read out, including addressing underrepresentation and lack of welfare provision for black and minority ethnic students and staff. The leader of Edinburgh city council has said he would feel \u201cno sense of loss\u201d if a statue of Henry Dundas, a politician who delayed the abolition of slavery, was removed. Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville, frustrated efforts to end the slave trade by using his influence as home secretary, setting the move back 15 years. Sir Geoff Palmer, an emeritus professor of Heriot-Watt University who has campaigned for years for a new plaque on the sculpture, estimates that Dundas \u201ccaused the enslavement of about 630,000 Africans; and as war secretary lost about 40,000 British troops in Haiti fighting a pro-slavery war.\u201d A 150ft column with a statue of the politician \u2013 known as the Melville Monument \u2013 stands in Edinburgh\u2019s St Andrew Square and was vandalised during the Black Lives Matter protest in the Scottish capital on Sunday. The council leader, Adam McVey, told BBC Radio Scotland\u2019s Good Morning Scotland programme today: I would have absolutely no sense of loss if the Dundas statue was removed and replaced with something else or left as a plinth. I think it\u2019s important to tell our story as a city, I think it\u2019s important that that\u2019s reflective, that\u2019s representative of what actually happened \u2013 not what we might have wanted to happen \u2013 and I think we take that conversation from there. A senior Tory city councillor in Bristol has described slave trader Edward Colston as a \u201chero\u201d and condemned the toppling of his statue as \u201cfrenzied thug violence\u201d. The councillor, Richard Eddy, was formerly the Conservative leader on Bristol city council and is no stranger to controversy. In 2001, he resigned as deputy leader of the city\u2019s Conservative group after he began to use a golliwog doll as a mascot. He reportedly got into trouble soon after when he said the council should hire \u201cmore attractive lesbians\u201d. True to form, Eddy has now let rip on Colston. He\u2019s been quoted by BristolLive as saying: I am horrified and appalled by the rank lawlessness which was exposed in Bristol on Sunday when the famous statue of Edward Colston was attacked and vandalised by a criminal mob. Edward Colston to me and generations of Bristolians stands out as a hero whose wealth has continued to benefit the housing, education and healthcare of the citizens of this city. Since this frenzied thug violence on Sunday, I have received a stream of outraged responses from constituents and others \u2013 more than I\u2019ve even received in such a short time in my 28-year council service. Eddy said he was equally outraged \u201cby the feeble comments, effectively condoning violence\u201d of Bristol\u2019s mayor, Marvin Rees, and the \u201cpathetic hand-wringing\u201d of senior Avon &amp; Somerset police officers. My colleague Andrew Sparrow has been at the Downing Street lobby briefing for journalists in Westminster. He says it was striking that Boris Johnson used cabinet this morning to reset his response to the Black Lives Matter protests, reinforcing the message he conveyed in a video message last night. In a tweet on Sunday night, after BLM protesters tore down the Edward Colston statue in Bristol and a minority of BLM protesters in London got involved in clashes with the police, Johnson posted this on Twitter. Boris Johnson #StayAlert\u2714@BorisJohnson People have a right to protest peacefully &amp; while observing social distancing but they have no right to attack the police. These demonstrations have been subverted by thuggery - and they are a betrayal of the cause they purport to serve. Those responsible will be held to account. 125K9:13 PM - Jun 7, 2020Twitter Ads info and privacy 41.2K people are talking about this Since then No 10 has recalibrated its response, and the prime minister\u2019s spokesman gave this account of what was said in cabinet this morning. The spokesman said: The PM began cabinet by discussing the anger and the grief felt not just in the US but around the world following the death of George Floyd. He said those who lead and govern simply cannot ignore the depth of emotion that has been triggered. He said there was an undeniable feeling of injustice and that people from black and minority ethnic groups do face discrimination, in education, in employment and in the application of criminal law. He said we are a much, much less racist society than we were, but we must also frankly acknowledge that there is so much more to do in eradicating prejudice and creating opportunity. Cabinet reiterated its commitment to that effort. The PM said his message to all those who protested lawfully was \u2018I hear you and I understand\u2019. However, he said this cause is not an acceptable [reason] for violence or [relaxing the rules] regarding to social distancing. He said those who attack public property or the police are undermining the cause they claim to represent and will face the full force of the law. This also suggests that No 10 has now crafted what it views as a better response to the question \u2018Is Britain racist?\u2019. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, was asked this on Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday at the weekend and he said that it wasn\u2019t, although he said there was still injustice that needed to be tackled. At the No 10 lobby briefing yesterday, in response to the same question, the spokesman said that Johnson did not think the UK was a racist country. Now the line is that the UK is \u201cmuch, much less racist\u201d than it was. At today\u2019s briefing the spokesman was also asked if Johnson felt that any of his various racially offensive comments in the past had contributed to the UK\u2019s problems in this regard. The spokesman refused to engage, just saying that Johnson had addressed these questions during the election campaign. Back in the House of Commons, the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, has said peaceful protest is \u201cone of the hallmarks of a mature democracy\u201d but criminal conduct must never be accepted as a \u201clegitimate tool of protest\u201d. In quotes reported by PA Media, Buckland said: The death of George Floyd in the United States and the protests that have been taking place across the globe are stark reminders that we live in a world where prejudice sadly and unacceptably continues to play a role. We all have a duty to stand up to racism wherever we see it and I\u2019m more determined than ever to work with our justice partners and the BAME community to address racial disparity in our justice system. The right to peaceful protest is one of the hallmarks of a mature democracy like ours, but under the rule of law. The rule of law which is the guarantor of equality before the law and we must never accept violence or criminal conduct as a legitimate tool of protest.\u201d Bansky has posted a picture suggesting what could happen to the empty plinth in the city that had housed the statue of slave trader Edward Colston. He wrote on Instagram: \u201cHere\u2019s an idea that caters for both those who miss the Colston statue and those who don\u2019t. We drag him out the water, put him back on the plinth, tie cable round his neck and commission some life size bronze statues of protestors in the act of pulling him down. Everyone happy. A famous day commemorated.\u201d The concern about controversial statues is not limited to the metropolitan cities of London, Bristol and Oxford. A quaint Derbyshire market town is grappling with its own moral dilemma following a mass petition to remove a black caricature head from a pub sign where locals claim it has stood for at least 300 years. The figurine in Ashbourne depicts a black head in the style of a golliwog, the 19th-century dolls now widely seen as racist. More than 42,000 people have signed an online petition (set up by a local resident) to get the head removed, saying \u201cthis kind of disgusting racist imagery has NO place in 2020 and should have been removed many many years ago\u201d. And on Monday night a group of Ashbourne residents took it upon themselves to take it down. About 150 locals gathered outside the Green Man pub with ladders as the head was removed. Derbyshire Dales district council said today it did not object to the figurine being removed \u201ctemporarily\u201d and said the group had decided to \u201cremove the figure themselves for safe keeping and, not wanting to create a confrontation\u201d. The council said it expected to have the head in its possession later today, when it will then decide what to do with it. A number of NHS trusts, which are responsible for hospitals and GPs\u2019 practices, are holding a minute\u2019s silence at midday in solidarity against racism: The General Medical Council, the independent regulator for doctors, is also holding a moment of remembrance of George Floyd: It turns out the justice questions in the Commons didn\u2019t touch on the Black Lives Matter protests. David Lammy, the shadow justice secretary, pressed the justice minister Lucy Frazer on the issue of children in young offender institutions across the UK. Lammy said one third of all children on youth justice estates were on remand without a sentence, and a proportion of those will not receive a custodial sentence when they eventually appear before a judge. He said there were issues with young people not being allowed adequate time out of their cells due to Covid-19. Frazer responded by saying custody was a last resort and that young people should have 12 to 14 hours out of their cells every day. We\u2019ll return to justice questions if the Black Lives Matter protests are discussed. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, says George Floyd\u2019s death must be a \u201ccatalyst for change\u201d and that his party stands with those opposing racism and oppression. And fellow Labour MP Rachael Maskell tweeted: The justice secretary, Robert Buckland, will soon be taking questions in the House of Commons. He\u2019s likely to repeat the stance set out yesterday by the home secretary, Priti Patel, vowing that a minority of protesters would \u201cface justice\u201d for their \u201cthuggery\u201d. As Jack Blanchard pointed out in today\u2019s Politico London Playbook, Buckland\u2019s opposite number, the shadow justice secretary, David Lammy, is one of parliament\u2019s most powerful voices on race issues so today\u2019s hearing should be worth watching. We\u2019ll bring you updates live. Parliament has just held a minute\u2019s silence in memory of George Floyd, whose death at the hands of a police officer in Minnesota triggered a wave of demonstrations on both sides of the Atlantic. Four Commons select committees were sitting at 11am when they all fell silent. Some MPs have tweeted about the minute\u2019s silence: Hello. This is Josh Halliday taking over from Martin. Stay with us for all the day\u2019s developments on the UK Black Lives Matter protests. And feel free to get in touch with tips or suggestions. I\u2019m on: Twitter: @JoshHalliday (DMs open) Email: josh.halliday@theguardian.com The last time Oriel College was under pressure to remove the Cecil Rhodes statue, they sought the opinions of former students. Some of those former students are now very much rallying around the idea that the statue must go. A form is being circulated online for alumni to add their names to an open letter. Appealing for leaders at the college to think of the long-term impact on the institution, in part it reads: We would be ashamed and embarrassed to be associated with a college that let the statue of Cecil Rhodes remain standing on its grounds. The Oriel students and alumni campaigning for the removal of the statue back in 2016 and today are the donors of tomorrow. The momentum is well and truly behind removing the statue. Every year it is still there, more and more alumni will think twice about making a donation; more and more students will refuse to be associated with an institution that is so out-of-step with their own beliefs. Oriel can, and should be, a pioneer in healing the scars of Imperialism, and beginning the process of reconciliation this country so obviously needs. Oriel\u2019s future depends on what you do next. We urge you to be on the right side of history this time. One common refrain you will have heard from politicians after the toppling of the Edward Colston statue in Bristol is that those who object to monuments that glorify colonial figures should use proper democratic channels to achieve change, rather than direct action. Protesters in Bristol, however, will tell you that they had been trying to use the proper channels for years, without success. With the focus today switching to the planned demonstration against the Cecil Rhodes statue at Oriel college, Oxford, it is worth reminding ourselves that this is also a long-standing campaign for change. If you want some more background on it, in 2016 we published a long read by Amit Chaudhuri looking at \u201cThe real meaning of Rhodes Must Fall\u201d, and discussing the origins of the movement in South Africa. Most of the controversy generated by the movement has revolved around the figure of Cecil Rhodes \u2013 but Rhodes himself is not really central to its aims. What is at issue is an ethos that gives space and even preeminence to such a figure, and hesitates to interrogate Rhodes\u2019s legacy. That legacy does not merely include Rhodes\u2019s financial bequests and their educational offshoots, like the Rhodes scholarships, but the vision embodied in his will, which called for: \u201cthe establishment, promotion and development of a Secret Society, the true aim and object whereof shall be for the extension of British rule throughout the world, the perfecting of a system of emigration from the United Kingdom, and of colonisation by British subjects of all lands where the means of livelihood are attainable by energy, labour and enterprise. You can read it in full here: Dr Shola Mos-Shogbamimu was on Good Morning Britain this morning \u2013 put up against Nigel Farage to talk about racism and statues. She is definitely not mincing her words here in this tweet. It\u2019s worth watching the segment as well. Another former student at Oriel has just posted on social media in support of the Rhodes Must Fall campaign. Doug Buist, who is chair of the Lambeth Liberal Democrats and who works at The Globe theatre, has publish a letter he has written to the provost of Oriel college. He says that he \u201cdidn\u2019t speak out a few years back when asked and this was wrong\u201d. In the letter, he says: A few years ago, the college wrote to alumni of Oriel to ask our thoughts on the removal of the statue of Cecil Rhodes. At the time, I did not take the opportunity to offer an opinion. I understood the arguments, it certainly seems anachronous, and while the thoughts of its removal in no way concerned me, I simply considered it someone else\u2019s decision to make. On reflection I think this attitude was probably a fault and an act of complicity in allowing the damage of Rhodes\u2019 actions during his lifetime, and the century of their legacy to go unchallenged. I believe now is the time to remove the statue from the college and that is it is in all our interest that is done proactively and peacefully. Statues in situ do not teach us about history; their intent is to memorialise or magnify the reputations of those we admire. We cannot continue to glorify the acts or name of men like Rhodes. Buist goes on to say that \u201cI appreciate that Rhodes and his estate have financed a great deal of educational benefit. That does not atone.\u201d In London, Sadiq Khan is launching a review of statues with links to slavery. The mayor said that the city\u2019s landmarks \u2013 including street names, the names of public buildings and plaques \u2013 will be reviewed by a commission. Khan said: \u201cIt is an uncomfortable truth that our nation and city owes a large part of its wealth to its role in the slave trade and while this is reflected in our public realm, the contribution of many of our communities to life in our capital has been wilfully ignored. This cannot continue \u2026 \u201cThe Black Lives Matter protests have rightly brought this to the public\u2019s attention, but it\u2019s important that we take the right steps to work together to bring change and ensure that we can all be proud of our public landscape. \u201cA new Commission for Diversity in the Public Realm will also consider which legacies should be celebrated before making recommendations about new statues and which could be removed.\u201d You can read the full report from my colleague Rowena Mason here: Also doing the media rounds this morning was former chief superintendent Dal Babu, who was appearing on Sky News and was highly critical of the home secretary. Priti Patel has suggested that police should have acted more firmly on Sunday when the statue of Edward Colston was being pulled down. \u201cI think it\u2019s very, very dangerous when politicians get involved and become armchair police officers,\u201d he said. Dal Babu spoke about the complexities of policing a situation like that, saying: There is a real skill in being able to determine what to do in a disorder situation. You have to make decisions very, very quickly. You have to think about the protection of police officers, you have to think about the general welfare of the crowd. So these are complex decisions. You have to make them within the law, and you have to use the resources that you have. Police officers invariably will be outnumbered by demonstrators, so you just end up with a huge amount of injuries to police officers, and disorder, and perhaps not even achieving your goal. His words echo those of Andy Marsh, the chief constable of the Avon and Somerset police, who said at the weekend of the decision not to intervene in the destruction of the statue: To arrest suspects would likely lead to injuries to suspects, injuries to officers, and people who were not involved in damaging property being thrown into a very violent confrontation with the police. Can you imagine scenes of police in Bristol fighting with protesters who were damaging the statue of a man who is reputed to have gathered much of his fortune through the slave trade? Former students of Oxford University have been campaigning for some time over the Cecil Rhodes statue. This week they have been urged to sign an open letter calling for the university to tackle systemic racism. The open letter states that: Despite multiple campaigns \u2014 including Rhodes Must Fall Oxford and Common Ground Oxford, and the tireless work of the Oxford African and Caribbean Society and Oxford Africa Society \u2014 the university has failed to address its institutional racism, its systemic racism across colleges, and the impact this has on the student body and city. It goes on to make specific demands for the university to address the issue - and can be read in full here. The historian and former Oriel College student Dr Kristen D Nawrotzki added her voice to the Rhodes Must Fall campaign this morning on social media. Bristol city council has said it will act quickly to retrieve the statue of Edward Colston from the harbour. The deputy mayor, Craig Cheney, acknowledged that if the council did not fish the statue out there was a risk someone else would take it away. \u201cWe do need to prioritise getting that out,\u201d he said. Speaking on BBC Radio Bristol, Cheney said that the idea of setting up a museum focusing on the slave trade in Bristol was being discussed by a steering group that was set up last year. While emphasising that he did not condone the tearing down of the statue, he said it had been a \u201cpowerful and historical moment\u201d. There have already been some clips shared on social media which appear to show a group of people attempting to retrieve the statue from under the water. Dr Shola Mos-Shogbamimu was on Good Morning Britain a little while ago discussing the removal of the Edward Colston statue. She said: Properties can be replaced, black lives can\u2019t. And it is indefensible for those who suggest otherwise. So what we saw there is an act of resistance and the hypocrisy is palpable. Think about the fact that when Saddam Hussein\u2019s statute was destroyed, people in this country hailed it as an act of resistance. But here you have the destruction of the statue of a slave trader condemned as lawless. You can watch the clip here: The toppling of the Edward Colston statue has inevitably led to a national debate about whether it was right to do it, and what should be done with the statue now, what should go into the space it has left behind. If you haven\u2019t seen this piece by Travis Alabanza about the statue, it really is worth a read. They talk about the racism they experienced growing up in Bristol, and what it felt like to watch the statue fall: I watched the video of Edward Colston\u2019s statue in my hometown of Bristol being pushed into Bristol harbour around 100 times last night \u2026 It felt different each time, I think. It fluctuated between the feeling of a sparkle of hope, to the satisfaction of watching a bully getting what they deserve at the end of a movie, to a feeling of pure disbelief. They also talk about what might come next: Already, there is discussion about what must replace the statue. People are thinking about the Bristol Bus Boycott and one of the founders of that movement, Dr Paul Stephenson. Others are talking about replacing it with sculptures or artworks by local young Black organisers and impact makers. But I want fellow Bristolians to pause. I want us to keep the rubble on the ground and to have to walk past it. For it to stay there, dust and all, as a reminder to the promise that was made in that action. You should read it in full here: I didn\u2019t think 2020 would have me crying tears of joy at the death of a statue, but here we are The anti-racism protests of the last few days in the UK may have been initially sparked by an incident of police violence in the US, but they have been attempting to address a broad range of issues impacting on BAME society in the UK. This morning we\u2019ve got an interview with Patrick Roach, head of the teaching union NASUWT. In it he speaks about his own experience of racism at school in the 1970s, and where he thinks things are failing to be improved. If we want to have the best teaching profession, then it has to be inclusive, and it is not. This is another one of these national scandals that has to sit squarely with the government. Clear statutory duties in respect of equality apply to schools as employers but how, since the 2010 Equalities Act, has the government sought to reinforce it in schools? It hasn\u2019t. Successive secretaries of state have removed equality from the accountability systems, and that includes race equality. It has been very instructive to hear from BAME members the extent to which they felt that their schools are just paying lip service to race equality. I know it is not a popular thing to say and that it is often misunderstood, but institutional racism does exist and is an issue that has clearly got to be addressed, especially in the light of the handling of the coronavirus emergency. You can read the full interview here, where Roach also reflects on how further education gave him a second chance after school failed him: New UK teachers\u2019 union chief: \u2018Institutional racism in schools has got to be addressed\u2019 Overnight the Rhodes Must Fall campaign has been buoyed by 26 local councillors signing a letter in support of their protest. The letter reads: We as City Councillors support the Rhodes Must Fall campaign in its demands for the removal of the Cecil Rhodes statue from Oxford\u2019s High Street and endorse its wider campaign to decolonise Oxford University. Cecil Rhodes was a white supremacist who believed in brutal colonial rule and subjugation across Africa and the world. A city\u2019s public art and monuments should reflect its values. The presence of this statue on our High Street is incompatible with our city\u2019s proud internationalist heritage and commitment to anti-racism. We condemn Oriel College\u2019s 2016 decision to privilege its donors over the wider Oxford community. We call on Oriel College to immediately remove the Cecil Rhodes statue and associated plaque. The campaign group are planing a peaceful protest at 5pm today. Angus Robertson, the former deputy leader of the Scottish National party, has written for the Edinburgh Evening News about the extent to which monuments and buildings in Scotland\u2019s capital are still named after figures linked to slavery. As with the statue of Edward Colston in Bristol, Robertson is arguing that the process of change and making public acknowledgements of the truth behind these monuments is far too slow. Prominent Edinburgh residents associated with slavery include Henry Dundas, whose statue stands in the middle of St Andrew\u2019s Square. The Tory MP for Midlothian was instrumental in delaying the end of slavery. Also on the square is Dundas House, now the RBS Headquarters, which was owned by his relative. The statue in front is of the 4th Earl of Hopetoun who put down a two-year slave revolution in the West Indies. The time has come to properly acknowledge the role of Dundas and others. The campaign by Edinburgh academic Sir Geoff Palmer to reword the history of Dundas is long past time for action. Monuments don\u2019t just reflect the past, they are in pride of place in our present, in our capital city. You can read the full piece here: Black Lives Matter protest is just the start. Edinburgh must be honest about its slavery past Oxford Brookes University\u2019s Afro-Caribbean Society has published overnight a mini-essay on Instagram on why they are campaigning for the removal of the controversial Cecil Rhodes statue from Oriel College. The issue of whether Rhodes, and other controversial figures like him, should \u2018fall\u2019 was never about whether or not he should be remembered, it\u2019s about him being celebrated\u2026Imperialism and the exploitation of Africa is one of the reasons why Britain is such a successful nation, and Cecil Rhodes played a part in that. He was responsible for stealing and exploiting land in the Rhodesia region, and he exploited black workers to sustain his empire\u2026keeping him up is just a reminder to the people of colour, especially black and African people, that they are in a space that celebrates him. You can read the full post on Instagram. If you haven\u2019t seen it yet, Boris Johnson recorded a video message addressed to black and ethnic minority communities in the UK. In it he said that there was a \u201ca cold reality\u201d that these communities faced discrimination in employment, education, and in the application of the law. \u201cI hear you,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand.\u201d However, he then went on to condemn protesters, saying they would face the \u201cfull force of the law\u201d for acts of violence and vandalism, and he also admonished those who had not been obeying social distancing measures while out on protests. You can watch the clip here: Good morning. Yesterday Boris Johnson was insisting that despite understanding the \u201cdepth of emotion\u201d of those protesting, Britain was not a racist country. Thousands have been on the streets in the last few days to disagree with that assessment, and there will be more protests today. In Oxford, between 5pm and 7pm there is an organised demonstration from the #RhodesMustFall campaign to put more pressure on Oxford University to remove a statue honouring colonialist Cecil Rhodes. We\u2019ll be bringing you live coverage of the protests, and further reaction to the toppling of Edward Colston\u2019s statue in Bristol at the weekend.

He said black people were still treated as second-class citizens, \u201cnot only in this country but all over the world\u201d, making action on the streets much-needed. \u201cI am pleased there are lots of people trying to support it.\u201d</p> <p>However, he said he was concerned protesters were potentially exposing themselves to the coronavirus: \u201cThey have made a decision to put themselves at risk to show their displeasure at what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p> <p>Amid controversy after protesters tore down the Colston statue, Lawrence said: \u201cThe people in power should have the decency to realise it is offensive.

      "bodyText": "The father of Stephen Lawrence has said black people are still treated as second-class citizens in Britain, with police breaking promises to change they made two decades ago after being shamed by their failure to find his son\u2019s racist killers. Neville Lawrence used a Guardian interview to back peaceful anti-racism protests, saying he was \u201cpleased\u201d by the mass marches sweeping the country, triggered by the US police killing of George Floyd. Lawrence said racial injustice in Britain was worse than it should be and that the government, from the prime minister down, was not doing enough. Revealing his continuing exasperation with UK policing, he said it was still institutionally racist, as shown by stop and search disproportionately targeting black people. Lawrence, 78, said statues such as that of the slave owner Edward Colston, which was pulled down and dumped in Bristol harbour at the weekend, were \u201coffensive\u201d and should not have been left up in the first place. However, he warned against violence and voiced concerns over the spread of coronavirus. On Tuesday, protests moved to Oxford, with more than 1,000 gathering to demand the removal of a statue of the Victorian imperialist Cecil Rhodes from Oriel College. It came as Britain\u2019s head of counterterrorism, Neil Basu, denounced racial bias in UK institutions and society, and said protesters had legitimate aims that should not be tarnished by a violent minority. In an internal post for officers, the most senior BAME officer in policing wrote: \u201cWhat we are seeing in America, and here in the UK, too, is anger directed not just at police brutality but the racial bias built into the very fabric of our institutions and society \u2013 perhaps best illustrated in the UK by the huge disparity in young black men in the criminal justice system. \u201cMeanwhile, recent reports describe how BAME communities are not only more likely to die as a result of Covid-19, they have also been disproportionately affected by the way we have policed lockdown rules. This disparity is seen in education, in health, in the workplace \u2013 it\u2019s everywhere \u2013 and it\u2019s a daily lived experience for many.\u201d Basu said he felt moved to see officers take a knee at the weekend, adding: \u201cWe must confront the fact that with many of our communities \u2013 especially the black community \u2013 we still have a long way to go.\u201d Lawrence\u2019s 18-year-old son, Stephen, was murdered in 1993 by a racist gang in south-east London, with police bungling the investigation. He and his wife, Doreen, now Lady Lawrence, spent years fighting the police, who denied wrongdoing, and won a public inquiry which in 1999 found errors were down to incompetence and \u201cinstitutional racism\u201d. Police promises to reform and enshrine racial justice in the ranks, Lawrence said, were not delivered and he still had no idea when they would be kept. \u201cI thought when they came out they would be respected and done in quick time, so people can see they are making the force more fair. \u201cIt was not done in quick time, it\u2019s not been done, I don\u2019t know when it will be done \u2013 we should not be talking about it 21 years later. They have fallen way, way short. Twenty-one years short.\u201d The 2017 Lammy review concluded that \u201cBAME individuals still face bias, including overt discrimination, in parts of the justice system\u201d. It showed that, while black people comprise 3% of the overall population in England and Wales, they made up 12% of its prison population, with the percentage of black people in prison higher in relation to their share of the general population than the corresponding figure in the US. Just 1.2% of police officers in England and Wales are black, official data shows. Lawrence said police had made some improvements but these were insufficient to gain support in certain communities, damaging their ability to fight crime. \u201cWithout the community behind you it is harder to solve crimes. It is like a them-and-us situation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not want people stealing and doing bad things. Some people still think the police are not there for them.\u201d The Met police commissioner, Cressida Dick, has declared that Britain\u2019s biggest force is no longer institutionally racist. Lawrence, who has previously praised her, said: \u201cI totally disagree with her. Yes, the police are institutionally racist.\u201d Lawrence cited stop and search as an example.

Government sources said scientists were reluctant to advise the watering-down of physical distancing rules at this point in the pandemic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jun/09/reopening-schools-what-is-happening-in-england\">Reopening schools: what is happening in England?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Another 286 coronavirus deaths were reported in the UK on Tuesday, with the number of excess deaths since lockdown <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jun/09/excess-deaths-in-uk-under-coronavirus-lockdown-pass-63000\">hitting 63,000</a> \u2013 a toll believed to be greater than anywhere else except the US.</p> <p>Announcing the U-turn in the Commons, Williamson said he hoped all schools could return by September but could not guarantee that would be achieved.</p> <p>New statistics showed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jun/09/school-reopening-plans-in-tatters-as-only-25-of-pupils-in-england-return\">just one in four eligible children</a> in reception, year 1 and year 6 returned last week, undermining Johnson\u2019s plan to allow parents back to work to boost the economy.</p> <p>Teaching unions warned that a September start for all pupils should not be taken for granted, and called for a national recovery plan for education. \u201cThe consequences of Covid-19 are going to be felt in our education system for months to come,\u201d said Dr Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union (NEU).</p> <p>With fears of a second spike in infections, the NEU is advising the government to develop a national approach to \u201cblended learning\u201d combining education at home and school, with increased support for disadvantaged children, including free internet access. There have been growing concerns about the disparity in quality and quantity of online learning available to pupils since lockdown. </p> <p>The union also suggested the requisitioning of local public spaces, including libraries and community centres, to reduce pressure on school space. \u201cThe scale of the challenge is immense,\u201d said Bousted. \u201cWe need a national recovery plan for education along the lines of the job recovery plan.\u201d</p> <p>A string of Conservative MPs \u2013 including the former education ministers Robert Halfon and Tim Loughton \u2013 called on the government to consider radical measures to help pupils lagging behind after missing up to six months of education. Halfon, the chair of the education select committee, warned there would be an \u201cepidemic of educational poverty\u201d without more assistance for those most at risk of falling behind.</p> <p>Loughton suggested catch-up schemes and mentoring over the summer using \u201cNational Citizen Service youth workers \u2026 or mobilising the many students who are now delaying going to university and will find it hard to travel or get a job\u201d.</p> <p>Labour also called for ministers to consult unions, headteachers and parents on a new timetable for reopening, saying the government \u201cneed[s] to face up to the scale of damage this is doing to children and scale up their response\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow education secretary, said: \u201cThe starting point for this needs to be rapid action to support summer schemes for this summer.\u201d</p> <p>The SNP suggested England could follow Scotland with a plan for blended learning and use of libraries and council offices to relieve pressure on classroom space. Scotland has also suggested retired teachers could consider returning to the classroom.</p> <p>Williamson admitted helping children catch up could take \u201ca full year and more\u201d, but resisted the idea of summer schools.&nbsp;He said schools that were not able to reopen would be given \u201cbasic minimum curriculum requirements we expect them to deliver for all children\u201d.</p> <p>If the need for physical distancing persists in schools, more staff will have to be recruited to teach smaller classes, potentially from the thousands of disillusioned teachers who have left the profession in recent years over workload and pay.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson needs an urgent national plan to get all pupils back to school in England from September, with an army of support staff, the requisitioning of public buildings and extra help for disadvantaged students, unions and cross-party MPs have said. As the government admitted that most primary pupils in England would not get back to the classroom before summer, ministers were urged to set out a comprehensive strategy or risk an \u201cepidemic of educational poverty\u201d. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, had hoped all primary schools in the country would reopen four weeks before the summer holidays but was forced to admit on Tuesday that this would be missed because of the difficulty of keeping children apart and in bubbles of 15. Government sources said scientists were reluctant to advise the watering-down of physical distancing rules at this point in the pandemic. Another 286 coronavirus deaths were reported in the UK on Tuesday, with the number of excess deaths since lockdown hitting 63,000 \u2013 a toll believed to be greater than anywhere else except the US. Announcing the U-turn in the Commons, Williamson said he hoped all schools could return by September but could not guarantee that would be achieved. New statistics showed that just one in four eligible children in reception, year 1 and year 6 returned last week, undermining Johnson\u2019s plan to allow parents back to work to boost the economy. Teaching unions warned that a September start for all pupils should not be taken for granted, and called for a national recovery plan for education. \u201cThe consequences of Covid-19 are going to be felt in our education system for months to come,\u201d said Dr Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union (NEU). With fears of a second spike in infections, the NEU is advising the government to develop a national approach to \u201cblended learning\u201d combining education at home and school, with increased support for disadvantaged children, including free internet access. There have been growing concerns about the disparity in quality and quantity of online learning available to pupils since lockdown. The union also suggested the requisitioning of local public spaces, including libraries and community centres, to reduce pressure on school space. \u201cThe scale of the challenge is immense,\u201d said Bousted. \u201cWe need a national recovery plan for education along the lines of the job recovery plan.\u201d A string of Conservative MPs \u2013 including the former education ministers Robert Halfon and Tim Loughton \u2013 called on the government to consider radical measures to help pupils lagging behind after missing up to six months of education. Halfon, the chair of the education select committee, warned there would be an \u201cepidemic of educational poverty\u201d without more assistance for those most at risk of falling behind. Loughton suggested catch-up schemes and mentoring over the summer using \u201cNational Citizen Service youth workers \u2026 or mobilising the many students who are now delaying going to university and will find it hard to travel or get a job\u201d. Labour also called for ministers to consult unions, headteachers and parents on a new timetable for reopening, saying the government \u201cneed[s] to face up to the scale of damage this is doing to children and scale up their response\u201d. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow education secretary, said: \u201cThe starting point for this needs to be rapid action to support summer schemes for this summer.\u201d The SNP suggested England could follow Scotland with a plan for blended learning and use of libraries and council offices to relieve pressure on classroom space. Scotland has also suggested retired teachers could consider returning to the classroom. Williamson admitted helping children catch up could take \u201ca full year and more\u201d, but resisted the idea of summer schools. He said schools that were not able to reopen would be given \u201cbasic minimum curriculum requirements we expect them to deliver for all children\u201d. If the need for physical distancing persists in schools, more staff will have to be recruited to teach smaller classes, potentially from the thousands of disillusioned teachers who have left the profession in recent years over workload and pay. About one in five teachers (22%) quit within the first two years, rising to two in five after 10 years. According to official statistics, just over half of primary schools in England reopened to more pupils from 1 June. Williamson said that figure had now risen to more than 70% of primary schools. Schools will be permitted to open to more age groups if they have space, but not all have the facilities to keep children 2 metres apart, particularly those in smaller urban buildings. Defending the government\u2019s approach, Williamson said: \u201cWe believe this cautious, phased return is the most sensible course of action to take. While we are not able to welcome all primary children back for a full month before the summer, we continue to work with the sector on the next steps where we would like to see schools that have the capacity bring back more children to do so before the summer holidays \u2026 We will be working to bring all children back to school in September \u2026 Exams will take place next year.\u201d While Labour and the unions said the delay was right, the decision was met with dismay in some quarters, as the children\u2019s commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, warned that children\u2019s education was being forgotten while theme parks, pubs and shops were being allowed to reopen. She called on the government to come up with a coherent plan to make up for children\u2019s lost education and show the same level of determination that led to the opening of emergency Nightingale hospitals and the introduction of the furlough scheme to save millions of jobs. Schools may have to build additional portable buildings or find temporary accommodation in sports halls or empty offices to accommodate more children safely, she said. \u201cSome worry that the economy is clearly being prioritised and education is not being prioritised at the same level. From everything that\u2019s been said, [children] could be going to theme parks and sitting in pub gardens with their parents, or they could be shopping, but they will not be in school.

The cause of Pierre Nkurunziza\u2019s death was described as a heart attack in a government statement. The 55-year-old was due to stand down in August following elections last month. It was unclear exactly when he died. A government statement said the president, a keen sports enthusiast, had attended a game of volleyball on Saturday but fell ill that night and was taken to hospital. The former footballer\u2019s health improved on Sunday but \u201csurprisingly, on morning of Monday June 8, 2020, his health suddenly deteriorated and he had a heart attack\u201d. The statement described Nkurunziza\u2019s death as \u201cunexpected\u201d and asked people to remain calm. Seven days of mourning have been announced. Nkurunziza had refused to impose restrictions in the small and poor African country, allowing sporting events and mass political rallies to go ahead. Speculation about the cause of his death has been fuelled by unconfirmed reports that his wife was flown to Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, 10 days ago after contracting Covid-19. Authorities in Burundi have been accused of deliberately playing down the threat posed by the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected 197,000 people on the African continent and killed more than 5,000. The nation of 11 million people has reported 83 cases of Covid-19 and officials have cited divine protection for Burundi\u2019s ostensibly low infection rate and urged citizens to go about their daily lives without fear. Nkurunziza\u2019s spokesperson said that although the country may be hit by the pandemic, \u201cBurundi \u2026 has signed a special covenant with God, whether you believe it or not\u201d. Burundi refused to follow most other African nations in imposing a lockdown and expelled the World Health Organization\u2019s expert team working on coronavirus. Nkurunziza was forced to step aside after 15 years in power by opponents within the country\u2019s ruling CNDD-FDD party, but was to become \u201csupreme guide\u201d with wide if ill-defined power. As former leader he would have received a $500,000 (\u00a3410,000) gift from the nation along with a luxury villa. The elections were won by Gen \u00c9variste Ndayishimiye, who analysts say was selected because he was acceptable to a powerful clique of senior military officers. The opposition claimed the poll had been rigged. Rights groups accused the ruling party and its youth wing of systematically crushing dissent. Between January and March, Ligue Iteka, an exiled Burundian human rights organisation, documented 67 killings, including 14 extrajudicial executions, six disappearances, 15 cases of gender-based violence, 23 cases of torture, and 204 arbitrary arrests. There was also some violence directed against ruling party members and youths \u2013 including killings \u2013 but at much lower levels. Burundi became diplomatically isolated after 2015, when Nkurunziza\u2019s decision to run for a third term \u2013 a move his opponents said violated the peace deal that ended the civil war \u2013 sparked protests met with extreme violence by the youth wing of the ruling party, known as the Imbonerakure, and the security forces. Hundreds of thousands of Burundians fled into exile. Burundi withdrew from the international criminal court in 2017 and shut down the United Nations office on human rights last year. \u201cAs I learn of the passing of Pierre Nkurunziza, I think of the thousands of lives that his regime cut short. The families that won\u2019t see justice,\u201d tweeted Thierry Uwamahoro, a democracy activist and prominent government critic who lives in exile. Journalists and human rights workers in Burundi are routinely targeted. Last week, four journalists from the domestic news website Iwacu were sentenced to two and a half years in prison after they travelled to investigate reports of unrest in the north-west of the country.",

      "bodyText": "All statues in Labour councils across England and Wales, and across London, will be examined for links to slavery and plantation owners, their leaders have said, as an east London authority took one down off its plinth on Tuesday evening. The statue of slave owner Robert Milligan at West India Quay in London\u2019s Docklands was removed using a JCB, after the charity which owns the land where it stood promised to organise its \u201csafe removal\u201d following a petition launched by Ehtasham Haque. The local council, Tower Hamlets, said it had removed the statue and had \u201calso announced a review into monuments and other sites in our borough to understand how we should represent the more troubling periods in our history\u201d. Earlier, the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said the capital\u2019s landmarks \u2013 including street names, the names of public buildings and plaques \u2013 would be reviewed by a commission to ensure they reflect the capital\u2019s diversity, with a view to removing those with links to slavery after Black Lives Matter protesters tore down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol. In Manchester, the council announced a city-wide review of all the statues in Manchester \u201cto understand their history and context\u201d. Councillor Luthfur Rahman said members of the public would also be asked for suggestions on \u201cmissing\u201d statues. \u201cWe also want to take this opportunity to ask the public who is missing \u2013 who should be celebrated but is not \u2013 with particular thought around representing the proud BAME [black and minority ethnic] history of Manchester and help to reflect the shared story of our diverse and multicultural city,\u201d he said. Manchester city council is under pressure to remove a statue of Sir Robert Peel in Piccadilly Gardens. Over a thousand people have signed a petition demanding the removal of the memorial to the two-time British prime minister, born in Bury in Greater Manchester, on the grounds that his father was known to be pro-slavery. Labour councils across England and Wales will begin reviews in their towns and cities too, the Local Government Association\u2019s Labour group said. It will ask council leaders to work with their communities to review \u201cthe appropriateness\u201d of monuments and statues in their areas. Speaking to broadcasters on Tuesday, Khan said he did not condone breaking the law and wanted there to be a proper process for the removal of any statues that do not reflect London\u2019s values. He would not name which ones should come down, saying it would be a matter for the new commission, but said there were clearly statues commemorating slavers in the capital. Khan\u2019s new Commission for Diversity in the Public Realm will also consider which legacies should be celebrated before making recommendations about new statues and which could be removed. \u201cIt is an uncomfortable truth that our nation and city owes a large part of its wealth to its role in the slave trade and while this is reflected in our public realm, the contribution of many of our communities to life in our capital has been wilfully ignored. This cannot continue \u2026 \u201cThe Black Lives Matter protests have rightly brought this to the public\u2019s attention, but it\u2019s important that we take the right steps to work together to bring change and ensure that we can all be proud of our public landscape.\u201d The commission \u2013 which will be co-chaired by Debbie Weekes-Bernard, the deputy mayor for social integration, social mobility and community engagement, and the deputy mayor for culture and creative industries, Justine Simons \u2013 will include historians as well as arts, council and community leaders. Pressed on Sky News about where to draw the line, given Winston Churchill held some racist views, Khan said the cases of Churchill, Gandhi and Malcolm X showed that many great historical figures were not perfect and history should be taught \u201cwarts and all\u201d. But there were clear-cut figures such as those actively involved in the slave trade and ownership who should not be celebrated, the mayor said. Khan announced the commission as he attempted to defuse tensions in London ahead of more planned anti-racism demonstrations. The London mayor is also pressing the Metropolitan police, the UK\u2019s largest force, over the use of stop and search, stun guns and other practices amid concerns about the spread of coronavirus in crowds, and fears of violence as it emerged that far-right groups were planning counter-demonstrations. The global Black Lives Matter protests were sparked by the death in the US of George Floyd at the hands of a police officer who held him with a knee on his neck for nine minutes while he protested: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d. The UK government has come under fire for its claim that the spreading protests are related to the US rather than prejudice in the UK and denials that Britain is a racist country. Boris Johnson said on Monday that Floyd\u2019s death had awakened an \u201cincontrovertible, undeniable feeling of injustice\u201d worldwide. He had previously condemned the \u201cthuggery\u201d by a minority that marred some demonstrations but acknowledged many of the activists\u2019 concerns were \u201cfounded on a cold reality\u201d. He said leaders \u201csimply can\u2019t ignore\u201d concerns that black, Asian and minority ethnic groups face discrimination in education, employment and the criminal justice system. However, the prime minister said those who harmed police or property would face \u201cthe full force of the law\u201d. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, has said it was \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d for protesters to pull down the statue of Colston and dump it in the harbour in Bristol \u2013 putting him at odds with some MPs on the left of his party \u2013 while emphasising the monument should never have been there in the first place. After police stood by and watched the statue being toppled in Bristol, the focus will shift on Tuesday to Oxford, where hundreds of students and residents are expected to attend a protest calling for the removal of Oxford University\u2019s statue of the colonialist Cecil Rhodes. A symbolic and socially distanced commemoration is planned at the Nelson Mandela statue in Parliament Square in London at 5pm, organised by Stand Up To Racism.",

This week, the Samoa Times, founded 19 years ago, was forced to close due to the Covid-19 crisis.</p> <h2>What has happened this week?</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>CNMI:</strong> The Marianas recorded two more positive cases last week, and then another asymptomatic case on Tuesday. This raises the total to 28. All three arrived from Guam, but originated from the United States.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Guam:</strong> The WHO has recorded 171 confirmed cases with five deaths. This is an increase of five cases from last week.</p></li> <li><p><strong>West Papua:</strong> The Jakarta Post reports there have been 1,243 cases in the provinces of Papua and West Papua. Nine people have died. The government of Papua New Guinea last week agreed to open its borders to 30 PNG nationals who had been held since January by Indonesian authorities. Indonesian officials said 25 had been convicted of crimes, and five were overstayers.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Papua New Guinea:</strong> The country remains stable at eight reported cases, but concerns are still high, especially considering the situation on its porous western border with Indonesia. The governor of East Sepik, Allan Bird, has called on the government to collect local data about the effects of Covid-19, citing a study in that province that showed 4% of 1,100 people tested had Covid-19 antibodies in their bloodstream, despite no one in the region testing positive for Covid-19 during the state of emergency. </p></li> <li><p><strong>French Pacific Territories:</strong> There are 20 recorded cases in New Caledonia, with no new infections recorded since last week. The most recent case, a police officer, arrived in Noumea in mid-May. He tested negative prior to departure. In French Polynesia, the number of cases remains unchanged from last week, at 60. The leader of French Polynesia\u2019s largest church has joined a chorus demanding that rotation of officials from France be suspended. Travellers from virus-free Wallis and Futuna are the first people to travel to New Caledonia without undergoing quarantine.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Fiji:</strong> With 18 infections all cleared up, and no new cases in a month and a half, the nation has declared itself virus-free. A curfew remains in place between 10pm and 5am. Schools will reopen on 30 June.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Solomon Islands:</strong> The first four Covid-19 tests to be carried out in-country all came back negative. The country remains under a state of emergency until 25 July. Government data reveals that tourist arrivals into the country fell nearly 50% in the first quarter of 2020, with only 752 people coming in to the country during March.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Vanuatu:</strong> The country is still virus-free, and is focused now on repatriation efforts. A Radio Australia report suggests that over 7,000 Vanuatu citizens and residents are waiting to return home. The bulk of them are seasonal workers in Australia and New Zealand, but hundreds were trapped while traveling casually, and risk overstaying temporary visas.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Marshall Islands:</strong> Community pressure continues for the government to ease the requirement that container ships undergo 14 days quarantine before having their cargo unloaded. The quarantine requirements are leading to fresh produce being spoiled and putting up costs.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Cook Islands:</strong> Citizens and work permit holders who have been in New Zealand for a period of at least 30 days will be allowed to return to Cook Islands as of 15 June.</p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ead9e38a0be05dff3f4b906399fd716352c7f31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ead9e38a0be05dff3f4b906399fd716352c7f31/0_0_3543_2127/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A nurse sits at a screening station for anyone presenting with a cough or flu like symptoms at Warangoin Clinic in East New Britain province, Papua New Guinea\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A nurse sits at a screening station for anyone with a cough or flu-like symptoms at Warangoin Clinic in East New Britain province, Papua New Guinea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kalo Fainu/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>What are Pacific governments doing?</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>Papua New Guinea:</strong> The country is still treating the virus as a live threat. Parliament voted by 80-2 to extend the state of emergency to 16 June. Schools have resumed but there are serious challenges caused by social distancing requirements and lack of resources. The government received another US$600,000 worth of personal protective equipment, or PPE, as well as six new ventilators. </p></li> <li><p><strong>New Caledonia:</strong> Anti-independence members of the French National Assembly have castigated the government in Noumea for accepting what they called a usurious $US270m loan from the French Development Agency. They warned that repayment terms would stifle attempts to get the local economy back on its feet, and widen the economic divide between rich and poor.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Fiji:</strong> The government last week declared the nation officially virus-free. Fuelling rising hopes that the tourism sector might be resurrected, a survey of Americans listed Fiji in third place among countries they would most like to visit when borders reopen.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Vanuatu:</strong> The Australian government is providing more than A$4.3m in assistance to help Vanuatu roll out its own massive bailout package. The money will be spent on improving underresourced financial administrative systems in order to speed the processing and delivery of funds. </p></li> <li><p><strong>Samoa:</strong> The associate minister for health has been accused of breaching restrictions on social gatherings after a video emerged, apparently showing more than five people had attended an open house. Tofa Li\u2019o Foleni denied the allegations, insisting that only five people had been invited. The rest of the people present were his children, he said.</p></li> <li><p><strong>French Polynesia:</strong> With borders reopening to tourists, the territory announced a number of requirements for visitors. These include a negative test no more than 72 hours prior to departure, or an immunity certificate showing a successful recovery.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Marshall Islands: </strong>The Marshall Islands Journal reports that the government has approved a $6m Covid-19 economic relief program to support local businesses.</p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e1aed7907a1bef84d101fa32d827328faddd902\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e1aed7907a1bef84d101fa32d827328faddd902/0_146_4737_2842/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Four thousand New Zealanders marched in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement in Auckland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Four thousand New Zealanders marched in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement in Auckland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Bradley/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Australia and New Zealand</h2> <p>The number of confirmed cases for New Zealand remains unchanged from last week at 1,154 with 22 deaths.

      "bodyText": "Here is the latest news about the Covid-19 outbreak across the Pacific, from Dan McGarry and Tess Newton Cain on Wednesday 10 June. The total number of cases of Covid-19 infection across the region stands at 305. This week, Fiji and New Zealand joined 13 of their neighbours in declaring themselves virus-free. New Zealand\u2019s successful eradication of Covid-19 led the Cook Islands to relax its travel ban slightly between the two countries, allowing workers and residents to enter. Some in the Pacific are hoping the drop in case numbers could lead to a restarting of tourism, but others are still fearful, mindful of limited public health infrastructure in the region \u2013 and globally, no vaccine. Hundreds of cruise ship workers, most of whom had been stuck in isolation for months on board empty ships, were finally flown back to Fiji and Vanuatu by their employer, Carnival Australia. The economic downturn continues to bite. This week, the Samoa Times, founded 19 years ago, was forced to close due to the Covid-19 crisis. What has happened this week? CNMI: The Marianas recorded two more positive cases last week, and then another asymptomatic case on Tuesday. This raises the total to 28. All three arrived from Guam, but originated from the United States. Guam: The WHO has recorded 171 confirmed cases with five deaths. This is an increase of five cases from last week. West Papua: The Jakarta Post reports there have been 1,243 cases in the provinces of Papua and West Papua. Nine people have died. The government of Papua New Guinea last week agreed to open its borders to 30 PNG nationals who had been held since January by Indonesian authorities. Indonesian officials said 25 had been convicted of crimes, and five were overstayers. Papua New Guinea: The country remains stable at eight reported cases, but concerns are still high, especially considering the situation on its porous western border with Indonesia. The governor of East Sepik, Allan Bird, has called on the government to collect local data about the effects of Covid-19, citing a study in that province that showed 4% of 1,100 people tested had Covid-19 antibodies in their bloodstream, despite no one in the region testing positive for Covid-19 during the state of emergency. French Pacific Territories: There are 20 recorded cases in New Caledonia, with no new infections recorded since last week. The most recent case, a police officer, arrived in Noumea in mid-May. He tested negative prior to departure. In French Polynesia, the number of cases remains unchanged from last week, at 60. The leader of French Polynesia\u2019s largest church has joined a chorus demanding that rotation of officials from France be suspended. Travellers from virus-free Wallis and Futuna are the first people to travel to New Caledonia without undergoing quarantine. Fiji: With 18 infections all cleared up, and no new cases in a month and a half, the nation has declared itself virus-free. A curfew remains in place between 10pm and 5am. Schools will reopen on 30 June. Solomon Islands: The first four Covid-19 tests to be carried out in-country all came back negative. The country remains under a state of emergency until 25 July. Government data reveals that tourist arrivals into the country fell nearly 50% in the first quarter of 2020, with only 752 people coming in to the country during March. Vanuatu: The country is still virus-free, and is focused now on repatriation efforts. A Radio Australia report suggests that over 7,000 Vanuatu citizens and residents are waiting to return home. The bulk of them are seasonal workers in Australia and New Zealand, but hundreds were trapped while traveling casually, and risk overstaying temporary visas. Marshall Islands: Community pressure continues for the government to ease the requirement that container ships undergo 14 days quarantine before having their cargo unloaded. The quarantine requirements are leading to fresh produce being spoiled and putting up costs. Cook Islands: Citizens and work permit holders who have been in New Zealand for a period of at least 30 days will be allowed to return to Cook Islands as of 15 June. What are Pacific governments doing? Papua New Guinea: The country is still treating the virus as a live threat. Parliament voted by 80-2 to extend the state of emergency to 16 June. Schools have resumed but there are serious challenges caused by social distancing requirements and lack of resources. The government received another US$600,000 worth of personal protective equipment, or PPE, as well as six new ventilators. New Caledonia: Anti-independence members of the French National Assembly have castigated the government in Noumea for accepting what they called a usurious $US270m loan from the French Development Agency. They warned that repayment terms would stifle attempts to get the local economy back on its feet, and widen the economic divide between rich and poor. Fiji: The government last week declared the nation officially virus-free. Fuelling rising hopes that the tourism sector might be resurrected, a survey of Americans listed Fiji in third place among countries they would most like to visit when borders reopen. Vanuatu: The Australian government is providing more than A$4.3m in assistance to help Vanuatu roll out its own massive bailout package. The money will be spent on improving underresourced financial administrative systems in order to speed the processing and delivery of funds. Samoa: The associate minister for health has been accused of breaching restrictions on social gatherings after a video emerged, apparently showing more than five people had attended an open house. Tofa Li\u2019o Foleni denied the allegations, insisting that only five people had been invited. The rest of the people present were his children, he said. French Polynesia: With borders reopening to tourists, the territory announced a number of requirements for visitors. These include a negative test no more than 72 hours prior to departure, or an immunity certificate showing a successful recovery. Marshall Islands: The Marshall Islands Journal reports that the government has approved a $6m Covid-19 economic relief program to support local businesses. Australia and New Zealand The number of confirmed cases for New Zealand remains unchanged from last week at 1,154 with 22 deaths. The New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, announced on Monday that her nation had successfully eliminated Covid-19, but warned \u201celimination is not a point in time, it is a sustained effort\u201d. The country has lifted all restrictions domestically, but its borders remain closed. In Australia, the number of active cases stands at 7,260, which is an increase of 58 from last week. There have been 102 deaths. Tens of thousands in Australia and New Zealand braved the virus threat to march in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movements. Large numbers of Pacific islanders attended, many highlighting the legacy of racism toward them. Australia\u2019s minister for the Pacific, Alex Hawke, was dismissive, calling the marchers \u201cself-indulgent\u201d. What did they say? In many Pacific Small Island Developing States ... imported foods constitute half of a person\u2019s food intake. If the pandemic continues, and the global and local supply chain \u2013 from production, processing, export, transportation to import \u2013 is affected, it will disrupt the region\u2019s food systems. \u2013 Eriko Hibi, FAO sub-regional coordinator for the Pacific and representative to 13 Pacific states Good news The Solomon Islands government has waived examination fees for all students in forms five and six, citing the economic hardships associated with Covid-19. In Vanuatu the minister for finance, Johnny Koanapo, has announced that all small and medium enterprises that have business licences will receive a one-off stimulus grant of VT60,000 (A$733). Infection and fatality figures in this article are valid as of 8 June. They are based on WHO daily situation reports, and supplemented in some cases by national government updates. Inconsistencies in running sum totals may result because of reconciliations in country totals, and revisions of previous data.",

      "bodyText": "Extremists are exploiting gaps in existing laws to push their agenda, such as peddling antisemitic coronavirus conspiracy theories, a former counter-terror chief has warned as a major review of current legislation is launched. A former assistant commissioner for specialist operations at the Metropolitan police, Sir Mark Rowley, has been asked to lead a review to examine whether existing legislation adequately deals with \u201chateful extremism\u201d. Rowley, who was appointed by the head of the Commission for Countering Extremism (CCE), Sara Khan, said he believed the UK had a strong counter-terrorism system in place but the country is less ready to address growing threats from hateful extremists who encourage community tensions. The CCE, which advises the government on new policies to deal with extremism, cited a recent rise in antisemitic posts and conspiracy theories linking coronavirus to the Jewish community as \u201chateful extremism\u201d. Rowley said: \u201cExtremism, hate crime and terrorism have all been increasing challenges for our communities and society as a whole. \u201cWhile I was in post as head of counter-terrorism policing for four years, I knew that we had a strong counter-terrorism system, resources and laws in place. \u201cHowever, I increasingly realised that nationally we are less experienced and ready to address the growing threats from hateful extremists who encourage community tensions, the rise in hate crime and some to even become terrorists. \u201cWhen Sara asked me to look from an operational perspective at whether the existing legal framework has gaps that allow extremists to flourish, I was initially cautious \u2013 not least because successive governments have tried to tackle this very problem, by proposing new legislation, and failed. \u201cHowever, after some initial scoping I am convinced that the commission\u2019s clarity of focus on \u2018hateful extremism\u2019 can help identify the gaps that exist at the boundaries of current laws, such as hate crime and terrorism, which are being exploited daily by extremists.\u201d The CCE\u2019s first major report found far-right activists were exploiting community tensions by swooping into towns and cities and distorting the truth in an effort to turn residents against minorities, particularly Muslims. Khan visited 20 towns and cities and sifted through 3,000 responses to a call for evidence to produce her first major report, published on Monday, titled Challenging Hateful Extremism. She concluded in her report that the government\u2019s response to extremism was \u201cinadequate\u201d, \u201cunfocused\u201d and urgently needed a complete overhaul. The review called on the government to focus on what the commission calls \u201chateful extremism\u201d, which stands apart from terrorism and violent extremism. As part of his legal review, Rowley has been tasked to identify whether there are gaps in existing legislation or inconsistencies in enforcing the law in relation to hateful extremism and make recommendations that are compatible with existing legal and human rights obligations. Khan said the UK authorities \u201cability to counter repeat and persistent offenders is inconsistent and often ineffective\u201d. \u201cWhen extremists engage in terrorist activity, they are often caught by robust counter-terrorism legislation. But when they incite hatred, engage in persistent hatred or justify violence against others, extremists know they will not cross over into the threshold of terrorism.\u201d Khan said a legal review was \u201ceven more pertinent\u201d during the current pandemic as extremists propagate \u201chorrific\u201d material which seeks to blame and incite hatred and violence against other people in society.",

In her poem American Arithmetic, she notes that \u201cNative Americans make up less than / 1 percent of the population of America\u201d, but \u201cPolice kill Native Americans more / than any other race\u201d.</p> <p><em>\u201cRace</em>&nbsp;is a funny word. /&nbsp;<em>Race&nbsp;</em>implies someone will win, / implies,&nbsp;<em>I have as good a chance of winning as \u2013 //&nbsp;</em>Who wins the race that isn\u2019t a race?\u201d she asks.</p> <p>Diaz, who was born in Fort Mojave Indian Village in California, says that the poem \u201cwas written in acknowledgment of, solidarity with, and in conversation with the police violence perpetrated against all black and brown people in the United States\u201d, adding that her poetry is a demand for \u201ca different visibility, one that makes my nation uncomfortable \u2013 my speakers refused to be defined by their wounds and would instead sow them and reap light from them\u201d.</p> <p>Postcolonial Love Poem is up against four other titles for the \u00a310,000 prize. David Morley is nominated for FURY, which takes its title from the boxer Tyson Fury and includes verbatim quotes from him: \u201cNothing\u2019s talked about in my family \u2026 we just give each other a punch.\u201d Vicki Feaver\u2019s I Want! I Want!, her fourth collection in 40 years, draws its title from William Blake\u2019s illustration of a child reaching for the moon, and moves from her childhood ambition to be a poet, to becoming a woman \u201cburied under ice with words burning inside\u201d. Pascale Petit is nominated for Tiger Girl, an exploration of her grandmother\u2019s Indian heritage growing up near the forests of Ranthambore in Rajasthan, as is Caroline Bird\u2019s The Air Year, named for the time before the first, or \u201cpaper\u201d, anniversary in a relationship.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e16280aa0dbf6073d8574e2dd0be05c9346ef5c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e16280aa0dbf6073d8574e2dd0be05c9346ef5c2/0_0_1204_1505/800.jpg\" alt=\"Will Harris, poet.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Will Harris, who is nominated for his first collection RENDANG.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Etienne Gilfillan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chair of judges and social historian Alexandra Harris said the judging process had coincided almost exactly with the first two months of lockdown.</p> <p>\u201cNone of the books were written for a pandemic, but it was noticeable how often a strong poem would seem as true to the hour and the day as the constantly updated news,\u201d she said, describing the collections on the shortlist as \u201crich in energy and surprise, intellectually agile, sensuous, made to last\u201d.</p> <p>Harris said that almost everyone had been turning to poetry over the course of the spring, with even Vanity Fair going so far as to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/04/why-poetry-is-having-a-moment-amid-the-global-quarantine\">identify the coronavirus pandemic as \u201ca moment\u201d for the art form</a>.</p> <p>\u201cPoetry had a moment that lasted through both world wars. It has a moment whenever there is pressure and threat, and whenever we want to think carefully \u2013 together or individually,\u201d she said. \u201cIn times of distraction it can carve out a space of concentration. Poems can shake or shock or magnetise our ideas into new configurations.\u201d</p> <p>The five collections in the running for the \u00a35,000 Felix Dennis prize for best first collection have also been announced, including Will Harris\u2019s debut RENDANG, an exploration of his Anglo-Indonesian heritage, and Nina Mingya Powles\u2019s Magnolia \u6728\u862d, which sees her writing of Disney\u2019s film Mulan, and learning the Mandarin of her grandparents.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9f9e73e837df59cd041f47aac6ef4e77f45926a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f9e73e837df59cd041f47aac6ef4e77f45926a9/414_230_3717_2232/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In the running again \u2026 Fiona Benson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the running again \u2026 Fiona Benson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last year\u2019s best collection winner Fiona Benson is nominated for the \u00a31,000 prize for best poem with her poem, Mama Cockroach, I Love You, as is previous nominee Malika Booker and the Belarusian poet Valzhyna Mort.</p> <p>The winners will be announced on 25 October. Meanwhile, on 30 June, the awards are launching a Meet the Poet online series, which will feature readings from the shortlisted books and the chance to ask the poets about their work. Herbert said the initiative was partly inspired by 2014 Forward prizes judge Jeremy Paxman, who called for a \u201cPoetry Inquisition\u201d so the public could \u2018\u201cask poets to explain why they chose to write about the particular subject they wrote about, and why they chose the particular form and language, idiom, the rest of it\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAt last!

      "bodyText": "A poetic exploration of the wounds the US has inflicted on its indigenous people, written by one of the few remaining speakers of the Mojave language, has made the shortlist for the prestigious Forward prize for best collection. As Black Lives Matter protests sweep the world in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd, Natalie Diaz \u2013 a MacArthur \u201cGenius\u201d grant recipient and former professional basketball player \u2013 writes in her collection, Postcolonial Love Poem, of police violence against Native Americans. In her poem American Arithmetic, she notes that \u201cNative Americans make up less than / 1 percent of the population of America\u201d, but \u201cPolice kill Native Americans more / than any other race\u201d. \u201cRace is a funny word. / Race implies someone will win, / implies, I have as good a chance of winning as \u2013 // Who wins the race that isn\u2019t a race?\u201d she asks. Diaz, who was born in Fort Mojave Indian Village in California, says that the poem \u201cwas written in acknowledgment of, solidarity with, and in conversation with the police violence perpetrated against all black and brown people in the United States\u201d, adding that her poetry is a demand for \u201ca different visibility, one that makes my nation uncomfortable \u2013 my speakers refused to be defined by their wounds and would instead sow them and reap light from them\u201d. Postcolonial Love Poem is up against four other titles for the \u00a310,000 prize. David Morley is nominated for FURY, which takes its title from the boxer Tyson Fury and includes verbatim quotes from him: \u201cNothing\u2019s talked about in my family \u2026 we just give each other a punch.\u201d Vicki Feaver\u2019s I Want! I Want!, her fourth collection in 40 years, draws its title from William Blake\u2019s illustration of a child reaching for the moon, and moves from her childhood ambition to be a poet, to becoming a woman \u201cburied under ice with words burning inside\u201d. Pascale Petit is nominated for Tiger Girl, an exploration of her grandmother\u2019s Indian heritage growing up near the forests of Ranthambore in Rajasthan, as is Caroline Bird\u2019s The Air Year, named for the time before the first, or \u201cpaper\u201d, anniversary in a relationship. Chair of judges and social historian Alexandra Harris said the judging process had coincided almost exactly with the first two months of lockdown. \u201cNone of the books were written for a pandemic, but it was noticeable how often a strong poem would seem as true to the hour and the day as the constantly updated news,\u201d she said, describing the collections on the shortlist as \u201crich in energy and surprise, intellectually agile, sensuous, made to last\u201d. Harris said that almost everyone had been turning to poetry over the course of the spring, with even Vanity Fair going so far as to identify the coronavirus pandemic as \u201ca moment\u201d for the art form. \u201cPoetry had a moment that lasted through both world wars. It has a moment whenever there is pressure and threat, and whenever we want to think carefully \u2013 together or individually,\u201d she said. \u201cIn times of distraction it can carve out a space of concentration. Poems can shake or shock or magnetise our ideas into new configurations.\u201d The five collections in the running for the \u00a35,000 Felix Dennis prize for best first collection have also been announced, including Will Harris\u2019s debut RENDANG, an exploration of his Anglo-Indonesian heritage, and Nina Mingya Powles\u2019s Magnolia \u6728\u862d, which sees her writing of Disney\u2019s film Mulan, and learning the Mandarin of her grandparents. Last year\u2019s best collection winner Fiona Benson is nominated for the \u00a31,000 prize for best poem with her poem, Mama Cockroach, I Love You, as is previous nominee Malika Booker and the Belarusian poet Valzhyna Mort. The winners will be announced on 25 October. Meanwhile, on 30 June, the awards are launching a Meet the Poet online series, which will feature readings from the shortlisted books and the chance to ask the poets about their work. Herbert said the initiative was partly inspired by 2014 Forward prizes judge Jeremy Paxman, who called for a \u201cPoetry Inquisition\u201d so the public could \u2018\u201cask poets to explain why they chose to write about the particular subject they wrote about, and why they chose the particular form and language, idiom, the rest of it\u201d. \u201cAt last! A chance to ask poets what they\u2019re on about. It\u2019s been too long,\u201d said Paxman of the new initiative.

      "bodyText": "The grounding of air travel during the coronavirus pandemic could prompt a jobs crisis in British aviation on the scale of the coal mining industry\u2019s collapse during the 1980s, a report has warned. Putting ministers on notice for a surge in redundancies as airlines confront a future with fewer journeys made by plane even after the outbreak recedes, the New Economics Foundation (NEF) said at least 70,000 jobs in the wider aviation industry \u2013 including engineering, catering and duty free shopping \u2013 were at risk before the end of summer. Thousands of workers in the industry will have to retrain in other areas of the economy, it said. Compiled in collaboration with the TUC, aviation unions and the climate action charity Possible, the study warned this figure would match the job losses in the coal industry in 1980-81 in the early years of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s newly elected Tory government, which left lasting scars for communities across the north, Midlands, Wales and Scotland. The warning on aviation jobs comes at a crucial time for firms that have furloughed workers in the UK. Covering the wage bill of almost 9 million workers, the transition away from the furlough scheme is expected to trigger a wave of redundancies in the coming weeks, as the government gradually reduces the support available from August until the scheme closes at the end of October. Redundancy consultations require between 30 and 45 days, depending on the number of staff affected, meaning companies deciding to cut jobs will have to start the process in the coming days. Firms will have to decide whether they can afford to keep staff on furlough when they have to start contributing towards the cost of the government scheme or choose to make workers redundant. Airlines have been among the biggest beneficiaries of government support, with British Airways, Ryanair and easyJet placing more than 25,000 staff on furlough between them and borrowing \u00a31.5bn using cheap government-backed loans from the Bank of England. However, against a backdrop of new quarantine restrictions, reduced passenger demand due to the health risks from Covid-19, and with fewer planned journeys expected in future, the airlines still plan to make thousands of job cuts this year. Faced with the prospect of mounting job losses at aviation industry hubs across Britain, the NEF urged ministers to transform the furlough wage subsidy scheme into a retraining programme to help people move into other sectors. Calling on the industry to negotiate redundancy limits with trade unions, it also said any airline industry bailouts should come with tough conditions forcing the suspension of shareholder dividends, excessive executive pay and tax avoidance, while also demanding firms invest more in green technology and decarbonisation. Of the 70,000 jobs immediately at risk over the next three months, the leftwing thinktank said 39,000 were directly in aviation jobs. The remainder are likely to be lost in the wider supply chain surrounding the sector in engineering, food catering, and duty free shopping. The NEF said at least 17,000 workers in the sector would need to permanently move into other areas of the economy, warning that aviation sector employment is unlikely to ever return to pre-crisis levels due to service cutbacks, automation and technological developments. \u201cWe cannot consign these workers to the despair of unemployment,\u201d said Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the TUC. \u201cAviation needs immediate support \u2013 and not just to protect the incomes of billionaire airline owners.

coronavirus by people with no symptoms is \u201cvery rare\u201d, saying this guidance could pose problems for governments as they seek to lift lockdowns, <strong>Reuters</strong> reports. </p> <p> Maria van Kerkhove, an epidemiologist and the WHO\u2019s technical lead on the Covid-19 pandemic, said on Monday that many countries undertaking contact tracing had identified asymptomatic cases, but were not finding they caused further spread of the virus. \u201cIt is very rare,\u201d she said. </p> <p> \u201cI was quite surprised by the WHO statement,\u201d said Liam Smeeth, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who added that he had not seen the data Kerkhove\u2019s statement was based on. </p> <p> \u201cIt goes against my impressions from the science so far that suggest asymptomatic people \u2013 who never get symptoms \u2013 and pre-symptomatic people are an important source of infection to others.\u201d </p> <p>Smeeth and other experts said understanding the risks of transmission among people with mild or no symptoms is crucial as governments begin to ease the lockdown measures they imposed to try and reduce the pandemic\u2019s spread and gradually replace them with case tracking and isolation plans. <br></p> <p> \u201cThis has important implications for the track/trace/isolate measures being instituted in many countries,\u201d said Babak Javid, a Cambridge University Hospitals infectious diseases consultant. </p> <p>The co-head of Singapore\u2019s coronavirus taskforce told Reuters on Monday there had been asymptomatic transmission cases there, between people living in close quarters. However, China said last week that 300 symptomless coronavirus carriers in its central city of Wuhan, the pandemic\u2019s epicentre, had not been found to be infectious. </p> <p> Keith Neal, a professor of the epidemiology of infectious diseases at Britain\u2019s University of Nottingham, said that while the question of how big a role asymptomatic transmission plays in new infections is unclear, what is known is that people with symptoms are responsible for most of the spread of the disease. </p> <p> \u201cThis reinforces the importance of any person who has any of the symptoms of Covid-19 arranges a test .\u2026 as soon as possible and isolating until they get their test result,\u201d he said. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-09T12:24:18.754Z\">at 1.24pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5edf72428f083999a26dd07b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-09T11:42:19.983Z\">12.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hundreds more fatalities from Covid-19 in the north-west of <strong>England</strong> and in care homes have driven up the number of excess deaths since the <strong>UK</strong> went into lockdown to more than 63,000, a toll believed to be greater than those anywhere else except the US, writes <strong>Robert Booth</strong>, the Guardian\u2019s social affairs correspondent, in London. </p> <p>The number of deaths from the virus in England and Wales fell to 1,822 in the last week of May, the fewest for eight weeks, according to the latest data from the Office of National Statistics.

Many economists believe the pandemic will push the German economy into its biggest decline since the end of the second world war in the second quarter.</p> <p>Seasonally adjusted exports fell 24% on the month while imports slid by 16.5%. The trade surplus shrank to \u20ac3.2bn, the federal statistics office said. Economists polled by Reuters had expected exports to fall by 15.6% and saw imports down 16%. The trade surplus was expected to come in at \u20ac10bn.</p> <p>Alexander Krueger, an economist at Bankhaus Lampe, said a recovery may have already started due to a loosening of the lockdown and reopening of borders, but little was left of the last decade\u2019s export boom. \u201cThe road out of the corona trough is long, rocky and above all uncertain, especially for foreign trade,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Despite a \u20ac130bn stimulus package announced last week, which comes on top of \u20ac750bn worth of measures announced in March, the government expects the economy to shrink by 6.3% this year.

Hospital bosses say that such a massive increase in England is a realistic prospect, given so many people have been unable to have surgery and crucial diagnostic tests in recent months while the NHS\u2019s main priority has been minimising the damage from Covid-19. The total number of people waiting to undergo a procedure in a hospital in England such as a hernia repair, cataract removal or hip or knee replacement stood at 4.4 million before the pandemic. It then fell to 4.2 million because in March GPs referred fewer patients for care to help hospitals tackle the pandemic and also because some patients were reluctant to risk getting infected by going into hospital. However, the NHS Confederation estimates that it is likely to reach 9.8 million by the end of the year as a result of staff shortages and hospitals having to cap the number of patients they can treat at any one time because of strict physical distancing rules that reduce the number of beds available. Hi, Helen Sullivan with you now. I\u2019ll be bringing you the latest for the next few hours \u2013 get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan or via email: helen.sullivan[at]theguardian.com. Population-wide facemask use could push transmission down to controllable levels for national epidemics and could prevent further waves when combined with lockdowns, according to a UK study. The research, led by scientists at Cambridge and Greenwich universities, suggests lockdowns alone will not stop a resurgence, but that even homemade masks can dramatically reduce transmission rates if enough people wear them in public. Richard Stutt, who co-led the study at Cambridge, said: Our analyses support the immediate and universal adoption of facemasks by the public. He said the findings showed that, if widespread mask use were combined with social distancing and some lockdown measures, this could be an \u201cacceptable way of managing the pandemic and reopening economic activity\u201d long before the development and public availability of an effective vaccine. The study\u2019s findings were published in the \u201cProceedings of the Royal Society A\u201d scientific journal. The World Health Organization updated its guidance on Friday to recommend that governments ask everyone to wear fabric face masks in public areas where there is a risk to reduce the spread of the disease. Here are the latest developments: The World Health Organization\u2019s Covid-19 technical lead backtracked on her comment that asymptomatic transmission of the virus was \u201cvery rare\u201d. \u201cI think that it\u2019s a misunderstanding to state the asymptomatic transmission globally is very rare,\u201d Dr Maria Van Kerkhove said, noting modelling suggesting 40% of infections could be transmitted by people without symptoms. A group of EU member states called for medical and equipment stockpiles to be increased. The leaders of Denmark, Spain and Germany, as well as France, Belgium and Poland, called for measures to boost the bloc\u2019s long-term resilience to public health crises and backed proposals for shared research and development of vaccines and treatment. The epidemic in Mexico is advancing toward its peak level of infections, the World Health Organization warned. Mexico, where total confirmed cases exceed 120,000 and the death toll stands at about 14,000, began a gradual re-opening of the economy at the start of June. Pakistan should implement intermittent lockdowns to counter a surge in infections, the World Health Organization advised. The increase has come as the country was loosening restrictions. Zoos, safari parks and drive-in cinemas will be allowed to reopen in England from 15 June. Boris Johnson will make the official announcement on Wednesday. There have been sharp rises in reports of violence against women across Latin America, already a hotspot for gender-based violence, since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, the International Rescue Committee has said. Meghan Lopez, the IRC\u2019s regional director for Latin America, said some women and girls were stuck with perpetrators 24 hours a day. The world faces a food crisis worse than any seen for at least 50 years, the UN has warned. Social protections for poor people are urgently needed as the looming recession following the Covid-19 pandemic may put basic nutrition out of reach. A supreme court judge in Brazil has ordered Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s administration to resume publishing complete Covid-19 statistics. His government sparked outrage on Saturday by purging the health ministry website of data on to pandemic and announcing it would stop publishing the death toll or number of infections. Nearly one in five people in Iran may have been infected with coronavirus since the country\u2019s outbreak, a health official said. This meant the virus was \u201cmuch less lethal than we or the world had anticipated\u201d, said Ehsan Mostafavi, a member of the taskforce set up to combat Covid-19. Face masks will remain compulsory in all public spaces even after Spain\u2019s Covid-19 state of emergency ends on 22 June. \u201cThe message is one of prudence and caution,\u201d said the government spokeswoman, Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Montero. \u201cUntil there is a vaccine or a treatment, the virus remains a threat. We can\u2019t think that the danger has gone.\u201d Fifty-two Cuban medics who flew to Italy to help doctors treat Europe\u2019s first mass coronavirus outbreak returned home to a heroes\u2019 welcome. The medical brigade, comprising 36 doctors, 15 nurses and a logistics specialist, arrived in Milan on 22 March and were the first ever to be deployed to a European country. Up to 600 deaths in Kano, northern Nigeria, most within a single week in April, were caused by an undetected outbreak of Covid-19, officials said. Government investigations, which began after reports of hundreds of deaths caused alarm in Nigeria\u2019s second largest city, linked 50-60% of 979 \u201cmysterious\u201d deaths to the virus. Spain is not discussing any travel corridor with Britain, a Spanish foreign ministry source has said, after a UK tourism lobby group said corridors allowing unrestricted movement with a number of countries would open from 29 June. Spain is discussing with other European Union countries whether and how to allow tourism from Britain and other states, the source told Reuters. German exports and imports slumped in April, posting their biggest declines since 1990 as the coronavirus crisis slashed demand and adding to a gloomy outlook for Europe\u2019s biggest economy. China\u2019s education ministry has warned that Chinese students should consider whether to study in Australia because of a string of \u201cincidents of discrimination\u201d targeting people of Asian descent. Indonesia has reported its biggest daily rise in Covid-19 infections. The country\u2019s health ministry recorded 1,043 new cases in the past 24 hours, bringing its total to 33,076. There were also 40 new deaths, bringing the total number of fatalities to 1,923. Coronavirus may have been present and spreading in Wuhan as early as August last year, according to a study that analysed satellite imagery of car parks outside major hospitals and search engine data. Pakistan should implement intermittent lockdowns to counter a surge in infections, the World Health Organization has advised. The increase has come as the country was loosening restrictions, Agence France-Press (AFP) reported. Since the start of Pakistan\u2019s outbreak in March, the prime minister Imran Khan has opposed a nationwide lockdown, arguing the impoverished country cannot not afford it. Instead, Pakistan\u2019s four provinces ordered a patchwork of closures. But, last week, Khan said most of these restrictions would be lifted. That decision came as Pakistan\u2019s infection rate was worsening, as it is across all of South Asia, which had been less severely affected than many other regions of the globe. Brazil has suffered 1,272 more deaths and registered 32,091 new cases, its health ministry has said. The country has confirmed a total of 739,503 cases \u2013 the second highest level of contagion after the United States \u2013 and 38,406 deaths \u2013 the third highest national toll in the world. In England, zoos, safari parks and drive-in cinemas will be allowed to reopen in England from 15 June, as the UK\u2019s prime minister announces the latest easing of the country\u2019s lockdown measures. Boris Johnson will update the nation on Wednesday as he tries to reopen the economy while minimising the rate of transmission and strident criticism from many, who believe his government\u2019s preparations have been inadequate. Under pressure from zoos warning they face an exponential threat, Johnson will say they can reopen next week as long as they can uphold social-distancing rules. He will also announce the easing of restrictions on outdoor attractions where people remain in their cars, such as safari parks and drive-in cinemas, because the risk of spreading the disease is lower outside. Brazil has restored detailed Covid-19 data to the official national website, Reuters reports, following a scandal about the removal of cumulative totals and a ruling by a Supreme Court justice that the full set of information be reinstated. Here\u2019s a little more detail from the discussions global health officials are holding on Mexico\u2019s response to its epidemic. The officials, from both the World Health Organization (WHO) and its Americas\u2019 arm PAHO, have said physical distancing should continue until a vaccine is made available. They stressed that more testing is needed in Mexico before further economic reopening and that street protests could cause a spike of new cases. Mexico, where total confirmed cases exceed 120,000 and the death toll stands at about 14,000, began a gradual re-opening of the economy at the start of June. Morocco will start easing restrictions, though a full lifting of the state of emergency will be delayed until 10 July, Rabat has said. The country has been on lockdown since 20 March. The gradual relaxation will take into account disparities in the infection rate between Moroccan regions, the government added. The prime minister Saad Dine El Otmani is expected to brief the parliament on the next steps on Wednesday. Morocco has confirmed 8,437 cases, including 210 deaths, as the rise of hot spots within factories and families complicates efforts to curb contagion.

The epidemic in Mexico is advancing toward its peak level of infections, the World Health Organization\u2019s representative in the country Cristian Morales has warned. Morales described the response of the Mexican government as positive. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported 550 more deaths and 17,598 new cases, taking the respective totals in the country to 110,925 and 1,956,421. The leaders of six European Union nations have called for building up EU stocks of critical medicines and equipment and other measures to boost the bloc\u2019s long-term resilience to public health crises. The 27-nation EU and Britain have reported some 1.4m cases, or about a fifth of the global total. At the height of the crisis, many EU states resorted to protectionist measures, raising trade barriers to hinder the export of medical equipment to their neighbours. In a joint paper sent to European commission president Ursula von der Leyen on Tuesday, the leaders of Denmark, Spain and Germany, as well as France, Belgium and Poland, backed proposals for shared research and development of vaccines and treatment. A broader, holistic EU strategy could be more efficient than each member state attempting to enhance preparedness on their own. Portugal\u2019s government expects a deficit equal to 6.3% of GDP in 2020 because of the pandemic, budget secretary of state Jo\u00e3o Le\u00e3o has said, foreshadowing a painful setback after the country had its first budget surplus in 45 years at the end of 2019. The pandemic dented a \u20ac4.4bn (\u00a33.91bn) hole in public revenues, amounting to 5% of the state budget, Le\u00e3o said, largely due to a fall in tax and social security payments. Government spending was \u20ac4.3bn higher than predicted, Le\u00e3o added. Brazil\u2019s most populous state S\u00e3o Paulo has registered a record daily death toll. The state reported 334 additional deaths, taking its total to 9,522. The total number of confirmed cases has reached 150,138. Here are the latest developments in the world coronavirus outbreak so far on Tuesday: The World Health Organization\u2019s Covid-19 technical lead backtracked on her comment that asymptomatic transmission of the virus was \u201cvery rare\u201d. \u201cI think that it\u2019s a misunderstanding to state the asymptomatic transmission globally is very rare,\u201d Dr Maria Van Kerkhove said, noting modelling suggesting 40% of infections could be transmitted by people without symptoms.

Coronavirus may have been present and spreading in Wuhan as early as August last year, according to a study that analysed satellite imagery of car parks outside major hospitals and search engine data. Germany plans to extend its travel warnings for non-European countries until 31 August, government sources have told the Reuters news agency, adding that Berlin was also strongly advising against any cruises due to the special risks related to the pandemic. A demonstrator in the Democratic Republic of Congo died during a protest against the closure of the capital city\u2019s main market during the country\u2019s lockdown, officials and witnesses have said. Police fired warning shots at dozens of people who gathered at the site to demand the reopening of the Kinshasa market, according to Agence France-Presse (AFP). Several demonstrators said the dead man was hit by a bullet, while the city\u2019s governorate said he was \u201celectrocuted\u201d while running away. It promised a \u201cmeticulous inquiry\u201d. Demonstrators stood their ground behind barriers that have cut off the Gombe area housing the market since early April as part of the fight against the spread of the virus. Belise Okonda, a governorate spokesperson, denied rumours the market was being knocked down. In a letter seen by AFP, the interior minister Gilbert Kankonde ordered the Kinshasha governor Gentiny Ngobila to reopen the market. However, the governor first wants work undertaken by the city authorities to improve health and sanitation at the market before any reopening. Modelling studies estimate that up to 40% of coronavirus infections could be transmitted by people who have the virus but no symptoms, a World Health Organization expert has acknowledged after her comment on Monday that asymptomatic transmission was \u201cvery rare\u201d caused a stir, Sarah Boseley, the Guardian\u2019s health editor reports. But Dr Maria Van Kerkhove maintained that real world data suggested it could still be a rare event when she took part in a social media Q&amp;A to explain herself, saying she was not referencing the modelling studies when she spoke. Van Kerkhove, the WHO\u2019s Covid-19 technical lead, said that on asymptomatic transmission \u201cwe don\u2019t have the answer yet\u201d. Her comment at the WHO\u2019s Monday press briefing about its rarity was based on two or three studies following up the contacts of asymptomatic people, and unpublished data shared by countries or experts with her organisation. \u201cI used the phrase \u2018very rare\u2019 and I think that it\u2019s a misunderstanding to state the asymptomatic transmission globally is very rare. What I was referring to was a subset of studies. I was also referring to some data that isn\u2019t published,\u201d she said. She said she did not mention the estimates of up to 40% because \u201cthose are from models\u201d. Sweden has reported its lowest daily number of new cases of coronavirus since March, after just 202 more people were recorded as testing positive for the virus. According to the public health agency, 45,924 people in the country have so far tested positive for the virus which causes the Covid-19 respiratory disease. The death toll reached 4,717, after a further 23 deaths were recorded on Tuesday. The latest figures from Sweden, which has chosen not to implement a coronavirus lockdown in favour of non-compulsory public health advice, came as several German states introduced a requirement for travellers arriving from the country to self-quarantine for 14 days, the Associated Press reports. Germany had a quarantine requirement for most people arriving from abroad for over a month until mid-May, when state governments started exempting people coming from European countries. But several states are now reintroducing the requirement for arrivals from Sweden, on the grounds that new infections there have exceeded 50 per 100,000 residents over seven days. Inside Germany, that level of infections in a region is supposed to trigger action by local authorities. Bavaria on Tuesday followed three northern states \u2014 Schleswig-Holstein, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Lower Saxony \u2014 in imposing the quarantine. Reported infection rates in Sweden have risen slightly recently because testing rules have changed slightly, allowing new groups of people to be tested. Aid organisations have slammed a decision by the Greek government to keep migrants and refugees in prolonged lockdown when restrictions on public movement have otherwise been greatly eased nationwide, writes Helena Smith, the Guardian\u2019s Athens correspondent. Medecins Sans Frontiers described the move as discriminatory and unfair saying it would exacerbate already diminished access to basic services and medical care in vastly overcrowded camps. \u201cIt is absolutely not justified from a public health point of view,\u201d said Marco Sandrone, the group\u2019s field coordinator on Lesbos, the Aegean isle long home to Europe\u2019s largest refugee camp. \u201cThese discriminatory measures stigmatise and marginalise asylum seekers, refugees and migrants,\u201d he added emphasising there were no confirmed coronavirus cases in any of the island installations that could pose a risk to locals. Athens\u2019 centre right government says precautionary measures to stem the spread of coronavirus will continue to apply in reception centres hosting asylum seekers until 21 June. Some 34,000 men, women and children are currently living in holding facilities designed for no more than 5,400 people on five Aegean islands facing the Turkish coast. Some 32 camps and dozens of hotels house an estimated 70,000 migrants and refugees on the mainland. All have been under strict lockdown since March 23 following multiple extensions of the restrictions. Greeks, in contrast, began to emerge from lockdown in early May. Despite the criticism, Manos Logothetis, the migration ministry\u2019s general secretary in charge of asylum seekers\u2019 reception, defended the decision and strenuously denied any racist intent. \u201cThe extension is there to protect them,\u201d he told the Guardian explaining that with the policies still in place only 10% in any facility would be free to circulate at any one time. \u201cWe are talking about populations living in very closed quarters. We are doing this to protect them from Greeks who are now moving around so extensively. In the same vein we are not allowing anyone, bar essential staff, into the facilities. It is precisely such measures that have saved them from coronavirus.\u201d But reports of violence between feuding ethnic groups and increased cases of abuse have been directly attributed to prolonged incarceration in the facilities. \u201cPublic health measures should protect people especially [those] at high risk like the elderly and patients with chronic diseases,\u201d said Sandone. \u201cThey should not trap them in overcrowded camps with limited access to water and sanitation and where preventative measures are just impossible to apply.\u201d The chief prosecutor in Paris has begun an investigation into alleged criminal negligence by French government agencies over their handling of the coronavirus crisis, the Associated Press reports. In a written statement on Tuesday, the Paris prosecutor, Remy Heitz, said 62 legal complaints alleging misconduct have been filed by individuals as well as trade unions and associations. Heitz said the complaints focus on the criminal offences of \u201cendangering the life of others, failing to help someone in danger, voluntary abstention to fight a dangerous disaster, manslaughter and unintentional injuries.\u201d Some other legal complaints have been filed across France against care homes and are being investigated locally. France has recorded the deaths of over 14,000 care home residents, or nearly half of the country\u2019s total reported pandemic death toll of 29,209. More than 70 complaints specifically targeting the government have been filed before the Court of Justice of the Republic, the French court in charge of offences committed by sitting ministers. There have been sharp rises in reports of violence against women across Latin America, already a hotspot for gender-based violence, since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, the International Rescue Committee has said. In El Salvador there was a 70% increase in reports compared to 2019; Mexico\u2019s Chihuahua state has recorded a 65% increase in femicides between March and April; in Colombia there was a 51% increase in cases of domestic violence during the first days of quarantine; in Venezuela there was a 65% increase in femicides in April compared to a year earlier; and in Honduras the number of reported cases of domestic and intra-family violence increased by 4.1% per week since the start of the pandemic. Meghan Lopez, the IRC\u2019s regional director for Latin America, said: In the wake of Covid-19, women and adolescent girls, many of whom were already experiencing forms of violence, are now taking on double and triple responsibilities all in confined spaces 24 hours of the day, some completely stuck with their perpetrators and in increasingly vulnerable situations, without any respite. This, coupled with services closed due to quarantine and lockdown - 95% of local and government response services are closed in El Salvador, for example - puts women and girls at high risk of serious harm or death. Greater funding to support efforts - such as the IRC\u2019s Women\u2019s Protection and Empowerment efforts from Mexico to Northern Central America to Venezuela - will ensure women and girls who are experiencing GBV have accessible and safe response services they need during this crisis through psychosocial support and that they have information on the proper referral pathways for shelter and clinical care for gender-based violence. The world stands on the brink of a food crisis worse than any seen for at least 50 years, the UN has warned as it urged governments to act swiftly to avoid disaster, writes Fiona Harvey, the Guardian\u2019s environment correspondent. Better social protections for poor people are urgently needed as the looming recession following the coronavirus pandemic may put basic nutrition beyond their reach, the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said on Tuesday. \u201cUnless immediate action is taken, it is increasingly clear that there is an impending global food emergency that could have long-term impacts on hundreds of millions of children and adults,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to act now to avoid the worst impacts of our efforts to control the pandemic.\u201d Although harvests of staple crops are holding up, and the export bans and protectionism that experts feared have so far been largely avoided, the worst of the impacts of the pandemic and ensuing recession are yet to be felt. Guterres warned: \u201cEven in countries with abundant food, we see risks of disruption in the food supply chain.\u201d About 50 million people risk falling into extreme poverty this year owing to the pandemic, but the long-term effects will be even worse, as poor nutrition in childhood causes lifelong suffering. Already, one in five children around the world are stunted in their growth by the age of five, and millions more are likely to suffer the same fate if poverty rates soar.

The Eiffel Tower, symbol of the French capital and one of the most visited monuments in the world, is to reopen to visitors on 25 June, it was announced on Tuesday, writes Kim Willsher, the Guardian\u2019s Paris correspondent. The landmark, known as La Dame de Fer (the Iron Lady), has been shut for more than three months following France\u2019s strict coronavirus lockdown, its longest closure since World War II. The number of visitors will be limited and all those over the age of 11 will be required to wear masks. To ensure appropriate social distancing people will only be able to use the stairs that go up to the second floor and no higher. Ascending and descending visitors will use separate stairways and areas open to the public will be cleaned and disinfected regularly. The reopening of the Eiffel Tower is a symbolic boost for Parisians who, unlike the rest of the country, remain under certain lockdown restrictions. Its operators say visitors are \u201cstrongly encouraged\u201d to buy tickets online before visiting. The booking site is currently closed but is expected to reopen soon. The World Health Organization\u2019s technical lead for Covid-19, to say asymptomatic transmission is rare globally., has clarified comments she made about the transmission of the coronavirus, saying that the the amount of transmission from people with no symptoms is unknown. There had been concern from some experts after Kerkhove said in a press briefing on Monday that transmission of coronavirus by people with no symptoms is \u201cvery rare\u201d. They said this guidance could pose problems for governments as they seek to lift lockdowns. In Brazil, the president, Jair Bolsonaro, a coronavirus sceptic, seized on Kerkhove\u2019s comments as proof his country should be reopening for business. On Tuesday, Kerkhove said it was a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d to say asymptomatic transmission is rare globally. She said that modelling studies has come up with a range of estimates, from 6% of the population infected by asymptomatic individuals to 40%, with a median of 16%, reports the Guardian\u2019s health editor, Sarah Boseley. But, she said, the very few studies - two or three - where real asymptomatic people have been followed to find out whether they infect others, for instance in outbreak or cluster situations, have found such transmission to be very rare. Those studies have not been published but have been shared with WHO by scientists. Undoubtedly some people are asymptomatic - although others might have mild symptoms not identified as Covid. But the big question is whether they actually transmit the virus when they do not have symptoms - so they are not for instance coughing infected droplets into the air. Singapore has announced its lowest number of new daily cases of coronavirus since 11 April According to the health ministry, on Tuesday there were 218 more cases of coronavirus, with the majority, again, found among the low-paid migrant workers who perform the city state\u2019s basic economic functions. Singapore has so far recorded 38,514 confirmed cases of coronavirus, one of the highest caseloads in south east Asia, but just 25 deaths from Covid-19. A briefing by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) on the coronavirus situation in the Americas is about to begin. Carissa Etienne, director of PAHO and WHO regional director for the Americas, will lead the session on the fast changing Covid-19 situation on the region, and health authorities\u2019 responses to the pandemic. The Americas are currently regarded as the world\u2019s coronavirus hotspot. You can tune into the live stream of the briefing in the player at the top of the blog. A supreme court judge in Brazil has ordered Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s administration to resume publishing complete Covid-19 statistics after moves to suppress such information prompted accusations of authoritarian skulduggery designed to cover up the crisis, write Tom Phillips and Caio Barreto Bristo in Rio De Janeiro. The Brazilian government sparked outrage on Saturday by purging the health ministry website of historical data relating to the pandemic and announcing it would stop publishing the cumulative death toll or number of infections. Officials claimed the changes would help \u201crefine\u201d official coronavirus data. But critics attacked what they called an illiberal ruse to conceal the severity of the pandemic\u2019s impact in Brazil, where more than 37,000 lives have been lost. Some drew parallels with the suppression of information in authoritarian countries such as North Korea and Venezuela while others recalled how Brazil\u2019s own military regime had covered up a meningitis epidemic in the 1970s, with devastating consequences. On Monday night, supreme court justice Alexandre de Moraes reportedly gave Bolsonaro\u2019s administration a 48-hour deadline to begin releasing the full figures again each day, after a legal challenge from two opposition parties. The epidemiological curve of the coronavirus epidemic is rising in many regions of Kenya, the country\u2019s health secretary has said. In a briefing on the crisis on Tuesday, Rashid Aman said that it was likely that the country would record increasing numbers of cases, with more people needing hospital care. Kenya\u2019s ministry of health recorded 127 more confirmed cases of coronavirus on Tuesday, out of a total 2,247 tests, he said. So far, 2,989 people in the country have been diagnosed as carrying the virus, with 873 having made a full recovery. Aman said: According to the experts, our epidemiological curve is rising sharply in many regions, implying that, going forward, we are likely to record increasing numbers of positives and more people requiring clinical management. We have no choice, but to work together, share resources, and deploy the proven strategies, that we have learnt along the way, which is the way out. The European Union\u2019s health commissioner, Stella Kyriakides, says the health emergency provoked by the pandemic has made one thing very clear: Europe needs a stronger public health system, writes Helena Smith, the Guardian\u2019s Athens correspondent. Speaking via teleconference at this year\u2019s Delphi Economic Forum, the EU health chief said it was vital the continent emerged \u201cwiser\u201d from the crisis. \u201cThe pandemic is not over. Public health is our basic priority, we can\u2019t relax measures and risk what we have achieved so far,\u201d said Kyriakides, a Greek Cypriot. \u201cEurope needs a better public health system. European citizens expect us to take a more active role in this issue.\u201d The European Commission says it will increase expenditure on health dramatically announcing that the \u20ac413 million allocated to the sector in the bloc\u2019s current seven-year budget will be boosted more than 20-fold, to \u20ac9.4 billion, in the next. The massive rise, which covers a coronavirus recovery fund, is aimed specifically at assisting member states tackle future health emergencies. Funding for doctors who will fly between participant countries at times of crisis is also included. Kyriakides said Brussels\u2019 priority now was to find a vaccine against coronavirus that would be accessible to all. The EU had already collected 9.8 billion euro for that purpose while the European investment bank had earmarked 75 million euro for research. \u201cThe vaccine is our basic priority,\u201d said the health commissioner adding that from day one she had been in contact with pharmaceutical companies working on finding an effective treatment. Although the novel virus had highlighted the bloc\u2019s weaknesses it had also helped bring its better characteristics to the surface including solidarity, support and collectivity, the health commissioner told the annual forum which pre-coronavirus has taken place since 2015 in Delphi, home of the ancient oracle. Nearly one in five people in Iran may have been infected with coronavirus since the country\u2019s outbreak, AFP reports citing a health official. \u201cAccording to results (of studies) about 15 million Iranians may have experienced being infected with this virus since the outbreak began,\u201d said Ehsan Mostafavi, a member of the taskforce set up to combat Covid-19. This meant the virus was \u201cmuch less lethal than we or the world had anticipated\u201d, the semi-official ISNA news agency quoted him as saying. The figure represents 18.75% of the more than 80 million population of Iran, which on Tuesday announced a further 74 deaths from the coronavirus. Mostafavi said the 15m figure \u201cmust be viewed with caution\u201d and that the studies it resulted from are \u201csomehow similar to others done in the rest of the world\u201d. Mostafavi said it was derived from serology tests to identify antibodies in patients who have recovered from the illness. These differ from polymerise chain reaction (PCR) tests, which detect the presence of an antigen. Iran says it has carried out more than 1m PCR tests to \u201cconfirm\u201d infections and report them so far. Health ministry spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari said 74 new coronavirus fatalities in the past 12 hours had raised the overall death toll to 8,425. Cases of infection increased by 2,095 over the same period to total 175,927, she added. The chief prosecutor of Paris said on Tuesday it had launched an investigation into the French state\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak, with possible charges including \u201cinvoluntary homicide\u201d and \u201cendangering life\u201d, AFP reports. Remy Heitz said the investigation, which comes after complaints were filed by civil groups and members of the public, was not aimed at determining \u201cpolitical or administrative responsibility\u201d. But he said it would decide whether national decision-makers had committed \u201cpossible criminal offences\u201d. President Emmanuel Macron, as head of state, has immunity from prosecution and is not a target of the inquiry, nor are government ministers who can be held accountable only by the Republican court of justice, an administrative tribunal, which has itself received 80 complaints, Heitz said. The complaints relate to the alleged failure to put in place anti-virus protections at the workplace, to provide face masks to reduce infection, and to roll out testing to diagnose carriers of a virus that has claimed more than 29,000 lives in France. The Paris prosecutor\u2019s office has jurisdiction over issues of national public health, and over crimes allegedly committed within the borders of the city, where most of the state authorities targeted by Heitz\u2019s inquiry are based. They include Jerome Salomon, head of the Sante Publique France health agency, who has gained prominence with his nightly summaries of the virus\u2019s toll at the height of the outbreak. His agency will also be a focus of the inquiry, as is the health ministry and the national prison administration. Care homes, many of which are privately operated, are not part of the investigation. Heitz said the investigation arose from complaints lodged by associations, labour unions and individuals. Possible charges of involuntary homicide, involuntary injury, endangering life, failure to combat a threat and non-assistance to persons in danger are being examined by a branch of the prosecutor\u2019s office dedicated to alleged threats to public health. \u201cIf there is criminal wrongdoing, it will probably have been \u2013 it\u2019s a hypothesis - unintentional,\u201d Heitz said. Many shops and restaurants are still deserted as India begins emerging from lockdown this week. Radha Dhongre, an economist, described going out for a coffee with her daughter on Monday in Khan Market in New Delhi, the Indian capital, the day the lockdown was eased as an experiment. Her trip was motivated by curiosity and a desire to see if it was feasible. \u201cI\u2019m glad we went but we aren\u2019t doing it again for some time. It was too much for the nerves. We felt quite drained by the tension,\u201d said Dhongre. It\u2019s a view being echoed over large parts of India as the country emerges from its two-and-a-half month lockdown. Banks, shopping malls, cafes, and restaurants were still mostly deserted, with only a handful of customers. Many Indians prefer the security of the lockdown to the perils of venturing out. Spain: facemasks to remain compulsory in public places Facemasks will remain compulsory in all public spaces even after Spain\u2019s Covid-19 state of emergency ends on 22 June, the government has announced, as it urged Spaniards to \u201cto live alongside the virus\u201d. The announcement came as the Socialist-led coalition laid out its plans for the return to what it terms \u201cthe new normality\u201d but insisted that there was no room for complacency amid Spain\u2019s staggered lockdown exit. \u201cThe message is one of prudence and caution,\u201d the finance minister and government spokeswoman, Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Montero, said on Tuesday. \u201cUntil there is a vaccine or a treatment, the virus remains a threat. We can\u2019t think that the danger has gone.\u201d The health minister, Salvador Illa, said people would \u201chave to learn to live alongside the virus\u201d, adding that masks remain compulsory in situations where people cannot keep a 1.5m-distance from each other. Masks will need to continue to be worn on public streets, in the open air and in enclosed public spaces as well as on public transport. Anyone not wearing a mask without a valid reason will be subject to a \u20ac100 fine. According to the royal decree approved by the cabinet on Tuesday morning, Spain\u2019s 17 regional governments will need to keep providing figures on deaths, diagnoses and hospitalisations so that the pandemic can be monitored. Regional governments will have to have contingency plans and enough healthworkers to deal with any further outbreaks, and also ensure that anyone suspected of having the virus is given a PCR or other test as soon as possible. Carehomes \u2013 which have been very hard hit in Spain, as elsewhere \u2013 must also prepare themselves and draw up contingency plans for residents and staff. The government said workplaces, restaurants and shops would need to adopt hygiene and prevention measures such as organising shifts to avoid large groups of people gathering in one place. Mexico is still weeks away from its peak of coronavirus infections and deaths, the deputy health minister, Hugo Lopez-Gatell, has warned. Speaking at a regular news conference, he said: We still haven\u2019t reached maximum point. For several more weeks, we will keep announcing there are more cases today than yesterday. Earlier, Lopez-Gatell announced 2,999 new infections and 354 new deaths. Coronavirus has claimed the lives of more 14,000 people in Mexico, making it the seventh worst-hit country in the world.

Food insecurity is deepening in North Korea after it closed the border with China and took other steps against Covid-19, a UN rights expert said Tuesday. The country, which has yet to confirm a single case of the novel coronavirus, has introduced a range of other measures to try and prevent an outbreak, including strict quarantine measures, restricted travel between cities, and the total closure of its borders. Tomas Ojea Quintana, the United Nations special rapporteur on human rights in the country, called for urgent action from Pyongyang and the international community to relieve the suffering. On food insecurity, the rapporteur said: Under the pervasive discrimination in the public distribution system, ordinary citizens, including farmers, do not receive rations. Lack of food had a devastating impact in DPRK in the 1990s, and prospects of a further deepening of food shortages and widespread food insecurity is alarming. The Government must take swift action on this matter by prioritising allocations of financial resources and allowing the humanitarian aid to be delivered on the ground without restrictions Before the coronavirus crisis, more than 40% of people in North Korea were already considered food insecure, with many suffering malnutrition. The decision five months ago to close the border with China, and putting thousands into isolation, are exacerbating the situation, said Quintana - an independent expert who does not speak on behalf of the UN but who reports his findings to it. North Korea\u2019s trade with China in March and April this year dropped by more than 90 percent, leaving many living in the border areas with no income, he said. The expert pointed to reports that soldiers were also reportedly suffering from food shortages, and voiced concern over the situation in prisons, particularly in secret prison camps. Pointing to accounts of prisoners frequently dying due to exhaustive work, lack of food, overcrowding and contagious diseases, he urged Pyongyang to consider releasing vulnerable prisoners. Quintana also warned of the impact of the punishing international sanctions imposed on North Korea. In a context where the Covid-19 is bringing drastic economic hardship worldwide, any sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council that impact on the livelihood of people and hinder the Government\u2019s capacity to respond to Covid-19 should be sincerely reconsidered. The international community, in particular some permanent members of the Security Council, should no longer rest on the paradox of sanctioning inputs needed to increase food production, while then offering food relief. Any gains from lifting of sanctions should be channeled towards the most vulnerable, including by strengthening the right to food and to health. Domestic flights have resumed in Indonesia - as the country announced its biggest daily rise in coronavirus cases. The transport minister, Budi Karya Sumadi, said new regulations for air travel, allowing planes to operate at only 70% capacity, among other strict rules, followed talks between airlines, the Covid-19 task force, and the health ministry. \u201cTransportation management in the era of the new normal hinges on health aspects,\u201d Sumadi told an online news conference, according to Reuters. \u201cWe hope that people stay productive, but safe.\u201d Flights have been restricted in Indonesia in response to the pandemic, but in recent weeks migrant workers returning home and those travelling for work in exempt sectors, such as health and security, have been allowed to fly. The Indonesian capital began easing social restrictions last week, even though coronavirus cases continue to rise across the world\u2019s fourth most populous nation. Indonesia has recorded 33,076 positive coronavirus infections and 1,923 deaths from Covid-19. On Tuesday, it announced 1,043 new cases, the highest daily increase so far. The Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro has seized on a comment from a World Health Organization official that transmission of coronavirus by people with no symptoms could be \u201crare\u201d as proof his country should be reopening for business, writes Tom Phillips, the Guardian\u2019s Latin America correspondent. Brazil has the second highest number of infections after the US and is set to overtake the UK this week as the country with the second highest number of deaths. But during a cabinet session on Tuesday morning, Bolsonaro, who has downplayed the risks of coronavirus and opposed efforts to impose shutdowns, said he hoped the statement from WHO official Maria van Kerkhove would \u201ccut short this policy of stay at home and absolute isolation and even lockdown\u201d. Bolsonaro insisted this was necessary \u201cso the ills [caused by such measures] are not worse \u2026 than the treatment for the pandemic\u201d. The Brazilian leader criticised how many people in Brazil had followed the WHO \u201calmost blindly\u201d and said it was time for South America\u2019s largest economy to get back to business. \u201cWhat we most want is to get back to normal and for the country to retake the path of prosperity,\u201d Bolsonaro said. Bolsonaro distorted the WHO\u2019s official\u2019s controversial comment that symptomatic carriers appeared less likely to pass on the illness. During the televised meeting at his official residence, Bolsonaro falsely suggested the WHO had issued a categorical statement making clear \u201cthat asymptomatic did not transmit\u201d the virus. Bolsonaro said he hoped coronavirus \u201cpanic\u201d might now start to fade because of the WHO\u2019s supposed claim over the \u201cnon-transmission, or near zero-transmission\u201d of carriers without symptoms. As the number of cases of coronavirus continue to rise rapidly in South Africa, health officials are warning the outbreak may last between one and two years, writes Jason Burke, the Guardian\u2019s Africa correspondent. There are more than 50,000 confirmed cases in Africa\u2019s most industrialised nation, with 1,080 deaths. These have been concentrated in and around the city of Cape Town, where more than 800 of the fatalities have occurred. More than 80% of the deaths nationwide have been people older than 50. South Africa was widely praised for its early and strict lockdown, and rollout of testing and contact-tracing. But though nearly 1m tests have been carried out, the strategy has run into trouble with long delays before test results are known, a consequence of a global shortage in testing reagents. The lockdown was lifted at the beginning of the month, with schools returning this week. Officials insist it bought valuable time to acquire PPE and build up field hospitals, though concerns remain that the number of critical care beds remains insufficient. For weeks, the booze-soaked, coronavirus-themed parties had raged over the road from Ticyana Azambuja\u2019s home in Rio de Janeiro, until finally she snapped. She picked up a hammer, marched across the street and used it to smash the rear windshield and union jack-patterned wing mirror of a reveller\u2019s car. \u201cI just wanted them to come out and listen to me. I\u2019d pay to fix the car, but they needed to understand how ridiculous it was to be throwing those parties day and night \u2026 right in the middle of a pandemic,\u201d the 35-year-old said. Azambuja\u2019s moment of fury was understandable, if illegal: an anaesthetist, she has spent the last three months battling to save lives on the frontline of Brazil\u2019s fight against Covid-19 \u2013 even catching the disease herself. On 30 May, the day she lost her cool, she had been trying to rest after a gruelling 24-hour shift at one of the three hospitals where she works. The organisers of the bacchanalia showed no compassion. There could soon be half a million cases of coronavirus in Delhi, the city\u2019s authorities have warned, saying they expect transmission to increase almost 20-fold in the coming weeks. Even as India eases its coronavirus lockdown, which has dealt a devastating economic blow, the virus is still spreading fast across the world\u2019s second-most populous nation, with nearly 270,000 reported infections - the fifth-highest caseload in the world. It has reported almost 10,000 new infections in the past 24 hours with crowded megacities like Mumbai and Delhi, the capital, the worst hit. Manish Sisodia, Delhi\u2019s deputy chief minister, said after a crisis meeting that authorities expected infections to soar to 550,000 by the end of July, up from almost 30,000 at present. \u201cThere will be 44,000 cases by June 15, 100,000 by June 30, 225,000 by July 15, and we\u2019ll need to prepare necessary infrastructure accordingly,\u201d Sisodia was quoted as saying by the French news agency AFP. He said the city of around 20 million people, where hospitals are already stretched and anecdotal evidence suggests crematoriums are struggling, needed 80,000 hospital beds. Delhi\u2019s health minister last week said that it had around 9,000 beds available for coronavirus patients. Slovakia is to reopen its borders to 16 more European countries from 10 June and will no longer require people to wear face masks outside, the prime minister, Igor Matovic, has said. From Wednesday, there will be no restrictions on visitors from Germany, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, Slovenia, Croatia, Bulgaria, Greece, Cyprus, Malta, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, Norway, Denmark and Iceland. Slovakia last week reopened its borders with neighbours Czech Republic, Austria and Hungary. Matovic also said that compulsory quarantine upon arrival from abroad will be dropped for countries on its safe list, and people will not have to activate \u201csmart quarantine\u201d on their mobile devices, Reuters reports. Slovakia had imposed relatively strict restrictions including border closures before it reported any coronavirus cases, and has moved cautiously in reopening. \u201cWe are switching from bans to personal responsibility,\u201d Matovic said at a televised news conference. The country of 5.5 million people has recorded 1,531 cases of the Covid-19 illness, with 28 deaths. Disease experts have questioned a statement by the World Health Organization that transmission of coronavirus by people with no symptoms is \u201cvery rare\u201d, saying this guidance could pose problems for governments as they seek to lift lockdowns, Reuters reports. Maria van Kerkhove, an epidemiologist and the WHO\u2019s technical lead on the Covid-19 pandemic, said on Monday that many countries undertaking contact tracing had identified asymptomatic cases, but were not finding they caused further spread of the virus. \u201cIt is very rare,\u201d she said. \u201cI was quite surprised by the WHO statement,\u201d said Liam Smeeth, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who added that he had not seen the data Kerkhove\u2019s statement was based on. \u201cIt goes against my impressions from the science so far that suggest asymptomatic people \u2013 who never get symptoms \u2013 and pre-symptomatic people are an important source of infection to others.\u201d Smeeth and other experts said understanding the risks of transmission among people with mild or no symptoms is crucial as governments begin to ease the lockdown measures they imposed to try and reduce the pandemic\u2019s spread and gradually replace them with case tracking and isolation plans. \u201cThis has important implications for the track/trace/isolate measures being instituted in many countries,\u201d said Babak Javid, a Cambridge University Hospitals infectious diseases consultant. The co-head of Singapore\u2019s coronavirus taskforce told Reuters on Monday there had been asymptomatic transmission cases there, between people living in close quarters. However, China said last week that 300 symptomless coronavirus carriers in its central city of Wuhan, the pandemic\u2019s epicentre, had not been found to be infectious. Keith Neal, a professor of the epidemiology of infectious diseases at Britain\u2019s University of Nottingham, said that while the question of how big a role asymptomatic transmission plays in new infections is unclear, what is known is that people with symptoms are responsible for most of the spread of the disease. \u201cThis reinforces the importance of any person who has any of the symptoms of Covid-19 arranges a test .\u2026 as soon as possible and isolating until they get their test result,\u201d he said. Hundreds more fatalities from Covid-19 in the north-west of England and in care homes have driven up the number of excess deaths since the UK went into lockdown to more than 63,000, a toll believed to be greater than those anywhere else except the US, writes Robert Booth, the Guardian\u2019s social affairs correspondent, in London. The number of deaths from the virus in England and Wales fell to 1,822 in the last week of May, the fewest for eight weeks, according to the latest data from the Office of National Statistics. But the numbers remain relatively high in the north-west, where there have been fears of a resurgence of the virus. The region including Liverpool and Manchester recorded 282 deaths from the virus in England and Wales in the week ending 29 May, the most in any region. Fifty-two Cuban medics who flew to Lombardy to help Italian doctors treat Europe\u2019s first mass coronavirus outbreak have returned to a heroes\u2019 welcome in Havana. The medical brigade, comprising 36 doctors, 15 nurses and a logistics specialist, arrived in Milan on 22 March, when Italy had reported 53,578 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 4,825 related deaths. As the death toll mounted in Italy, they worked with the health service in the region to care for seriously ill and dying patients \u2013 in spite of calls from the US for countries to refuse medical aid from the Caribbean\u2019s communist state. During the welcome ceremony on Monday, Cuba\u2019s president, Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel, denounced the US blockade of his country, as he pointed to the importance of international solidarity. \u201cWe are winning the battle against the pandemic at a moment when another terrible pandemic of the US blockade and the economic war against the island have been tightened without mercy of the current US administration,\u201d he was quoted as saying by China\u2019s Xinhua news agency. More than 3,300 Cuban doctors and nurses have joined medical brigades sent around the world to help treat coronavirus patients in 27 countries. As many as 600 deaths in Kano, northern Nigeria, most within a single week in April, were caused by an undetected outbreak of Covid-19, Nigeria\u2019s health minister has revealed, writes Emmanuel Akinwotu, the Guardian\u2019s West Africa correspondent. Investigations by the government determined that 50-60% of 979 \u201cmysterious\u201d deaths were linked to the virus, Osagie Ehanire told a Covid-19 press briefing on Monday. The investigation began after reports of hundreds of deaths sent alarm through Nigeria\u2019s second largest city. The government\u2019s findings were determined through verbal autopsies as tests could not be conducted on those who died. Most were buried the following morning, according to religious practice in the majority Muslim city. Nigeria\u2019s official Covid-19 death toll of 361 has not been adjusted to account for the deaths in Kano and investigations in eight other states recording unexplained deaths are ongoing. Nigeria took key steps early in their Covid-19 outbreak, and quickly leveraged virus response measures in place due to its history with Ebola and other virus outbreaks. Yet infections have steadily risen to 12,800, while 4,040 people have recovered. Just 78,000 tests have been conducted. In Kano, community testing has begun in recent days. Yet despite the mass deaths, overcoming scepticism of the pandemic has remained an obstacle for health officials. A high profile scandal almost a decade ago when controversial drug trials were conducted by pharmaceutical company, Pfizer, still informs sensibilities in the city. Businesses have taken at least half a trillion dollars in coronavirus aid from the American public, and the US government is refusing to disclose which companies are getting the money, write Emily Holden and Daniel Strauss in Washington for the Guardian US. The lack of oversight in the system for US lawmakers\u2019 \u201cpaycheck protection program\u201d makes the historic levels of spending ripe for abuse. The media and watchdogs cannot scrutinise the payments to ensure against waste, fraud or favours to political allies. Eleven national news publications are suing for public records, yet little public attention has gone to the problem, as the government has scrambled to respond to a cratered economy and unemployment that has soared past 40m jobless claims. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely mind-boggling that we\u2019re in a situation where we\u2019re shovelling so much money out to private businesses, and we don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going,\u201d said Kyle Herrig, founder of the watchdog group Accountable.US. Madrid\u2019s regional government has denied reports that vulnerable people in care homes in and around the capital were deliberately denied hospital treatment in an attempt to stop the region\u2019s health services collapsing at the height of the pandemic, writes Sam Jones, the Guardian\u2019s Madrid correspondent. Madrid has been the hardest-hit area of Spain. According to the regional government\u2019s own figures, 14,910 people have died from the coronavirus, or while showing symptoms consistent with the illness. Of those, 6,007 were people in care homes. Documents have emerged over recent days suggesting that the regional government had ordered that highly dependent elderly or disabled people with Covid-19 should not be taken to hospital. The protocol had provoked divisions within the Madrid regional government, which is a coalition between the conservative People\u2019s party (PP) and the centre-right Citizens party, backed by the far-right Vox party. Alberto Reyero, the Citizens politician who serves as the government\u2019s head of social policy, expressed concerns that the measures could lead to many residents dying in what he termed \u201cundignified conditions\u201d. The government has insisted that the protocol was merely a \u201cworking document\u201d that was never put into practice. \u201cNo official protocol was signed saying that the life of one person was worth more than that of someone else because of their age or other reasons,\u201d Isabel D\u00edaz Ayuso, the regional president, told esRadio on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve fought for every life. Did we manage to get everywhere? Obviously not, but we\u2019ve fought to and for me that\u2019s the fundamental thing.\u201d Ayuso, who is responsible for health and social care in the region, has been fiercely critical of the central government\u2019s handling of the health emergency, accusing it of \u201ctaking advantage of Spain\u2019s biggest crisis in recent history to impose a single dictatorial command\u201d through the continuing state of emergency. The scale of the problem in Spanish care homes was laid bare in late March, when military units sent by the central government to disinfect the facilities found some people dead and abandoned in their beds. Hi, this is Damien Gayle in the hot seat now, bringing you the latest headlines and updates from the coronavirus outbreak around the world. If you have any comments, tips or suggestions for coverage please do feel free to get in touch, either via email to damien.gayle@theguardian.com, or via Twitter direct message to @damiengayle. I\u2019ll now hand over to my colleague Damien Gayle, who will take you through the next few hours. Thanks a lot for your company so far today. An official in Afghanistan has warned that the country\u2019s actual number of Covid-19 infections is higher than the official figures state. Meanwhile the war-torn nation is facing a lack of compressed oxygen for an increasing number of patients, while the health ministry detected 542 new cases on Tuesday amid a continued surge of transmission in the capital and Herat. Wahid Majroh, the deputy health minister, said on Monday that the ministry believes the actual number of infections is \u201chigher than the official figures, because most people with the virus don\u2019t go to the medical centres\u201d. Over the weekend, Kabul\u2019s governor Mohammad Yakub Haidary warned that the actual number of infections may be much higher than official figures show, even \u201ca million\u201d. Majroh also warned that the country will be facing a shortage of compressed oxygen for Covid-19 patients if numbers continue to surge. \u201cIn the last two days, the Ali Jenah hospital and Afghan-Japan hospital were faced with a lack of oxygen for one or two hours,\u201d Majroh said. \u201cThe ministry of public health has made all its efforts through oxygen-producing companies in Kabul to increase their capacity to maximum and purchase oxygen.\u201d A Kabul resident, who lost his young wife to the virus, told local television that he struggled to buy compressed oxygen for his wife. \u201cThere was no oxygen. We wanted to buy it with our own money. There is no management, there is no system,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, the health ministry has detected 542 new cases from 1,225 tests, according to the latest update, bringing the total number of infections to 21,459. Fifteen patients also died overnight, meaning the country\u2019s Covid-19 death toll stands at 384. There have been 2,651 recoveries. The ministry has tested 49,530 suspected patients, of whom around 44% were positive. Majroh pledged that 14 new testing labs would be launched in Afghanistan. Most of the new cases were recorded in Kabul, with 213 new infections and eight deaths confirmed in the capital. Kabul is the country\u2019s worst-affected area, with 8,436 and 81 deaths in total. The western province of Herat recorded 142 new confirmed cases. Here is a rundown of key stories from the past few hours: German exports and imports slumped in April, posting their biggest declines since 1990 as the coronavirus crisis slashed demand and adding to a gloomy outlook for Europe\u2019s biggest economy. China\u2019s education ministry has warned that Chinese students should consider whether to study in Australia because of a string of \u201cincidents of discrimination\u201d targeting people of Asian descent. Indonesia has reported its biggest daily rise in Covid-19 infections. The country\u2019s health ministry recorded 1,043 new cases in the past 24 hours, bringing its total to 33,076. There were also 40 new deaths, bringing the total number of fatalities to 1,923. Coronavirus may have been present and spreading in Wuhan as early as August last year, according to a study that analysed satellite imagery of car parks outside major hospitals and search engine data. Spain is not discussing any travel corridor with Britain, a Spanish foreign ministry source has told Reuters. Russia has reported 171 new deaths from Covid-19 in the last 24 hours, bringing the total death toll to 6,142. As Covid-19 cases in the north-east of the US drop, states across the south and California are seeing increases \u2013 much to experts\u2019 concern. Oliver Milman reports from New York. As the US enters the heat of summer and coronavirus restrictions start to wind down, public health experts are already noticing a concerning trend \u2013 an uptick in Covid-19 cases in parts of the country. A resurgence in new infections has been detected in states including Florida, Texas and California, as authorities restart normal rhythm of life by allowing certain businesses and public places to reopen. On Sunday, Florida recorded more than 1,000 newly-diagnosed Covid-19 cases for the fifth day of the previous week, with Thursday\u2019s total of 1,413 the highest since the state started providing daily updates in March. In Texas, officials in Dallas said the city hit its highest ever one-day total for new infections on Thursday, at 285, while Houston has also recorded climbing numbers. Read the full story here: Spain is not discussing any travel corridor with Britain, a Spanish foreign ministry source has said after a UK tourism lobby group said corridors allowing unrestricted movement with a number of countries would open from 29 June. Spain is discussing with other European Union countries whether and how to allow tourism from Britain and other states, the source told Reuters. Madrid hopes the EU will agree on common criteria over the coronavirus situation in a territory in order to allow tourists to travel, but will adopt its own criteria if there is no agreement at EU level, the source said. Hong Kong will let some students from mainland China return to resume classes from 15 June, the government has said, in a selective easing of coronavirus border restrictions. School buses will be arranged and students will be subject to health checks, including temperature screening and submission of health declaration forms in Hong Kong and bordering Shenzhen as they commute to school, Reuters reports. Hong Kong has to date reported 1,108 coronavirus cases and four deaths. Horse racing is due to resume in Turkey \u2013 although this one may not have got the memo about social distancing. And here is another full story from Lily Kuo on China\u2019s warning that its students should reconsider travelling to Australia for study. The original blog post take from two and a half hours ago is here. Staying in south-east Asia, the Philippines has recorded six new coronavirus deaths and 518 additional infections in the last 24-hour period. Its health ministry said the death toll increased to 1,017 while confirmed cases have reached 22,992. Indonesia has reported its biggest daily rise in Covid-19 infections. The country\u2019s health ministry recorded 1,043 new cases in the past 24 hours, bringing its total to 33,076. There were also 40 new deaths, bringing the total number of fatalities to 1,923. Indonesia had, as of today, tested more than 281,650 people for the virus. Further to the post from a few hours ago, here is Lily Kuo\u2019s full story on how Covid-19 may have been spreading in Wuhan as far back as last August. With virus travel restrictions preventing summer holidays abroad, the Lithuanian capital city Vilnius is offering a low-cost alternative by mimicking the look and feel of different countries at weekends. France, Japan and the US are among the more than half-a-dozen nations that residents can get a taste of without leaving the Baltic city. Last weekend Italian music filled the Old Town, while local restaurants offered Mediterranean dishes as green, white and red flags fluttered nearby. Aurelija Baniulaitiene, a Lithuanian civil servant who came with a friend to an open-air restaurant, said the southern European atmosphere helped her \u201cleave the lockdown cocoon\u201d. In the weeks to come, the theme will change to India, the United States, France, Spain, Germany and Japan. Rasa Kliostoraityte, a translator who presented three books by contemporary Italian writers as part of the initiative, hoped it would allow \u201cpeople to enjoy the Italian spirit without leaving the city\u201d. Her husband, the Italian-born singer Mario Di Pasquale, had mixed feelings before taking his guitar to the stage near the 17th century St John\u2019s Church bell tower that dominates the city\u2019s skyline. \u201cI had to think if it is fine to celebrate Italy now, when it is suffering so much pain,\u201d the 44-year-old told AFP. \u201cI have not forgotten the victims for a moment and I pay my respect with my songs. Italians themselves started singing folk songs from balconies when the outbreak started,\u201d he added. In the capital\u2019s Bernardine Gardens, the entrance gate invited visitors to enjoy \u201cAn Italian holiday in Vilnius\u201d. Inside the park, a children\u2019s entertainer was disguised as the video game character Super Mario, an Italian plumber. Lithuania itself reopened for tourists from most European countries earlier this month after containing the spread of the disease. Reported Covid-19 deaths stand at just 71, with case numbers at 1,720 in the eurozone nation of 2.8m people. Instead of following false claims that Covid-19 was created in a laboratory, writes Peter Daszak, we should be focusing our efforts on the regions where the next pandemic is likely to emerge. Contrary to the idea that Chinese scientists deliberately released the virus, existing patterns of infection suggest that the wide spread of Covid-19 was a question of when, not if. Only a handful of people work on bat coronaviruses in labs in China, and they wear masks and gloves so as not to contaminate their laboratories. In 2018, we conducted a pilot survey of people living in rural Yunnan province and found nearly 3% had antibodies for bat coronaviruses. Expanding this data to cover the densely populated area in southeast Asia where there are bats known to harbour coronaviruses, we can safely estimate that between one and seven million people are infected with bat coronaviruses each year. The full piece by Peter, who is president of EcoHealth Alliance, a non-profit dedicated to analysing and preventing pandemics, can be found here: We are also running a live blog on the Black Lives Matter protests around the UK. Here it is, with Martin Belam: Covid-19 has spread around the planet, sending billions of people into lockdown as health services struggle to cope. Find out where the virus has spread, and where it has been most deadly, with our detailed set of maps and graphics curated by Pablo Guti\u00e9rrez. Russia has reported 171 new deaths from Covid-19 in the last 24 hours, bringing the total death toll to 6,142. It also reported 8,595 new cases, meaning the number of infections nationwide is now 485,253. Copenhagen\u2019s Tivoli amusement park reopened yesterday \u2013 with limited-capacity seating in its rides as per this photo. Denmark\u2019s lockdown is gradually being relaxed, with a wider range of leisure and social activities permitted from Monday. Coronavirus death rates are exposing the deep racial inequalities in Brazil, reports Dom Phillips in Rio de Janeiro. Researchers, doctors and health specialists believe factors including poverty, poor access to health services, overcrowded housing and high rates of health issues such as hypertension are some of the reasons Covid-19 kills proportionally more black Brazilians. \u201cThere is clearly a difference in lethality for whites and non-whites,\u201d says Fernando Bozza, a researcher in infectious diseases at the government research institute Fiocruz, who co-authored the analysis of deaths by race published on 27 May by the Nucleus of Health Operations and Intelligence. The researchers studied health service data on 30,000 patients diagnosed with Covid-19, who had either recovered or died by 18 May. It found that 55% of the black and mixed-race patients died, compared to 38% of white patients. It noted that a black patient who could not read had nearly four times more chance of dying than a white university graduate, \u201cconfirming the enormous disparities in access and quality of treatment in Brazil\u201d. Read the article in full here: Vietnam plans to allow a resumption of flights to and from countries that have had no cases of coronavirus for 30 days, state media cited the prime minister as saying on Tuesday, with priority destinations including Japan, South Korea and Cambodia. In the comments broadcast by Vietnam Television (VTV), Nguyen Xuan Phuc did not specify whether inbound travellers from these places would be subject to a quarantine programme in place since mid March. Vietnam has contained its tally of infections from Covid-19 to a relatively low 332 and reported no deaths, Reuters reports. Tens of thousands of incoming travellers have been put in quarantine. \u201cVietnam is looking to resume international flights with countries that have registered no new Covid-19 cases in 30 days but the resumption needs to be extremely cautious considering the complexity of the pandemic,\u201d VTV quoted the prime minister as saying. The national steering committee for Covid-19 prevention and control had been asked to draft a list of \u201csafe\u201d countries, the prime minister said. He did not say whether countries or airlines had been consulted, but said destinations such as Guangzhou in China, Tokyo, Seoul, Taiwan, Laos and Cambodia were among the priority routes to reopen. German exports and imports slumped in April, posting their biggest declines since 1990 as the coronavirus crisis slashed demand and adding to a gloomy outlook for Europe\u2019s biggest economy. Many economists believe the pandemic will push the German economy into its biggest decline since the end of the second world war in the second quarter. Seasonally adjusted exports fell 24% on the month while imports slid by 16.5%. The trade surplus shrank to \u20ac3.2bn, the federal statistics office said. Economists polled by Reuters had expected exports to fall by 15.6% and saw imports down 16%. The trade surplus was expected to come in at \u20ac10bn. Alexander Krueger, an economist at Bankhaus Lampe, said a recovery may have already started due to a loosening of the lockdown and reopening of borders, but little was left of the last decade\u2019s export boom. \u201cThe road out of the corona trough is long, rocky and above all uncertain, especially for foreign trade,\u201d he said. Despite a \u20ac130bn stimulus package announced last week, which comes on top of \u20ac750bn worth of measures announced in March, the government expects the economy to shrink by 6.3% this year. Economists expect a slow recovery and the pace will depend largely on how fast Germany\u2019s European neighbours and other trade partners, including China and the US, emerge from the crisis. Exports to France and the US, hit hard by the coronavirus, fell most while those to China, which was first affected by the virus but which has since started to see some signs of recovery, fell slightly less sharply, the office said. China\u2019s education ministry has warned that Chinese students should consider whether to study in Australia, amid escalating tensions between Beijing and Canberra, Reuters reports. The ministry warned that there have been multiple incidents of racial incidents targeting Asians in Australia amid the Covid-19 pandemic, without elaborating. China last week advised the public to avoid travelling to Australia. In its statement, the ministry reminded \u201coverseas students to conduct a good risk assessment and be cautious about choosing to go to Australia or return to Australia to study\u201d. Our UK coronavirus live blog is now up and running, led by Alexandra Topping: New Zealanders have been enjoying their first day at alert level one, with almost all remaining coronavirus restrictions removed. Some have taken the opportunity for a sunset stroll along the scenic New Brighton beach in Christchurch. The nation has effectively been declared \u201cvirus-free\u201d. Children in the Philippines will not attend school until a vaccine to protect against Covid-19 becomes available, officials have confirmed, prompting fears millions of students could be left without access to education. This story and more can be found in Rebecca Ratcliffe\u2019s global report: Hello everyone \u2013 I\u2019ll be taking you through the next few hours of global coronavirus news. As always, your interaction is highly valued. If you have a tip, observation or any feedback, do drop me a line at nick.ames@theguardian.com or via direct message @NickAmes82. Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s key events so far. Global infections have risen to 7,119,454, with deaths at 406,540, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The US still has the most infections (1,961,185) and deaths (111,007). The UK has the second highest death toll globally (40,680). University of Washington researchers have estimated that 145,728 people could die of Covid-19 in the US by August. Infectious disease experts have said that large street protests held in major cities after George Floyd\u2019s death could spark a new outbreak. Brazil continues its steep trajectory of Covid-19 cases, passing 700,000 infections on Monday (second only to the US), with 37,134 deaths. It passed 500,000 cases on 1 June. The World Health Organization has warned against complacency, saying the coronavirus pandemic situation is worsening around the globe. The WHO said it had recorded its highest daily tally of new infections on Sunday (136,000), with Covid-19 raging in the Americas. \u201cAlthough the situation in Europe is improving, globally it is worsening,\u201d WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. Russia will lift a range of lockdown measures on Tuesday, including the lockdown in Moscow, the city\u2019s mayor has announced. The capital\u2019s restriction on movement end on Tuesday, allowing residents to travel freely for the first time since March. Some measures have gradually eased, with some shops opening. New Zealanders have enjoyed their first day of level-1 restrictions, where all coronavirus measures have been lifted, except at its international borders. A report by the charity CARE international found a \u201cglobal absence\u201d of women in leadership roles in the response to coronavirus. A survey of 30 countries and found on average that women made up only 24% of national response committees. Mexico has reported 354 new deaths and 2,999 new infections from Covid-19. While I\u2019m on the UK, here\u2019s a look at a few of the newspaper front pages .... the Guardian splashes with \u201cBid to defuse tensions as racism protests escalate\u201d. The Telegraph has \u201cSchools may remain shut beyond September\u201d. The FT has \u201cBP to slash 10,000 jobs as virus crisis hammers oil\u201d. And the Times has \u201cStatue thugs must face justice, Patel tells police\u201d. In the UK, plans to reopen English schools before summer are in disarray, after the government admitted that not all primary school pupils will be able to return to the classroom. Boris Johnson last month said his aim was \u201cto get primary pupils back into schools, in stages,\u201d as he announced the opening of primary schools to pupils in reception, year one and year six from 1 June. But government sources now acknowledge that \u2013 with little more than six weeks remaining before schools close for summer \u2013 the practicalities are too difficult for all children to return. You can read our full story below: There is a \u201cglobal absence\u201d of women in leadership roles in the response to coronavirus, according to new research, Press Association reports. The charity CARE International surveyed 30 countries and found on average that women made up only 24% of national response committees. It also found governments with lower levels of women\u2019s leadership risked failing to consider the pandemic\u2019s disproportionate impact on women and girls. The figures follow a UN Women report last month showing lockdown measures had led to an increase in gender-based violence worldwide and had \u201cseriously affected\u201d the economic opportunities of women. CARE\u2019s analysis found 14 countries including the UK and New Zealand \u2013 which has lifted most restrictions after recording no active Covid-19 cases \u2013 have taken action on gender violence during the pandemic by announcing new funding or policies. But only Canada has made funding and policy commitments that \u201cspecifically recognise the economic effect of the pandemic on women\u201d, CARE said. It also found no evidence in nearly 25% of countries of any gender-specific actions or policy. The charity said government at all levels \u201cmust increase women\u2019s leadership in formal decision-making spaces and the humanitarian community must support localised, women-led responses\u201d. \u201cThese actions are mutually reinforcing: women\u2019s rights movements tend to work with women and men in positions of power to advance legal and policy initiatives, and these movements often support more women leaders to emerge and attain power.\u201d New Zealanders woke on Tuesday to no restrictions on their daily lives for the first time since 21 March, with all remaining rules lifted after the country\u2019s last known case of Covid-19 recovered from the virus. People in a nation that appears to have vanquished the coronavirus \u2013 for the time being \u2013 were permitted to hug and kiss strangers, to stand shoulder to shoulder at rock concerts, pray in large groups at mosques and churches, attend rugby games and throw large wedding parties or funerals. Strict border controls remain, with New Zealanders and their families the only people permitted to enter the country. They must remain in government-run quarantine for 14 days. As the Guardian\u2019s Charlotte Graham-McLay in Wellington writes, while no one was openly hugging in the streets on Tuesday, those walking outdoors were giddy with pleasure at the new status. Australia has continued to report positive news on its bid to beat the coronavirus pandemic. On Tuesday it reported no locally transmitted cases of Covid-19. The most populous state of New South Wales had two cases reported in returned travellers, who were in mandatory quarantine. The health minister, Greg Hunt, reiterated how important the continued closure of the country\u2019s borders was: What we have seen now is that in the last four hours, as the states and territories have made their announcements, on the advice I\u2019ve just had from the National Incidence Centre, there have been so far no cases of community transmission. I want to repeat that. On the latest advice I have, so far, there have been no cases of community transmission, two cases overseas-acquired. That explains why our border protections remain so fundamental. Fifty-nine cases in the last seven days. Of those, 69% have been detected through the hotel quarantine or our border protection processes. All travellers returning to Australia are required to complete two weeks in hotel quarantine. Australia has reported over 7,200 cases and 102 deaths from Covid-19 The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 252 to 184,193, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Tuesday. The reported death toll rose by 16 to 8,674, the tally showed. Satellite imagery showing spikes in vehicles outside major hospitals in Wuhan last winter suggest the coronavirus may have been present and spreading in the city months before authorities acknowledged the disease. Researchers from Harvard Medical School, Boston University of Public Health and Boston Children\u2019s Hospital analysed satellite imagery of the parking lots of major hospitals in Wuhan between 9 Jan 2018 and 30 April, 2020, as well as internet search trends. According to the study, which is still under peer review, vehicle counts extracted from the high-resolution images of Wuhan hospital parking lots showed a \u201csteep increase\u201d starting in August 2019 and peaking in December 2019. Between September and October, five of the six hospitals analysed saw their highest daily volume of cars. Search query terms for \u201cdiarrhoea\u201d and \u201ccough\u201d show a large increase about 3 weeks before the spike in confirmed Covid-19 cases in late 2019, the study said. The authors said that while they cannot confirm if the increased vehicle volume was directly related to the new virus, the evidence \u201csupports other recent work showing that emergence happened before identification at the Huanan Seafood market,\u201d in late December when Chinese officials reported a cluster at the market in central Wuhan. \u201cThese findings also corroborate the hypothesis that the virus emerged naturally in southern China and was potentially already circulating at the time of the Wuhan cluster,\u201d the report said. \u201cSomething was happening in October,\u201d John S Brownstein of Boston Children\u2019s Hospital told ABC News. \u201cClearly, there was some level of social disruption taking place well before what was previously identified as the start of the novel coronavirus pandemic.\u201d Given the focus on the protest marches in the US, I thought it might be a good time to take a look at what\u2019s happening in the US at the moment in terms of daily infections. The last figures available on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website showing new daily infections are as follows: 7 June - 17,919 6 June - 29,214 5 June - 29,034 4 June - 20,555 3 June -14,676 2 June - 25,955 The CDC says the total infections are 1,938,823, and total deaths are 110,375. The graph below from Our World in Data gives you an idea of the US\u2019s \u201ccurve\u201d on infections. Many of you will remember the US Navy aircraft carrier, the Roosevelt, which docked in Guam, with sailors infected with coronavirus, and its captain Brett Crozier who was fired after sounding the alarm over the cases onboard. A navy investigation has found that about 60% of the roughly 400 sailors tested had antibodies for the virus, three US officials told Reuters on Monday, on the condition of anonymity. All 4,800 sailors onboard the ship were tested for the coronavirus previously, and about a quarter tested positive. But in April the Navy and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) started conducting a serology test to look for the presence of specific antibodies. University of Washington researchers have estimated that 145,728 people could die of Covid-19 in the United States by August, raising their forecast by more than 5,000 fatalities in a matter of days. On Friday, the widely cited Institute for Health Metrics and evaluation at the university projected 140,496 deaths by August from Covid-19. Researchers did not give a reason for the abrupt revision. The new estimate came on the same day that Texas reported its highest number of hospitalisations so far in the pandemic and 22 US states showed at least a small uptick in the number of new confirmed cases, according toJohns Hopkins University figures. Among the states with the sharpest increases were Michigan and Arizona, according to Johns Hopkins, while Virginia, Rhode Island and Nebraska showed the greatest decreases. Infectious disease experts have said that large street protests held in major cities after George Floyd\u2019s death could spark a new outbreak. This picture of the blue blood of horseshoe crabs being extracted is quite incredible. The blood is used in medicine to ensure that anything that gets injected or implanted into humans is free from bacteria ... and it has become very important in the race to find a coronavirus vaccine. The Smithsonian magazine is reporting that an estimated 50,000 crabs die during the annual blood harvest, and, as a result, there has been a push to develop a synthetic replacement, but not all companies are in favour. You can read our full story here. Ok, so I want to quickly clear up the Mexico issue. It is NOT 2,999 new deaths reported on Monday. It is new cases. The new deaths figure for Monday is actually 354. Thanks for your patience on this one. When a figure looks wrong or out of context, it often is. Below is a tweet where you can see the official figures. Just looking at those Mexico figures again of 2,999* deaths on Monday for a minute ... the US has only recorded three days throughout the entire pandemic with deaths higher than 2,999 (April 16, 19, 24), according to Our World in Data (OWID). Brazil\u2019s highest recorded daily death toll is 1,473 (also OWID). So if those figures are correctly attributed to one day, it would mark a dark day indeed for Mexico. We will try and get some more information on that for you as soon as possible. * This figure was originally quoted by Reuters as the death toll, but it should have been the new daily cases. It has now been clarified \u2013 please see this post. Mexico daily coronavirus figures The Mexican government has reported 2,999* new deaths attributed to Covid-19 on Monday, the Reuters news agency reports. The country\u2019s previous highest daily total was 1,091, on Thursday. I am still waiting for clarification but the last two days have been much lower (188 and341), which may be linked to lower reporting rates on weekends. The government says cases stand at 120,102 and the official coronavirus death toll is now 14,053. * This figure was originally quoted by Reuters as the death toll, but it should have been the new daily cases. It has now been clarified \u2013 please see this post. Russia will lift a range of lockdown measures on Tuesday, including the lockdown in Moscow, the city\u2019s mayor has announced. The capital\u2019s restriction on movement would end on Tuesday, allowing residents to travel freely for the first time since March. Some measures have gradually eased, with some shops opening. Sergei Sobyanin said all restrictions on movement will lift on Tuesdays, with restaurants and cafes expected to start opening from mid June. Russia continues to report thousands of new infections daily. Its nationwide tally is more than 476,000, the third-highest in the world, but the number of cases in Moscow, the original epicentre of the virus, has more than halved to around 2,000 a day. The world has recorded its highest daily jump of cases (136,000), according to the WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who said: \u201cMore than six months into the pandemic, this is not the time for any country to take its foot off the pedal.\u201d \u201cAlthough the situation in Europe is improving, globally it is worsening,\u201d he said. Nearly 75% of the 136,000 cases were reported from 10 countries, mostly in the Americas and South Asia. The WHO emergencies chief, Dr Mike Ryan, said retrospective studies of how the outbreak has been addressed could wait, adding: \u201cWe need to focus now on what we are doing today to prevent second peaks.\u201d Ryan also said infections in central American countries including Guatemala were still on the rise, and that they were \u201ccomplex\u201d epidemics. \u201cI think this is a time of great concern,\u201d he said, calling for strong government leadership and international support for the region. Maria van Kerkhove, the WHO\u2019s technical lead on the virus, said that a \u201ccomprehensive approach\u201d was essential in South America. \u201cThis is far from over,\u201d van Kerkhove said, adding that asymptomatic transmission of the virus \u201cappears to be rare\u201d. South America\u2019s worst affected country now has 707,412 and deaths recorded are 37,134. It marks a continuing steep rise \u2013 Brazil recorded 500,000 cases on 1 June. A leading newspaper in the country reported that Brazil\u2019s health ministry slashed the number of new Covid-19 deaths it reported on Sunday by 857 because far-right president Jair Bolsonaro wanted less than a thousand deaths a day. The Guardian\u2019s Dom Phillips in Rio de Janeiro writes: On Sunday the health ministry said 1,382 deaths had been recorded in the previous 24 hours, but later corrected it down to 525. On Monday the Estado de S.Paulo newspaper reported that the correction was ordered because Bolsonaro wanted the number of deaths at less than a thousand a day. He has vociferously attacked social isolation and notoriously quipped \u201cso what?\u201d to the rising death toll in April. To accommodate him, the health ministry separated out all the deaths reported over 24 hours \u2013 as it had been doing for months \u2013 and began including only deaths that had actually occurred during the last day. The correction came two days after the Ministry stopped releasing accumulated cases and deaths in a daily bulletin and wiped a government site clean of data \u2013 a move also reportedly ordered by Bolsonaro that provoked widespread condemnation. Hello and welcome to our continuing live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic, with me Alison Rourke. If you would like to get in touch, you can email me at Alison.Rourke@guardian.co.uk. Before we dive in, let\u2019s get up to speed on what\u2019s happening right now... Infections globally have passed 7 million and deaths have passed 400,000, according to Johns Hopkins University. Brazil cases pass 700,000. The country\u2019s health ministry says cases now stand at 707,412 and deaths recorded are 37,134. A Brazilian senator called for an inquiry into Covid-19 data, after the country shared contradictory figures on deaths and infections. The discrepancy prompted criticism from across the political spectrum, and a leading newspaper has reported the health ministry slashed the number of deaths it reported by 857 because president Jair Bolsonaro wanted less than a thousand deaths a day. The World Health Organization has warned against complacency, saying the coronavirus pandemic situation is worsening around the globe. The WHO said it had recorded its highest daily tally of new infections on Sunday (136,000), with Covid-19 raging in the Americas. \u201cAlthough the situation in Europe is improving, globally it is worsening,\u201d WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. The WHO\u2019s technical lead on coronavirus, Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, has said it \u201cappears to be rare\u201d that asymptomatic cases transmit coronavirus. Moscow is lifting its months-long lockdown, mayor Sergei Sobyanin said. Local media reported that the Russian capital\u2019s general lockdown would end on Tuesday, allowing residents to travel freely for the first time since late March. Poland will close 12 coal mines from Tuesday for three weeks to curb the spread of the coronavirus among miners. Miners account for almost 20% of coronavirus cases reported in the country. Over half of pregnant women hospitalised for coronavirus in UK were BAME, a study has found. The research looked at data for 427 pregnant women admitted to 194 obstetric units in the UK with a positive Covid-19 infection between 1 March and 14 April. South Africa has passed 1,000 deaths and 50,000 cases. The grim milestones were passed just a week after the country further eased lockdown restrictions. At 50,879 the number of detected infections is the worst in Africa, and two-thirds are in the Western Cape province. South Africa ranks second in terms of deaths at 1,080 after Egypt. Antiracist protesters should wear masks, says Tedros. The director general of the WHO has called on people attending antiracism protests to wear masks, as he warned that the biggest threat in the ongoing coronavirus outbreak \u201cwas now complacency.\u201d The UK has recorded its lowest daily death toll since 22 March. A further 55 people have died after contracting Covid-19 in UK, taking the country\u2019s death toll to 40,597. This is the lowest daily total of newly reported deaths since 22 March, but there is often a reporting lag over a weekend. The figures do not include all deaths across the UK, which is thought to have passed 50,000.",
