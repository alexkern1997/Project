the spread of the coronavirus after cases rose to nearly 60,000, almost double their level a week earlier, the World Health Organization said on Thursday.</p> <p>\u201cNew cases have been reported in some of the most vulnerable countries with fragile health systems,\u201d said Ahmed Al-Mandhari, the WHO\u2019s director for the Eastern Mediterranean region, which includes Pakistan, Afghanistan, Somalia and Djibouti, as well as Middle Eastern states.</p> <p><strong>\u201cEven in countries with stronger heath systems, we have seen a worrying spike in the numbers of cases and deaths

just over 50,000 cases, confirmed coronavirus numbers have been relatively low in the Middle East compared to Europe, the United States and Asia.</p> <p>But health officials fear that cases of the

Just shortly after Donald Trump undermined recommendations that Americans should wear masks, Melania Trump has urged people to \u201ctake social distancing &amp; wearing a mask/face covering seriously\u201d. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is now recommending Americans cover their faces when outside. But, at his daily press briefing, the US president Donald Trump said he would not be following the guidance. \u201cI\u2019m choosing not to do it,\u201d he said, repeatedly noting that wearing non-medical grade masks is a \u201cvoluntary\u201d option. Hello this is Rebecca Ratcliffe, taking over from Kevin Rawlinson. Here\u2019s a summary of the latest developments: Aleast 58,773 people across the world have now died as a result of the pandemic, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. The UK has endured its deadliest day so far, with 684 more people dying in UK hospitals. This brings the total number of UK fatalities to 3,605. The country\u2019s Department of Health and Social Care says 173,784 people have been tested; of whom 38,168 were positive. Americans should cover their faces when outside, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is recommending. But the US president Donald Trump has undermined the guidance, saying: \u201cI\u2019m choosing not to do it.\u201d Italy has recorded 766 more deaths, but the infection rate has continued to slow. Some 85,388 people are currently infected, with an increase of 2,339 new cases; 138 fewer than Thursday. The Falklands Islands has confirmed its first case. The patient has been hospitalised since 31 March and developed a range of Covid-19 symptoms, tested positive for the virus, and is now in a stable condition. The number of cases detected in Egypt jumped to 985, the country\u2019s health ministry said. A large-scale public inquiry into the UK response is now inevitable, a former head of the country\u2019s civil service has said. There are demands for better protection for the UK\u2019s healthcare workers following the deaths of two nurses in their 30s, while another frontline worker quit her job after being forbidden from wearing a face mask. Albania reported 27 new cases \u2013 its second biggest daily increase \u2013 and ordered a third 40-hour lockdown over the weekend. Police surrounded Geneva\u2019s main prison after some 40 prisoners refused to return to their cells from their daily walk, complaining about measures taken due to the pandemic. The daughter of a Dutch man, who died aboard a coronavirus-stricken cruise ship that docked in Florida Thursday after 12 days stranded at sea, says her family has been told it will be unable to recover his remains, Erin McCormick and Patrick Greenfield report. Angelique Slagmolen of the Netherlands, said her 72-year-old father Albert Slagmolen died after several days on a ventilator onboard the ship. But she said, after her family filled out forms to try to bring his remains home, they were informed matter of factly by officials in Florida that he would be cremated there. \u201cI don\u2019t even know where my dad is,\u201d said Slagmolen. She said she felt her father, who had several pre-existing conditions and was generally in poor health, had been well cared for aboard the ship. But the situation had turned into a nightmare for her family. \u201cIt\u2019s like a bad movie \u2013 and the movie is getting worse every day,\u201d she said. The Guardian has been contacted by the Broward County medical examiner about the issue who said there will not be a cremation without family approval. \u201cWe want him to go home as much as anyone else does,\u201d said Broward County Medical Examiner Craig Mallak. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Trump in response to a question asking where Dr Anthony Fauci is today. Fauci has not joined in the briefing today. \u201cWhenever he\u2019s not here,\u201d Trump complained, \u201cthe fake news\u201d will ask about him. You can follow our US-focused coronavirus coverage here: The masks are more for the protection of other people than oneself, the US surgeon general has clarified. Wearing a cloth face covering will help contain you coughs and sneezes, reducing chances that you\u2019ll spray infectious droplets into the air, and risk transmitting the disease the others. Still \u201cmaintaining six feet of social distancing remains key\u201d, he said. Masks are \u201cnot a replacement for social distancing\u201d. All Americans, including those without health insurance, will be able to receive treatment without worrying about the cost, according to the vice-president, Mike Pence. But it\u2019s unclear what provisions will be made to ensure that \u2014 the administration has repeatedly ignored calls from Democratic lawmakers to reopen the Obamacare exchanges to allow the uninsured to purchase insurance. Returning to Washington DC, here\u2019s more from the CDC: CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission. Health officials say the previous distancing and hygiene guidance remains in place. Equipment shortages within England\u2019s health service are such that one NHS trust has had to put out a call for donations on social media: Trump says he is directing the Federal Emergency Management Agency to prevent the export of N95 masks under the Defense Production Act. Earlier, the US was accused of \u201cmodern piracy\u201d after reportedly diverting a shipment of masks intended for the German police, and outbidding other countries in the increasingly fraught global market for coronavirus protective equipment. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is now recommending Americans cover their faces when outside, the White House says. But, at his daily press briefing, the US president Donald Trump has repeatedly undermined the guideline. \u201cI\u2019m choosing not to do it,\u201d he said, repeatedly noting that wearing non-medical grade masks is a \u201cvoluntary\u201d option. The Falkland Islands government has confirmed the island territory\u2019s first case. The patient has been hospitalised since 31 March and developed a range of Covid-19 symptoms, tested positive for the virus, and is now in a stable condition and being cared for with necessary isolation procedures. Demands for better protection for the UK\u2019s healthcare workers are growing following the death of two nurses in their 30s, while another frontline worker quit her job after being forbidden from wearing a face mask, Haroon Siddique, Nazia Parveen and Alexandra Topping write. Areema Nasreen, 36, died shortly after midnight on Friday at Walsall Manor hospital in the West Midlands, where she had worked for 16 years. Aimee O\u2019Rourke, 38, who joined the NHS in 2017 and worked at Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother hospital in Margate, Kent, died hours earlier, on Thursday night. Both were mothers of three children. Two NHS healthcare assistants have also died. The family of Thomas Harvey, 57, who worked in north-east London, believe he would still be alive today if he had been given proper personal protective equipment (PPE), they told Sky News. The number of cases detected in Egypt has jumped by more than 100 for the first time, bringing total infections to 985, the country\u2019s health ministry has said. It announced that 120 new cases and eight more deaths have been recorded. That brought the total number of deaths to 66. Egyptian officials have said that once the number of known infections surpasses 1,000, the task of tracing contacts and quarantining those affected would become harder. The prime minister, Mostafa Madbouly, has said the next week will be critical in Egypt\u2019s efforts to contain the illness. UK biomedical scientists and National Health Service laboratory staff have expressed \u201cfrustration\u201d at a lack of resources preventing them from carrying out larger numbers of tests. On Thursday, the country\u2019s health secretary Matt Hancock committed to raising testing numbers to 100,000 a day by the end of April. But the Institute of Biomedical Science has said: The UK has numerous high-quality accredited laboratories with suitable equipment, with the capability to process over 100,000 tests per day, set up and ready to meet testing targets. Staffing levels are currently adequate to expand Covid-19 testing. Biomedical scientists across the UK have already been re-trained to carry out testing or free up virology-trained staff to focus on testing. Currently, England could process up to 25,000 a day, which by May could rise to 100,000, meeting the ambitious target set down by Matt Hancock, all within the NHS. However, there is a material supply issue with a worldwide shortage in reagent kits. The supply of precision plastics that are used with the reagents are not due to be ready until mid-May. Police have surrounded Geneva\u2019s main prison after some 40 prisoners refused to return to their cells from their daily walk, complaining about measures taken due to the pandemic. Laurent Forestier, the spokesman for prisons in Geneva, has said: There was a refusal to go back to their cells. At the end of the afternoon, the prisoners who were finishing their walk inside the prison refused to go back to their cells Discussions are continuing and it\u2019s not over yet. There has been one confirmed infection in the facility, Forestier said, adding that the person had been hospitalised. French-language Swiss broadcaster RTS said on Twitter that police have surrounded the area. The chronically-overcrowded Champ-Dollon prison, located in the Geneva countryside, was built for 400 inmates but had some 600 last month, the daily Le Temps said. Muhammad Siddique, the father of my Guardian colleague Haroon Siddique, died last week after being hospitalised with coronavirus symptoms. Haroon has written this beautiful obituary in his father\u2019s memory: Albania has reported 27 new cases \u2013 its second biggest daily surge \u2013 and ordered a third 40-hour lockdown over the weekend to halt the spread of the highly contagious pathogen that has killed 17 in the country so far. Albania had reported its largest single day of confirmed cases on March 26 with 28. After declaring the pandemic a natural calamity, Albania extended the shutdown of any activity, its borders, businesses and transport, except for a few essential industries during an eight-hour daily window. Telecoms engineers are facing verbal and physical threats during the lockdown, as baseless conspiracy theories linking coronavirus to the roll-out of 5G technology spread by celebrities such as Amanda Holden prompt members of the public to abuse those maintaining vital mobile phone and broadband networks. Warehouse workers for the fast fashion brands Pretty Little Thing and Boo Hoo are begging consumers to stop ordering non-essential items such as \u00a36 boob tubes and \u00a38 false eyelashes after orders at one depot more than tripled in a week, Helen Pidd and Amy Walker write. Morale is said to be \u201crock bottom\u201d at Pretty Little Thing\u2019s fulfilment centre in Tinsley, Sheffield, where workers doing 12-hour shifts said they were processing orders for 400,000 items this week, up from 120,000 in a \u201cnormal\u201d week. They also complain it is \u201cpractically impossible\u201d for hundreds of staff on each shift to keep two metres apart and still meet their hourly targets of picking 80 items. They also clock on using an unhygienic fingerprint scanner, though Pretty Little Thing (PLT) says a staff member thoroughly wipes the equipment after every use. The work of the Reuters news agency in Iraq has been suspended for three months after the outlet reported that the country\u2019s government was underreporting confirmed cases. Reuters was also fined 25 million Iraqi dinars (about \u00a317,000 or $20,800), according to a statement posted on the official Communication and Media Commission website. The Reuters story cited multiple sources who said the government was vastly misreporting cases of coronavirus in the country, saying the true number of those infected was in the thousands. The country\u2019s health ministry said on Friday there were 820 confirmed cases and 54 deaths. The Reuters report said the true number ranged from 3,000 to 9,000. Reuters said it has not received any notification from Iraqi authorities regarding their license and were seeking clarification on the matter. The agency said it stood by its report. The scale of the coronavirus outbreak and the response it has required from the UK government means a large-scale public inquiry is now inevitable, a former head of the country\u2019s civil service has said. Sir Bob Kerslake said the scope of the decision-making undertaken by politicians and officials had been vast, and, as some of it had already been challenged, there would need to be a chance to reflect upon the UK\u2019s response in case of another pandemic. There will need to be some sort of inquiry after we get through this to learn lessons. This is one where we might face the same situation again. I hope that even during this clear crisis moment there is a proper record being kept of who made decisions and why, because that will be very, very important. Not to lay blame \u2013 though clearly there will be a bit of that \u2013 but to plan for the future. We could face this again and it could be even worse. Disney is delaying the release of upcoming films because of the pandemic. The action epic \u201cMulan\u201d will come out in July and Marvel\u2019s \u201cBlack Widow\u201d will be available in November. Among other changes, Disney postponed the release of a new \u201cIndiana Jones\u201d film by one year to July 2022. The UK government\u2019s pledge to carry out 100,000 tests per day by the end of the month is \u201crealistic\u201d, Public Health England\u2019s director of public health improvement has said. Prof John Newton has told Channel 4 News: It is realistic. We have some really good progress. We\u2019re using tried and tested technology, this is not innovation \u2013 it\u2019s massive, industrial-scale rollout of these three big mega-labs in Milton Keynes, Manchester and Glasgow. And they are already delivering tests \u2013 many thousands of tests a day \u2013 and we are really looking forward to seeing that number go up soon. The number of funerals in Jakarta rose sharply in March, a development the governor of Indonesia\u2019s capital city said suggested that deaths from the new coronavirus may be higher than officially reported. Nearly 4,400 burials occurred in the month; 40% higher than any month since at least January 2018, according to a Reuters review of statistics from the city\u2019s Department of Parks and Cemeteries. Jakarta\u2019s governor, Anies Baswedan, and some public health experts suspect the number of infections and deaths in Jakarta has been significantly under-reported due to one of the world\u2019s lowest rates of testing. It is extremely disturbing. I\u2019m struggling to find another reason than unreported Covid-19 deaths. Known global death toll passes 55,000. At least 55,781 people across the world have now died as a result of the pandemic, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. The number of confirmed cases passed a million on Thursday and at least 1,056,777 people are now known to have been infected. The true scale of the outbreak is likely to be greater due to suspected underreporting by some nations. UK endures deadliest day so far. It is confirmed that 684 more people have died in UK hospitals, bringing the total to 3,605 and making the 24 hours to 5pm on Thursday (BST) the deadliest since the outbreak began. The country\u2019s Department of Health and Social Care says 173,784 people have been tested; of whom 38,168 were positive. New York reports nearly 3,000 deaths. The state\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, announcesd that 2,935 people have now died. The toll, up from from 2,373 a day earlier, represents the highest single-day rise since the coronavirus crisis struck. There are 102,863 confirmed cases in New York. Cuomo said that hospitals havein effect turned into ICU hospitals for Covid-19 patients. Italy records 766 more deaths \u2013 but infection rate slows. The number of deaths on Friday was relatively steady, when compared to those seen the previous day. But new infections continue to slow down, raising hopes of turnaround. Some 85,388 people are currently infected, with an increase of 2,339 new cases; 138 fewer than Thursday. Italy remains the world\u2019s worst-hit country, having suffered a total of 14,681 deaths. More than 250,000 EU citizens stranded abroad. Some 350,000 have been repatriated but that still leaves a quarter of a million EU citizens trying to get home. Josep Borrell, the bloc\u2019s foreign policy chief, says operations are under way to retrieve them. But he adds: \u201cOne could not imagine that there are so many Europeans stranded in the world: tourists; visitors; short-term workers.\u201d Swiss death toll rises to 484. The Swiss government announced an increase in the number of deaths, adding that the number of positive cases now stands at 19,903. Switzerland has closed schools and many businesses, as well as banning gatherings of more than five people. WHO said countries must avoid a cycle of lockdown, relaxation, and further lockdown. The organisation called on countries to develop a just transition strategy that gets them in control of the virus. English Premier League asks players to take 30% wage cut. Premier League clubs announce they are \u201ccommitting \u00a320m to support the NHS, communities, families and vulnerable groups during the pandemic\u201d. While older people are more likely to die if they contract coronavirus, evidence continues to show that younger people are also being severely impacted. Dr David Hepburn, ICU consultant at Newport\u2019s Royal Gwent hospital in south Wales, has said all the patients there are under-50. Speaking to Channel 4 News, he said: The pattern of illness that we\u2019ve seen in Gwent, and I can\u2019t speak for anywhere else, is much younger patients than we were expecting. When the reports started coming out of Wuhan, we were led to believe that this was something that was particularly dangerous for the more elderly patients but I would say all the patients we\u2019ve got an intensive care are in their 50s or younger at the moment. Our youngest patient is in her early 20s. And there are, you know, there are patients who are very well, you know, a chap who\u2019s a fitness professional but you know there are a lot of patients who are not, do not have any pre-existing medical conditions. They\u2019re not diabetic or anything like that. We\u2019ve got 16 ventilated patients in the intensive care unit at the minute, which has led us to completely run out of space. So we\u2019ve taken over theatre recovery, and we\u2019ve got a further eight there. I think by the end of today, we will fill recovery. So that\u2019ll bring us up to 25 patients. And then we have another area prepared, which is the old high dependency unit and coronary care that we\u2019ve taken over as well. We can fit a further 22 patients in that area. The way things are going at the minute, the rate of growth and the amount of admissions that we\u2019re seeing, I would say we will fill that by the end of the week, probably. The WHO briefing ends with Georgieva saying the world will get through the epidemic, but how quickly that happens depends on the actions that countries take now. Adhanom added that \u201cboth lives and livelihoods matter\u201d. When asked about the effectiveness of using masks, Ryan said there is a very healthy debate going on. He said countries must prioritise giving surgical and medical masks for healthcare workers. WHO already advises that people use medical masks for people who are ill at home and people caring for people at sick at home. He added the evidence suggests that wearing a mask in public doesn\u2019t necessarily protect someone, but it can be of use to someone who is experiencing symptoms and thus reduce the rate that an infected individual infects others. WHO said countries need a transition strategy that gets them in control of the virus. Countries need to avoid a cycle of lockdown, relaxation of rules, followed by a further lockdown. Ryan said WHO has repeatedly warned that young people are also at risk from this virus. He said even in South Korea, which has managed to control the disease, one in six deaths have been of people under 60. In Italy, over the last six weeks, at least 10-15% of people in intensive care have been under 50, Ryan explained. Ryan said: It\u2019s not that anything has changed. It\u2019s that we collectively have been living in a world where we\u2019ve tried to convince ourselves that this disease is mild in the young people and it\u2019s more severe in older people and that\u2019s where the problem is. I think the evidence has been there all along that there is a spectrum of severity and its definitely more severe in older age groups, but there is a spectrum of severity in younger people as well. When asked what WHO\u2019s stance is on antibody testing and immunity passports, Dr Maria Van Kerkhove said WHO is \u201cworking with a number of countries that are looking into the use of serologic assays in the form of research.\u201d The test will estimate the antibody levels in populations in a country. She added it is a positive sign that there are a number of tests being rapidly developed. The IMF has been asked whether it would grant debt relief to African nations where citizens who are following social distancing guidelines are now more worried about dying from hunger than the coronavirus. IMF\u2019s Kristalina Georgieva said it\u2019s important to provide significant financial support to African countries. She said the board approved emergency finances for Rwanda and two more African countries are in discussion for approval today. The briefing has now moved to questions from journalists. The first question asked if there is anything in the diet, lifestyle or drug protocol that Americans or Europeans use that make this virus more severe Dr Michael J Ryan, executive director of the WHO\u2019s health emergencies programme, said the evidence so far would indicate that antihypertensive drugs that many people are on does not have any impact on the severity of the disease. The difference in mortality rates between countries could be down to the age profile of the country, some have a higher population of older populations, and the presence of underlying conditions. Italy registered 766 more deaths from Covid-19 on Friday - 6 more than Thursday - and remains the country worst affected by the outbreak with a total of 14,681 deaths. However, new infections continue to slow down, raising hopes of turnaround. Some 85.388 are currently infected with an increase of 2339 new cases, 138 less than Thursday. Some 1.480 have recovered in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number to 19.758. In total, 119.827 people have tested positive with coronavirus in Italy, including people who have died, recovered and the ones who are currently infected. Lockdown in the country could be extended until May 1 and \u2018phase two\u2019 of living with the virus can begin in mid-May, Emergency Commissioner Angelo Borrelli said Friday. The government has officially extended the coronavirus lockdown until Easter in mid-April, but Borrelli stressed the importance of keeping to \u201cthe most rigorous conduct in observing lockdown rules\u2019\u2019. \u2018\u2019The date of emerging from lockdown is still not certain at all\u201d, Borrelli added. In the meantime, 77 health workers in Italy have died from coronavirus since the outbreak there began, as medics work relentlessly to try to turn the tide in Europe\u2019s worst-affected country. The majority were on the frontline in the badly affected northern regions and contracted the illness at the start of the outbreak when protective equipment was lacking. Adhanom said almost $690 million has now been pledged or received since it asked for support nearly two months ago Tedros Adhanom, WHO\u2019s director general, is leading a press conference on the coronavirus. He has called for countries to provide free care and testing for covid-19, regardless of a person\u2019s insurance, citizenship or residency status. \u201cThis is an unprecedented crisis which requires an unprecedented response,\u201d he said. Adhanom added that country\u2019s should consider using cash transfers for the most vulnerable households.suspend Ontario has been lagging behind other Canadian provinces in testing for coronavirus because in the early weeks of the outbreak its public labs relied heavily on a single company for needed chemicals, Reuters reports. There are thought to be thousands of backlogged cases in Ontario, Canada\u2019s most heavily populated region. The province is focused on ramping testing back up, particularly for healthcare workers. As of Wednesday, Ontario had tested 4,188 per million residents, less than every Canadian province except New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, which have far fewer cases. Alberta had tested 11,139 per million, and Quebec 8,216 per million. The provincial public health agency\u2019s labs were heavily dependent on one company\u2019s system to extract RNA, the virus\u2019s genetic material, the agency told Reuters. Hundreds of US citizens have been stranded in Moscow after an evacuation flight to New York was grounded at the last moment due to a Russian ban on all international flights. The Aeroflot flight was meant to carry US citizens seeking to leave Russia, and then repatriate hundreds of Russians stranded in the US. Russia has closed its international borders for most travellers, and this afternoon announced it would impose a ban on all international flights in and out of Russia as of Saturday morning. The cancellation came after passengers had already boarded the flight. Some had been trying to leave Russia for weeks. Others had been living in Moscow\u2019s Sheremetyevo airport for days, waiting for a chance to leave the country. Nicholas Mackay, a ballet photographer who lives in Russia, said that he has been trying to travel to the US for several weeks to reach his father, who has cancer. \u201cWe were already on the flight, and then a flight attendant came on over the intercom and told us that we are not flying out, the flight is cancelled and all flights are cancelled by the Russian government,\u201d he said by telephone. \u201cThere\u2019s no information. We\u2019re not even able to get any money back from our flight. We\u2019re only able to change for a different day. A different day is no day, because no one knows when international travel will be OK in this whole situation.\u201d A video uploaded by his brother, Julian, showed angry passengers reacting to the flight cancellation. \u201cIt\u2019s chaos,\u201d he said. A US embassy spokesperson said: \u201cThe US embassy is aware of the inexplicable cancellation of today\u2019s Aeroflot flight to New York. The flight was full of US citizens anxious to get home. We are awaiting an explanation from the Russian Federation. We continue to work to find ways to help US citizens return home.\u201d Canada has recorded almost 12,000 cases of coronavirus, according to the country\u2019s public health agency. The death toll increased to 152 on Friday. Quebec, which has 5,518 confirmed cases as of Friday, is the country\u2019s worst affected region, followed by Ontario, with 3,255 confirmed cases. The Spanish government has said it is working to roll out some form of guaranteed income that could benefit as many as 5 million people as the country reels from the coronavirus epidemic. \u201cWe\u2019re working on a minimum income,\u201d the country\u2019s labour minister, Yolanda D\u00edaz, said on Friday. \u201cWe need it now more than ever.\u201d Spain has emerged as one of the world\u2019s hardest-hit countries, with the virus claiming 10,935 lives. More than 117,000 people have tested positive for Covid-19. The rapid spread of the virus has decimated the country\u2019s tourism industry \u2013 which accounts for nearly 12% of the country\u2019s GDP \u2013 while the near-total lockdown has shuttered bars, restaurants and non-essential shops and halted construction. Nearly 900,000 workers have lost their jobs since the lockdown began on 14 March, while another 620,000 people have been temporarily laid off, government data showed this week, sparking worry in a country where the unemployment rate already ranks among the highest in the Eurozone. \u201cThe data is extraordinary,\u201d the social security minister, Jos\u00e9 Luis Escriv\u00e1, said on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented.\u201d The government has announced a series of measures aimed at softening the blow of the epidemic, including a moratorium on mortgages payments and the suspension of evictions for those affected by the crisis. The minimum income is aimed at complementing these measures, D\u00edaz, the labour minister, told the Spanish broadcaster Cadena Ser, as it will provide protection for vulnerable residents not served by other government measures. She declined to provide more details or a timeline for the measure. The death toll in New York from the coronavirus has jumped to 2,935, governor Andrew Cuomo announced. The death toll, which is up from from 2,373 a day earlier, represented the highest single-day rise since the coronavirus crisis struck the state. There are 102,863 confirmed cases of coronavirus in New York. Cuomo said that hospitals have effectively turned into ICU hospitals for Covid-19 patients. The prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda has written to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to call for debt relief for his country and other small economies hit suffering economic crises caused by the coronavirus outbreak. In a two-page letter published on Thursday to his Facebook page, Gaston Browne, who also finance minister of the Caribbean nation, said that the crisis had already led to the loss of a fifth of GDP, and was only likely to get worse. With airlines grounded, cruise ships berthed and hotels closed in an effort to curb the international spread of the coronavirus, the tourism industry in the region had ceased and governments had taken a huge hit to revenue, Browne said. \u201cAll of this translates into very high unemployment, and an increase in poverty levels that, inevitably, will spur more and varied crime \u2013 drug trafficking, probably becoming rampant\u201d He pointed out that his country and others in the region are trying to battle outbreaks at the same time as preparing what is forecast to be an \u201cabove average\u201d hurricane season, with as many as four major hurricanes expected. \u201cIn the region\u2019s already precarious state, the effects of a hurricane would be catastrophic.\u201d Slovenia will introduce a mandatory 14-day quarantine for most people entering the country from Saturday, Reuters reports. The quarantine will apply to both Slovenian citizens and foreign nationals, the government said on Friday. The penalty for those flouting the decree will be 400 euros ($430), the government said. The new rule will not apply to people who have to travel to the country for work and will not include those involved in cargo traffic or who are passing through Slovenia on their way to another country without staying overnight. Last month, Slovenia closed all schools, bars, restaurants, hotels, sports centres, cultural institutions and shops, except food and drug stores. It has also shut down all public transport. Slovenia has confirmed 934 coronavirus cases and 20 deaths. Premier League players will be asked to take a 30% drop in their wages, via cuts or deferrals or both, in response to the coronavirus pandemic, the clubs agreed at a meeting on Friday. The move came as the 20 top-flight teams said they would give \u00a3125m to the EFL and National League to help their clubs through the crisis and donate \u00a320m to support the NHS, communities, families and vulnerable groups. A Premier League statement said: \u201cIn the face of substantial and continuing losses for the 2019-20 season since the suspension of matches began, and to protect employment throughout the professional game, Premier League clubs unanimously agreed to consult their players regarding a combination of conditional reductions and deferrals amounting to 30% of total annual remuneration.\u201d More than 250,000 European Union citizens are still trying to get home after the EU has repatriated some 350,000 people, Reuters reports. \u201cWe have brought home 350,000 Europeans but there are still 250,000 remaining and many operations are under way,\u201d Josep Borrell, the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief told reporters. \u201cOne could not imagine that there are so many Europeans stranded in the world: tourists, visitors, short-term workers. We are not talking about permanent residents,\u201d Borrell added. With a mix of chartered and military planes, EU institutions are helping member states cover the costs of repatriation on flights with passengers of more than one EU country. How has coronavirus affected global air traffic? Niko Kommenda, the Guardian\u2019s visual projects editor, analysed the data and found thousands of planes are still in the air despite the mass cancellation of flights. French police have increased checks at train stations and motorways on Friday to stop people breaking a national lockdown ahead of school holidays this weekend. Reuters reports 5,307 people have died from the coronavirus in France. Almost 60,000 people there been diagnosed with the illness, and almost 6,400 are on life-support machines, which has put the health system under pressure and overwhelmed hospitals in the Paris and eastern regions. The number of people entering intensive care units has fallen over the last three days and the daily death toll in hospitals stabilised after the government imposed a lockdown on the country\u2019s 67 million population on 17 March, which was extended until 15 April. The government of Jersey has announced a plan to test every citizen for Covid-19 in a programme to be rolled out over the coming weeks. The British crown dependency says it has ordered up to 150,000 antibody test kits which are due to arrive in batches. Known as serology tests, they measure the presence of antibodies in the blood which are known to be produced by those who have already contracted the virus. Jersey went into lockdown on Monday and 96 islanders have so far tested positive. Frontline staff and key workers will be tested first, in order to check whether they have had the disease and therefore potentially gained immunity, meaning they can return to work. The scheme will then be rolled out to other islanders. The first delivery is due by the middle of April. Government medical officer Dr Ivan Muscat said arrangements for expanding testing into the community may involve sending out mobile testing units. \u201cObviously, we would be very interested in working out who is infected and who isn\u2019t,\u201d said Muscat at a press conference, \u201cin order to determine what someone\u2019s diagnosis is and where they\u2019re looked after if they\u2019re admitted to hospital, for example.\u201d Fellow crown dependency the Isle of Man has taken a different approach, choosing to align with UK government advice, which is that antibody test kits are not reliable enough for widespread use in the community. \u201cThe latest advice I\u2019ve received is that so far they are only 30% reliable,\u201d first minister Howard Quayle told the island\u2019s parliament Friday. \u201cWe are obviously watching this and when our medics feel that the test is reliable \u2026 then of course we will be looking to implement that on the Isle of Man too.\u201d Ireland has had a more than fourfold increase in coronavirus outbreaks in nursing homes in the space of a week, Reuters reports. The rate of increase in infections has more than halved across the country since the government implemented restrictions in mid-March. Despite these restrictions, the number of nursing homes reporting clusters of cases rose to 38 from nine from 24-31 March, according to the most recent data released on Friday from Ireland\u2019s health service executive (HSE). \u201cA manifestation of where Covid-19 is at the moment is that the health now of those who are in our nursing homes is a matter of real concern for the government,\u201d the finance minister, Paschal Donohoe, told reporters. \u201cWe are looking at the moment at what additional measures need to be put in place in nursing home environments.\u201d The global scramble to source protective equipment is heating up, Kim Willsher and Oliver Holmes reports. Val\u00e9rie Pecresse, the influential president of the \u00cele-de-France region, which includes Paris, described the race to get hold of masks as a \u201ctreasure hunt\u201d. Pecresse said: I found a stock of masks that was available and Americans \u2013 I\u2019m not talking about the American government \u2013 but Americans, outbid us. They offered three times the price and they proposed to pay upfront. I can\u2019t do that. I\u2019m spending taxpayers\u2019 money and I can only pay on delivery having checked the quality. So we were caught out. About 90% of Americans are under stay-at-home orders as the US tries to get a handle of the rapid spread of coronavirus by enforcing social distancing guidelines. But there are still frustrations with the handful of governors who are resisting issuing statewide orders. The US reported 1,169 coronavirus deaths on Thursday, the highest one-day death toll of any country so far. My colleague Joan Greve is now liveblogging all US-related coronavirus news. A coalition of governments and research institutions from 30 countries has been launched to work on tackling Covid-19 in lower-income countries. The 70 institutions signed up said states with limited resources are being forgotten in the pandemic response, and that very few related clinical trials had been planned for poorer countries despite their wealth of expertise. They called for greater coordination of research efforts in Africa, Latin America, Asia and eastern Europe. \u201cThe more players we have in research and development, the more rich it will be,\u201d said Jean-Michel Piedagnel, the south-east Asia director for the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative, one of the 70. \u201cYou will develop treatment options that are more aligned with the needs of the country and with the means of the country. If you do your clinical trial in a setting where healthcare is underfunded or resource-poor, you will do a different clinical trial, you will do a different treatment.\u201d The World Health Organization\u2019s chief scientist, Dr Soumya Swaminathan, said the initiative would help coordinate a global response. \u201cWe must prepare now for the consequences of this pandemic in more resource-constrained settings or we stand to lose many more lives,\u201d she said. Evans Amukoye, the director of scientific programmes at the Kenya Medical Research Institute, said in the past treatments were often beyond the means of poorer countries. \u201cA lot of people had died before it became accessible. If you look at some diseases you see that where there is no profit there is no investment,\u201d said Amukoye. Russia will suspend all flights bringing Russians home from abroad from Friday night, reports the Interfax news agency. The announcement was made with no explanation. The foreign ministry said on Wednesday that 25,000 Russians abroad had appealed for help getting home, with many still stranded as measures to curb the spread of coronavirus have limited travel options. The UK has endured its deadliest day of the coronavirus pandemic, with 569 fatalities recorded in 24 hours. As Downing Street comes under mounting pressure over its perceived failure to accelerate nationwide testing to combat the virus, the country\u2019s Covid-19 death toll continues to rise. A total of 2,921 people had died in hospitals after testing positive for the disease as of 5pm on Wednesday, representing a slightly bigger increase than the previous day, when there were 563 deaths. Don\u2019t forget, you can also follow our UK coronavirus blog: Russian police have detained a doctors\u2019 rights activist who has been highly critical of the Kremlin\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Anastasia Vasiliyeva, the head of the opposition-leaning Alliance of Doctors union, was detained with other activists last night while attempting to deliver medical equipment in Russia\u2019s Novgorod region. Video of the incident showed Vasiliyeva being dragged into a local police station by police officers and other men in medical masks. In a post, the organisation said Vasiliyeva lost consciousness during the arrest, possibly because she was choked. She is still in custody as of Friday afternoon and has reportedly received citations for violating mandatory quarantine measures and for resisting police orders. Vasiliyeva and the Alliance of Doctors have been highly critical of the government\u2019s preparations for the coronavirus outbreak, accusing the government of faking official statistics about the number of coronavirus cases in Russia and blasting the government for failing to equip hospitals with needed medical supplies. The group had also criticised the government\u2019s airlift of medical equipment and ventilators to the US. \u201cWell, great,\u201d the group wrote. \u201cWe raise money all over the country to buy medical protective equipment, and our government sells PPE to the USA. It\u2019s a mockery.\u201d Greta Thunberg, the 17-year-old Swedish activist who inspired the global school climate strikes, posted a picture of herself striking at home. Last week, Thunberg said in a post on Instagram that she had self-isolated after she and her father returned from a trip around central Europe about two weeks ago. The Swiss government is doubling the size of its coronavirus emergency loan scheme to 40bn Swiss francs ($40.94bn), Reuters reports. The government said on Friday it was inundated by requests for help by businesses and would be expanding bridging loan guarantees from an initial 20bn francs after banks made loans of 14.3bn francs in the first few days of the scheme. So far, more than 76,000 agreements have been made, the government said. The Swiss death toll from coronavirus rose to 484, from 432 on Thursday, while the number of positive tests rose to 19,303. Hi, I\u2019m Aamna taking over the liveblog from my colleague Ben. If you want to get in touch, you can email me (aamna.mohdin@theguardian.com) or tweet at me. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, said on Friday he was remaining in isolation with mild symptoms of the coronavirus, including a high temperature, seven days after he first tested positive. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m feeling better and I\u2019ve done my seven days of isolation, alas I still have one of the symptoms, a minor symptom, I still have a temperature,\u201d Johnson said in a video message posted on Twitter. \u201cSo in accordance with government advice I must continue my self isolation until that symptom itself goes.\u201d Johnson announced a week ago that he had tested positive and would be isolating in Downing Street. In his address, the prime minister told Britons that they needed to stick to the rules on staying at home unless it was essential to go out, ahead of a weekend when good weather is forecast. \u201cI just urge you not to do that (go out). Please, please stick with the guidance now,\u201d he said. \u201cThis country has made a huge effort, a huge sacrifice, done absolutely brilliantly well in delaying the spread of the virus. Let\u2019s stick with it now.\u201d When asked earlier on Friday if Johnson would be out of isolation on Friday, his health minister, Matt Hancock, said: \u201cI\u2019ve absolutely no idea but what I do know is he\u2019s still working.\u201d Hancock tested positive for coronavirus last week at about the same time as Johnson, but he has since left isolation and is working as scheduled. A drive-through coronavirus screening centre in the UAE capital Abu Dhabi has become a go-to destination for many wanting reassurance during the pandemic. The facility, believed to be the first of its kind in the Gulf, greets around 600 people a day in the 12 hours it is in service. The test is free for the elderly, pregnant women and anyone showing symptoms of Covid-19. Others can get tested for 370 dirhams ($100). A nurse approaches the car to take the passengers\u2019 temperatures and then takes a nasal swab - a five-minute procedure. \u201cIt is safer than going to the hospital, which is scary these days, especially for children,\u201d said Mohammed Abdullah al-Thahnani, who took his family to get tested after a 14-day quarantine upon arriving from abroad. French high-school school students will not sit the traditional baccalaur\u00e9at (bac) exam this summer due to the coronavirus, the education minister has said, an unprecedented move that highlights the scale of disruption caused by the pandemic. It is the first time since its inception in 1808 under Napoleon Bonaparte that the \u2018bac\u2019 exam will not take place in its traditional form. Even the sweeping student and labour protests of May 1968 did not prevent the exam going ahead. In the UK, Prince Charles opened a new 4,000-bed temporary hospital in a conference centre in east London, the first of several being built in Britain to deal with the coronavirus outbreak. The new state-run National Health Service (NHS) hospital is named after the trailblazing 19th-century nurse Florence Nightingale and has been built in just nine days. NHS Nightingale London will initially take 500 people in the coming days, said the health secretary, Matt Hancock, who has also tested positive for Covid-19. It will take intensive care patients with Covid-19 from other London hospitals, which have had the highest number of cases across Britain. There are initial signs that the trend in new coronavirus infections in Germany is flattening off, the health minister, Jens Spahn, said on Friday. Speaking during a visit to a logistics company involved in distributing supplies of medical protection equipment, Spahn said Germany had already obtained 1,500 new ventilators \u2013 essential to treating patients with acute cases of the novel coronavirus \u2013 and added that these would be in clinics by April. Efforts to boost the number of intensive care beds available in recent days had resulted in 40% of them being free to receive patients, Spahn said. China\u2019s central bank said on Friday it would cut the reserve requirements for smaller banks to release around 400bn yuan ($56.3bn) in liquidity, a move to counter the coronavirus impact on enterprises. The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) said in a statement it will also slash the interest it pays on financial institutions\u2019 excess reserves for the first time in 12 years, to encourage them to use the cash rather than store it with the central bank. New registrations of cars on German roads plunged in March to its lowest in almost three decades, data shows, as restrictions to slow the spread of the coronavirus inflicted a heavy blow. Sales tumbled 38% year-on-year to just over 215,100 according to data from the KBA vehicle licensing authority. \u201cNecessary health policy measures, like the massive limits on public life, closure of car dealerships and limited ability to work in the licensing offices\u201d had put the brake on the car trade, the VDA carmakers\u2019 federation said. Domestic demand fell 30%, while foreign orders were down 37%. In a quarterly comparison, sales in January-March were down 20% year-on-year. The Russian prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, on Friday said the coronavirus situation in Russia could yet develop into a worst-case scenario, and that the epidemic has not peaked there yet. \u201cIt is clear that the peak of infections has not yet passed, and we can\u2019t rule out the situation developing into the most difficult scenario,\u201d said Mishustin. I am covering the blog for the next hour. Please share your thoughts, news tips and any insights from where you are with me. Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Police in India barricaded parts of one of Asia\u2019s biggest slums on Friday after two coronavirus deaths. It comes as prime Minister Narendra Modi sought to dispel \u201cdarkness and uncertainty\u201d with a national light show. India so far has largely escaped the pandemic, with 2,300 infections and 56 deaths, according to official figures. However, two fatalities and a third infection in the Dharavi neighbourhood of Mumbai have set alarm bells ringing. Authorities have set up eight \u201ccontainment zones\u201d in the area, which was made famous by the 2008 film Slumdog Millionaire. \u201cWe have home-quarantined people from these buildings and cordoned off the area so people can\u2019t enter them, and enforced social distancing,\u201d said Vijay Khabale-Patil, spokesman of Mumbai\u2019s city authority. \u201cWe sprayed hydrochloric acid to disinfect these buildings and nearby areas as well \u2026 People from Dharavi are following the rules and keeping themselves and their kids inside homes.\u201d Police on Friday were not letting anyone in or out of the cordoned areas. In the UK, the deadliest peak of the coronavirus outbreak could be on Easter Sunday, according to the health secretary, Matt Hancock. When asked about reports that the death rate could peak on 12 April, Hancock told Sky: \u201cI defer to the scientists on the exact predictions, I\u2019m not going to steer you away from that. That is one perfectly possible outcome.\u201d Reuters reported on Thursday that the British government\u2019s worst case scenario envisaged the Covid-19 death toll of 50,000 if self-isolation was not fully adhered to and that the worst day for deaths was projected to be 12 April. Iran has announced 134 more deaths from the novel coronavirus, bringing the officially total to 3,294. Health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour told a news conference that 2,715 new infections had been confirmed in the past 24 hours, with cases now rising to 53,183. Iran is one of the countries worst-hit by the coronavirus pandemic and has been struggling to contain the outbreak since it reported its first deaths on 19 February. Jahanpour said 17,935 of those hospitalised with the virus had recovered, while 4,035 were in a critical condition. The government has banned all intercity travel until at least 8 April, and has repeatedly urged Iranians to stay at home. There is no official lockdown inside Iran\u2019s cities. President Hassan Rouhani warned on Thursday that there was no quick fix and that Iran might have to battle the pandemic for another year. Authorities have closed schools and universities as well as four key Shiite pilgrimage destinations, including the Fatima Masumeh shrine in Qom, the city where the first deaths were reported. They have also cancelled the main weekly Friday prayers and temporarily closed parliament. Singapore will close schools and most workplaces for a month as part of stricter measures to curb a recent jump in coronavirus infections, it said on Friday, an announcement that sent locals racing to supermarkets to stock up on staples. The city-state has won international praise for its two-month long battle against a virus that has infected over a million people globally, avoiding lockdown measures increasingly common around the world. But authorities said record jumps in new infections this week, taking its total to 1,114 cases, pointed to the need for a tougher approach. Disease experts have said breaches in Singapore\u2019s lauded virus defence have underlined the challenge of containing the pandemic around the world. Hello everyone. I am taking over the live blog while my colleague Ben Quinn gets some lunch. Please do share any thoughts or insights from where you are with me via any of the channels below. Twitter: @sloumarsh Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Hungarian journalists say a new law supposedly aimed at fighting the coronavirus will make objective reporting of the pandemic harder and leave them open to facing court cases or even jail time for their reporting. The measures, in place since Monday, have been roundly criticised for the sweeping powers they hand to the nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, to rule by decree. Another part of the bill provides penalties of up to five years in prison for those spreading misinformation during the pandemic. Journalists in the country say the new law is already being used to deny them access to information, and on occasion to threaten them. One Budapest-based journalist, who requested anonymity given the current situation in the country, said she had called a hospital over the weekend to follow up on a tip-off about a group of doctors who had reportedly contracted the coronavirus there. \u201cA few minutes later, the hospital\u2019s chief communication officer called me back and asked if I think it\u2019s a good idea to keep asking about this, a day before the government\u2019s bill will be passed,\u201d she said. The death toll in Switzerland has risen to 484 while the number of positive cases stands at 19,903, the Swiss government has said. The country has closed schools, shuttered many businesses and banned gatherings of more than five people as it fights the outbreak. The Premier League\u2019s position at the top of world football could be in danger if a solution to reducing player wages during the coronavirus crisis is not found, an analyst has warned. A week of talks between football bodies and the players\u2019 union, the PFA, has led to little movement before an extraordinary Premier League shareholders meeting on Friday. Away from negotiations, debate has centred on the tone-deafness of some clubs seeking taxpayers\u2019 money to furlough non-playing staff. According to one expert, however, it is also possible that substantial wage bills could hinder the Premier League\u2019s ability to bounce back after the crisis, leaving leading players as easy pickings for rival leagues. South Korea has denied entry to eight foreign nationals after they refused to comply with strict quarantine requirements introduced this week to help the country tackle a rise in coronavirus infections, as anger mounts over visitors who have been caught breaking self-isolation rules. The visitors, from six countries, were deported after they refused to self-isolate for two weeks, the justice ministry said. Media reports said the passengers had been informed of the rules before they boarded their flights Justin McCurry, in Tokyo, and Nemo Kim, in Seoul, report that the rule, which came into force on Wednesday, requires all overseas arrivals \u2013 including South Koreans \u2013 to quarantine at home or at government-designated facilities for 14 days. YouTube is profiting from videos promoting unproven coronavirus treatments, a report has found, as the company struggles to crack down on misinformation. The Google-owned tech company is running advertisements with videos pushing herbs, meditative music, and potentially unsafe over-the-counter supplements as cures for Covid-19, according to a report published on Friday by the Tech Transparency Project, a not-for-profit watchdog organisation. The report found at least seven videos hawking such dubious treatments with advertisements from sponsors including Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign, Facebook, Liberty Mutual Insurance, the streaming startup Quibi, and Masterclass.com. In Spain, 932 people have died in the past 24 hours, a slight drop from the 950 deaths recorded one day earlier and marking the first drop in the daily death toll this week. Spain has seen 10,935 deaths from the virus, the health ministry said on Friday, accounting for about 20% of the global death toll. On Friday, authorities in Madrid said they were working to convert a second ice rink in the region into a makeshift morgue for coronavirus victims, after carrying out a similar transformation on another ice rink last month. The number of confirmed cases in the country has grown to 117,710, surpassing the number of known cases in Italy but still behind the more than 245,000 confirmed cases in the US. Amid the bleak news was a glimmer of hope: this week has seen a drop in the rate of new infections across Spain, suggesting the outbreak is slowing. The number of hospitalisations grew by around 10% this week, compared to around 30% in weeks earlier, health officials said Friday. \u201cThere\u2019s a light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d the country\u2019s health minister, Salvador Illa, told parliament on Thursday. \u201cWe are in a phase of stabilisation and, with caution and prudence, I would say that we\u2019re seeing a slow down.\u201d At one of Madrid\u2019s hardest-hit hospitals, one doctor said there were now eight empty beds in his critical care unit, one of several such units in the hospital, and that his unit had not seen any new patients in 48 hours. Spain has documented more than 30,500 recoveries from Covid-19, second only to the more than 76,000 reported recovered in China. Those who left the hospital this week included 101-year-old Encarna Buis\u00e1n, who was wheeled out of the hospital to the raucous applause of healthcare workers. \u201cI want this to give hope for everyone,\u201d said Mari Carmen, one of her daughters. \u201cMom entered when she was 100 and turned 101 in the hospital, she made it out.\u201d Some 70 tonnes of protective gear arrived in Spain this week to help the country\u2019s beleaguered healthcare workers. At least 9,400 have tested positive for Covid-19 after a shortage of supplies left them re-using masks and crafting protective gowns out of garbage bags to fight the epidemic. A video purporting to show thousands of Russian troops taking part in rehearsals for the country\u2019s Victory Day parade has raised questions about the Kremlin\u2019s efforts to fight the spread of coronavirus in the armed forces. The video, which was posted to a military affairs group in the social network Vkontakte, shows thousands of soldiers lined up apparently at the Alabino training grounds outside of Moscow. It was posted anonymously and its author has not yet been verified. In the video, an unidentified man behind the camera says: \u201cHow many people are there, 15,000? Fuck, and they\u2019ve said no more than 50 are supposed to gather in one place. Not one fucking mask.\u201d Russia has not yet cancelled its plans to hold Victory Day celebrations on 9 May, the country\u2019s most important state holiday. The Russian defence ministry said last month it planned to hold rehearsals at parade grounds outside of Moscow that copy the dimensions of Red Square. Other videos have appeared that confirm that some rehearsals are taking place for the country\u2019s Victory Day parade. The military news agency Zvezda has posted videos of T-34 tanks, the model used in the second world war, practising manoeuvres at the parade grounds in Alabino. Tens of thousands of extra police and gendarmes are being posted across France to ensure people respect the lockdown and to stop the traditional \u201cGrand Depart\u201d for the Easter holidays on Friday. Patrols will set up checkpoints on all major roads and motorways out of towns and cities with orders to turn back those attempting to break the rules. Officials in areas popular with holidaymakers and where there is a high proportion of second homes have also been ordered to carry out checks to ensure there is no sudden influx of visitors. \u201cThe virus is not on holiday,\u201d the French prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, said in a televised address on Thursday evening. Philippe was echoing the interior minister, Christophe Castaner, who only hours earlier had warned: \u201cAbsolutely do not go on holiday during the lockdown period \u2026 people must remain confined. Any abuse will be punished.\u201d Laurent Nunez, the French transport minister, echoed the stern instructions on Friday morning saying an extra 60,000 police and gendarmes will be carrying out checks in addition to the 100,000 normally on duty. \u201cYou cannot leave your home to go to a resort or a second home. There will be no leaving for holiday \u2026 there will be checks across the country,\u201d Nunez told RTL radio. Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel, has returned to her office after ending her self-quarantine today. She had been isolating after being informed that a doctor who administered a vaccine to her has tested positive. Britain\u2019s health secretary, Matt Hancock, said this morning that the prime minister, Boris Johnson, who has \u201cbeen working throughout\u201d after he tested positive for the virus, is a \u201cbit under the weather\u201d but is also \u201cup and about and on the Zoom conference calls a huge amount, and on the phone\u201d. Hungary\u2019s prime minister, who has been given new powers to effectively rule by decree, has been hitting out again at a favourite target, the philanthropist George Soros. In another big test for the European Union, Politico\u2019s Lili Bayer tweets that Viktor Orb\u00e1n has suggested that criticism of new laws have come from a \u201cnetwork\u201d led by the Hungarian-born billionaire. Soros, who has also long been a target of what some regard as blatant antisemitic vilification by Orb\u00e1n\u2019s party, has donated $1.1m to help Budapest prepare for the coronavirus pandemic. On Monday, Hungary\u2019s parliament passed a new set of coronavirus measures that includes jail terms for spreading misinformation and gives no clear time limit to a state of emergency that allows Orb\u00e1n to rule by decree. Parliament voted by 137 to 53 on Monday afternoon to pass the measures, with the two-thirds majority enjoyed by Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party enough to push them through in spite of opposition from other parties, which had demanded a time limit or sunset clause on the legislation. The bill introduces jail terms of up to five years for intentionally spreading misinformation that hinders the government response to the pandemic, leading to fears that it could be used to censor or self-censor criticism of ministers. A $100m aid plan to help Afghanistan\u2019s fight against coronavirus has been approved by the World Bank as 34 new Coronavirus cases were confirmed in the country in the last 24 hours. The figure pushes the total number of confirmed infections to 273 although testing remains low in Afghanistan and experts fear that the full extent of the spread is not known. There has also been a sixth confirmed death. Fifteen of the new infections have been recorded in the western province of Herat, raising the total number of infections in Afghanistan\u2019s worst affected area to 199. The World Bank said in a statement: \u201cTo slow and limit the spread of Covid-19 through enhanced detection, surveillance, and laboratory systems, as well as strengthen essential healthcare delivery and intensive care.\u201d The work of doctors, nurses and other staff treating patients with Covid-19 in Barcelona has been documented by a team of journalists from the Associated Press, who accessed a makeshift Intensive Care Unit there. In an extraordinary dispatch, they report: The tension is palpable. There is no non-essential talking. An orchestra of medical monitors marks the tempo with an endless series of soft, distinct beeps. Never have so many people been inside the library of the Germans Trias i Pujol hospital in north-eastern Spain. But the healthcare workers in improvised protective gear aren\u2019t consulting medical books. Instead, they\u2019re treating patients in critical condition suffering from pneumonia caused by the coronavirus. From the outside, this makeshift intensive-care unit in Badalona, near Barcelona, looks nothing like a library. The bookshelves have been removed to make room for up to 20 hospital beds, breathing machines and an array of medical equipment after the longstanding ICU and other areas of the hospital flooded with Covid-19 patients. With the scarcity of full-body protective suits across Spain, doctors and nurses are employing what they can find, reusing masks, layering oversized surgical gowns with plastic aprons and running through an infinite number of latex gloves. Like scuba divers, they apply a small dose of detergent to their goggles just before stepping into the sweltering, virus-laden room in the hopes of mitigating the inevitable fogging of their eye protection caused by their own breathing. Challenges in keeping people apart have been underscored by data released by Google for 131 countries showing whether the number of visits to shops, parks and workplaces dropped in March, when many states issued stay-at-home orders to rein in the spread of coronavirus. While visits to supermarkets and grocery stores surged in Singapore, the UK and elsewhere before travel restrictions were imposed, visits to retail and recreational places fell 26% in Japan, where authorities have been relatively relaxed in urging social distancing measures but where calls have been growing daily for a state of emergency. Visits to workplace dropped just 9%. Google\u2019s analysis of location data from billions of users\u2019 phones is the largest public dataset available to help health authorities assess if people are abiding with shelter-in-place and similar orders issued across the world. Its reports show charts that compare traffic from 16 February to 29 March at underground, train and bus stations, grocery stores and other broad categories of places with a five-week period earlier this year. In Italy, one of the countries hardest hit by the virus, visits to retail and recreation locations, including restaurants and movie theaters, plunged 94% while visits to workplaces slid 63%. Reflecting the severity of the crisis there, grocery and pharmacy visits in Italy dropped 85% and park visits were down by 90%. In the US, California, which was the first in the with a statewide lockdown, cut visits to retail and recreation locations by half. By contrast, Arkansas, one of the few states without a sweeping lockdown, has seen such visits fall 29%, the lowest for a US state. Interactive maps charting the spread of the virus, and where it has been most deadly, have been launched by the Guardian. While the disease is hitting Italy and Spain with particular cruelty, the trajectory in many countries is the same; the UK and US are a couple of weeks behind Italy in the progress of the pandemic. Unable to access state benefits, food and even running water as Zimbabwe shuts up shop, people in the capital, Harare ,and elsewhere fear the worst. While affluent Zimbabweans stocked their pantries with food last weekend in preparation for the lockdown, which began on Monday, poor people were unable to do so, Nyasha Chingono reports in this piece for Guardian development. She spoke to Nelson Mahunde, a 70-year old who had no idea Zimbabwe has been plunged into a 21-day national lockdown to curb the spread of Covid 19. \u201cNo one in my village told me that the banks would be closed today. I don\u2019t even know what to do. My family depends on that money for survival. If it is true that no one will be moving for 21 days, then my family will starve,\u201d he said. Norway\u2019s rate of unemployment rose sixfold in March to 14.7%, the Labour and Welfare Agency (NAV) has said, the highest level on record as the economy ground to a halt amid efforts to curb the coronavirus pandemic. As many as 10.7% were fully unemployed, while the remaining 3% were registered as partially unemployed, Reuters reported. The Norwegian government three weeks ago announced emergency shutdowns of many public and private institutions, including schools and kindergartens, sending the economy into a tailspin and triggering hundreds of thousands of layoffs. Singapore\u2019s prime minster is doing a live briefing (watch here) on Facebook about new measures, which will involve the closure of most of the state\u2019s workplaces, except for essential services and key economic sectors. Lee Hsien Loong has said, as part of tighter measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus , that people should avoid socialising with others beyond their own households and go out only to do essential things, such as buy food at markets. The government will be distributing face masks to households in the coming weeks, he added. Two months ago Ireland\u2019s economy was humming: stellar growth, fiscal surplus, near full employment. What a difference a pandemic makes. The central bank on Friday warned that this year the economy will shrink by 8%, perhaps 15%, if lockdown continues beyond June. Instead of a \u20ac2.2bn surplus the government faces a \u20ac19.6bn deficit. And unemployment has just exploded to an all-time high of 513,350, more than a fifth of the labour force, with worse to come. \u201cThe starting point for the recovery will depend on the depth and duration of the downturn, which is, as yet, unknown,\u201d said Mark Cassidy, the bank\u2019s director of economics and statistics. Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach, said Irish people had suffered enough after the 2008 crash and that the government would strive to cushion the aftershocks. \u201cThe objective, if I have anything to do with it, will be to avoid another era of austerity,\u201d he said. Talks were under way among European Union member states over whether or not to extend border closures beyond Easter in order to tackle the coronavirus crisis, according to the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. \u201cWe are in consultation with member states on how to proceed beyond Easter,\u201d she told Europe 1 radio. Von Der Leyen also reiterated that the next EU budget should take the form of a new \u201cMarshall Plan\u201d to drive Europe\u2019s recovery from the coronavirus outbreak, and that she felt Europe would emerge from the coronavirus crisis in a stronger state. Eurozone states that need aid from the bloc\u2019s bailout fund to tackle the coronavirus should get it quickly and not be first subjected to visits from officials proposing policies like during the euro zone crisis, Germany\u2019s finance minister said last night. Olaf Scholz told the broadcaster ARD that he was convinced the European Stability Mechanism - a bailout fund with \u20ac400bn ($433.88bn) in firepower - had instruments suitable for use during the coronavirus outbreak, which has hit eurozone countries like Italy and Spain hard. The comments by Von der Leyen and Scholz come amid rising tensions - EU flags have been burned in Italy where polls show an uptick in unhappiness with the union - and proposals by France for a coronavirus \u2018rescue fund\u2019 for states. Iraq has banned the Reuters news agency from operating in Iraq for three months for reporting that the number of coronavirus cases in the country is much higher than acknowledged by officials. The agency reported that the actual number of those suffering from the virus could be thousands higher than the official tally of 772 and that the scale of the outbreak has been downplayed to avoid public panic. The report adds impetus to concerns reported in the Guardian this week that state figures of suspected Covid 19 patients in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon may be substantially lower than real numbers. Hezbollah has said it is opening treatment centres in southern Lebanon that supplement the state\u2019s health system. However, there are fears that a parallel state structure could obscure real numbers of those infected with the virus. All three countries have links to Iran, the centre of a pandemic in the region that has taken root among religious pilgrims and merchants who had travelled back to Baghdad, Beirut and Damascus, many since returning to communities outside the capitals. This piece of Chinese technology - tweeted here by China social trend watcher Manya Koetse - looks interesting. Police in Israel have surrounded the city of Bnei Brak with barricades and begun evacuating around 4,500 elderly people after the densely-populated area saw an explosion of Covid-19 cases. Predominately populated with ultra-Orthodox Jewish people, Bnei Brak is near the commercial capital of Tel Aviv but is poor and congested. Some ultra-orthodox rabbis \u2013 long distrustful of the Israeli state\u2019s authority over their way of life \u2013 had also initially rejected stringent coronavirus measures, playing down the risk and refusing to close synagogues and packed religious seminaries. Medical experts estimate up to 38% of Bnei Brak\u2019s roughly 200,000 inhabitants could be infected, significantly higher the national average. Israel\u2019s cabinet declared the city a \u201crestricted zone\u201d on Thursday night, with measures imposed early on Friday. Around 1,000 police officers had been dispatched. Residents will not be allowed to leave the city except under special circumstances. Police in Pakistan will today enforce a strict lockdown to prevent people from going to mosques to offer Friday prayers and fuel a rise in coronavirus infection, officials have said, after failing to prevent large congregations last week. Health experts have warned of an epidemic in South Asia, home to a fifth of the world\u2019s population, that could easily overwhelm its weak public health systems. But authorities in Pakistan and Bangladesh, another Muslim majority nation, and even India have struggled to persuade conservative religious groups to maintain social distancing in order to curb the spread of the virus. The government in Pakistan\u2019s southern province of Sindh, home to the country\u2019s largest city, Karachi, will enforce a \u201ccurfew-like\u201d lockdown for three hours beginning 12 noon Friday to deter people from coming out of their homes for prayers, Reuters reported. Concern is growing that a woefully inadequate health system will leave Malawi unable to cope when Covid-19 arrives. In Malawi only 20 people a day can be tested for the virus, and there are just 25 intensive care unit beds and seven ventilators in the country of more than 18 million people, John Vidal reports in this piece for the Guardian. Since February, however, the government has been racing to curb Covid\u2019s arrival. It has wheeled out a \u00a324m preparedness plan, suspended international flights, banned weddings and gatherings of more than 100 people, closed schools and universities, and is making anyone arriving from Europe, China, or the US self-isolate. According to the ministry of health, 4,603 people who have entered the country in the past few weeks are \u201cunder surveillance\u201d. Britain\u2019s \u2018peak\u2019 for coronavirus infections will be slightly sooner than previously thought and will be in the next few weeks, the UK\u2019s health minster has said, but it is very very sensitive to how many people continue to follow the social distancing guidelines. Hancock went on to say he was open to people and companies contacting him with ideas for how to resolve the problems and questions which his department was attempting to solve. \u201cI saw what happened with the ventilators when we got non ventilator companies in to build companies side by side with the smaller but expert ventilation companies,\u201d he added. The UK still does not currently have a reliable home test at the moment to carry out home blood tests that would enable people to know if they have had coronavirus, Britain\u2019s health secretary has said. Matt Hancock has been pressed in morning interviews on how many of the new UK target of 100,000 tests a day \u2013 up from much lower figures \u2013 would be composed of the blood, or antibody test. Hundreds of formulas and details for proposed ways of doing the antibody tests had been sent in to the government by experts but a good enough one has not been found. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme: \u201cWe haven\u2019t yet found one that works to be good enough to use. I get pressure on this. I get people saying \u2018oh come on it may not be perfectly accurate but can\u2019t we just use it.\u2019 The test problems is that with a test that is not of high quality you end up giving false assurance.\u201d People could go into harm\u2019s way when they may have immunity to the virus in those circumstances, he added. In another interview, Hancock described having coronavirus as a \u201cpretty unpleasant experience\u201d and said he had lost half a stone during the illness and said it was \u201clike having glass in my throat\u201d. He said: \u201cFor me it was short-lived and I was able to come back to work yesterday and I\u2019m in full health. But it is worrying. I\u2019ve lost half a stone, it\u2019s quite a serious impact directly. But thankfully for me I could get through it.\u201d China\u2019s foreign ministry is advising foreign diplomats to stop coming to Beijing, after the country temporarily banned most foreigners from entering to prevent a resurgence of a coronavirus epidemic, a spokeswoman said on Friday. Foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters during a daily briefing that the ministry was aware of confirmed coronavirus cases among foreign diplomats in China. The Hong Kong government has accused a media organisation of \u201cbreaching the One-China principle\u201d after a reporter asked a senior World Health Organization (WHO) adviser a question about Taiwan during an interview. RTHK\u2019s Yvonne Tong asked WHO adviser Bruce Aylward whether the organisation would reconsider Taiwan\u2019s membership, long objected to by Beijing. Aylward appeared not to hear Tong, and then either hung up on her or was disconnected. On Thursday, Hong Kong\u2019s secretary for commerce and economic development, Edward Yau, accused RTHK of breaching its charter obligations, which include \u201cpromoting understanding of the concept of \u2018one country, two systems\u2019.\u201d The British supermarket group Sainsbury\u2019s has said it would start to remove the customer purchasing limits it imposed as a response to increased demand during the coronavirus emergency. \u201cAs stock continues to build, we have been reviewing whether we still need to limit the number of items people buy. I am pleased to tell you that we will start to remove limits from Sunday,\u201d Chief Executive Mike Coupe said in a letter to customers. Limits will remain in place on the most popular items which include UHT milk, pasta and tinned tomatoes, he said. Here\u2019s a link on the company\u2019s website. British parliamentarians have called for strict curbs on gambling during the Covid-19 lockdown, including a moratorium on advertising, calling the betting industry\u2019s own proposals \u201cvery weak\u201d. An industry body, the Betting &amp; Gaming Council (BGC) issued a 10-point pledge last week, promising extra steps to ensure firms do not exploit vulnerable people and addicts who may be at increased risk due to the inertia inherent in staying at home for long periods. But in a letter to the government \u2013 and the BGC \u2013 22 MPs, two lords and one of the UK\u2019s foremost gambling addiction experts said the measures put forward by the trade body were either weak, vague or already formed part of requirements of their licence to operate. In the UK, the government is to follow through today on its attempt to regain the initiative around plans for mass testing after announcing last night it is to move from 10,000 tests a day to a new target of 100,000 a day by the end of the month. It comes as the new Nightingale hospital opens in London at the ExCeL conference centre. Other field hospitals in England have been announced in Bristol and Harrogate while there are temporary hospitals for Birmingham and Manchester. Similar initiatives are being rolled out in Glasgow and Cardiff. Heathrow airport has also announced it is to operate with just one runway from next Monday. While there are significantly fewer flights, it said it needed to remain open for vital foot and medical supplies. The airport has two runways and will alternate which one they keep open on a weekly basis, a spokesman said. In 2018, Heathrow served 80.1 million passengers, This is Ben Quinn in London picking up the blog now. Here\u2019s a summary of the main events so far today. There are more than 1,002,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus worldwide and more than 51,400 deaths. In the UK, there are more than 34,000 cases after a sharp rise in the number of confirmed cases on Thursday, and more than 2,900 deaths. A temporary hospital, built in nine days, will open in London on Friday. The US, which has the largest number of cases of any country, has more than 236,000 confirmed cases and more than 5,600 deaths. President Trump tested negative to the virus on Thursday, and 6.7 million Americans joined unemployment queues over the past week. In the US, the Zaandam cruise liner, on which four people have died, has docked in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, after previously being denied entry. Dozens of other passengers are sick with flu-like symptoms on the vessel. It\u2019s sister ship, the Rotterdam, also docked in Florida. Residents of Wuhan were warned to stay indoors and strengthen protection measures, a few days before travel restrictions on the city at the centre of the pandemic are scheduled to be lifted. China will hold a national day of mourning on Saturday for \u201cmartyrs\u201d who died in the fight against the epidemic, the official Xinhua news agency says. China recorded 31 new cases on Friday, 29 of which were imported. New Zealand\u2019s health minister has apologised to the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, after he was photographed mountain-biking, apparently flouting the government\u2019s own advice to exercise safely and locally during a countrywide lockdown. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Dr Brendan Murphy, has said worldwide cases of Covid-19 could be \u201cfive to 10 times\u201d higher than the one million known currently. Murphy says the only numbers he has total faith in are the Australian numbers, because \u201cwe have the highest testing rate in the world\u201d (Trump has also claimed this mantle). A row has erupted in the US over the sacking of the commander of the US Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier, which is docked in Guam. Capt Brett Crozier had written a scathing letter asking for stronger measures to control a coronavirus outbreak onboard his warship, which was subsequently leaked to the media. Hong Kong\u2019s airline, Cathay Pacific, carried just 582 passengers one day this week, with a load factor of 18.3%, Reuters reports, quoting an internal memo. Its CEO and chairman have agreed to take a 30% base salary cut until December. Also in Hong Kong, pubs and bars were ordered to close for two weeks from 6pm on Friday as the financial hub steps up social distancing restrictions and joins cities around the world in the battle to halt the spread of coronavirus. Governments in the Middle East need to act fast to limit the spread of the coronavirus after the number of cases rose to nearly 60,000, almost double their level a week earlier, the World Health Organization said on Thursday. Here\u2019s a look at some of today\u2019s front pages in the UK. Prince Charles will open the new NHS Nightingale hospital at the ExCeL conference centre in London Docklands on Friday, which will eventually be capable of providing support for up to 4,000 coronavirus patients if required. Charles, recently recovered from a mild case of Covid-19, will conduct the ceremony via videolink from his Scottish residence at Birkhall, where he self-isolated for seven days last week. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, also recently out of self-isolation following a positive test for coronavirus, and Prof Charles Knight, chief executive of NHS Nightingale, will join a small group representing medical staff, the Ministry of Defence, contractors and volunteers at the new hospital. It comes as the NHS announced two further NHS Nightingale hospitals will be built in Bristol and Harrogate to provide hundreds of extra beds if local services need them during the peak of coronavirus, in addition to the one at the ExCeL. The NHS England chief executive, Sir Simon Stevens, will confirm on Friday that the extra sites in south-west England and Yorkshire \u2013 which will have up to 1,500 beds if needed \u2013 have joined Manchester and Birmingham as the latest locations for major new facilities outside of London. Each of the five Nightingale hospitals will serve the wider regions in which they are located. The new hospital in east London is the first to open and will initially provide up to 500 beds equipped with ventilators and oxygen. The capacity will then increase, potentially up to several thousands beds should it be required. Constructed within nine days, the conversion of the ExCeL conference centre into a field hospital has been cited as perhaps the most ambitious medical project Britain has seen since the end of the second world war, and will dwarf all other hospitals in the UK. Planning has involved soldiers with experience from Afghanistan and the west African Ebola crisis working in support of health service staff. Up to 200 soldiers a day have been working alongside NHS staff and civilian contractors. Charles is expected to pay tribute to those who have worked tirelessly to create the new medical facility, and to the people across the UK who are delivering frontline care to those affected by the coronavirus crisis. Natalie Grey, head of nursing at NHS Nightingale, will unveil a plaque on behalf of Charles marking the occasion. Stevens said: \u201cIt\u2019s nothing short of extraordinary that this new hospital in London has been established from scratch in less than a fortnight \u2026 Now we are gearing up to repeat that feat at another four sites across the country to add to the surge capacity in current NHS hospitals. \u201cWe\u2019re giving the go ahead to these additional sites, hoping they may not be needed but preparing in case they are. But that will partly depend on continuing public support for measures to reduce growth in the infection rate by staying at home to save lives.\u201d The new hospital in Manchester will be built at the city\u2019s Manchester Central complex while the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham will take care of patients as needed in the West Midlands, the region second hardest hit by the virus. Each of these new services will initially have up to 500 beds, potentially offering as many as 3,000 more between them if cases escalate. Sir Elton John, Sir Paul McCartney and David Beckham were among the stars paying tribute to NHS staff risking their lives fighting the coronavirus pandemic, PA reports. In a video shared online by NHS England, stars from film, TV, music and sport held up a placard bearing the slogans OurNHSPeople and ThankYouNHS. Sir Elton, Sir Paul and Beckham were joined by A-listers including Sir Mick Jagger, Kate Winslet, Daniel Craig, Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Dame Kristin Scott Thomas. Kylie Minogue, Naomi Harris, Eddie Redmayne Dame Jessica Ennis-Hill and Sir Mo Farah also featured. The video was shared hours before the nation saluted key workers for a second successive Thursday. Up and down the country grateful Britons stood on their doorsteps and hung out of windows to clap, cheer and bang pots and pans to show their appreciation for key workers. I mentioned earlier that the Asian Development Bank had said Vietnam\u2019s GDP growth will slow to 4.98% this year, versus 7.02% last year. I now have a fuller copy of the report, which says regional economic growth in developing Asia will decline sharply in 2020. It forecasts regional growth of 2.2% in 2020, down from the 5.5% the ADB had forecast in September. But the ADB says growth is expected to rebound to 6.2% in 2021, assuming that the outbreak ends and activity normalises. \u201cThe evolution of the global pandemic\u2014and thus the outlook for the global and regional economy\u2014is highly uncertain. Growth could turn out lower, and the recovery slower, than we are currently forecasting. For this reason, strong and coordinated efforts are needed to contain the COVID-19 pandemic and minimise its economic impact, especially on the most vulnerable,\u201d said ADB Chief Economist Yasuyuki Sawada. The ADB estimates the pandemic will: reduce China\u2019s growth to 2.3% this year, before rebounding to 7.3% in 2021. It estimates growth in India will slow to 4.0% in fiscal year 2020 before strengthening to 6.2% in 2021. Economic activity in the Pacific subregion is expected to contract by 0.3% in 2020 before recovering to 2.7% in 2021. New Zealand\u2019s health minister has apologised to Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern after he was photographed mountain biking, apparently flouting the government\u2019s own advice to exercise safely and locally during a country-wide lockdown. David Clark told Ardern on Thursday night that he had driven to a park 2km from his Dunedin home. You can read our full story below. Here\u2019s our latest global wrap on the coronavirus pandemic, toplining with the citizens of Wuhan being told to stay inside and be vigilant as the date for their travel restrictions being lifted approaches (8 April). As I mentioned earlier, tomorrow will be a national day of mourning in China. Get the full story below: In Hungary journalists say a new law supposedly aimed at fighting the coronavirus will make objective reporting of the pandemic harder and leave them open to facing court cases or even jail time for their reporting. The measures, in place since Monday, have been roundly criticised for the sweeping powers they hand to the nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, to rule by decree. Another part of the bill provides penalties of up to five years in prison for those spreading misinformation during the pandemic. Journalists in the country say the new law is already being used to deny them access to information, and on occasion to threaten them. You can read the Guardian\u2019s full story below: Farmers across Europe bank on improvised armies of pickers to save harvest, as coronavirus lockdowns have stopped migrant workers from arriving to carry out the work. Fruit and vegetable crops in Spain, Italy, France, Germany, the UK and other countries risk rotting in the fields \u2013 putrefying testaments to the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cIt won\u2019t be pretty,\u201d said Eamonn Kehoe, a soft fruit specialist with Ireland\u2019s agri-food agency, Teagasc. \u201cIf they don\u2019t have the staff it won\u2019t be picked. It\u2019s a nightmare, a perfect storm.\u201d He was referring to Ireland\u2019s growers, but farmers and agriculture officials across Europe have equally grim warnings about abandoned fields and lost crops unless they can conjure improvised armies of pickers. Spain, which is the EU\u2019s biggest exporter of fruit and vegetables, is already feeling the impact. \u201cWe\u2019re very limited at the moment when it comes to having enough hands to pick and harvest,\u201d said Pedro Barato, the president of Spain\u2019s largest farming association, Asaja. You can read the full story below: Australia\u2019s Chief Medical Officer Dr Brendan Murphy has said worldwide cases of Covid-19 could be \u201cfive to 10 times\u201d higher than the one million known currently. Murphy says the only numbers he has total faith in are the Australian numbers, because \u201cwe have the highest testing rate in the world\u201d (Trump has also claimed this mantle). I think China is in a really difficult position. They did clamp down incredibly hard and they stopped transmission. But their population is not immune. They still have a lot of people in their population and they are, obviously, trying very hard to prevent second waves. I think they have been pretty transparent but as I said, I\u2019m only confident about our numbers. I\u2019m certainly not confident even the numbers out of the US are much higher than being reported because nobody else in the world has been doing testing like we have. Nobody else in the world got on to all those original cases out of Wuhan in January and contained them. That\u2019s why we are now dealing with what we know rather than a huge community transmission that happened all through February in countries like Italy and the US. We\u2019re on top of our cases. But we still have a long way to go. At the same press conference, Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, said modelling done for the government shows that \u201cat the current rate\u201d Australia is \u201ctracking well\u201d. At the current rate if we keep doing what we\u2019re doing and keep doing the work to upgrade ICU capacity and secure the extra ventilators then right now that trajectory is promising, it\u2019s encouraging, but there are no guarantees. This virus writes its own rules. You can follow all of the developments in Australia\u2019 on Guardian Australia\u2019s live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. The Asian Development Bank says that Vietnam\u2019s GDP growth will slow to 4.98% this year, versus 7.02% last year. Still with business and share markets have had a sticky day after hopes of a Saudi-Russia deal on oil production faded. Donald Trump talked up the hope of a deal that would reverse a decision last month by the two countries to boost production, which shocked investors and saw prices plunge to $20 a barrel. But that looks less certain now and the price of Brent crude slipped more than 1% in the Asia trading session. Shares also struggled and Wall Street was set to open down on Friday. All the main indices in Asia Pacific, from Sydney to Seoul, are in the red. Some more details from my colleague Helen Davidson about the capacity cuts at Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong-based airline that has been devastated by the city protests and now the virus. Augustus Tang, the chief executive, says the airline\u2019s passenger fleet \u201chas been virtually grounded as the remaining demand has disappeared\u201d, according to a memo seen by Reuters. \u201cWe carried 582 customers on one day this week, with a load factor of just 18.3%,\u201d he said, adding that a usual day would see 100,000 passengers. Cathay\u2019s passenger capacity will now be further reduced from the previously announced \u201cskeleton schedule\u201d to two weekly flights to four long-haul destinations- London Heathrow, Los Angeles, Vancouver, and Sydney. Tang said they hoped to maintain three weekly flights on regional services to Tokyo, Taipei, New Delhi, Bangkok, Jakarta, Manila, Ho Chi Minh City and Singapore, as well as three weekly flights to Beijing, Shanghai and Kuala Lumpur. He will take a 30% cut to his base salary from April to December, as will Chairman Patrick Healy, with executive directors taking a 25% cut, the memo said. This week the Australian Broadcasting Corporation\u2019s 7.30 Report TV programme asked viewers if any of their children had messages to send to their grandparents, who they couldn\u2019t see at the moment because of the home isolation requirements. The result was terrific. China has released its latest daily figures. They include 31 new cases, 29 of which were imported. A row has erupted in the US over the sacking of the commander of the US Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier, which is docked in Guam. Captain Brett Crozier had written a scathing letter asking for stronger measures to control a coronavirus outbreak onboard his warship, which was subsequently leaked to the media. Acting US Navy Secretary Thomas Modly said the commander exercised poor judgment. Modly said the letter was sent through the chain of command but Crozier did not safeguard it from being released outside the chain. \u201cHe sent it out pretty broadly and in sending it out pretty broadly, he did not take care to ensure that it couldn\u2019t be leaked and that\u2019s part of his responsibility,\u201d Modly said. \u201cIt raised alarm bells unnecessarily,\u201d he added. Over 100 personnel on the Theodore Roosevelt have tested positive for the coronavirus so far. In the four-page letter, Crozier, who took command in November, described a bleak situation aboard the nuclear-powered carrier as more sailors tested positive for the highly contagious respiratory virus. He called for \u201cdecisive action\u201d: removing over 4,000 sailors from the ship and isolating them. He said that unless the Navy acted immediately, it would be failing to properly safeguard \u201cour most trusted asset - our sailors.\u201d The ship has since docked at US naval base in Guam. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said the Trump administration\u2019s decision to remove the commander showed \u201cpoor judgement\u201d. Fujifilm Holdings Corp says it has developed a new test for the coronavirus that reduces the results time to about two hours. The test was developed by subsidiary Fujifilm Wako Pure Chemical Corp and will be released on 15 April, Reuters reports. The SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR Detection kit will be able to deliver results for the virus that causes Covid-19 faster than existing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, which presently take four to six hours, the company said. Jazz guitarist John Bucky Pizzarelli who was inducted to the New Jersey Hall of Fame, has died at the age of 94. The virtuoso who had played for presidents at the White House during his long and esteemed career died on Wednesday at his home in New Jersey. His family told the New York Times they believe the cause of death was the coronavirus. And the Bergen Record reports that Pizzarelli tested positive for the virus on Sunday. Associated Press says: Pizzarelli was born in Paterson, New Jersey, and had a career that spanned eight decades. He showed off his musical chops for former presidents like Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton and played alongside musical icons like Frank Sinatra. Jazz guitar wouldn\u2019t be what it is today without Bucky Pizzarelli, said jazz guitarist Frank Vignola. He and Freddie Green were responsible for a style of rhythm guitar playing that has lasted until 2020. Pizzarelli died with his wife, Ruth, his son Martin, and his caregiver at his side. China will hold a national mourning on Saturday for \u201cmartyrs\u201d who died in the fight against the epidemic, the official Xinhua news agency says. Three minutes of silence will be observed at 10am on 4 April across the country \u201cwhile air raid sirens and horns of automobiles, trains and ships will wail in grief,\u201d Xinhua said. China has reported a total of 81,589 confirmed cases, which exclude asymptomatic patients, and 3,318 deaths from the outbreak. Just while I\u2019m on the airline industry, Hong Kong\u2019s carrier Cathay Pacific carried just 582 passengers one day this week, with a load factor of 18.3%, Reuters reports, quoting an internal memo. It\u2019s CEO and chairman have agreed to take a 30% base salary cut until December. We have written quite a lot about the dire state of the airline industry, but here\u2019s a little more woe to add to it ... International seat capacity has dropped by almost 80% from a year ago and half the world\u2019s airplanes are in storage, new data shows, suggesting the aviation industry may take years to recover from the coronavirus pandemic. Carriers including United Airlines Holdings Inc and Air New Zealand have warned they are likely to emerge from the crisis smaller, and there are fears others may not survive. \u201cIt is likely that when we get across to the other side of the pandemic, things won\u2019t return to the vibrant market conditions we had at the start of the year,\u201d said Olivier Ponti, vice president at data firm ForwardKeys. \u201cIt\u2019s also possible that a number of airlines will have gone bust and uneconomic discounts will be necessary to attract demand back,\u201d he said in a statement. There seems to be some movement on whether or not Americans should wear face masks routinely, outside of the house. Speaking at a White House briefing, Dr Deborah Birx, a member of President Trump\u2019s coronavirus task force, said the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would issue guidelines in the coming days on the use of face coverings. Birx however cautioned that Americans, who have been admonished to stay at home except for essential outings, should not develop a \u201cfalse sense of security\u201d that they are fully protected from the respiratory illness by wearing a mask. New York City\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio, urged residents to wear face coverings, citing studies showing that the virus can be transmitted by infected people who are showing no symptoms. \u201cWhat that means is when you put on that face covering you\u2019re protecting everyone else,\u201d de Blasio said. The Democratic mayor suggested New Yorkers use scarves or other home-made masks because medical-grade protective gear was in short supply. The WHO has said only people who are sick or treating or assisting people who are sick should wear masks. The Guardian asked four experts for their advice on face masks. In case you missed this, the Guardian\u2019s Yang Tian has written about her anticipation of receiving a care package from her father in Beijing: \u201cDad has always sent care packages from China. Now it\u2019s face masks instead of snacks.\u201d Hong Kong has ordered pubs and bars to close for two weeks from 6 pm on Friday as the financial hub steps up social distancing restrictions and joins cities around the world in the battle to halt the spread of coronavirus. Reuters reports that anyone who violates the new law faces six months in jail and a fine of HK$50,000 ($6,450). The extraordinary move comes a week after the government stopped all tourist arrivals and transit passengers at its airport and said it was considering suspending the sale of alcohol in some venues. \u201cAny premises (commonly known as bar or pub) that is exclusively or mainly used for the sale or supply of intoxicating liquors ... must be closed,\u201d the government said in a statement late on Thursday. It added that 62 confirmed coronavirus cases in the city had been linked to bars, leading to 14 further infections, including a 40-day-old baby. Hong Kong has 802 cases of coronavirus and four deaths from the disease. Alcohol will still be available in supermarkets and convenience stores. Here are some of the images from Fort Lauderdale, where the Zaandam cruise liner has finally docked. It\u2019s a salient reminder of the human cost of this tragedy. The Zaandam cruise line, on which four people have died, has docked in Fort Lauderdale, after previously being denied entry. Dozens of other passengers are sick with flu-like symptoms on the vessels. Earlier this week the ship offloaded its healthy passengers onto its sister-ship, the Rotterdam, which has now also been given permission to dock in Florida\u2019s Port Everglades. The Zaandam cruise liner last entered port in Valpara\u00edso, Chile, more than two weeks ago and has been stranded at sea with a Covid-19 outbreak onboard worsening after several Latin American countries refused to let it dock. The agreement to let both ships dock in Florida comes after opposition from the state governor Ron DeSantis and several Broward county commissioners who feared that they could not cope with an influx of sick passengers. You can read our full story here Residents of the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus began, have been told to strengthen self-protection measures and avoid going out unless it is necessary. The City\u2019s Communist party chief, Wang Zhonglin, was quoted as saying in a statement published by the Wuhan city government that the risk of a rebound in the city\u2019s coronavirus epidemic remained high due to both internal and external risks and that it must continue to maintain prevention and control measures. Britain will build a further two temporary hospitals to treat coronavirus patients, the National Health Service said as its first field hospital prepares to open in London on Friday. The NHS said it would build a 1,000-patient facility at a university in Bristol, south-west England, and a 500-bed facility at a conference centre in Harrogate in the north of the country. That means it is now planning to open five field hospitals in the coming weeks. The first, the NHS Nightingale in east London will receive its first patients next week. It will be located in Docklands and will eventually be capable of providing support for up to 4,000 coronavirus patients if required. It will initially provide up to 500 beds Prince Charles will open the hospital via video link from his Scottish residence, where he is recovering from Covid-19. In case you missed it, the speaker of Iran\u2019s parliament, Ali Larijani, has contracted the coronavirus, the highest-ranking official among several senior government figures to catch the disease, the Associated Press reports. The parliament in Iran announced Larijani\u2019s illness on its website, saying he was receiving treatment in quarantine. Iran\u2019s health ministry said Thursday the coronavirus had killed another 124 people, pushing the country\u2019s death toll to 3,160. Governments in the Middle East need to act fast to limit the spread of the coronavirus after cases rose to nearly 60,000, almost double their level a week earlier, the World Health Organization said on Thursday. \u201cNew cases have been reported in some of the most vulnerable countries with fragile health systems,\u201d said Ahmed Al-Mandhari, the WHO\u2019s director for the Eastern Mediterranean region, which includes Pakistan, Afghanistan, Somalia and Djibouti, as well as Middle Eastern states. \u201cEven in countries with stronger heath systems, we have seen a worrying spike in the numbers of cases and deaths reported,\u201d he said in a statement. Outside of Iran, which has reported just over 50,000 cases, confirmed coronavirus numbers have been relatively low in the Middle East compared to Europe, the United States and Asia. But health officials fear that cases of the highly contagious respiratory illness caused by the virus are under-reported and that many countries with weak governments and health systems eroded by conflict will struggle to cope. \u201cI cannot stress enough the urgency of the situation,\u201d said Mandhari. \u201cThe increasing numbers of cases show that transmission is rapidly occurring at local and community levels.\u201d \u201cWe still have a window of opportunity, but this window is slowly closing day by day,\u201d he added. In a sign of the sizeable impact that this pandemic is having on travel, London\u2019s Heathrow airport has said it will close one of its runways from Monday because of a fall in traffic. The airport has two runways and will alternate which one they keep open on a weekly basis, a spokesman said. They added: \u201cAlthough we are seeing significantly fewer flights at the moment, Heathrow will remain open so that we can continue to play a crucial role in helping to secure vital medical goods and food for the nation during this unprecedented epidemic.\u201d On Thursday BA suspended 30,o00 staff from cabin crew to ground staff, engineers and head office employees, until the end of May under the government furlough scheme for companies hit by the coronavirus pandemic. In 2018, Heathrow served 80.1 million passengers, according to their website. A total of 475,624 flights took off from the west London site in the same year. Gatwick Airport has also significantly scaled back its operations, closing one of its two terminals on Wednesday and its runway will only be open for scheduled flights between 2pm and 10pm. The measures will be in place for a minimum of one month. Gatwick recorded 47 million passengers last year. For those of you who may not have seen some of our coverage of President Trump\u2019s recent press conference, there were a few key lines: The president blamed the states for lack of supplies in fighting the virus. One of the key medical faces of the virus fight, Dr Deborah Birx, said not everyone was adhering to social distancing rules: \u201cI can tell by the curve as it is today that not everyone is following the social distancing guidance,\u201d Birx said. \u201cWe can bend our curve, but everyone has to take responsibility as Americans.\u201d Newly approved testing kits will be able to give results in 15 minutes, Birx said. Trade and economic adviser, and Defence Production Act policy coordinator, Peter Navarro, said that the bidding on supplies inside the US is due to a \u201cblack market\u201d of bidders driving up prices. He said domestic supplies are being bought up and sent abroad. Vice president Mike Pence said the US had the \u201cgreatest healthcare system in the world\u201d. Jared Kushner addressed the briefing but said very little, other than people were working hard and doing a good job. You can stay up to date on all of our live coverage from the US on our US blog: Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic. I\u2019m Alison Rourke and will be steering our coverage for the next few hours. As the number of infections rose past one million, and deaths passed 50,000, countries, including the United Sates, are taking increasing measures to combat the virus. New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, has warned his state will run out of ventilators in six days. Donald Trump has issued orders to use the defence production act to make ventilators. The president has also confirmed in his daily press briefing that he has tested negative for Covid-19. The US now has just under 240,000 infections and 5, 798 deaths according to the Johns Hopkins university tracker. Here\u2019s a summary of the other top points: Global cases of the virus have passed one million, according to figures collected by researchers from Johns Hopkins University. Deaths worldwide have passed 50,000. In terms of deaths, Italy remains the country worst affected by the outbreak, with 13,915 fatalities, followed by Spain, with 10,003 deaths. The US is now the third worst affected country, with 5,316 total deaths. Governments in the Middle East need to act fast to limit the spread of the coronavirus after cases rose to nearly 60,000, almost double their level a week earlier, the World Health Organization said on Thursday. The UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the government was hoping to build an \u201cat-scale\u201d diagnostics industry to reach 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month, as he unveiled his five-pillar strategy. Just 5,000 NHS staff have been tested so far. More than 6.65 million people have filed for unemployment benefits in the US last week, according to the latest official figures, highlighting the devastating economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the American economy. The pro-independence leader of Catalonia, the region of Spain hardest hit by the coronavirus after Madrid, has abandoned his government\u2019s initial reluctance to seek help from the Spanish army, saying any assistance would be gratefully received.

(Kushner had said: \u201cThe notion of the federal stockpile was it\u2019s supposed to be <strong><em>our</em></strong><em> </em>stockpile. It\u2019s not supposed to be states\u2019 stockpiles that they then use.\u201d)<strong><br></strong></p> \n  <p>Trump just gave a very confusing response, saying: \u201cYou know what \u2018our\u2019 means? The United States of America. Our, our, and then we take that \u2018our\u2019 and we distribute it to the states.\u201d </p> \n  <p>The reporter responded: \u201cSo why did he say it\u2019s not supposed to be states\u2019 stockpiles?\u201d</p> \n  <p>Trump: \u201cBecause we need it for the government, we need it for the federal government. To keep for our country because the federal government needs it, too, not just the states.

      "bodyText": "Live reporting on the coronavirus in the US continues on Saturday\u2019s blog: The CDC issued new recommendations for people to wear masks or face coverings while in public. The president undermined the guidelines almost immediately after announcing them, insisting that he wouldn\u2019t wear masks because \u201cthey\u2019re not for me\u201d. During the daily coronavirus task force briefing, Donald Trump attacked the idea of voting by mail, despite having requested an absentee ballot in 2020. The president said, citing no evidence, that mail-in voting encouraged cheating. Asked whether he could reassure New Yorkers that the state would receive enough ventilators, the president said, \u201cNo.\u201d. The state is seeking 15,000 ventilators before the peak of cases hits. Today, New York reported the largest single-day increase in its coronavirus death toll, with nearly 3,000 residents having already lost their lives. Nancy Pelosi said Congress should pass another economic relief bill. The House speaker said Congress should build upon the $2tn stimulus package passed last month. The unemployment rate rose to 4.4% last month, according to the US jobs report released this morning. Economists expect that figure to rise steeply as more companies lay off workers amid the pandemic. The supreme court announced it will postpone oral arguments scheduled for this month. The court had already delayed cases that were scheduled to be argued in March. Congressman Adam Schiff drafted a bill to establish a commission to probe the coronavirus response. The Democratic lawmaker said the commission would seek to gather lessons for future crises, but Trump dismissed the idea of a commission yesterday as a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d. And here\u2019s a roundup of the Guardian\u2019s coronavirus coverage from across the country: 1) In California, food banks are struggling to keep up with growing demand, even as they run into volunteer shortages and rising food prices. 2) In Michigan, a public bus driver died less than two weeks after expressing concern about passenger coughing without covering her mouth. 3) In New York, workers at Bellevue hospital, which has fought against epidemics for centuries, say they can see a breaking point coming as coronavirus cases rise. 4) In Florida, passengers from an ill-fated cruise were carefully freed from their cabins and allowed to touch dry land. Here\u2019s a round-up of Guardian opinion pieces, to help you digest this week in politics: 1) Lloyd Green on Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law as public health adviser... 2) David Heymann on face masks... 3) Heidi Shierholz on the economy... 4) And finally, The Guardian view on Trump\u2019s coronavirus response... Here\u2019s more from the reporter who Trump attacked during the briefing. The president told Weijia Jiang of CBS that she \u201coughtta be ashamed\u201d for asking what the president\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner meant when he said that the federal stockpile was \u201cours\u201d. The president has habitually lashed out at reporters of color, and particularly women. The Guardian\u2019s David Smith has also found that the pattern extends to lawmakers and public figures of color. My colleague Sam Levine circles back to the moment during today\u2019s coronavirus briefing when Trump bashed the idea of voting by mail... As Donald Trump was explaining that he won\u2019t be wearing a mask, because he doesn\u2019t want to greet \u201cpresidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings queens,\u201d with his face covered, Melania Trump tweeted an appeal for \u201ceveryone\u201d to take the CDC guidelines seriously: I missed this moment, from earlier, when Trump discusses models: Well, that\u2019s all the briefing we\u2019re getting today. My colleague Joanna Walters has one last fact check for us: Fact check: the federal stockpile A reporter at the White House briefing asked Trump why Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, referred to \u201cour stockpile\u201d yesterday when asked about states struggling to get key medical supplies, especially ventilators, from the federal government. (Kushner had said: \u201cThe notion of the federal stockpile was it\u2019s supposed to be our stockpile. It\u2019s not supposed to be states\u2019 stockpiles that they then use.\u201d) Trump just gave a very confusing response, saying: \u201cYou know what \u2018our\u2019 means? The United States of America. Our, our, and then we take that \u2018our\u2019 and we distribute it to the states.\u201d The reporter responded: \u201cSo why did he say it\u2019s not supposed to be states\u2019 stockpiles?\u201d Trump: \u201cBecause we need it for the government, we need it for the federal government. To keep for our country because the federal government needs it, too, not just the states. But out of that we choose oftentimes, as an example, we have almost 10,000 ventilators and we are ready to rock...we are going to bring them to various areas of the country that need them. But when he says \u2018our\u2019 he is talking about \u201cour country\u201d he is talking about the federal government. You should be ashamed of yourself...don\u2019t make it sound bad...you just asked your question in a very nasty way.\u201d In fact, yesterday reporters quickly noted the stockpile is indeed meant as a resource for the states, as noted on the department of health and human services\u2019 website. \u201cWhen state, local, tribal, and territorial responders request federal assistance to support their response efforts, the stockpile ensures that the right medicines and supplies get to those who need them most during an emergency,\u201d the website read. But this morning, that language had been removed from the HHS website. \u201cThe Strategic National Stockpile\u2019s role is to supplement state and local supplies during public health emergencies,\u201d the website now says. \u201cMany states have products stockpiled, as well.\u201d Fact check: Mail-in voting \u201cA lot of people cheat\u201d with mail-in voting, Trump said. People should go to the voting booth, \u201cproudly display yourself\u201d and have an ID, he added. \u201cAll sorts of bad things can happen\u201d, when people vote by mail, the president said. But there is no evidence of widespread cheating when people vote by mail, and on the contrary, there is evidence that removing barriers to voting by mail can make it easier for many people \u2013 including those with disabilities, and work and childcare responsibilities \u2013 to vote. Still, Trump has long-opposed measures to expand vote by mail. My colleague Sam Levine reported earlier this week: Donald Trump admitted on Monday that making it easier to vote in America would hurt the Republican party. The president made the comments as he dismissed a Democratic-led push for reforms such as vote-by-mail, same-day registration and early voting as states seek to safely run elections amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Democrats had proposed the measures as part of the coronavirus stimulus. They ultimately were not included in the $2.2tn final package, which included only $400m to states to help them run elections. \u201cThe things they had in there were crazy. They had things, levels of voting that if you\u2019d ever agreed to it, you\u2019d never have a Republican elected in this country again,\u201d Trump said during an appearance on Fox &amp; Friends. \u201cThey had things in there about election days and what you do and all sorts of clawbacks. They had things that were just totally crazy and had nothing to do with workers that lost their jobs and companies that we have to save.\u201d Fact check: Is the previous administration to blame? Donald Trump has repeatedly blamed the \u201cprevious administration\u201d for his government\u2019s lack of preparation for the coronavirus crisis. \u201cSpeak to the people from the previous administration. The shelves were empty,\u201d he said when asked why the US failed to stockpile enough medical supplies to meet current needs. But Trump, who has been president since 2017, ignored early warnings that a pandemic was coming, including from his own HHS secretary. Three months before the first cases of coronavirus began spreading through China, the Trump administration ended a $200m early warning program designed to alert it to potential pandemics. Will the government guarantee that New York will have enough ventilators? \u201cNo,\u201d the Trump said. \u201cWe are doing the best we can... We happen to think [governor Andrew Cuomo] is well served with ventilators. We are going to find out.\u201d Trump added that other states like Michigan and Louisiana made need ventilators, too. We found Dr Fauci... He\u2019s on PBS NewsHour, providing context and guidance on the new mask guidelines. Context: Antibody tests Dr Deborah Birx said that tests that can detect whether people have had the infection and developed immunity will be important going forward. \u201cWe want those tests to be like what we use for HIV and Malaria,\u201d she said, which uses a finger prick of blood to detect whether a person\u2019s immune system has developed antibodies to fight the infection. Yesterday, the FDA approved an antibody test that is more complicated, and requires a lot more than just a finger-prick of blood. The test, developed by Cellex, takes 15 to 20 minutes to get a result. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to test for immunity,\u201d Robert Siegel, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford University, told me yesterday because people who are immune could return to work without endangering themselves or others. \u201cThey could more safely work as frontline healthcare providers,\u201d Siegel said. Trump is growing increasingly hostile toward reporters in the briefing room. Asked to clarify what the president\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner meant when he said the national stockpile was \u201cour stockpile\u201d and not for states, Trump snapped that she \u201coughtta be ashamed\u201d of herself. \u201cWe need it for the federal government,\u201d he said, of the national emergency stockpile. He\u2019s repeatedly said that states should depend on the federal government for aid unless it\u2019s a \u201clast resort\u201d and has blamed states for a shortage of medical supplies. Context: Oracle and Covid-19 treatments Trump said, \u201cmany providers are trying different experimental treatments.\u201d The health secretary Alex Azar added: \u201cToday, Oracle has developed and donated to the government and the American people a web portal and platform to gather crowdsourced and real-time information from providers about how patients respond to potential therapeutics.\u201d As the New York Times reported on 24 March: The White House is preparing to use software provided by the technology giant Oracle to promote unproven coronavirus treatments, including a pair of malaria drugs publicized by Trump, potentially before the government approves their use for the outbreak, according to five senior administration officials and others familiar with the plans. An online platform designed by Oracle, in collaboration with the White House, is still taking shape, but it is likely to be used to collect information about off-label use of the drugs, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, which are not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Trump has tried to reassure Americans that what he has called a \u201cgame changer\u201d treatment is imminent, but his language has alarmed senior health officials and public health experts, who say that the Oracle program would amount to a sprawling, crowdsourced clinical trial without the usual controls of the FDA. The president boasted about his administration\u2019s shipments of medical masks to New York. Compared to the homemade masks that the CDC is reccomending that the public wear, the N-95 masks are \u201cmore expensive, more complicated, better, whatever\u201d, Trump said. Why is it we don\u2019t have enough masks? \u201cThe previous administration,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSpeak to the people from the previous administration. The shelves were empty.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Trump in response to a question asking where Dr Anthony Fauci is today. Fauci, Trump\u2019s leading public health adviser, has jot joined in the briefing today. \u201cWhenever he\u2019s not here,\u201d Trump complained, \u201cthe fake news\u201d will ask about him. The masks are more for the protection of other people than oneself, the surgeon general clarified Jerome Adams. Wearing a cloth face covering will help contain your coughs and sneezes, reducing chances that you\u2019ll spray infectious droplets into the air, and risk transmitting the disease the others, noted Dr Adams. Still \u201cmaintaining 6ft of social distancing remains key\u201d, he said. Masks are \u201cnot a replacement for social distancing\u201d. Also important: don\u2019t put a mask on with dirty hands. \u201cIf you choose to wear a face covering, wash your hands first,\u201d Adams said. \u201cI won\u2019t be doing it, personally,\u201d Trump said about masks - it wouldn\u2019t suit his position. He doesn\u2019t want to greet world leaders, \u201cpresidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens\u201d, he continued, while wearing a face covering. \u201cI don\u2019t know, somehow, I don\u2019t see it for myself.\u201d Here\u2019s more from the CDC: \u201cCDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (eg, grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission\u201d People should continue to maintain a 6ft distance between themselves and others, and remain diligent about washing and sanitizing hands. All Americans, including those without health insurance, will be able to receive treatment without worrying about the cost, according to Mike Pence. The administration has repeatedly ignored calls from Democratic lawmakers to reopen the Obamacare exchanges to allow the uninsured to purchase insurance. Instead, Pence said that hospitals that treat uninsured would get paid for at Medicare rates. Fact check: hydroxychloroquine Trump once again touted hydroxychloroquine as a coronavirus cure, \u201cI don\u2019t know it\u2019s looking like good results,\u201d he said. But public health experts including Trump\u2019s top infectious diseases adviser, Dr Fauci, have previously warned that there was only \u201canecdotal evidence\u201d that the drugs could be helpful. My colleague Oliver Milman reported that a French study of 40 coronavirus patients found that half experienced clearing of their airways after being given hydroxychloroquine. Experts have warned that the study is small and lacks sufficient rigor to be classed as evidence of a potential treatment. The French health ministry has warned against the use of hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19. The surge in demand for the unproven hydroxychloroquine also risks shortages of the drug for those who need it most. It is used to help patients manage the chronic autoimmune disease lupus, but some are already complaining the drug is harder to come by. Trump\u2019s pushing of the treatment has reportedly caused stockpiling of hydroxychloroquine. White House aide Judd Deere provided more clarification: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now recommends masks for the public, Trump said, though Trump repeatedly undermined the recommendation. \u201cI\u2019m choosing not to do it,\u201d he said, repeatedly noting that wearing non-medical grade masks is a \u201cvoluntary\u201d option. Donald Trump has taken the podium. New York City residents all received a push alert, calling on all licensed healthcare workers to support facilities in need. My colleague Alexandra Villarreal reported, earlier: New York City\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio, has called for a national enlistment program for doctors and nurses, to handle an expected surge in coronavirus cases in New York and across the US. \u201cIf we\u2019re fighting a war, let\u2019s act like we\u2019re fighting a war,\u201d he said. Hi there, it\u2019s Maanvi Singh, blogging from the West Coast. Soon, we\u2019re expecting Donald Trump to speak at the daily coronavirus briefing at 5:30. Alabama has just issued a stay at home order for the entire state, starting at 5pm Saturday. Governor Kay Ivey issued the order after initially resisting calls. The state has reported more than 1,400 cases of coronavirus. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Nancy Pelosi said Congress should pass another economic relief bill. The House speaker said Congress should build upon the $2 trillion stimulus package passed last month to help Americans who are struggling financially because of coronavirus. The unemployment rate rose to 4.4% last month, according to the US jobs report released this morning. Economists expect that figure to rise steeply as more companies lay off workers amid the pandemic. New York governor Andrew Cuomo is signing an executive order to redistribute respirators to hospitals in need. New York reported the largest single-day increase in its coronavirus death toll, with nearly 3,000 residents having already lost their lives. The Supreme Court announced it will postpone oral arguments scheduled for this month. The court had already delayed cases that were scheduled to be argued in March. Congressman Adam Schiff drafted a bill to establish a commission to probe the coronavirus response. The Democratic lawmaker said the commission would seek to gather lessons for future crises, but Trump dismissed the idea of a commission yesterday as a \u201cwitch-hunt.\u201d Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Wisconsin governor Tony Evers is calling on lawmakers to cancel in-person voting for the state\u2019s presidential primary on Tuesday. Evers expressed fear that primary voters could spread coronavirus at polling places if they are asked to cast ballots in person. The Democratic governor called on legislators to hold a special session tomorrow to make the primary an entirely mail-in election. \u201cThis is a significant concern and a very unnecessary public health risk,\u201d Evers told reporters. \u201cI can\u2019t move this election or change it on my own. My hands are tied.\u201d Wisconsin has already seen a surge in requests for mail-in ballots. Wisconsin Democrats and civil rights have also sued the state to get officials to loosen requirements for absentee voting. The Supreme Court has said it will postpone oral arguments scheduled for this month because of the pandemic. Reuters reports: The court, which already had delayed cases due to be argued in March, has yet to say how it will proceed. The court\u2019s current term is due to conclude at the end of June. Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said that the nine justices - including oldest member Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 87 - are all healthy. The court is due to issue rulings online only on Monday, as it has in the last two weeks. The governor of Pennsylvania is asking all state residents to wear face masks if they go outside. The recommendation from governor Tom Wolf comes amid some conflicting messages about whether all Americans should be wearing face coverings. Health officials originally said widespread mask usage would not help mitigate the spread of the virus, but that thinking appears to be changing as early evidence indicates coronavirus can be spread even through talking. The White House is expected to soon issue federal guidance on all Americans wearing face coverings. Lawmakers from both parties criticized the reported barriers that small businessowners are experiencing as they try to receive funds from the stimulus package. Applications opened today for the $350 billion small business loan program that was estblished in the $2 trillion stimulus package, but some businessowners said they were being blocked from applying to certain banks. Republican senator Marco Rubio specifically criticized Bank of America for its requirements of loan applicants. Democratic senator Ben Cardin similarly accused banks of \u201ccreating artificial barriers\u201d that block much-needed funds from reaching struggling businesses. \u201cThe small business provisions in the CARES Act were written to get funds into the hands of American small business owners as quickly as possible so they can keep employees on payroll and avoid financial ruin while we work to combat COVID-19,\u201d Cardin said in a statement. \u201cCreating artificial barriers that block businesses from much-needed capital is redlining by another name.\u201d Meanwhile, the Small Business Administration said that more than $2 billion in loans have already been processed through the program. The Guardian\u2019s Sam Levin reports on the latest from California: California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, has announced that the state has now secured 7,000 hotel rooms for homeless people during the pandemic, with the goal of procuring 15,000 total. At a briefing in Sacramento, he also said the state now has 10,710 total positive Covid-19 cases, 2,188 people hospitalized, and 901 in the ICU (a 10.4% hike from yesterday). Newsom said the federal government would cover 75% of the costs of hotels through Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) reimbursement. He said 869 people total have been housed through the state program so far, and that the rooms are for people who have tested positive, been exposed or are high risk. \u201cWe want to relieve the stress in our shelter system so we can separate individuals and relieve the impact on our medical delivery system,\u201d the governor said, standing outside a facility where 30 homeless people have now been housed. There are questions about whether the state\u2019s efforts to prevent major outbreaks in homeless communities will be fast enough and at a large enough scale. More than 150,000 people are homeless in the state, with an estimated 40,000 in crowded shelters on a given night where there are major concerns about potential spread. Some previous reporting on the subject: Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell celebrated House speaker Nancy Pelosi shifting her focus away from a massive infrastructure bill. The Kentucky Republican said Pelosi had been trying \u201cto use this crisis to push unrelated left-wing priorities,\u201d even though Trump himseld voiced support for an infrastructure bill. Pelosi released a statement earlier today saying the next coronavirus bill should focus on economic relief, expanding upon the $2 trillion stimulus package signed into law last month, as the country confronts mass job losses. \u201cWhile I\u2019m very much in favor of doing some things we need to do to meet the needs \u2014 clean water, more broadband, the rest of that \u2014 that may have to be for a bill beyond this,\u201d Pelosi told CNBC earlier today. The description of the Strategic National Stockpile on a government website was changed after Jared Kushner mischaracterized the program. Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, said yesterday, \u201cAnd the notion of the federal stockpile was it\u2019s supposed to be our stockpile. It\u2019s not supposed to be states\u2019 stockpiles that they then use.\u201d Reporters quickly noted the stockpile is indeed meant as a resource for the states, as noted on the department of health and human services\u2019 website. \u201cWhen state, local, tribal, and territorial responders request federal assistance to support their response efforts, the stockpile ensures that the right medicines and supplies get to those who need them most during an emergency,\u201d the website read. But this morning, that language had been removed from the HHS website. \u201cThe Strategic National Stockpile\u2019s role is to supplement state and local supplies during public health emergencies,\u201d the website now says. \u201cMany states have products stockpiled, as well.\u201d News outlets were quick to note the change, but the agency said the language revision was in the works for weeks, a claim that was met with much skepticism on Twitter. The actual coronavirus death toll in Wuhan, China, may have exceeded 40,000, according to estimates based on the activity of the region\u2019s funeral homes. The official death toll in Wuhan, the first region to experience an outbreak of coronavirus, is 2,563. The Washington Post reports: The Hankou Funeral Parlor\u2019s crematorium was operating 19 hours a day, with male staff enlisted to help carry bodies. In just two days, the home received 5,000 urns, the respected magazine Caixin reported. ... Using photos posted online, social media sleuths have estimated that Wuhan funeral homes had returned 3,500 urns a day since March 23. That would imply a death toll in Wuhan of about 42,000 \u2014 or 16 times the official number. Another widely shared calculation, based on Wuhan\u2019s 84 furnaces running nonstop and each cremation taking an hour, put the death toll at 46,800. The US intelligence community has reportedly concluded that China under-reported coronavirus cases and deaths. Health experts have similarly said the death tolls in Italy and Spain suggest China may not have reported all of its data on the virus. The White House is stepping up its precautions to ensure the president and vice president don\u2019t get coronavirus. The AP reports: Starting Friday, anyone who is expected to be in \u2018close proximity\u2019 to either President Donald Trump or Vice President Mike Pence will be given a quick COVID-19 test \u2018to evaluate for pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic carriers status to limit inadvertent transmission.\u2019 ... All visitors to the White House complex already have their temperatures taken when entering the building and if they will be in close proximity to either Trump or Pence. Trump took the new COVID-19 test on Thursday and the White House doctor said results were back in 15 minutes. He tested negative. Trump and Pence were both tested for coronavirus themselves last month, after they both came into contact with individuals who later tested positive. New Jersey governor Phil Murphy raised the possibility of delaying the state\u2019s presidential primary, which is currently set for early June. \u201cI\u2019ll be stunned if we stay at June 2,\u201d Murphy said. Eleven primaries are currently set to be held on June 2, after several states delayed their April and May primaries in order to avoid spreading coronavirus at polling places. But if New Jersey pushes its primary past June 2, it will likely put pressure on those other states to follow suit. The Democratic National Committee similarly announced yesterday that its convention, originally scheduled to start July 13, would be delayed a month because ofthe pandemic. Joe Biden applauded a Navy captain who was dismissed from his post after raising concerns about the spread of coronavirus on his ship. Brett Crozier was relieved from his post as captain of the the USS Theodore Roosevelt yesterday after a letter he wrote to senior officials, which demanded crew members be allowed to quarantine, was made public. \u201cWe are not at war,\u201d Crozier wrote in the letter. \u201cSailors do not need to die. If we do not act now, we are failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset \u2014 our Sailors.\u201d The acting Navy secretary said Crozier had shown \u201cpoor judgment\u201d by sending the letter outside his chain of command, but Biden applauded the captain\u2019s courage and loyalty. Videos shared on social media last night showed hundreds of crew members cheering for Crozier as he departed from the ship. Early data on coronavirus cases and deaths indicates that in the US, African Americans are being worst affected by the pandemic. ProPublica reports: As of Friday morning, African Americans made up almost half of Milwaukee County\u2019s 945 cases and 81% of its 27 deaths in a county whose population is 26% black. Milwaukee is one of the few places in the United States that is tracking the racial breakdown of people who have been infected by the novel coronavirus, offering a glimpse at the disproportionate destruction it is inflicting on black communities nationwide. In Michigan, where the state\u2019s population is 14% black, African Americans made up 35% of cases and 40% of deaths as of Friday morning. Detroit, where a majority of residents are black, has emerged as a hot spot with a high death toll. As has New Orleans. Louisiana has not published case breakdowns by race, but 40% of the state\u2019s deaths have happened in Orleans Parish, where the majority of residents are black.\u201d Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said there will be \u201cglitches\u201d with distributing funds from the stimulus package. \u201cThere are bound to be problems,\u201d McConnell told McClatchy. \u201cYou can\u2019t pass a bill of this magnitude in a week and have a perfect implementation of $2.2 trillion, so sure there are going to be glitches.\u201d McConnell\u2019s comments come as banks report a flood of applicatnts for the small business loan program, which started accepting applications today, and Americans await their direct cash payments. According to a memo House Democrats are reportedly ciculating, some Americans may not receive their payments for nearly five months, a disappointing timeline considering nearly 10 million people have filed for unemployment in the past two weeks. Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin said $875 million in small business loans have already been processed as part of the Paycheck Protection Program created by the $2 trillion stimulus package. That $875 million represents a small fraction of the $349 billion the program, which began accepting application today, is expected to distribute. Some major banks are already reporting a flood of applications that raised concerns about how small businesses would be able to quickly receive the much-needed funds. Bank of America said it received 10,000 applications by 10 am ET, and some banks have not even opened their application portals yet. House speaker Nancy Pelosi has issued a statement calling for another bill to build on the $2 trillion stimulus package to help Americans who are suffering financially during the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cThe acceleration of the coronavirus demands that we double down on the downpayment we made in CARES by passing a CARES 2 package,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement. \u201cWe must extend and expand this bipartisan legislation to meet the needs of the American people.\u201d The Democratic speaker called for more direct payments to American families, additional funding to process unemployment claims and resources for the overwhelmed healthcare system. The statement comes one day after the labor department announced nearly 10 million people have filed for unemployment benefits in the past two weeks. \u201cThe coronavirus is moving swiftly, and our communities cannot afford for us to wait,\u201d Pelosi said. The speaker added that Demorats will also continue working on a potential infrastructure package, which she has referred to as \u201cphase four\u201d of Congress\u2019 coronavirus response. CNN host Brooke Baldwin said she has tested positive for coronavirus, becoming the second CNN host this week to announce a diagnosis. \u201cI am OKAY,\u201d Baldwin wrote on Instagram, noting she has no underlying conditions to complicate her illness. \u201cIt came on suddenly yesterday afternoon. Chills, aches, fever.\u201d CNN host Chris Cuomo, the brother of New York governor Andrew Cuomo, announced earlier this week that he had also been diagnosed with the virus. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: New York governor Andrew Cuomo said he would sign an executive order to seize ventilators from hospitals with fewer coronavirus cases. The order, which will allow the state to redistribute ventilators to overwhelmed hospitals, comes as New York reported its highest single-day increase yet in the coronavirus death toll. Congressman Adam Schiff has drafted a bill to form a commission to probe the coronavirus response. Schiff said the purpose of the commission would to gather lessons for future crises, but Trump dismissed the idea of a commission yesterday as a Democratic \u201cwitch-hunt.\u201d The unemployment rate rose to 4.4% as the US reported 701,000 job losses. The figure is only expected to rise in the coming months, with the Congressional Budget Office predicting unemployment will surpass 10% this financial quarter. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. The Guardian\u2019s Stephanie Kirchgaessner reports: The removal of a US naval captain who expressed alarm over sailors on his ship because of the threat of the Covid-19 virus may have violated whistleblower protection laws, according to a lawyer who has studied the issue. Captain Brett Crozier was relieved of his command of the USS Theodore Roosevelt days after a letter he wrote, which had warned that an outbreak of the virus aboard the aircraft carrier could lead to deaths, was leaked in the press. The letter, first reported by the San Francisco Chronicle, warned \u201cif we do not act now, we are failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset - our sailors\u201d. Thomas Modly, the Navy secretary, announced Crozier\u2019s dismissal due to loss of confidence and not using his chain of command. While Modly accused Crozier of creating a \u201cpanic\u201d, online videos showed what the Navy Times dubbed a \u201chero\u2019s farewell\u201d. Stephen Kohn, a Washington DC-based attorney who represents whistleblowers (but is not representing Crozier) said military law permitted Crozier to inform officials of \u201clife-threatening conditions\u201d as well as \u201cgross mismanagement\u201d by the US Navy. \u201cConsequently, Captain Crozier\u2019s memorandum to the Navy was a protected disclosure under law,\u201d Kohn said. CNN has reported that the Navy was concerned that Crozier had used an \u201cunsecure system\u201d to email his memo, increasing chances that it could be leaked. Kohn said the justification appeared to raise the spectre of illegal retaliation. \u201cUnder military law, whistleblower disclosures made by Captain Crozier would only lose their protection if they were \u2018unlawful.\u2019 The Navy has not alleged that any of Captain Crozier\u2019s communications violated the law,\u201d Kohn said. Washington may not see its peak of coronavirus hospitalizations until July, mayor Muriel Bowser announced in a briefing on the capital city\u2019s response to the pandemic. Bowser said Washington would need more than 2,700 new ICU beds by early July to address the surge in hospitalizations. The city has less than 100 ICU beds available now. Officials estimate that Washington will see 93,000 cases of coronavirus over the course of the pandemic and up to 1,000 fatalities. More than 700 cases have already been confirmed in the city, and 15 residents have died. Bowser also unsurprisingly confirmed that the city\u2019s schools will not reopen on April 27, as previously hoped, but a final decision on that matter will be issued later. The Guardian\u2019s Andrew Roth reports from Moscow: Hundreds of US citizens have been stranded in Moscow after an evacuation flight to New York was grounded at the last moment due to a Russian ban on all international flights. The Aeroflot flight was meant to carry US citizens seeking to leave Russia, and then repatriate hundreds of Russians stranded in the United States. Russia has closed its international borders for most travellers, and this afternoon announced that it would impose a ban on all international flights in and out of Russia as of Saturday morning. The flight cancellation came after passengers had already boarded the flight. Some had been trying to leave Russia for weeks. Others had been living in Moscow\u2019s Sheremetyevo airport for days, waiting for a chance to leave the country. Nicholas Mackay, a ballet photographer who lives in Russia, said that he has been trying to travel to the United States for several weeks to reach his father, who is sick with cancer. \u201cWe were already on the flight, and then a flight attendant came on over the intercom and told us that we are not flying out, the flight is cancelled and all flights are cancelled by the Russian government,\u201d he said by telephone. \u201cThere\u2019s no information. We\u2019re not even able to get any money back from our flight. We\u2019re only able to change for a different day. A different day is no day, because no one knows when international travel will be OK in this whole situation.\u201d A US embassy spokesperson said: \u201cThe US Embassy is aware of the inexplicable cancellation of today\u2019s Aeroflot flight to New York. The flight was full of US citizens anxious to get home. We are awaiting an explanation from the Russian Federation. We continue to work to find ways to help US citizens return home.\u201d During his daily briefing, New York governor Andrew Cuomo said the temporary hopsital at the Javits Center would be converted into a coronavirus facility because there are so few non-coronavirus cases right now. \u201cWe don\u2019t have non-Covid people to any great extent in the hospitals,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cHospitals have now turned into effectively ICU hospitals for Covid patients.\u201d Cuomo\u2019s comments come as reports indicate the Navy hospital ship Comfort, which is in New York to treat non-coronavirus patients, has only received 20 patients so far. Meanwhile, the city\u2019s emergency rooms are overrun with coronavirus patients, and medical professionals are working long hours to confront the surge in cases. New York governor Andrew Cuomo just wrapped up his daily briefing on the state\u2019s coronavirus response. Here\u2019s what he covered: Cuomo will sign an executive order to allow the state to take ventilators from hospitals with fewer coronavirus cases and give them to hospitals in need. Cuomo pushed back against a reporter who said the state would \u201cseize\u201d the medical equipment, but that seems like an accurate description considering the National Guard will be used for the operation. New York has recorded 2,935 deaths linked to coronavirus, up from from 2,373 a day earlier, marking the largest single-day increase in the death toll since the crisis struck the state. New York has also confirmed 102,863 cases of the virus. Officials offered a mixed message on whether everyone should wear face coverings to limit the spread of the virus. State health commissioner Howard Zucker noted there was no data to confirm face coverings help prevent transmissions, but Cuomo said it \u201ccouldn\u2019t hurt\u201d to wear them. Cuomo once again expressed bafflement and anger that the state has to rely on China for the production of medical equipment. \u201cIt is unbelievable to me that in New York state, in the United States of America, that we can\u2019t make these materials,\u201d Cuomo said. The temporary hospital at the Javits Center will begin receiving coronavirus patients, even though officials originally said the facility would treat non-coronavirus patients. Cuomo said there simply aren\u2019t enough non-coronavirus cases right now to make that plan worthwhile. New York governor Andrew Cuomo closed his press conference on a message of hope, saying the state will \u201cfind the light\u201d at the end of this crisis. \u201cThis is hard personally,\u201d Cuomo said of the state\u2019s rising coronavirus death toll. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to stay in this all day and then it\u2019s hard staying up all night watching the numbers go up \u2026 and knowing that you\u2019re in charge of the ship.\u201d But the governor emphasized the state would make it through the pandemic. \u201cOnce you go through darkness, you will find the light,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cWe will find the light.\u201d Moments ago, New York officials painted a mixed picture on whether all residents should wear face coverings to limit the spread of the virus. \u201cThere\u2019s no data to support the effectiveness of face masks,\u201d said Dr Howard Zucker, the New York state health commissioner. But governor Andrew Cuomo then suggested it might be worth wearing face coverings considering the lack of clear evidence on the matter. \u201cThe masks couldn\u2019t hurt,\u201d Cuomo said. New York governor Andrew Cuomo dismissed concerns that the state may be sued over his executive order to take ventilators from hospitals with fewer coronavirus cases. \u201cIf they want to sue me for borrrowing their excess ventilators to save lives, then let them sue me,\u201d Cuomo said of the plan. Cuomo noted the state would return the ventilators to their owners or reimburse them for the cost of the equipment. New York governor Andrew Cuomo pushed back against the word \u201cseize\u201d to describe the redistribution of ventilators from less-stressed hospitals to the hospitals with the most coronavirus cases. \u201cIt\u2019s sharing of resources,\u201d Cuomo said of the executive order he plans to sign. But that characterization seems dubious, considering Cuomo said the National Guard would be used to take the ventilators. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said 20,000 medical professionals from other parts of the country have volunteered to help the state as it confronts this crisis. Cuomo emphasized the state would send similar aid to \u201cany community in this nation that needs it\u201d once New York passes its peak number of coronavirus cases. New York mayor Bill de Blasio suggested earlier today that the country needs a national enlistment program for medical professionals to deploy staff to the most stressed regions as the crisis develops. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said ventilators would be seized from less-stressed hospitals to give them to areas where they are \u201curgently required to save lives.\u201d The use of military members to seize medical equipment sends a clear message that New York is entering a new phase of the coronavirus crisis, coming as the state recorded its highest single-day death toll yet. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said he would sign an executive order to seize medical equipment from hospitals that are not as overwhelmed with coronavirus patients right now. Cuomo said the National Guard would be used to take ventilators and personal protective equipment to help hospitals that are particularly hard hit right now, presumably those in New York City and Long Island. Cuomo said the equipment would be returned or reimbursed, but the move is likely to spark outcry from hospitals in upstate New York, which has seen fewer coronavirus cases. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said the temporary hospital constructed at the Javits Center in Manhattan would now receive coronavirus patients. The orignal plan was for the convention center to receive non-coronavirus patients to help free up space in the city\u2019s hospitals, but Cuomo said there were simply not enough non-coronavirus patients right now to make that plan worthwhile. Cuomo also warned that the city is running dangerously low on ventilators. \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough,\u201d the governor said. \u201cPeriod.\u201d Cuomo said yesterady that the state was expected to run out of ventilators in less than a week. New York governor Andrew Cuomo expressed bafflement and anger that the US cannot produce its own medical materials as hospitals run dangerously low on personal protective equipment. \u201cIt is unbelievable to me that in New York state, in the United States of America, that we can\u2019t make these materials,\u201d Cuomo said. The governor implored companies yesterday to shift production toward medical equipment, promising to pay \u201ca premium\u201d for the materials. New York has recorded 2,935 deaths linked to coronavirus, up from from 2,373 a day earlier, governor Andrew Cuomo announced. Cuomo said the increase in the death toll represented the highest single-day rise since the coronavirus crisis struck the state. New York has also confirmed 102,863 cases of coronavirus, far more than any other US state. Congressman Adam Schiff said in a statement that the proposed commission to probe the coronavirus response would not be aimed at \u201cscoring political points.\u201d \u201cThis is not an exercise in casting blame or scoring political points, but something that the American people should rightly expect from their government as an exercise in accountability,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cIn designing such a commission, I believe that the 9/11 Commission provides an established and proven model, one which Congress should adapt to the purposes of the Coronavirus.\u201d But Trump has already made clear he is steadfastly opposed to the idea, dismissing any potential review commission as another \u201cwitch-hunt.\u201d House intelligence committe chairman Adam Schiff has drafted a bill to form a commission, in the style of the 9/11 commission, to investigate the US response to coronavirus. Schiff said the commission would be comprised of 10 members from both parties and would not be formed until February 2021, \u201chopefully after the pandemic has been overcome and after the presidential election.\u201d Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the House homeland security committee, has already drafted a similar bill, but it\u2019s unclear whether House speaker Nancy Pelosi supports the proposal. Pelosi announced yesterday that a House select committee would be formed to ensure appropriate use of government funds in the $2tn stimulus package, but she did not commit to supporting a review commission when asked about the matter by reporters. Trump dismissed the idea out of hand during the daily White House press conference yesterday, arguing the proposal was a partisan attack strategy. \u201cThis is not the time for politics,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cYou see what happens. It\u2019s witch-hunt after witch-hunt after witch-hunt and, in the end, the people doing the witch-hunt have been losing, and they\u2019ve been losing by a lot. It\u2019s not any time for witch-hunts.\u201d A Navy captain who was relieved from his post after raising concerns about the spread of coronavirus on his ship was celebrated by his crew members as he departed. Captain Brett Crozier was dismissed yesterday for showing \u201cpoor judgment\u201d after a letter he wrote warning about a coronavirus outbreak on the USS Theodore Roosevelt was leaked to the press. In the letter, Crozier wrote, \u201cWe are not at war. Sailors do not need to die. If we do not act now, we are failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset \u2014 our Sailors.\u201d Most of the ship\u2019s crew members were allowed to disembark and quarantine after the letter became public, but the incident cost Crozier his job. Last night, hundreds of sailors gathered to wish Crozier farewell, and videos posted to social media showed crew members chanting the captain\u2019s name as he departed. A Navy ship hospital docked in New York to help the city amid the coronavirus crisis has only received 20 patients. The Comfort\u2019s arrival into New York Harbor was celebrated on Monday, but a laborious process to receive patients has hobbled the hospital ship\u2019s usefulness as many of the city\u2019s emergency rooms are overwhelmed with coronavirus patients. The New York Times reports: On Thursday, though, the huge white vessel, which officials had promised would bring succor to a city on the brink, sat mostly empty, infuriating executives at local hospitals. The ship\u2019s 1,000 beds are largely unused, its 1,200-member crew mostly idle. Only 20 patients had been transferred to the ship, officials said, even as New York hospitals struggled to find space for the thousands infected with the coronavirus. Another Navy hospital ship, the U.S.N.S. Mercy, docked in Los Angeles, has had a total of 15 patients, officials said. \u2018If I\u2019m blunt about it, it\u2019s a joke,\u2019 said Michael Dowling, the head of Northwell Health, New York\u2019s largest hospital system. \u2018Everyone can say, \u2018Thank you for putting up these wonderful places and opening up these cavernous halls.\u2019 But we\u2019re in a crisis here, we\u2019re in a battlefield.\u2019 ... Ambulances cannot take patients directly to the Comfort; they must first deliver patients to a city hospital for a lengthy evaluation \u2014 including a test for the virus \u2014 and then pick them up again for transport to the ship. The Comfort was originally supposed to treat non-coronavirus patients, but that theory has been difficult to put into practice, and hospital executives complain the hospital ship serves little purpose if it cannot help address the surge of coronavirus cases. The company 3M has responded to Trump\u2019s criticism of its production of N95 masks after the president implied 3M was negatively impacting the US coronavirus response. Trump issued an order under the Defense Production Act yesterday to have 3M step up its production of face masks and then sent this mysterious tweet: The CEO of 3M fiercely pushed back against Trump\u2019s criticism this morning, saying the company started doubling its production of masks in late January in response to coronavirus. \u201cThe narrative that we aren\u2019t doing everything we can as a company is just not true,\u201d CEO Mike Roman said. New York mayor Bill de Blasio called for the creation of an enlistment program for medical professionals to help combat the pandemic. \u201cNext week in New York City is going to be very tough \u2014 next week in New York City and Detroit and New Orleans and a lot of other places,\u201d de Blasio told MSNBC this morning. \u201cAnd unless the military is fully mobilized and we create something we\u2019ve never had before, which is some kind of national enlistment of medical personnel moved to the most urgent needs in the country constantly, if we don\u2019t have that we\u2019re going to see hospitals simply unable to handle so many people who could be saved.\u201d New York governor Andrew Cuomo has similarly asked for medical professionals from other parts of the country to come to New York as the state sees the highest number of coronavirus cases, promising to \u201creturn the favor\u201d once the virus hits their communities. Dr Anthony Fauci said this morning that Americans can use face coverings to lower their risk of getting coronavirus. The federal government is expected to soon revise its recommendations on face coverings, after health officials initially saying masks were not necessary for the general public. But Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the coverings could be helpful for instances when people are not able to stay six feet apart, like at pharmacies. \u201cBecause of that and because of some recent information that the virus can actually be spread even when people just speak, as opposed to coughing and sneezing, the better part of valor is that when you\u2019re out, and you can\u2019t maintain that six-foot distance, to wear some sort of facial covering,\u201d Fauci told Fox News. But the senior official emphasized Americans should still practice social distancing, adding that medical professionals would still have the highest priority in getting face masks. The US jobs report released this morning shows that the unemployment rate has risen to 4.4% after the country lost 701,000 jobs last month. The latest figure marks a 0.9% increase from last month\u2019s rate of 3.5%, which was a 50-year low in the US unemplyment rate. The jobs report also ends a decade of job growth since the financial crisis, as the country braces for another recession because of the coronavirus pandemic. Adding to the disappointing news, the unemployment rate is expected to only go up. Nearly 10 million people have filed for unemployment benefits in the past two weeks, and the Congressional Budget Office predicted yesterday that unemployment in the second quarter of this year would pass 10%. Read more on the numbers from the Guardian\u2019s Dominic Rushe: Good morning, live blog readers! About 90% of Americans are under stay-at-home orders as states try to mitigate the spread of coronavirus by enforcing social distancing guidelines. However, a handful of governors are still resisting issuing statwide orders, and Donald Trump has been hesitant to issue a federal order to enforce the guidelines. Last night on CNN, Dr Anthony Fauci, the country\u2019s top infectious disease expert, said he was baffled as to why every state does not have an order in effect. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why that\u2019s not happening,\u201d Fauci told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, saying the governors who have not issued statewide orders \u201creally should\u201d reconsider. But the official made clear he was not explicitly calling for a federal order. \u201cYou know, the tension between federally mandated versus states\u2019 rights to do what they want is something I don\u2019t want to get into,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you look at what\u2019s going on in this country, I just don\u2019t understand why we\u2019re not doing that.\u201d Fauci\u2019s comments came as the US reported 1,169 coronavirus deaths, the highest one-day death toll of any country so far, although that record is bound to be quickly broken.",

Maybe I\u2019ll change my mind, but this will pass, and hopefully it will pass very quickly.\u201d</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/can-a-face-mask-protect-me-from-coronavirus-covid-19-myths-busted\">guidance on face covering</a> has shifted over time. Previously only the sick or those at high risk of complications from the virus were advised to wear masks. Jerome Adams, the US surgeon general, tweeted at the end of February that people should \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Surgeon_General/status/1233725785283932160\">STOP BUYING MASKS</a>\u201d and said they were not effective in protecting the general public.</p> \n<p>On Friday, Adams admitted the evolution of the guidance on masks \u201chas been confusing to the American people\u201d. He said the original advice was based on the best information available at the time and that the World Health Organization recommended against using them.</p> \n<p>But now, Adams said, it is known that a \u201csignificant portion\u201d of people with the virus lack symptoms and can transmit it before they show symptoms, for example by coughing, sneezing or speaking. \u201cIn light of this new evidence, CDC recommends, and the task force recommends, wearing cloth-based coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. These includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies.\u201d</p> \n<p>At Friday\u2019s briefing, Trump was not accompanied by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/dr-fauci-security-reportedly-expanded-as-infectious-disease-expert-faces-threats\">Anthony Fauci</a>, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or son-in-law Jared Kushner, who spoke at the podium on Thursday about his growing role in the supply chain.</p> \n<p>Kushner, who has no medical qualifications, raised eyebrows by claiming that states should use their own equipment stockpiles first, adding: \u201cThe notion of the federal stockpile was it\u2019s supposed to be our stockpile. It\u2019s not supposed to be states\u2019 stockpiles that they then use.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hours later, the administration suddenly changed the description of the strategic national stockpile on government websites, switching the emphasis from it being the country\u2019s biggest supply for use in a public health emergency to it supplementing state and local supplies. \u201cMany states have products stockpiled, as well,\u201d it now says.</p> \n<p>At the briefing, Trump was challenged by Weijia Jiang, White House correspondent of CBS News, over Kushner\u2019s use of the word \u201cour\u201d. He dismissed it as a \u201cgotcha\u201d question, responding: \u201cIt means the United States of America. And then we take that \u2018our\u2019 and we distribute it to the states. We need it for the government and we need it for the federal government ...</p> \n<p>\u201cAs an example, we have almost 10,000 ventilators and we are ready to rock with those ventilators. We\u2019re gonna bring them to various areas of the country that need them. When he says \u2018our\u2019 he\u2019s talking about our country. He\u2019s talking about the federal government.\u201d</p> \n<p>Increasingly riled as he sought to defend a family member, Trump told Jiang, a woman of colour: \u201cI mean, it\u2019s such a basic, simple question and you try to make it sound so bad. You ought to be ashamed of yourself ... You just asked your question in a very nasty tone.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4fc021bd6808e1e261d7f29bb0365fe6b883c6a2\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fc021bd6808e1e261d7f29bb0365fe6b883c6a2/0_0_5265_3408/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Face masks for sale in Los Angeles, California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"647\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Face masks for sale in Los Angeles, California.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The tension between federal and state governments in the distribution of ventilators, masks, gloves and other equipment has been a defining feature of the incoherent US response to the virus. Trump reeled off numbers of supplies Washington is sending to states, including 8.1m masks to New York, which has been hardest hit.</p> \n<p>But Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, tweeted on Friday: \u201cWe do not have enough ventilators. Period.\u201d</p> \n<p>Pressed on whether he can assure New Yorkers that they will have a sufficient quantity, Trump said bluntly: \u201cNo. They should\u2019ve had more ventilators at the time. They should\u2019ve had more ventilators, They were totally under-serviced. We are trying to do \u2013 we are doing our best for New York.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou know, we have states, we have a lot of states \u2013 we have territories too \u2013 but we have a lot of states that have to be taken care of. Some much more so than others. We happen to think he\u2019s well-served with ventilators. We\u2019re gonna find out.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/california-church-coronvirus-outbreak-sacramento\">California megachurch linked to spread of more than 70 coronavirus cases</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Whereas Fauci has called for a nationwide state-at-home order, Trump continues to argue that the main responsibility lies with the states. \u201cI leave it up to the governors,\u201d he said on Friday. \u201cI like that from the standpoint of governing.\u201d</p> \n<p>Critics say the administration was caught napping by the pandemic and has mobilised the buying and manufacturing of equipment way too late. But Trump took a swipe at his predecessor, Barack Obama, complaining: \u201cThe previous administration, the shelves were empty.\u201d</p> \n<p>As Trump also continues to attack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, and massive job losses leave people uninsured, there are growing concerns over access to health care for millions. But the White House said on Friday it would cover the costs of coronavirus treatment for uninsured people, drawing on $100bn set aside in the emergency rescue package passed by Congress last week.</p> \n<p>Friday\u2019s briefing also produced a very Trumpian moment as he referred to the models projecting the virus\u2019s spread and death toll. He said: \u201cThe models show hundreds of thousands of people are going to die. You know what I want to do? I want to come way under the model. The professionals did the models. I was never involved in a model \u2013 at least, this kind of a model.\u201d</p>",

It\u2019s not supposed to be states\u2019 stockpiles that they then use.\u201d Hours later, the administration suddenly changed the description of the strategic national stockpile on government websites, switching the emphasis from it being the country\u2019s biggest supply for use in a public health emergency to it supplementing state and local supplies. \u201cMany states have products stockpiled, as well,\u201d it now says. At the briefing, Trump was challenged by Weijia Jiang, White House correspondent of CBS News, over Kushner\u2019s use of the word \u201cour\u201d. He dismissed it as a \u201cgotcha\u201d question, responding: \u201cIt means the United States of America. And then we take that \u2018our\u2019 and we distribute it to the states. We need it for the government and we need it for the federal government ... \u201cAs an example, we have almost 10,000 ventilators and we are ready to rock with those ventilators. We\u2019re gonna bring them to various areas of the country that need them. When he says \u2018our\u2019 he\u2019s talking about our country. He\u2019s talking about the federal government.\u201d Increasingly riled as he sought to defend a family member, Trump told Jiang, a woman of colour: \u201cI mean, it\u2019s such a basic, simple question and you try to make it sound so bad. You ought to be ashamed of yourself ... You just asked your question in a very nasty tone.\u201d The tension between federal and state governments in the distribution of ventilators, masks, gloves and other equipment has been a defining feature of the incoherent US response to the virus. Trump reeled off numbers of supplies Washington is sending to states, including 8.1m masks to New York, which has been hardest hit. But Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, tweeted on Friday: \u201cWe do not have enough ventilators. Period.\u201d Pressed on whether he can assure New Yorkers that they will have a sufficient quantity, Trump said bluntly: \u201cNo. They should\u2019ve had more ventilators at the time. They should\u2019ve had more ventilators, They were totally under-serviced. We are trying to do \u2013 we are doing our best for New York. \u201cYou know, we have states, we have a lot of states \u2013 we have territories too \u2013 but we have a lot of states that have to be taken care of. Some much more so than others. We happen to think he\u2019s well-served with ventilators. We\u2019re gonna find out.\u201d Whereas Fauci has called for a nationwide state-at-home order, Trump continues to argue that the main responsibility lies with the states. \u201cI leave it up to the governors,\u201d he said on Friday. \u201cI like that from the standpoint of governing.\u201d Critics say the administration was caught napping by the pandemic and has mobilised the buying and manufacturing of equipment way too late. But Trump took a swipe at his predecessor, Barack Obama, complaining: \u201cThe previous administration, the shelves were empty.\u201d As Trump also continues to attack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, and massive job losses leave people uninsured, there are growing concerns over access to health care for millions. But the White House said on Friday it would cover the costs of coronavirus treatment for uninsured people, drawing on $100bn set aside in the emergency rescue package passed by Congress last week. Friday\u2019s briefing also produced a very Trumpian moment as he referred to the models projecting the virus\u2019s spread and death toll. He said: \u201cThe models show hundreds of thousands of people are going to die. You know what I want to do? I want to come way under the model. The professionals did the models. I was never involved in a model \u2013 at least, this kind of a model.\u201d",

With stringent social distancing, the Imperial\u2019s 2.2m body bags could be reduced, but by the reckoning even of Trump\u2019s own advisers between 100,000 and 240,000 Americans are still likely to die.</p> \n<p>Trump now has on his watch a public health disaster of devastating proportions. Some <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">245,573 cases</a> have been confirmed across the states, twice the number in Italy, the second-highest nation in the <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">Johns Hopkins league table</a>.</p> \n<p>More than 6,000 people have died and the curve is still rising exponentially. Covid-19 is overwhelming hospitals in New York, New Orleans, Detroit and is hurtling towards the Trump-supporting heartlands.

Even diagnostic testing, the most critical hope for getting on top of the disease, remains hard to get because of shortages in <a href=\"https://qz.com/1822596/all-the-coronavirus-test-materials-in-short-supply-in-the-us/\">swabs and vials</a> leaving emergency coordinators still \u2013 three months into the crisis \u2013 in the dark.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>You can have the best system in the world, but if you give the virus an eight-week head start it will eat you alive</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Jeremy Konyndyk</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>It is a catastrophe that many scientists and public health emergency experts believe could substantially have been averted, if only Trump had listened.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis will be regarded as the worst public health disaster in America in a century,\u201d said Eric Topol, professor of molecular medicine at Scripps Research in San Diego. \u201cThe root cause of the disaster was the lack of readiness to understand where, how and when the disease was spreading.\u201d</p> \n<p>Jeremy Konyndyk, a senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development who led the US government\u2019s response to international disasters between 2013 and 2017, said that stark contrasts in outcomes between different countries in terms of illness and death have been determined not by Covid-19 itself, but by how seriously each government took the risk and how early they acted.</p> \n<p>\u201cOn that score we failed badly,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can have the best system in the world, but if you give the virus an eight-week head start it will eat you alive.\u201d</p> \n<p>For Naomi Oreskes, a history of science professor at Harvard, the unfolding calamity is the fulfilment of her worst fears.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen we first heard about coronavirus, I and several of my colleagues worried that Trump would not attend to scientific advice.

Coronavirus makes no distinctions as to party, but it does prey on the elderly.</p> \n<p>So it is one of the great paradoxes of Trump\u2019s pandemic that he may have put many of his own loyal supporters in mortal peril. As Konyndyk put it: \u201cTrump has endangered his own supporters by sending out a message in contradiction to the science, and they believed him.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "On 6 March, a group of epidemiologists at Imperial College London gave the White House coronavirus taskforce a heads-up about the terrifying projections for the disease they were about to publish relating to the US. The Imperial scientists\u2019 findings would have induced paralytic fear in all but the most nonchalant American. They likened Covid-19, which by that point had already extended its tentacles into at least 28 states in the US, to the 1918 influenza pandemic that killed 50 million people around the globe. On the basis of their modelling, they calculated that if nothing was done to halt the spread of the disease, within weeks it would infect 81% of the US population. The virus would ravage the nation, eviscerate its health system and \u2013 here came the sting \u2013 put 2.2 million Americans into body bags. We don\u2019t know at what point that bone-chilling figure was presented to Donald Trump. What we do know is that on the same day, 6 March, the president of the United States was taking a tour of the Atlanta offices of the federal disease control agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). He was in ebullient mood. He had just heard on Fox News that the latest tally of coronavirus cases in the country was 240, with 11 deaths. Trump and his favourite TV channel were as one in their interpretation of those figures \u2013 things were going great, there was really nothing to worry about. \u201cIt will end,\u201d he told the reporters trailing after him. \u201cPeople have to remain calm \u2026 All I say is: \u2018Be calm.\u2019\u201d Then a resourceful reporter asked him to set out the Trump administration\u2019s latest forecast for how coronavirus would progress in the country. He replied: \u201cWe don\u2019t have a forecast, because we don\u2019t know.\u201d \u2018One day \u2013 it\u2019s like a miracle \u2013 it will disappear\u2019 Trump\u2019s answer was one of the few candid moments over the past three months of his handling of the coronavirus crisis. It was true that they didn\u2019t know. That in a real sense they were walking blind. Already by 6 March the absence of effective diagnostic testing \u2013 caused in part by the CDC\u2019s botched rollout of its own Covid-19 test \u2013 was severely hampering efforts to track the spread of the disease in the hope of containing it before it overwhelmed the country. \u201cAnybody that needs a test gets a test,\u201d Trump told the gaggle of reporters in Atlanta. \u201cThey have the tests. And the tests are beautiful.\u201d The tests were not beautiful, they were critically flawed. Anybody who needed them was not getting them. With virtually no testing available to inform public conversation, Trump was free to unleash his \u201cnatural ability\u201d on the problem, which he did with abandon throughout the early weeks of the crisis. Trump took to describing himself as a \u201cwartime president\u201d, with Covid-19 as the enemy. But his dogged pursuit of his own instincts, his preference for letting his \u201chunches\u201d lead the nation into battle rather than deploying the weaponry of evidence and science, has been the hallmark of his response to the contagion so far. From the first confirmed US case in Washington state on 20 January to Trump\u2019s citing of Imperial\u2019s 2.2 million projected deaths which he did for the first time just this week, he has kept up a relentlessly upbeat facade, downplaying the severity of the threat largely for the benefit of the New York stock exchange. \u201cWe have it totally under control,\u201d he said two days after that first confirmed case and a day before China cut off Wuhan, a city of 11 million. \u201cWe only have five people, we pretty much shut it down coming from China,\u201d he said on 30 January, the day the World Health Organization declared a global emergency. \u201cIt\u2019s going to disappear. One day \u2013 it\u2019s like a miracle \u2013 it will disappear,\u201d he said on 27 February, the day America mourned its first coronavirus death. Trump\u2019s \u2018hunches\u2019 versus science On Tuesday he finally switched tone. The country was in for a \u201cvery, very painful two weeks\u201d, he said, and every American had to be prepared \u201cfor the hard days that lie ahead\u201d. By then the bitter truth could no longer be avoided. With stringent social distancing, the Imperial\u2019s 2.2m body bags could be reduced, but by the reckoning even of Trump\u2019s own advisers between 100,000 and 240,000 Americans are still likely to die. Trump now has on his watch a public health disaster of devastating proportions. Some 245,573 cases have been confirmed across the states, twice the number in Italy, the second-highest nation in the Johns Hopkins league table. More than 6,000 people have died and the curve is still rising exponentially. Covid-19 is overwhelming hospitals in New York, New Orleans, Detroit and is hurtling towards the Trump-supporting heartlands. The federal stockpile of essential medical equipment is nearly empty. Ventilators and protective gear for frontline medical staff are running fatally low. Doctors are improvising masks to save their own lives out of plastic bags and rubber bands. Even diagnostic testing, the most critical hope for getting on top of the disease, remains hard to get because of shortages in swabs and vials leaving emergency coordinators still \u2013 three months into the crisis \u2013 in the dark. It is a catastrophe that many scientists and public health emergency experts believe could substantially have been averted, if only Trump had listened. \u201cThis will be regarded as the worst public health disaster in America in a century,\u201d said Eric Topol, professor of molecular medicine at Scripps Research in San Diego. \u201cThe root cause of the disaster was the lack of readiness to understand where, how and when the disease was spreading.\u201d Jeremy Konyndyk, a senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development who led the US government\u2019s response to international disasters between 2013 and 2017, said that stark contrasts in outcomes between different countries in terms of illness and death have been determined not by Covid-19 itself, but by how seriously each government took the risk and how early they acted. \u201cOn that score we failed badly,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can have the best system in the world, but if you give the virus an eight-week head start it will eat you alive.\u201d For Naomi Oreskes, a history of science professor at Harvard, the unfolding calamity is the fulfilment of her worst fears. \u201cWhen we first heard about coronavirus, I and several of my colleagues worried that Trump would not attend to scientific advice. This is a man who has exhibited a reckless disregard for scientific evidence over climate change; if he could do that, there was always the question of whether he would take seriously any science.\u201d Oreskes sees Covid-19 as Trump\u2019s ultimate challenge. Would he put the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans first, or would he dig into the tried-and-tested Republican playbook of showing hostility to science and expertise, reining in government intervention and prioritizing the money markets? \u201cThis was a test of whether Trump\u2019s government would act. What we\u2019ve seen is that for the people in power in this country, ideology beats even an imminent threat.\u201d \u2018As the president fiddles, people are dying\u2019 Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in Congress, took the extraordinary step on Sunday of accusing Trump directly of \u201ccosting American lives\u201d. His lessening of the severity of the virus early on \u201cwas deadly\u201d, she told CNN, as will be the delays in delivering medical equipment to where it is needed. \u201cAs the president fiddles, people are dying,\u201d she said. That was a tough accusation, even by the standards of these hyper-partisan times. But a growing number of scientists and health emergency experts are tentatively drawing the same conclusion. \u201cWe now know there will be well over 100,000 deaths,\u201d Topol said. \u201cA vast majority of those will have been unnecessarily lost because of the lack of preparedness of the United States. As a leader, Trump has to accept responsibility, which of course he won\u2019t.\u201d It is not as though Trump wasn\u2019t warned. In the wake of the Ebola epidemic in 2014, the Obama administration was so fearful of the dangers of another epidemic that they put in place several innovations designed to prepare the nation for a pandemic. Konyndyk, who was central to the Ebola response, has watched aghast as every element of that effort has been unpicked or overlooked by the Trump administration. \u201cWe set up a special team for pandemic preparedness at the national security council \u2013 they dismantled that. We left them a very detailed playbook of the initial steps for managing an event like this \u2013 they ignored that.\u201d \u2018Scientists knew the risk \u2013 urgent action was needed\u2019 When coronavirus reared its ugly head, there was plenty of early warning. Alex Azar, the health and human services secretary, became aware of the outbreak of a virus in China as early as 3 January. By 5 January scientists in Shanghai had obtained a complete viral genome from an infected patient and reported it immediately to GenBank, the genetic sequencing database of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH). By early February, scientists were aware that Covid-19 was both easily transmitted between individuals and had a relatively high fatality rate, especially for older and vulnerable people. \u201cThat was enough for scientists to know the virus had the potential to spread far and wide and that urgent action was needed,\u201d Konyndyk said. At the same time, US intelligence agencies were passing on their own warnings to the White House. According to the Washington Post, Azar tried several times to sound the alarm but couldn\u2019t get an audience with Trump until 18 January, at which point all the president wanted to talk about was vaping. The Post quoted an anonymous US official who said the system was \u201cblinking red\u201d. The official said: \u201cDonald Trump may not have been expecting this, but a lot of other people in the government were \u2013 they just couldn\u2019t get him to do anything about it.\u201d With the full might of the US scientific community at his disposal, Trump appointed individuals not known for their prowess with pandemics in charge of the federal response. The coronavirus taskforce was to be led by the vice-president, Mike Pence, who has been widely criticized for his handling of a 2015 HIV outbreak when governor of Indiana. Trump is also increasingly relying on his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who made his first appearance at the taskforce briefing on Thursday. Politico has reported that Kushner, whose skill set is in real estate, has in turn reached out to his brother\u2019s father-in-law, who is at least a physician, for advice on fighting the pandemic. \u2018Trump was out of step with all the experts\u2019 Trump\u2019s failure to heed the warnings and act quickly has set in train a domino effect that now imperils large swathes of the US. What began as an inability to get diagnostic testing going on a mass scale has developed into a sluggish mobilization of the federal government, a stuttering deployment of the Defense Production Act to enlist the firepower of corporations, and a stand-back, almost detached approach that has allowed state governors to take the lead in what Konyndyk called the birth of \u201c50-state anarchy\u201d. One of the few proactive measures taken by Trump was to impose a partial travel ban on China and Europe. Scientists told him the move would only delay the advance of Covid-19 in the US, it could never stop it. Again, he didn\u2019t listen. \u201cTrump thought in terms of a wall.

As a result, the US lost the early potential to contain the virus, either by locking down hotspots as China did with Hubei province or through aggressive testing to isolate those infected as South Korea has done. Tomas Pueyo, a Stanford-trained consultant based in California, has laid out in sobering detail how quickly the disaster is laying waste to the US. His first exploration of the subject, a data-driven plea to take the disease seriously posted on Medium in early March, received 40m views. On Wednesday he published his updated research. It shows America\u2019s curve of confirmed cases rising more steeply than that of any other country in the world. Three weeks ago, Pueyo reminds us, the US had fewer than 1,000 confirmed cases at a time when Trump was telling the world: \u201cNo, I\u2019m not concerned at all. No, I\u2019m not. No, we\u2019ve done a great job.\u201d Now it stands at almost a quarter of a million. \u201cThis is what exponential growth looks like,\u201d he said. Having hit the Democratic-controlled high-density urban centers first \u2013 San Francisco and Seattle, then New York and New Jersey, now Detroit \u2013 the virus is marching inexorably in the direction of the more rural southern and heartland states that happen to form the crucible of Trump\u2019s base. Many of those states followed the lead set by Trump and Fox News, remaining relaxed about the threat and moving astonishingly slowly to put physical distancing controls in place. Florida, under its Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, has echoed Trump\u2019s approach and only imposed a statewide stay-at-home order on Friday despite having the sixth-largest tally of confirmed cases in the country. Georgia and Mississippi followed suit. Some Republican states including Oklahoma and South Carolina still have no statewide mandatory stay-at-home orders. Pueyo points out that Republican voters are additionally vulnerable as they have a higher age profile than Democratic voters. Coronavirus makes no distinctions as to party, but it does prey on the elderly. So it is one of the great paradoxes of Trump\u2019s pandemic that he may have put many of his own loyal supporters in mortal peril. As Konyndyk put it: \u201cTrump has endangered his own supporters by sending out a message in contradiction to the science, and they believed him.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The New South Wales health minister, Brad Hazzard, has defended the role of health experts who allowed 2,700 passengers to disembark the Ruby Princess cruise ship and make their own way home, following reports that authorities knew about the widespread respiratory sickness on board. As recriminations about the Ruby Princess saga continued on Saturday, the NSW police conducted the largest maritime operation in Sydney Harbour outside of wartime to move crew and supplies between a series of stranded cruise ships before they depart Australian waters. NSW Health has confirmed it had been aware of 104 people with \u201cacute respiratory infections\u201d on the Ruby Princess before it docked in Sydney. Leaked emails show the ship\u2019s doctor told authorities on 18 March that people who had presented at the onboard medical clinic with flu-like symptoms had tested negative for influenza. Yet on 19 March about 2,700 passengers were allowed to depart the ship at Sydney\u2019s Circular Quay and travel onward, before test swabs had been analysed by state health authorities, who had considered the ship a \u201clow risk\u201d of carrying coronavirus. A total of 662 people linked to the cruise ship have been infected with Covid-19 and seven passengers have died. The NSW opposition leader, Jodi McKay, has described the incident as one of the most significant health failures in the state\u2019s history and called on Hazzard to stand down. During a heated press conference appearance on Saturday, the health minister faced aggressive questioning about the government\u2019s handling of the Ruby Princess. \u201cCan I just say that the experts who made the decision were the best in the world,\u201d Hazzard said. \u201cEach of the staff of the chief health officer who made the decision made it to the best of their ability. And those people are experts in their field.\u201d The NSW chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, said those who had died had all contracted the virus on board, and that authorities believed it might have spread through the ship from infected crew members preparing food. Sources familiar with ship said crew rarely disembarked and that the infection would have likely been brought on board by a passenger. Chant said that if NSW Health had known that coronavirus was on board the ship, they would have disembarked the passengers differently and moved them directly to self-isolation. But she said that would have only prevented 11 known cases of the virus that were subsequently spread within the community. \u201cCases that we could have averted by decanting people in a more ordered way with face masks and taking them directly to their homes, would have been in the order of 11,\u201d Chant said. \u201cThe people that have acquired their infection on the cruise ship could not have been avoided and every period of time that people were on that cruise ship, there were actually at risk of more transmission on the cruise ship in a very, vulnerable age group.\u201d NSW Health has said the rapid influenza tests conducted onboard the Ruby Princess often return false negative results and that it believed \u201cthe illness and test results identified on board was consistent with influenza\u201d. Guardian Australia understands crew members on four Royal Caribbean ships \u2013 Celebrity Solstice, Ovation of the Seas, Voyager of the Seas and Spectrum of the Seas \u2013 are being sorted into groups according to their country of origin before the ships depart Australian waters. NSW police said these ships would return to their home ports, though maritime sources say that is unlikely as most are \u201cflag of convenience\u201d vessels registered in the Bahamas. Crew members who remain onboard are mostly Indonesian, Indian, Sri Lankan and Filipino. At least two of those ships \u2013 Voyager of the Seas and Celebrity Solstice \u2013 have been linked to fatal Covid-19 cases. Documents seen by Guardian Australia show almost 800 crew members from Celebrity Solstice were transferred to two separate ships, the Ovation of the Seas and Voyager of the Seas, under police escort. More than 600 crew members were transferred from the Ovation of the Seas to Spectrum of the Seas. Maritime sector sources told Guardian Australia many crew members stuck aboard those ships were \u201cfrightened\u201d and believed they were being separated in order to be returned to their countries of origin. Crew members have expressed concerns that the effect of the transfers will be to spread the contagion across several ships. In a statement, NSW police marine area commander Steve Hegarty said the operation has been planned for several days. \u201cNSW Police has been instrumental in facilitating the movement of more than 750,000 tonnes of shipping through the Port of Sydney over about a 30-hour period,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be the largest peacetime maritime operation undertaken in Sydney Harbour and has relied on the cooperation of Royal Caribbean cruise line and the Port Authority of NSW to ensure its success.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>A healthcare worker in north-west London quit her job after she was refused permission to wear a protective face mask, the Guardian has learned.</p> \n<p>In her resignation letter (below), Tracy Brennan chastised her superiors at Hillingdon Hospitals NHS foundation trust for forbidding her from wearing a surgical mask she had bought to protect herself \u2013 and the patients she was caring for \u2013 from contracting the deadly virus.</p> \n<p>Brennan, a healthcare assistant, which is also sometimes referred to as an auxiliary nurse, said she had returned to work after self-isolating for 14 days because her daughter had shown symptoms of Covid-19. She said that patients in the ward where she was working, which was not a coronavirus treatment ward, felt comfortable with her wearing the surgical mask and some positively encouraged her to do so.</p> \n<p>She wrote in the letter: \u201cUpon arriving to work on Tuesday morning, whilst still wearing a mask, you asked me for a word in your office. You outlined to me that wearing a mask wasn\u2019t following the trust policy and asked me to remove it. I responded stating that I wasn\u2019t pleased with this instruction and defended myself stating that I was uncomfortable not wearing a mask while dealing with patients who may be carriers of Covid, however I adhered to the request.\u201d</p> \n<p>She said that later that day, while taking blood, a patient coughed into her unprotected face but, despite relaying details of the incident, she was still refused permission to wear her mask.</p> \n<p>Brennan wrote: \u201cWith a heavy heart and sadness, I feel I have no alternative but to hand this letter in as my formal resignation and will be unable to work my notice due to not being allowed to wear sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) for the duties I perform.\u201d</p> \n<p>NHS England has insisted that lack of PPE is down to distribution problems rather than shortages, but many remain sceptical. On Friday, a group of organisations including Doctors in Unite and the Doctors\u2019 Association UK issued a demand that the government repurpose industry to produce adequate quantities of PPE, including face masks, preferably to the highest specification.</p> \n<p>A spokesman for the Hillingdon trust said: \u201cOur trust takes the safety of all our staff extremely seriously and we follow national guidelines, as set out by Public Health England. We regularly update staff on the types of PPE and the rules for its use ... We are also providing extra support to our staff during the current emergency both for their physical and their mental health and wellbeing.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Department of Health and Social Care said: \u201cIn the past two weeks the NHS supply chain have delivered 397m pieces of PPE equipment. While we are confident that enough supply is now reaching the frontline, we appreciate there were limited distribution problems to begin with while we dealt with a new demand caused by this emerging epidemic.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Tracy Brennan\u2019s letter</h2> \n<p>I am writing to inform you of the recent issues \u2026 over the last two days. As you are aware, I have been in self-isolation for the past 14 days due to my daughter having symptoms of Covid-19 and, upon returning to work, I have attempted to wear a surgical mask, which I have supplied myself. The reason for wearing the mask is to reduce the risk of me potentially spreading the virus to patients and colleagues whilst also protecting myself from contracting the virus from said patients and colleagues.</p> \n<p>Whilst carrying out my duties on Monday, I made sure to ask the patients if they felt comfortable with me wearing the protective mask and all gave their consent, with some also stating that they felt more comfortable with me wearing it due to being in such close proximity.</p> \n<p>Upon arriving to work on Tuesday morning, whilst still wearing a mask, you asked me for a word in your office. You outlined to me that wearing a mask wasn\u2019t following the trust policy and asked me to remove it. I responded stating that I wasn\u2019t pleased with this instruction and defended myself stating that I was uncomfortable not wearing a mask while dealing with patients who may be carriers of Covid, however I adhered to the request.</p> \n<p>Later that day, whilst taking blood from one of our patients, they accidentally coughed in my face. I told you what had just happened, however, you informed me I was still unable to wear my mask.</p> \n<p>With a heavy heart and sadness. I feel I have no alternative but to hand his letter in as my formal resignation and will be unable to work my notice due to not being allowed to wear sufficient PPE for the duties I perform. I love my job and have loved working with you and the girls in the ward and miss you all dearly.</p> \n<p>Please keep safe in these troubling times.</p> \n<p>Yours sincerely,</p> \n<p>Tracy Brennan</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0d8291fe-d266-465d-b612-0d0837e08565\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/juts-IbPAeM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

      "bodyText": "A healthcare worker in north-west London quit her job after she was refused permission to wear a protective face mask, the Guardian has learned. In her resignation letter (below), Tracy Brennan chastised her superiors at Hillingdon Hospitals NHS foundation trust for forbidding her from wearing a surgical mask she had bought to protect herself \u2013 and the patients she was caring for \u2013 from contracting the deadly virus. Brennan, a healthcare assistant, which is also sometimes referred to as an auxiliary nurse, said she had returned to work after self-isolating for 14 days because her daughter had shown symptoms of Covid-19. She said that patients in the ward where she was working, which was not a coronavirus treatment ward, felt comfortable with her wearing the surgical mask and some positively encouraged her to do so. She wrote in the letter: \u201cUpon arriving to work on Tuesday morning, whilst still wearing a mask, you asked me for a word in your office. You outlined to me that wearing a mask wasn\u2019t following the trust policy and asked me to remove it. I responded stating that I wasn\u2019t pleased with this instruction and defended myself stating that I was uncomfortable not wearing a mask while dealing with patients who may be carriers of Covid, however I adhered to the request.\u201d She said that later that day, while taking blood, a patient coughed into her unprotected face but, despite relaying details of the incident, she was still refused permission to wear her mask. Brennan wrote: \u201cWith a heavy heart and sadness, I feel I have no alternative but to hand this letter in as my formal resignation and will be unable to work my notice due to not being allowed to wear sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) for the duties I perform.\u201d NHS England has insisted that lack of PPE is down to distribution problems rather than shortages, but many remain sceptical. On Friday, a group of organisations including Doctors in Unite and the Doctors\u2019 Association UK issued a demand that the government repurpose industry to produce adequate quantities of PPE, including face masks, preferably to the highest specification. A spokesman for the Hillingdon trust said: \u201cOur trust takes the safety of all our staff extremely seriously and we follow national guidelines, as set out by Public Health England. We regularly update staff on the types of PPE and the rules for its use ... We are also providing extra support to our staff during the current emergency both for their physical and their mental health and wellbeing.\u201d The Department of Health and Social Care said: \u201cIn the past two weeks the NHS supply chain have delivered 397m pieces of PPE equipment. While we are confident that enough supply is now reaching the frontline, we appreciate there were limited distribution problems to begin with while we dealt with a new demand caused by this emerging epidemic.\u201d Tracy Brennan\u2019s letter I am writing to inform you of the recent issues \u2026 over the last two days. As you are aware, I have been in self-isolation for the past 14 days due to my daughter having symptoms of Covid-19 and, upon returning to work, I have attempted to wear a surgical mask, which I have supplied myself. The reason for wearing the mask is to reduce the risk of me potentially spreading the virus to patients and colleagues whilst also protecting myself from contracting the virus from said patients and colleagues. Whilst carrying out my duties on Monday, I made sure to ask the patients if they felt comfortable with me wearing the protective mask and all gave their consent, with some also stating that they felt more comfortable with me wearing it due to being in such close proximity. Upon arriving to work on Tuesday morning, whilst still wearing a mask, you asked me for a word in your office. You outlined to me that wearing a mask wasn\u2019t following the trust policy and asked me to remove it. I responded stating that I wasn\u2019t pleased with this instruction and defended myself stating that I was uncomfortable not wearing a mask while dealing with patients who may be carriers of Covid, however I adhered to the request. Later that day, whilst taking blood from one of our patients, they accidentally coughed in my face. I told you what had just happened, however, you informed me I was still unable to wear my mask. With a heavy heart and sadness. I feel I have no alternative but to hand his letter in as my formal resignation and will be unable to work my notice due to not being allowed to wear sufficient PPE for the duties I perform. I love my job and have loved working with you and the girls in the ward and miss you all dearly. Please keep safe in these troubling times. Yours sincerely, Tracy Brennan",

OK?\u201d</p> <p>Trump went on. Karl, he said, was \u201ca wise guy\u201d too.</p> <p>What viewers may not have known is that the two men go way back.</p> <p>They first met in 1994 when Karl was a cub reporter at the <a href=\"https://nypost.com/\">New York Post </a>and Trump, a millionaire property developer, gave him a tour of Trump Tower, where newly married couple Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley were staying. The result was a front-page scoop: \u201cInside Michael\u2019s Honeymoon Hideaway\u201d.</p> <p>Now president of the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association, Karl recounts the episode both at the start of his new book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Front-Row-at-Trump-Show/dp/1524745626\">Front Row at the Trump Show,</a> and in a phone interview with the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing that blew me away about that moment, my first real introduction to Donald Trump, was the way he understood exactly what my job was and how to make a compelling story, and the way he operated so quickly,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t going through handlers and PR advisers and spokespeople. It was Donald Trump: \u2018Come on over, let me show you what I got.\u2019 There was no filter. It was him and he was incredibly, in a way, charming and we had a great story and he was willing to break rules to tell it.</p> <p>\u201cThere was intense security all around, keeping the press at bay, and here\u2019s Donald Trump bringing me right up to Michael\u2019s apartment, showing me their secret vehicle to get in and out of the place. He didn\u2019t play it the way it\u2019s normally played.\u201d</p> <p>Karl, 52, adds: \u201cI knew that I could call him from that point on whenever I wanted to and he would be accessible and willing to play along and loved to be in the mix. The idea that I would go on to become a White House reporter, president of the White House Correspondents Association, and he would be the president is kind of mind-blowing.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s gut instinct for publicity and reptilian genius for making media weather would be evident in his 2016 election campaign and throughout his presidency. The White House press secretary\u2019s daily briefing was killed off and replaced by \u201cchopper talk\u201d, before Trump boarded Marine One on the South Lawn. He has turned the daily coronavirus updates into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/24/donald-trump-coronavirus-briefings-2020-campaign-rallies\">a new form of campaign rally.</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9b8f7b89de3504d9a78b540e44dbfc24e7a431d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b8f7b89de3504d9a78b540e44dbfc24e7a431d6/0_289_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Karl with Sarah Sanders, then White House press secretary, at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Karl with Sarah Sanders, then White House press secretary, at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Karl reflects: \u201cWe\u2019ve had three White House press secretaries, we\u2019ve had \u2013 I guess depends on how you count \u2013 three or four communications directors in the Trump White House, but in reality we\u2019ve really only had one. Donald Trump has always been the press secretary, the spokesperson, the communications director for Donald Trump. That was true in 1994 when I first encountered him and it\u2019s absolutely true in 2020.\u201d</p> <p>Karl finds himself promoting a book in the middle of a pandemic. He has been doing TV interviews from remote locations. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XwIwwG0u_E\">Stephen Colbert teased him</a> for speaking from a home office where his Emmy awards were prominently displayed.</p> <p>One of Karl\u2019s most memorable anecdotes is about 10 November 2016. It has become a commonplace to quote the musical Hamilton\u2019s song The Room Where It Happens but Karl was genuinely in there, witnessing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/10/barack-obama-donald-trump-white-house-meeting-transition\">the Oval Office meeting</a> between President Barack Obama and President-elect Trump (and snapping a few photos from 5ft away). And this collision of matter and anti-matter produced a surprise.</p> <p>\u201cIt was the first time that I saw what seemed to be a humbled Donald Trump,\u201d Karl recalls. \u201cHe seemed to be taken with the moment. I was almost imagining he\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, my God, what did I get myself into?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cNobody thought he was going to win. I don\u2019t think he really thought he was going to win and here he was in the Oval Office, a place where he was gonna be returning in just a short period of time as the president and all the weight of all that meant and the problems he was gonna be dealing with and the responsibility he was going to have.</p> <p>\u201cHe seemed humbled. He seemed a little bit freaked out. Now, that didn\u2019t last: we never saw that look again, really. That was a fleeting moment but it really struck me.\u201d</p> <p>When Trump was asked if he intended to ask Obama or any of his other predecessors for advice on dealing with the coronavirus crisis, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-8/\">he replied:</a> \u201cI don\u2019t want to disturb them, bother them. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to learn much. And, you know, I guess you could say that there\u2019s probably a natural inclination not to call.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Enemy of the people\u2019</h2> <p>For more than three years, Karl has been on Trump\u2019s trail, even receiving a hug from Kanye West in the Oval Office. He has also witnessed Trump\u2019s war on the media with barbs such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/07/donald-trump-war-on-the-media-oppo-research\">\u201cthe enemy of the people\u201d</a> \u2013 a phrase which, Karl notes, the Nazis used in 1934. So what message does it send to the rest of the world?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6103cd901482fe2f6f7d3b3b20b342eca0fedb61\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6103cd901482fe2f6f7d3b3b20b342eca0fedb61/62_525_3187_1913/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A famous confrontation between the president and Jim Acosta of CNN, at the White House in November 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A famous confrontation between the president and Jim Acosta of CNN at the White House in November 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI think it is deeply disturbing that you have authoritarian leaders around the world who shut down a free press, jail reporters and potentially even worse and do so invoking the words of the American president. So you see Erdo\u011fan and Putin. You see it\u2019s been documented in Kazakhstan and in Egypt. You see authoritarian leaders echoing the precise words of Donald Trump, talking about \u2018fake news\u2019 as reporters are thrown in jail.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/11/the-enemy-of-the-people-review-cnn-jim-acosta-trump\">The Enemy of the People review: CNN's Jim Acosta takes Trump's bait again</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe other thing that I think is really troubling is when the president calls real news \u2018fake news\u2019, when he suggests that the act of being an aggressive reporter is \u2018treasonous\u2019, it has undermined the faith in an independent free press among a significant segment of the population. That\u2019s a big problem. I do worry about that a lot.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s use of the bully pulpit for his daily coronavirus briefings has led to renewed calls for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/us-coronavirus-outbreak-donald-trump-media-latest\">press corps to be more combative.</a> In his book, however, Karl cautions against reporters behaving like a political opposition or the anti-Trump \u201cresistance\u201d.</p> <p>He explains: \u201cThere is a breathlessly negative tone to a lot of the news coverage of Trump and Trump\u2019s provided ample material to fuel that, but what happens is a segment of the population sees it and tunes it all out. It all becomes noise and everything is the outrage of the day and then it\u2019s hard to differentiate between a real outrage and an outrage that is maybe not as important.</p> <p>\u201cI mention the case of one CNN reporter literally getting up on live television and saying reporters should be protesting the president in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/wash/dc30.htm\">Lafayette Square.</a> We are not protesters. We are not the resistance. We need to report on a president fairly and objectively and a lot of that\u2019s going to end up being negative.\u201d</p> <p>He adds: \u201cYour north star is to provide objective and balanced news and let\u2019s remember that this president has branded the news media as the opposition party, so when those working for mainstream news organisations act like the opposition party, you\u2019re actually playing right into his media strategy.\u201d</p> <p>Karl\u2019s book draws on fresh research and interviews, including with John Kelly, the former White House chief of staff. In 2017, Karl writes, Kelly had to talk the national security adviser, HR McMaster, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/jonathan-karl-front-row-at-the-trump-show-kelly-venezuela-e9025e17-8486-47d2-abdf-16d771877812.html\">out of passing on the president\u2019s order</a> for a Venezuela war plan to the Pentagon.</p> <p>Now, however, as Trump faces the biggest test of his life, most voices of restraint are gone.</p> <p>Karl says: \u201cUp until this moment he\u2019s had a series of people in the White House who have tried to steer him or put some guardrails up. John Kelly made the most aggressive effort to try to protect Donald Trump from his most destructive tendencies.</p> <p>\u201cIt is all Donald Trump right now and I think that\u2019s potentially dangerous. Any president, no matter how competent, needs to have strong advisers. He\u2019s got the medical people that are advising him on this, sure, but those are not on his West Wing staff there.</p> <p>\u201cThis is truly Donald Trump calling all the shots and doing it by his gut instinct. So I think that is potentially worrisome, as is the way the truth has been undermined, the credibility of the White House and also the credibility of the press corps that he\u2019s tried so hard to undermine.

      "bodyText": "At a White House briefing late last month, Jonathan Karl asked what he regarded as the fundamental question that day, about the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cAnd everybody who needs one will be able to get a ventilator?\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s reply was probably the strangest Karl, ABC News\u2019s chief White House correspondent, has ever received from a US president. \u201cLook,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t be a cutie pie. OK?\u201d Trump went on. Karl, he said, was \u201ca wise guy\u201d too. What viewers may not have known is that the two men go way back. They first met in 1994 when Karl was a cub reporter at the New York Post and Trump, a millionaire property developer, gave him a tour of Trump Tower, where newly married couple Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley were staying. The result was a front-page scoop: \u201cInside Michael\u2019s Honeymoon Hideaway\u201d. Now president of the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association, Karl recounts the episode both at the start of his new book, Front Row at the Trump Show, and in a phone interview with the Guardian. \u201cThe thing that blew me away about that moment, my first real introduction to Donald Trump, was the way he understood exactly what my job was and how to make a compelling story, and the way he operated so quickly,\u201d he says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t going through handlers and PR advisers and spokespeople. It was Donald Trump: \u2018Come on over, let me show you what I got.\u2019 There was no filter. It was him and he was incredibly, in a way, charming and we had a great story and he was willing to break rules to tell it. \u201cThere was intense security all around, keeping the press at bay, and here\u2019s Donald Trump bringing me right up to Michael\u2019s apartment, showing me their secret vehicle to get in and out of the place. He didn\u2019t play it the way it\u2019s normally played.\u201d Karl, 52, adds: \u201cI knew that I could call him from that point on whenever I wanted to and he would be accessible and willing to play along and loved to be in the mix. The idea that I would go on to become a White House reporter, president of the White House Correspondents Association, and he would be the president is kind of mind-blowing.\u201d Trump\u2019s gut instinct for publicity and reptilian genius for making media weather would be evident in his 2016 election campaign and throughout his presidency. The White House press secretary\u2019s daily briefing was killed off and replaced by \u201cchopper talk\u201d, before Trump boarded Marine One on the South Lawn. He has turned the daily coronavirus updates into a new form of campaign rally. Karl reflects: \u201cWe\u2019ve had three White House press secretaries, we\u2019ve had \u2013 I guess depends on how you count \u2013 three or four communications directors in the Trump White House, but in reality we\u2019ve really only had one. Donald Trump has always been the press secretary, the spokesperson, the communications director for Donald Trump. That was true in 1994 when I first encountered him and it\u2019s absolutely true in 2020.\u201d Karl finds himself promoting a book in the middle of a pandemic. He has been doing TV interviews from remote locations. Stephen Colbert teased him for speaking from a home office where his Emmy awards were prominently displayed. One of Karl\u2019s most memorable anecdotes is about 10 November 2016. It has become a commonplace to quote the musical Hamilton\u2019s song The Room Where It Happens but Karl was genuinely in there, witnessing the Oval Office meeting between President Barack Obama and President-elect Trump (and snapping a few photos from 5ft away). And this collision of matter and anti-matter produced a surprise. \u201cIt was the first time that I saw what seemed to be a humbled Donald Trump,\u201d Karl recalls. \u201cHe seemed to be taken with the moment. I was almost imagining he\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, my God, what did I get myself into?\u2019 \u201cNobody thought he was going to win. I don\u2019t think he really thought he was going to win and here he was in the Oval Office, a place where he was gonna be returning in just a short period of time as the president and all the weight of all that meant and the problems he was gonna be dealing with and the responsibility he was going to have. \u201cHe seemed humbled. He seemed a little bit freaked out. Now, that didn\u2019t last: we never saw that look again, really. That was a fleeting moment but it really struck me.\u201d When Trump was asked if he intended to ask Obama or any of his other predecessors for advice on dealing with the coronavirus crisis, he replied: \u201cI don\u2019t want to disturb them, bother them. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to learn much. And, you know, I guess you could say that there\u2019s probably a natural inclination not to call.\u201d \u2018Enemy of the people\u2019 For more than three years, Karl has been on Trump\u2019s trail, even receiving a hug from Kanye West in the Oval Office. He has also witnessed Trump\u2019s war on the media with barbs such as \u201cthe enemy of the people\u201d \u2013 a phrase which, Karl notes, the Nazis used in 1934. So what message does it send to the rest of the world? \u201cI think it is deeply disturbing that you have authoritarian leaders around the world who shut down a free press, jail reporters and potentially even worse and do so invoking the words of the American president. So you see Erdo\u011fan and Putin. You see it\u2019s been documented in Kazakhstan and in Egypt. You see authoritarian leaders echoing the precise words of Donald Trump, talking about \u2018fake news\u2019 as reporters are thrown in jail. \u201cThe other thing that I think is really troubling is when the president calls real news \u2018fake news\u2019, when he suggests that the act of being an aggressive reporter is \u2018treasonous\u2019, it has undermined the faith in an independent free press among a significant segment of the population. That\u2019s a big problem. I do worry about that a lot.\u201d Trump\u2019s use of the bully pulpit for his daily coronavirus briefings has led to renewed calls for the press corps to be more combative. In his book, however, Karl cautions against reporters behaving like a political opposition or the anti-Trump \u201cresistance\u201d. He explains: \u201cThere is a breathlessly negative tone to a lot of the news coverage of Trump and Trump\u2019s provided ample material to fuel that, but what happens is a segment of the population sees it and tunes it all out. It all becomes noise and everything is the outrage of the day and then it\u2019s hard to differentiate between a real outrage and an outrage that is maybe not as important. \u201cI mention the case of one CNN reporter literally getting up on live television and saying reporters should be protesting the president in Lafayette Square. We are not protesters. We are not the resistance. We need to report on a president fairly and objectively and a lot of that\u2019s going to end up being negative.\u201d He adds: \u201cYour north star is to provide objective and balanced news and let\u2019s remember that this president has branded the news media as the opposition party, so when those working for mainstream news organisations act like the opposition party, you\u2019re actually playing right into his media strategy.\u201d Karl\u2019s book draws on fresh research and interviews, including with John Kelly, the former White House chief of staff. In 2017, Karl writes, Kelly had to talk the national security adviser, HR McMaster, out of passing on the president\u2019s order for a Venezuela war plan to the Pentagon. Now, however, as Trump faces the biggest test of his life, most voices of restraint are gone. Karl says: \u201cUp until this moment he\u2019s had a series of people in the White House who have tried to steer him or put some guardrails up. John Kelly made the most aggressive effort to try to protect Donald Trump from his most destructive tendencies. \u201cIt is all Donald Trump right now and I think that\u2019s potentially dangerous. Any president, no matter how competent, needs to have strong advisers. He\u2019s got the medical people that are advising him on this, sure, but those are not on his West Wing staff there. \u201cThis is truly Donald Trump calling all the shots and doing it by his gut instinct. So I think that is potentially worrisome, as is the way the truth has been undermined, the credibility of the White House and also the credibility of the press corps that he\u2019s tried so hard to undermine. Both of those things make this crisis harder to deal with day to day.\u201d \u2018An exhausting story\u2019 As the title of his book implies, Karl already had a front-row seat to history, reporting on the most peculiar president of this or any other age. Now there is a once-in-a-century global pandemic added to the mix. What a time to be alive. Is a part of him secretly enjoying the daily adrenaline rush? \u201cIt\u2019s an exhausting story,\u201d he says, suddenly sounding weary. \u201cYes, there is something rewarding about people wanting to know the story and the interest and the fascination in it, but it\u2019s exhausting and some of it\u2019s truly been troubling.\u201d He elaborates: \u201cI think, especially in light of what we\u2019re seeing with this pandemic, there is something very dangerous that is unfolding here. \u201cWe\u2019re at a point where nearly half the country doesn\u2019t believe what this president and White House says and we have nearly half the rest of the country that\u2019s been told not to believe what they see in a newspaper or see in television news or any other form of mainstream news. \u201cThat\u2019s a deeply troubling, deeply dangerous place to be where there isn\u2019t a shared agreement and sense of some basic facts, especially now where reliable information, and believing you have reliable information, can literally be a matter of life and death.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Day Whatever: as a regular part of my lockdown routine, I now set aside 30 minutes each day to consider the possibility that I have coronavirus. This involves feeling my forehead with the back of my hand while swallowing repeatedly to see if it hurts or not. They say the virus can cause symptoms so mild you might not even notice you have it. I think: <em>I would notice</em>.</p> <p>Two weeks ago I was looking in horror at TV footage of people streaming into Richmond Park, and thinking: <em>I hope you can\u2019t see my car in that</em>. Yes, I was there. But we didn\u2019t go to the park in order to join a mass infection gathering, and I don\u2019t think anyone else did, either. We went to Richmond Park because it\u2019s huge. It\u2019s unfortunate that thousands of people had the same idea.</p> <p>Since then I have not ventured beyond my front gate. My wife leaves the house early every morning to walk the dog in some undisclosed location, but I don\u2019t go along. She still manages about 10,000 steps a day during the crisis. I do about 250, and that\u2019s only because I forget where I put things.</p> <p>It is a warm afternoon; not a bad day, all in all, for enforced sequestration. With the door of my office shed open, voices occasionally reach me from afar \u2013 from gardens, or from the street out front. It\u2019s partly due to the absence of other noise \u2013 no cars, no construction, no planes, no background school-playground shrieking \u2013 and partly, I think, because everybody is projecting their chat across a two-metre safety gap. I can\u2019t always make out the words, but I know what they\u2019re saying. If I overhear a conversation about something other than the lockdown, I know it\u2019s the Archers leaking from an open window.</p> <p>Every day, at about five, I walk across the garden to the kitchen, where my oldest son is invariably sitting at the table, fist on forehead, gazing into his phone.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d I say. We discuss the stupid thing that Donald Trump just said, and then I show him some viral videos that he has already seen. The youngest one walks in.</p> <p>\u201cDid you hear what Trump said?\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d says the oldest.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe how he was all like \u2013\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe heard it!\u201d says the oldest.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, we heard it,\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cAll right, yeesh,\u201d says the youngest. My wife walks in.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s for supper?\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t really care.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re strangely spoilt for choice,\u201d I say, staring into the fridge. \u201cWe really need to start eating some of this stuff.\u201d</p> <p>I walk across the room to my case of wine.

      "bodyText": "Day Whatever: as a regular part of my lockdown routine, I now set aside 30 minutes each day to consider the possibility that I have coronavirus. This involves feeling my forehead with the back of my hand while swallowing repeatedly to see if it hurts or not. They say the virus can cause symptoms so mild you might not even notice you have it. I think: I would notice. Two weeks ago I was looking in horror at TV footage of people streaming into Richmond Park, and thinking: I hope you can\u2019t see my car in that. Yes, I was there. But we didn\u2019t go to the park in order to join a mass infection gathering, and I don\u2019t think anyone else did, either. We went to Richmond Park because it\u2019s huge. It\u2019s unfortunate that thousands of people had the same idea. Since then I have not ventured beyond my front gate. My wife leaves the house early every morning to walk the dog in some undisclosed location, but I don\u2019t go along. She still manages about 10,000 steps a day during the crisis. I do about 250, and that\u2019s only because I forget where I put things. It is a warm afternoon; not a bad day, all in all, for enforced sequestration. With the door of my office shed open, voices occasionally reach me from afar \u2013 from gardens, or from the street out front. It\u2019s partly due to the absence of other noise \u2013 no cars, no construction, no planes, no background school-playground shrieking \u2013 and partly, I think, because everybody is projecting their chat across a two-metre safety gap. I can\u2019t always make out the words, but I know what they\u2019re saying. If I overhear a conversation about something other than the lockdown, I know it\u2019s the Archers leaking from an open window. Every day, at about five, I walk across the garden to the kitchen, where my oldest son is invariably sitting at the table, fist on forehead, gazing into his phone. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d I say. We discuss the stupid thing that Donald Trump just said, and then I show him some viral videos that he has already seen. The youngest one walks in. \u201cDid you hear what Trump said?\u201d he says. \u201cYes,\u201d I say. \u201cYes,\u201d says the oldest. \u201cI can\u2019t believe how he was all like \u2013\u201d \u201cWe heard it!\u201d says the oldest. \u201cYeah, we heard it,\u201d I say. \u201cAll right, yeesh,\u201d says the youngest. My wife walks in. \u201cWhat\u2019s for supper?\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t really care.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re strangely spoilt for choice,\u201d I say, staring into the fridge. \u201cWe really need to start eating some of this stuff.\u201d I walk across the room to my case of wine. When I pull back the cardboard flaps, I see that there is only one bottle left. I pull it out and hold it up. \u201cOh dear,\u201d my wife says. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how this could happen,\u201d I say. \u201cWe have, like, a six-month supply of pistachios, but we\u2019re out of wine?\u201d But I do know how it happened.

When he ran for re-election in 2014, his more liberal primary opponent, Zephyr Teachout, became a national progressive icon for challenging the establishment-aligned Cuomo. In 2018, when Cuomo ran again, he faced another challenge from his left, that time from the former Sex and the City star Cynthia Nixon, who became the darling of liberals hoping to oust the incumbent governor.</p> <p>The common liberal critique of Cuomo is that his administration has been <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2020/03/29/not-for-first-time-a-governor-named-cuomo-casts-an-election-year-shadow-1269546\">rife with corruption</a> and his agenda has been too deferential to centrists and the right.</p> <p>\u201cThe Democratic party has spent the past two decades moving away from its New Deal values and refusing to unequivocally stand up for working people \u2013 and Governor Cuomo embodies this shift to the center,\u201d said Monica Klein, a New York-based progressive Democratic strategist.</p> <p>\u201cThe governor has consistently led New York as a corporate Democrat \u2013 slashing funding for hospitals, public schools and affordable housing instead of raising taxes on the wealthy.

He has known Trump for years. His personal life has been the subject of local and national scrutiny. His first marriage was to Kerry Kennedy, a daughter of the late Robert F Kennedy.

The common liberal critique of Cuomo is that his administration has been rife with corruption and his agenda has been too deferential to centrists and the right. \u201cThe Democratic party has spent the past two decades moving away from its New Deal values and refusing to unequivocally stand up for working people \u2013 and Governor Cuomo embodies this shift to the center,\u201d said Monica Klein, a New York-based progressive Democratic strategist. \u201cThe governor has consistently led New York as a corporate Democrat \u2013 slashing funding for hospitals, public schools and affordable housing instead of raising taxes on the wealthy. If Democrats want to take back the White House, we need to once again become the party for working people \u2013 and leaders like Cuomo are doing the exact opposite,\u201d Klein added. Cuomo is certainly party establishment. He is the son of the former New York governor Mario Cuomo, who memorably decided against running for president at the last moment in 1992. He has known Trump for years. His personal life has been the subject of local and national scrutiny. His first marriage was to Kerry Kennedy, a daughter of the late Robert F Kennedy. Cuomo\u2019s romances and breakups have been documented in the New York and national press (including more recently his breakup with longtime partner and Food Network star Sandra Lee). These days, Cuomo\u2019s prominence has earned him a new level of attention. His press conferences have even sparked speculation around the internet over whether he sports a nipple ring. But it is Cuomo\u2019s actions that have won him acclaim. He has taken an everything-and-the-kitchen-sink approach to fighting the virus. He has pleaded for more ventilators, worked with the federal government, issued strict edicts on isolating, and talked with business leaders privately. Despite all the praise and attention, however, and mutterings over White House ambition, Cuomo has solidly stuck with supporting Biden. When his brother asked him on CNN if he was thinking about running for president, Cuomo kept saying no. \u201cNo. No. The answer\u2019s no,\u201d Cuomo responded curtly.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Music</strong></h2> <p>Back in the music industry\u2019s 1990s boom, when tenner-a-pop CD sales were skyrocketing, going on tour was a good way of shifting more product. After digital piracy burst that bubble in the early 2000s, however, touring became more of a financial necessity, creating a new, lopsided business model only accentuated in recent years by the rise of subscription streaming services. With gigs and festivals essentially banned under new measures to stave off the spread of coronavirus, how can we help artists who can no longer tour?</p> <p>Readers of a certain age will remember the thrill of holding an album in their hands but, guess what? They still make physical product! Vinyl sales are booming, you can still buy CDs and \u2013 in nostalgia news \u2013 cassettes are back, too. If there is nothing that immediately takes your fancy, maybe buy a voucher from an independent online retailer for later. Or, if your favourite act has recently put out a not-at-that-price lavish box set, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/bjork\">Bj\u00f6rk</a>\u2019s Utopia collection featuring 14 handmade bird call flutes, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/depeche-mode\">Depeche Mode</a>\u2019s MODE, in which all 14 of their albums come housed in an elegant black cube, now might be the best time to treat yourself to a day\u2019s worth of B-sides, remixes and forgotten radio sessions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cea8e7fb0d39be80d61bc00068c971c88fea6580\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cea8e7fb0d39be80d61bc00068c971c88fea6580/141_167_847_847/500.jpg\" alt=\"Bjork\u2019s Utopia flutes\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wind power\u2026 Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s Utopia flutes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Record company handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The rise in touring has also meant a rise in merch, most of which is readily available directly from artist\u2019s official websites, and has evolved to include not just T-shirts and caps, but tote bags (lo-fi pop experimentalists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/08/girl-ray-girl-review-moshi-moshi\">Girl Ray</a> have a particularly fetching pink lipstick one), pillows (including a very sweary Cupcakke one), socks adorned with Aussie DJ and producer Flume\u2019s name,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/28/fka-twigs-in-shadow-of-man-robert-pattinson-surgery-new-album-miranda-sawyer\"> FKA twigs</a> shoelaces and \u2013 with time on our hands, why not \u2013 sex toys from the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/marilyn-manson\">Marilyn Manson</a> and Sophie. Or, if your fave act is too cool for an official online shop, try Bandcamp, which only takes 10% for merch and music sales, and doesn\u2019t charge artists to upload their music in the first place (the site has also started waiving its revenue share completely on certain days to boost direct sales for artists).</p> <p>The knock-on effect for future tours and festivals looks grim, but at least with the shows that have already been postponed financial losses can be sutured if people keep hold of their tickets where possible, rather than asking for a refund from promoters that likely don\u2019t have the money any more. If classical music is more your thing, then you could spend a lockdown night at the opera (Opera North\u2019s acclaimed <a href=\"https://www.operanorth.co.uk/the-ring-cycle/\">Ring cycle is on its website</a>), or how about soothing your fears with the <a href=\"https://lso.co.uk/\">London Symphony Orchestra</a>, who are streaming full-length concerts every Sunday and Thursday evening. And, if more acts are going guerrilla and doing online \u201cgigs\u201d \u2013 as pop newcomers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/19/instagram-how-we-feeling-can-livestreaming-replace-cancelled-gigs\">L Devine</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/19/best-livestreamed-gigs-coronavirus-john-legend-chris-martin-code-orange\">Yungblud</a> have done recently \u2013 then let\u2019s all pop a dressing gown on and get involved.

Christopher Green\u2019s No Show, about a performer who would rather stay at home than perform live, streams on the web-conferencing platform Zoom in March and April. The bods behind Showstopper!

Ordinarily, most make ends meet via a tangled web of teaching gigs, squeezed funding bodies, public projects and, sometimes, selling work. Can art lovers help out?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d8a4af4167b423dca183c8a6816f70f2f09382f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8a4af4167b423dca183c8a6816f70f2f09382f1/0_0_626_1013/618.jpg\" alt=\"Lecture on Nesting by Andy Holden\" width=\"618\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lecture on Nesting by Andy Holden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Max McClure/Spike Island</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Art dealers have sold to those with deep pockets on the strength of Jpegs for a long while. So, if you are a wealthy collector, keep buying. For everyone else, the good news is that there are ways you can support artists and experience new work from the safety of your living room. Artist\u2019s prints, individually made books and other editions are often touted as a collector entry point. Art book publisher Phaidon\u2019s platform <a href=\"https://www.artspace.com/\">Artspace</a> has a bit of everything, with art historical greats for sale alongside newbies.</p> <p>Another way to help protect the system artists depend on is to buy works specially created to support not-for-profit public spaces. Cubitt, the cutting-edge gallery and artists\u2019 studios in Islington, north London, sells everything from a tote bag to a \u00a33,000 print box online. Among the editioned prints at Bristol\u2019s Spike Island, Andy Holden\u2019s Lecture on Nesting \u2013 with its cocoon-building birds \u2013 offers apt imagery for days indoors. Available through <a href=\"https://baltic.art/\">BALTIC</a> in Gateshead, top painter George Shaw\u2019s prints circle the housing estate where he grew up.</p> <p>But sales are just one part of art\u2019s fragile ecology. Spreading ideas and keeping people engaged is essential. Commercial galleries, from international big gun Pace to smaller operations such as London\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.katemacgarry.com/\">Kate MacGarry</a> are now organising shows and talks online. The charity Art UK, meanwhile, is inviting everyone to curate their own virtual exhibitions from the 216,000+ artworks it lists from the UK\u2019s public collections. For original digital art commissions, there are a few institutions that have long led the way in terms of what is achievable in the virtual world. Among the <a href=\"https://www.serpentinegalleries.org/\">Serpentine Galleries\u2019 current web projects</a>, you can navigate <a href=\"https://www.serpentinegalleries.org/exhibitions-events/suzanne-treister-survivor-f-escapist-bhst-black-hole-spacetime\">Suzanne Treister\u2019s The Escapist BHST</a> (Black Hole Space Time). With its promise of inter-dimensional travel to see painting archives in new universes via your computer screen, The Escapist \u2026 certainly feels like art for our housebound moment.</p> <p><em>SS</em></p> <h2><strong>Comedy</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0cb7080cb3af2650de38e024e97a1952c9d057ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0cb7080cb3af2650de38e024e97a1952c9d057ce/0_119_4928_2959/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Professor Brian Cox\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Home schooling\u2026 Professor Brian Cox.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicky J Sims/Getty/McIntyre</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Comedians are uniquely exposed by the outbreak. Their counterparts in theatre and music, visual art and dance have received words of support \u2013 with actions promised to follow \u2013 from the <a href=\"https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/\">Arts Council of England</a> and other organisations that exist to support them. Not so comics, whose work \u2013 individualistic, largely unregulated and mostly funded by ticket sales \u2013 is not recognised by the arts bodies.</p> <p>The flipside is that they may be more entrepreneurial than practitioners of other artforms. They are certainly well versed already in retooling their skills for digital media. The dictum about a technology only really existing once it is used to create porn could equally be said of comedy. In the time since the Covid-19 shutdown, there has been an uptick in the number of comics making material available online. If you want to help out struggling standups, look no further than NextUp, the so-called \u201cNetflix for British standup\u201d which has nearly 200 downloadable sets from the cream of fringe comedy \u2013 and shares revenue from downloads directly with performers.</p> <p>Comedian and activist Mark Thomas has launched another streaming initiative with the DVD label <a href=\"https://www.gofasterstripe.com/cgi-bin/website.cgi?page=videofull&amp;id=33812\">Go Faster Stripe</a>. Each week, a comic will have one of their standup specials broadcast for free in exchange for a donation to the crisis-relief charity the <a href=\"https://www.trusselltrust.org/\">Trussell Trust</a>. One of the acts signed up is Richard Herring, who has also contributed to NextUp\u2019s #hecklethevirus crowdfunder to help comedians stay afloat during the pandemic. At time of writing, it had raised \u00a381K of an initial \u00a3100K target.</p> <p>Trading in moral support, if not yet money, the indie comedy producers Berk\u2019s Nest and Fight in the Dog are offering advice sessions for the comedy industry using Zoom. Several of their acts, meanwhile, are likely to be appearing on Robin Ince\u2019s hastily cobbled together <a href=\"https://cosmicshambles.com/stayathome\">Stay at Home festival</a>, a daily (sometimes twice daily) livestream promising chat and entertainment from comics, scientists and artists, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/chris-hadfield\">Chris Hadfield</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sara-pascoe\">Sara Pascoe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/mark-gatiss\">Mark Gatiss</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/jo-brand\">Jo Brand</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/brian-cox\">Prof Brian Cox</a> among them.

      "bodyText": "Music Back in the music industry\u2019s 1990s boom, when tenner-a-pop CD sales were skyrocketing, going on tour was a good way of shifting more product. After digital piracy burst that bubble in the early 2000s, however, touring became more of a financial necessity, creating a new, lopsided business model only accentuated in recent years by the rise of subscription streaming services. With gigs and festivals essentially banned under new measures to stave off the spread of coronavirus, how can we help artists who can no longer tour? Readers of a certain age will remember the thrill of holding an album in their hands but, guess what? They still make physical product! Vinyl sales are booming, you can still buy CDs and \u2013 in nostalgia news \u2013 cassettes are back, too. If there is nothing that immediately takes your fancy, maybe buy a voucher from an independent online retailer for later. Or, if your favourite act has recently put out a not-at-that-price lavish box set, such as Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s Utopia collection featuring 14 handmade bird call flutes, or Depeche Mode\u2019s MODE, in which all 14 of their albums come housed in an elegant black cube, now might be the best time to treat yourself to a day\u2019s worth of B-sides, remixes and forgotten radio sessions. The rise in touring has also meant a rise in merch, most of which is readily available directly from artist\u2019s official websites, and has evolved to include not just T-shirts and caps, but tote bags (lo-fi pop experimentalists Girl Ray have a particularly fetching pink lipstick one), pillows (including a very sweary Cupcakke one), socks adorned with Aussie DJ and producer Flume\u2019s name, FKA twigs shoelaces and \u2013 with time on our hands, why not \u2013 sex toys from the likes of Marilyn Manson and Sophie. Or, if your fave act is too cool for an official online shop, try Bandcamp, which only takes 10% for merch and music sales, and doesn\u2019t charge artists to upload their music in the first place (the site has also started waiving its revenue share completely on certain days to boost direct sales for artists). The knock-on effect for future tours and festivals looks grim, but at least with the shows that have already been postponed financial losses can be sutured if people keep hold of their tickets where possible, rather than asking for a refund from promoters that likely don\u2019t have the money any more. If classical music is more your thing, then you could spend a lockdown night at the opera (Opera North\u2019s acclaimed Ring cycle is on its website), or how about soothing your fears with the London Symphony Orchestra, who are streaming full-length concerts every Sunday and Thursday evening. And, if more acts are going guerrilla and doing online \u201cgigs\u201d \u2013 as pop newcomers L Devine and Yungblud have done recently \u2013 then let\u2019s all pop a dressing gown on and get involved. A sense of community is what we need right now. MC Theatre Outside the Royal Court theatre in London, the play banner reads: \u201cBack soon\u201d. At the Battersea Arts Centre, a new sign reads: \u201cHope\u201d. Theatres have temporarily gone dark, but the response from the theatre industry has been swift, optimistic and tirelessly creative. A number of online theatrical enterprises have already emerged. The Show Must Go On will see the complete plays of Shakespeare read live on YouTube. A festival of musical concerts are to be streamed live from London\u2019s Theatre Caf\u00e9, and Notflix \u2013 featuring some of the UK\u2019s top female improvisers \u2013 will be performed on Facebook live throughout spring. Enterprising artists are moving their work online. Christopher Green\u2019s No Show, about a performer who would rather stay at home than perform live, streams on the web-conferencing platform Zoom in March and April. The bods behind Showstopper! The Improvised Musical filmed one of their last productions before the shutdown. Kieran Hurley\u2019s Bubble is streaming until 23 April: it was rehearsed and recorded on Skype, is set entirely on Facebook and is written in text-speak and emoji. Theatres are working hard to support their emerging artists. The King\u2019s Head, Papatango, Southwark Playhouse and Luton\u2019s Next Generation Youth Theatre are offering a selection of online advice sessions, workshops, play-reading clubs and choreography courses. The Bruntwood prize website includes interviews, mini-plays and live-recorded workshops by David Eldridge, Jo Clifford and Winsome Pinnock. (Bruntwood recently received an email from a woman in lockdown in Italy, delighted to be able to \u201clearn things that would otherwise be unreachable\u201d.) All the Web\u2019s a Stage will feature a variety of live performances to raise money for artists struggling during the pandemic. The BBC has launched a virtual festival of arts, and Manchester\u2019s HOME has launched a range of online theatrical experiences, including new work from Chris Thorpe and Bryony Kimmings. The National Theatre and Shakespeare\u2019s Globe have particularly brilliant online catalogues. Bloomsbury\u2019s Drama Online is a treasure trove for students, and LIVR \u2013 which provides recorded theatre in 360\u00b0 VR \u2013 is available for a subscription fee. Amazon Prime also includes a healthy selection of live-recorded theatre, including Rent, Company, Billy Elliot and Cats. And yes, it\u2019s the Elaine Paige Cats. And yes, it\u2019s heaps better than the film. MG Art When gallery doors shut, art fairs are cancelled and public space empties, survival for many artists looks tough. Ordinarily, most make ends meet via a tangled web of teaching gigs, squeezed funding bodies, public projects and, sometimes, selling work. Can art lovers help out? Art dealers have sold to those with deep pockets on the strength of Jpegs for a long while. So, if you are a wealthy collector, keep buying. For everyone else, the good news is that there are ways you can support artists and experience new work from the safety of your living room. Artist\u2019s prints, individually made books and other editions are often touted as a collector entry point. Art book publisher Phaidon\u2019s platform Artspace has a bit of everything, with art historical greats for sale alongside newbies. Another way to help protect the system artists depend on is to buy works specially created to support not-for-profit public spaces. Cubitt, the cutting-edge gallery and artists\u2019 studios in Islington, north London, sells everything from a tote bag to a \u00a33,000 print box online. Among the editioned prints at Bristol\u2019s Spike Island, Andy Holden\u2019s Lecture on Nesting \u2013 with its cocoon-building birds \u2013 offers apt imagery for days indoors. Available through BALTIC in Gateshead, top painter George Shaw\u2019s prints circle the housing estate where he grew up. But sales are just one part of art\u2019s fragile ecology. Spreading ideas and keeping people engaged is essential. Commercial galleries, from international big gun Pace to smaller operations such as London\u2019s Kate MacGarry are now organising shows and talks online. The charity Art UK, meanwhile, is inviting everyone to curate their own virtual exhibitions from the 216,000+ artworks it lists from the UK\u2019s public collections. For original digital art commissions, there are a few institutions that have long led the way in terms of what is achievable in the virtual world. Among the Serpentine Galleries\u2019 current web projects, you can navigate Suzanne Treister\u2019s The Escapist BHST (Black Hole Space Time). With its promise of inter-dimensional travel to see painting archives in new universes via your computer screen, The Escapist \u2026 certainly feels like art for our housebound moment. SS Comedy Comedians are uniquely exposed by the outbreak. Their counterparts in theatre and music, visual art and dance have received words of support \u2013 with actions promised to follow \u2013 from the Arts Council of England and other organisations that exist to support them. Not so comics, whose work \u2013 individualistic, largely unregulated and mostly funded by ticket sales \u2013 is not recognised by the arts bodies. The flipside is that they may be more entrepreneurial than practitioners of other artforms. They are certainly well versed already in retooling their skills for digital media. The dictum about a technology only really existing once it is used to create porn could equally be said of comedy. In the time since the Covid-19 shutdown, there has been an uptick in the number of comics making material available online. If you want to help out struggling standups, look no further than NextUp, the so-called \u201cNetflix for British standup\u201d which has nearly 200 downloadable sets from the cream of fringe comedy \u2013 and shares revenue from downloads directly with performers. Comedian and activist Mark Thomas has launched another streaming initiative with the DVD label Go Faster Stripe. Each week, a comic will have one of their standup specials broadcast for free in exchange for a donation to the crisis-relief charity the Trussell Trust. One of the acts signed up is Richard Herring, who has also contributed to NextUp\u2019s #hecklethevirus crowdfunder to help comedians stay afloat during the pandemic. At time of writing, it had raised \u00a381K of an initial \u00a3100K target. Trading in moral support, if not yet money, the indie comedy producers Berk\u2019s Nest and Fight in the Dog are offering advice sessions for the comedy industry using Zoom. Several of their acts, meanwhile, are likely to be appearing on Robin Ince\u2019s hastily cobbled together Stay at Home festival, a daily (sometimes twice daily) livestream promising chat and entertainment from comics, scientists and artists, Chris Hadfield, Sara Pascoe, Mark Gatiss, Jo Brand and Prof Brian Cox among them. It is free to watch, but donations are requested for \u201cperformers and venues most in need in these difficult times\u201d. BL",

Citizens stood with heads bowed, while cars, trains and ships sounded their horns, and air-raid sirens rang out. Among the 14 health workers and police declared to be remembered was Li Wenliang, the doctor who was reprimanded for \u201cspreading rumours\u201d before being exonerated. The country reported 19 new cases on Friday, most of which were linked to foreign travel, and more than 1,030 patients who are asymptomatic are under medical observation.</p> <h2>Fresh warnings on global economy</h2> <p>World Bank Group president David Malpass said the rapidly spreading pandemic was expected to cause a \u201cmajor global recession\u201d that would likely hit the poorest and most vulnerable countries the hardest. He echoed comments by the IMF\u2019s managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, who called on advanced economies to step up their efforts to help emerging markets and developing countries survive the economic and health impacts. \u201cThis is a crisis like no other,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have witnessed the world economy coming to a standstill. We are now in recession. It is way worse than the global financial crisis\u201d of 2008.</p> <h2>Trump ignores latest US health advice</h2> <p>Health officials in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/im-not-going-to-do-it-trump-refutes-his-own-administrations-advice-on-masks\">US advised Americans to cover their faces when outside</a>. But President Donald Trump has undermined the guidance, saying he can\u2019t see himself wearing one when he greets \u201cpresidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens\u201d. Melania Trump later urged everyone to take the official advice seriously.</p> <h2>UK endures deadliest day so far</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/03/uk-coronavirus-live-emergency-nightingale-hospital-opens-today-matt-hancock-covid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e8734358f087564da1e539d#block-5e8734358f087564da1e539d\">It was confirmed that 684 more people have died in UK hospitals</a>, bringing the total to 3,605 and making the 24 hours to 5pm on Thursday (BST) the deadliest since the outbreak began. The country\u2019s Department of Health and Social Care says 173,784 people have been tested; of whom 38,168 were positive.</p> <h2>US prisoners freed</h2> <p>US attorney general William Barr has issued an emergency order for the release of more federal inmates into home confinement, warning that the federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) is facing emergency conditions. Barr has given priority to vulnerable inmates housed in federal prisons that have been hardest hit by Covid-19, including facilities such as Oakdale in Louisiana, Elkton in Ohio and Danbury in Connecticut, where inmates have died.

      "bodyText": "Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: China mourns \u2018martyrs\u2019 and victims People across China paused for three minutes on Saturday morning to remember the more than 3,000 patients and medical workers who have died during the coronavirus outbreak. Citizens stood with heads bowed, while cars, trains and ships sounded their horns, and air-raid sirens rang out. Among the 14 health workers and police declared to be remembered was Li Wenliang, the doctor who was reprimanded for \u201cspreading rumours\u201d before being exonerated. The country reported 19 new cases on Friday, most of which were linked to foreign travel, and more than 1,030 patients who are asymptomatic are under medical observation. Fresh warnings on global economy World Bank Group president David Malpass said the rapidly spreading pandemic was expected to cause a \u201cmajor global recession\u201d that would likely hit the poorest and most vulnerable countries the hardest. He echoed comments by the IMF\u2019s managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, who called on advanced economies to step up their efforts to help emerging markets and developing countries survive the economic and health impacts. \u201cThis is a crisis like no other,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have witnessed the world economy coming to a standstill. We are now in recession. It is way worse than the global financial crisis\u201d of 2008. Trump ignores latest US health advice Health officials in the US advised Americans to cover their faces when outside. But President Donald Trump has undermined the guidance, saying he can\u2019t see himself wearing one when he greets \u201cpresidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens\u201d. Melania Trump later urged everyone to take the official advice seriously. UK endures deadliest day so far It was confirmed that 684 more people have died in UK hospitals, bringing the total to 3,605 and making the 24 hours to 5pm on Thursday (BST) the deadliest since the outbreak began. The country\u2019s Department of Health and Social Care says 173,784 people have been tested; of whom 38,168 were positive. US prisoners freed US attorney general William Barr has issued an emergency order for the release of more federal inmates into home confinement, warning that the federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) is facing emergency conditions. Barr has given priority to vulnerable inmates housed in federal prisons that have been hardest hit by Covid-19, including facilities such as Oakdale in Louisiana, Elkton in Ohio and Danbury in Connecticut, where inmates have died. The BOP said on Friday 91 inmates and 50 staff in its 122 institutions had fallen ill, though reports suggest the number of those affected is much higher. Falklands confirm first case The Falkland Islands government confirmed the territory\u2019s first case. The patient has been hospitalised since 31 March and developed a range of Covid-19 symptoms, tested positive for the virus, and was now in a stable condition in isolation. Crackdown in Central America Police have detained thousands across Central America for violating rules put in place by their governments to curb coronavirus transmission. Honduran authorities said about 2,250 people had been arrested for violating the curfew imposed since mid-March while Guatemalan authorities said 5,705 people had been detained for leaving their homes without justification. In Panama, more than 5,000 people have been detained in recent weeks for violating curfew rules; another 424 people have been held for not complying with recent rules that limit men and women leaving the house on alternate days. Meanwhile, in El Salvador, 712 people have been detained for failing to comply with the mandatory home quarantine decreed by President Nayib Bukele, and have been taken to containment centres.",

The anger is so raw many commentators have dismissed it as a parody, and the Guardian was unable to confirm its authenticity.</p> <p>But Airbnb\u2019s army of 700,000 hosts are distraught at the income they are losing as a result of the company\u2019s generosity to guests. <a href=\"https://www.airbnb.co.uk/d/host-message\">Chesky this week apologised</a> and said the company would spend $250m (\u00a3200m) covering 25% of what hosts would have been paid under their cancellation policies for reservations between 14 March and 31 May.</p> <p>An additional $10m relief fund is being made available to \u201csuper hosts\u201d offering grants of up to $5,000 for \u201chosts who hurt the most\u201d. Airbnb founders will also take no salary for six months, and top executives will have their salaries halved.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough it may not have felt like it, we are partners,\u201d Chesky <a href=\"https://news.airbnb.com/a-letter-to-hosts/\">said in email to hosts</a>. \u201cWhen your business suffers, our business suffers. We know that right now many of you are struggling, and what you need are actions from us to help, not just words.\u201d</p> <p>Airbnb has built up reported cash reserves of $3bn from <a href=\"https://www.airbnb.co.uk/help/article/1857/what-is-the-airbnb-service-fee\">booking fees charged to both guests and hosts</a>. It collected revenues from the fees in excess of $4.8bn last year, according to Reuters. Hosts are charged 3% of every booking, while guests are charged up to 14.2%.</p> <p>The hangover from the coronavirus pandemic is likely to last far longer than 31 May or whenever governments lift movement restrictions. Hosts report empty booking calendars stretching throughout the summer, and research by analysis website AirDNA shows bookings in some cities has fallen by as much as 96%.</p> <p>For hosts who occasionally rent out their spare room in the style of a real bed &amp; breakfast the lost Airbnb income due the coronavirus is a frustration.</p> <p>But, for those who have built up mini (or in some cases not-so-mini) property portfolios that rely on a constant stream of guests churning through Airbnb apartments in Bath, Barcelona or Berlin, the prospect of weeks or months without guests spells financial disaster.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RobCross247/status/1241325290565111808\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">64% rise in rental properties across <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dublin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Dublin</a> in midst of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Covid_19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Covid_19</a> crisis according to property website <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daftmedia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@daftmedia</a>  as landlords start withdrawing their rentals from short-term listing sites like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Airbnb?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Airbnb</a> and are offering them into the market instead.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/HousingCrisis?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#HousingCrisis</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CoronaCrisis?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CoronaCrisis</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Wfj56HaNLC\">pic.twitter.com/Wfj56HaNLC</a></p>&mdash; Rob Cross (@RobCross247) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobCross247/status/1241325290565111808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 21, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>It is also a disaster for Chesky, 38, and the large number of Airbnb\u2019s employees who hold stock options. The company was lining up for a stock market flotation this year, which some investors hoped would value the 11-year-old tech giant at up to $42bn \u2013 even though the Wall Street Journal reported the business lost nearly $320m in just the first nine months of last year.</p> <p>In a video presentation on Thursday, Chesky told staff the company had lowered its valuation to $26bn, down from $31bn when it last raised money from investors in September 2017, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/02a8ca9b-1ba9-4e0a-a3d5-084dd93469bb\">according to the Financial Times</a>.</p> <p>Airbnb employees have long been pushing executives to press ahead with an initial public offering (IPO) because stock options granted to seasoned staff start to expire in November 2020. Those shares could be worthless if the platform is not trading on the public market.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B5-xVmXlzz6/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "\u201cYou would not have an empire without us,\u201d an Airbnb host shouts down the lens in a video addressing the company\u2019s billionaire co-founder and chief executive Brian Chesky. \u201cIt\u2019s our homes on your platform. It\u2019s our face on millions of listings. It\u2019s our soul that brings the magic \u2026 It\u2019s our place that makes you money.\u201d The man in the video is pulsating with anger at Airbnb\u2019s decision to allow guests to cancel bookings for trips starting before 31 May with a full refund due to the coronavirus outbreak. The anger is so raw many commentators have dismissed it as a parody, and the Guardian was unable to confirm its authenticity. But Airbnb\u2019s army of 700,000 hosts are distraught at the income they are losing as a result of the company\u2019s generosity to guests. Chesky this week apologised and said the company would spend $250m (\u00a3200m) covering 25% of what hosts would have been paid under their cancellation policies for reservations between 14 March and 31 May. An additional $10m relief fund is being made available to \u201csuper hosts\u201d offering grants of up to $5,000 for \u201chosts who hurt the most\u201d. Airbnb founders will also take no salary for six months, and top executives will have their salaries halved. \u201cAlthough it may not have felt like it, we are partners,\u201d Chesky said in email to hosts. \u201cWhen your business suffers, our business suffers. We know that right now many of you are struggling, and what you need are actions from us to help, not just words.\u201d Airbnb has built up reported cash reserves of $3bn from booking fees charged to both guests and hosts. It collected revenues from the fees in excess of $4.8bn last year, according to Reuters. Hosts are charged 3% of every booking, while guests are charged up to 14.2%. The hangover from the coronavirus pandemic is likely to last far longer than 31 May or whenever governments lift movement restrictions. Hosts report empty booking calendars stretching throughout the summer, and research by analysis website AirDNA shows bookings in some cities has fallen by as much as 96%. For hosts who occasionally rent out their spare room in the style of a real bed &amp; breakfast the lost Airbnb income due the coronavirus is a frustration. But, for those who have built up mini (or in some cases not-so-mini) property portfolios that rely on a constant stream of guests churning through Airbnb apartments in Bath, Barcelona or Berlin, the prospect of weeks or months without guests spells financial disaster. It is also a disaster for Chesky, 38, and the large number of Airbnb\u2019s employees who hold stock options. The company was lining up for a stock market flotation this year, which some investors hoped would value the 11-year-old tech giant at up to $42bn \u2013 even though the Wall Street Journal reported the business lost nearly $320m in just the first nine months of last year. In a video presentation on Thursday, Chesky told staff the company had lowered its valuation to $26bn, down from $31bn when it last raised money from investors in September 2017, according to the Financial Times. Airbnb employees have long been pushing executives to press ahead with an initial public offering (IPO) because stock options granted to seasoned staff start to expire in November 2020. Those shares could be worthless if the platform is not trading on the public market. \u201cThey are stuffed, the IPO just can\u2019t happen,\u201d Richard Holway, chairman of analyst firm TechMarketView, said. \u201cAirbnb is in the worst of the worst situations. Unlike other tech firms, like Uber which can do deliveries instead of driving people, it can\u2019t diversify. There\u2019s nothing Airbnb can do to make money. \u201cEverything indicates that Airbnb income around the world has just stopped,\u201d he said. \u201cIt [coronavirus and lockdown] has exposed the Airbnb business model, and it\u2019s going to pull thousands and thousands of people down with it. People [hosts] have gone into it as an absolute business and they\u2019re in a very, very difficult situation.\u201d To try and make some income from their empty properties landlords have flooded the rental market with their Airbnb flats. On Edinburgh\u2019s Princes Street, for example, there are 209 Airbnb listings on a road of just 494 homes. Property portal Rightmove said the number of new rentals coming on to the market in the week the UK lockdown started increased by 45% in London, up 55% in Brighton, 62% in Edinburgh and 78% in Bath. It\u2019s a similar story the world over with a 61% increase in Dublin and 41% in Prague. Holway said many hosts are reliant on Airbnb income to pay mortgages on not one but several properties, while others \u201crent flats off commercial landlords and then seek to make a profit renting it out on short lets on Airbnb \u2013 that\u2019s not going to happen now\u201d. Sheffield based entrepreneur Alex Milburn claims to have made \u201c\u00a31,000,000 in Airbnb sales in 12 months\u201d and now markets his \u201crent to rent\u201d strategy in one-day seminars costing \u00a3997 (plus VAT). He promises, in YouTube videos, he can teach others how to make six figure sums \u201cwith very little or none of your own money\u201d. One Airbnb host rented out 881 properties in London in a single year making revenue of \u00a311.9m, according to AirDNA. The unnamed person was said to be highest-earning Airbnb landlord in the world in 2017. \u2022 This article was amended on 4 April 2020 to make clearer that hosts will receive 25% of what would have been due to them under their cancellation policies.

Not everyone needs to rush ahead with cancer treatment but others need to continue despite this to get the best long-term cure,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Sikora said: \u201cThe important thing here is people with curable cancer still get treatment. The private sector is in talks with NHS England and providers to provide increased capacity for NHS patients.\u201d<br><br>The doctor said one of his close friends who worked in gastroenterology had got an email from a nurse saying \u201cnot to bother coming in\u201d and that his treatment would be \u201cstopped for the duration of the crisis\u201d. \u201cThe emotion is very difficult for our patients ... everything is uncertain,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is a hard decision regarding how much you transfer care to coronavirus and how much say \u2018we have to keep going with vital non-urgent but critical services\u2019.

      "bodyText": "Cancer treatment has become a postcode lottery with many patients not receiving vital care as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, doctors have warned. Leading oncologists have said that even those patients in category one and two priority, the highest for continuing treatment, are not receiving chemotherapy. The NHS said non-urgent operations would have to be put on hold so hospitals could focus on battling the Covid-19 pandemic, and NHS England guidance states that cancer services should continue to deliver care. However, it also calls for \u201clocal solutions to continue the proper management of these cancer services while protecting resources for the response to coronavirus\u201d. Prof Karol Sikora, the chief medical officer at Rutherford Health, which runs oncology centres, said the advice provided by NHS England around cancer was sensible but was being \u201cimplemented inconsistently\u201d around the country. \u201cThat is always the trouble \u2013 it becomes inconsistent, so people getting chemotherapy have now had it stopped even though they are category one and two patients, the highest priority. Also some hospitals have put blanket bans on cancer treatment for two to three weeks ... Not everyone needs to rush ahead with cancer treatment but others need to continue despite this to get the best long-term cure,\u201d he said. Sikora said: \u201cThe important thing here is people with curable cancer still get treatment. The private sector is in talks with NHS England and providers to provide increased capacity for NHS patients.\u201d The doctor said one of his close friends who worked in gastroenterology had got an email from a nurse saying \u201cnot to bother coming in\u201d and that his treatment would be \u201cstopped for the duration of the crisis\u201d. \u201cThe emotion is very difficult for our patients ... everything is uncertain,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a hard decision regarding how much you transfer care to coronavirus and how much say \u2018we have to keep going with vital non-urgent but critical services\u2019. The same is true of cardiac care.\u201d He said that there was the \u201clooming threat\u201d that cancer centres would close and all staff would go to the new Nightingale hospitals, built to take coronavirus patients from overstretched NHS facilities. \u201cI don\u2019t think that will happen. But there is concern that they will abandon all cancer patients. It would be sad if that happened.\u201d Angus George Dalgleish, a professor of oncology at St George\u2019s, University of London, said: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult. Coronavirus is having a devastating impact on how we deliver ordinary care \u2013 everything is out on hold or delayed.\u201d Asked whether this could mean more indirect deaths because of patients not getting care, Dalgleish said that \u201cwe won\u2019t know until it is all over\u201d. \u201cBut we are already seeing the effects of patients who are not going to get treatment. I heard today St George\u2019s is going to have nine wards full of coronavirus patients. They cannot do that without seriously impacting care of everyone else.\u201d Laura Lee, the chief executive of the cancer charity Maggie\u2019s, said anxieties among patients were being exacerbated by the current situation. She said: \u201cThe government needs to be more articulate about the issue, in the same way it has explored the effects of Covid on, for example, businesses and employment. In a sense, the plight of Covid isn\u2019t just with those who are going through Covid.\u201d She said that people had heard about the plight of those losing their jobs, but not about those with health conditions who would be affected by the virus, adding: \u201cThe unintended consequences or the non-choice consequences are coming.\u201d Dr Rosie Loftus, the joint chief medical officer at Macmillan Cancer Support, said that more than a quarter of calls to the charity\u2019s support line in the past week were from cancer patients concerned about Covid-19. \u201cWe\u2019re hearing from people who are feeling upset and scared, fretful about their future and even lonelier as a result of having to self-isolate,\u201d she said. \u201cWe recognise that these are exceptional circumstances for the NHS.

      "body": "<p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/lil-nas-x\" title=\"\">Lil Nas X</a> was growing up in the small, conservative community of Lithia Springs outside Atlanta, Georgia, he was sure of two things. One: he wanted to be an entertainer. Two: he would never come out of the closet. Only one of those predictions proved to be true.</p> <p>As a teenager who blasted SoundCloud rappers in his headphones and spent all his free time scrolling through Twitter, Lil Nas X quickly learned that it was easier to blend in than risk being different. He knew people who had come out at high school, and saw the pain, bullying and homophobia they experienced. He told himself he wasn\u2019t cut out for it. So he dressed in his cousin\u2019s hand-me-downs and, when he could afford them, purchased safe, muted clothes from Zara and H&amp;M. He watched fashion shows on his smartphone, but never thought he would be brave or rich enough to wear such explicitly queer outfits.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Everything seemed like a dream or a movie. It was like the world was playing a prank on me</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe honest truth is, I planned to die with the secret,\u201d Nas says now of his sexuality. We meet two weeks before the California lockdown, and he digs into the plate of spicy fusilli in front of him, a quick lunch at a West Hollywood restaurant after the Guardian photoshoot and before his afternoon power nap. Hesitant and shy at first, he becomes increasingly playful as our lunch goes on. Today he\u2019s dressed in a matching, traffic cone-orange <a href=\"https://www.heronpreston.com/en/GB\" title=\"\">Heron Preston</a> denim combo \u2013 a contrast to the soft, Edwardian-esque outfits he modelled hours earlier, strutting shirtless in a flower crown while belting out <a href=\"https://youtu.be/pok8H_KF1FA\" title=\"\">Doja Cat\u2019s viral hit Say So</a>.</p> <p>Was that really his plan, I ask, never to be himself? \u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that changed when I became Lil Nas X.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b2eacb57d0450e2b3f0a017f8b7653b081b0eb13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2eacb57d0450e2b3f0a017f8b7653b081b0eb13/504_536_4894_6258/782.jpg\" alt=\"Lil Nas X wearing a Givenchy suit and jewellery by Chrishabana\" width=\"782\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Suit: Givenchy.

In 12 months, he has gone from \u201cthe black cowboy with the song on TikTok\u201d to a global superstar. He is simultaneously a Gen-Z success story, red carpet fixture, <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8524235/lil-nas-x-old-town-road-longest-number-one-hot-100\" title=\"\">Billboard record holder</a> and, perhaps most surprising to Lil Nas X himself, a queer figurehead.</p> <p>The key to this success has been his track <a href=\"https://youtu.be/r7qovpFAGrQ\" title=\"\">Old Town Road</a>, an infectious blend of hip hop and country, right down to lyrics such as \u201cRidin\u2019 on a tractor/Lean all in my bladder\u201d and \u201cCowboy hat from Gucci/Wrangler on my booty\u201d. The crossover hit was embraced by everyone from Rolling Stone magazine to teens on TikTok, prompting Lil Nas X to quickly release <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/05/lil-nas-x-billy-ray-cyrus-old-town-road-remix-country-enough\" title=\"\">a version featuring country titan Billy Ray Cyrus</a>, known to one generation for his 1992 hit <a href=\"https://youtu.be/byQIPdHMpjc\" title=\"\">Achy Breaky Heart</a>, and another for being Miley\u2019s dad. \u201cEverything seemed like a dream or a movie,\u201d Nas says of his whirlwind 2019, culminating in six Grammy nominations, including best record for Old Town Road and best album for 2019\u2019s 7. \u201cIt was like the world was playing a prank on me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"57347a28419aa89661ce98cb4b330a312ec86312\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57347a28419aa89661ce98cb4b330a312ec86312/0_6_5894_7361/801.jpg\" alt=\"Lil Nas X wearing a gold corset and a necklace\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Corset: <a href=\"http://zanabayne.com/\">Zana Bayne</a>.

He slept on the floor of his sister\u2019s apartment and was about to drop out of college, giving up on the computer science major he half-heartedly pursued at the University of West Georgia. One day, while procrastinating over his course work, he wrote his first song. The track, Shame, saw Nas lean into the rough-edged, macho qualities of the rap styles he grew up listening to: Drake, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/09/lil-uzi-vert-review\" title=\"\">Lil Uzi Vert</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/07/rae-sreummurd-sr3mm-album-review\" title=\"\">Rae Sremmurd</a>. \u201cIt was just me acting really hard,\u201d he admits. \u201cWhich I did a lot of in the beginning. Because it felt like that\u2019s what I had to do.\u201d</p> <p>He took on a straight persona for those early songs, lewdly rapping that he \u201cmight go and fuck ya motha\u201d on the unpolished and unmixed track Nasarati, formerly available on the rapper\u2019s SoundCloud page. Merely mentioning the song makes him cover his face in embarrassment, hiding his high-beam smile, and shaking his head. \u201cYou heard it?\u201d he says when I point out that nothing on the internet ever truly disappears. \u201c<em>Oh</em> <em>goddddd</em>.\u201d</p> <p>He is currently recording his first proper album (he considers 7 to be an EP), and after a year of talking about Old Town Road says he\u2019s tired of answering the same questions. \u201cYou know, \u2018What was it like working with Billy Ray Cyrus?\u2019\u201d he drones, rolling his large, hooded eyes. \u201cIt was great, by the way,\u201d he quickly adds.</p> <p>For better or worse, these questions will not stop any time soon. The song was made in a $20-an-hour studio, on a laptop with a beat found on YouTube (which illegally sampled Nine Inch Nails\u2019 track <a href=\"https://youtu.be/XF_ceFugJjQ\" title=\"\">34 Ghosts IV</a>). Nas had already amassed a 20K following on Twitter, with an account mainly known for memes and jokes. When he posted the song there, his life would change dramatically. \u201cCountry music is evolving,\u201d he wrote, finding a video of a cowboy riding a bull to accompany the song.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e728bcfbb52cb0d9df9d10204b55a11e61e321f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e728bcfbb52cb0d9df9d10204b55a11e61e321f1/89_347_3659_2194/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lil Nas X with Noah Cyrus, Diplo, Billy Ray Cyrus and YoungKio at the Stagecoach festival in California in April 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Noah Cyrus, Diplo, Billy Ray Cyrus and YoungKio at the Stagecoach festival in California in April 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Old Town Road took off on the video-centric TikTok, soundtracking clips of teens shedding their suburban attire for cowboy hats and boots, and switching seamlessly between square dancing and hip hop moves. The genre was dubbed \u201ccountry trap\u201d and quickly charted high on the Billboard Hot Country Songs list. Then Billboard stepped in and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/02/lil-nas-song-removed-from-billboard-not-country-enough\" title=\"\">yanked it off the</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/02/lil-nas-song-removed-from-billboard-not-country-enough\" title=\"\">chart</a>, claiming the track lacked the necessary \u201celements\u201d of the genre, without <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/lil-nas-x-old-town-road-810844/\" title=\"\">specifying what those elements were</a>. Many accused Billboard\u2019s decision of being rooted in racial bias.

The Billy Ray Cyrus collaboration hit No 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in early April 2019, holding that position for 18 more weeks and beating the previous record (held jointly by Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men for <a href=\"https://youtu.be/UXxRyNvTPr8\" title=\"\">One Sweet Day</a>; and Puerto Rican artist Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee and Justin Bieber for <a href=\"https://youtu.be/72UO0v5ESUo\" title=\"\">Despacito</a>).</p> <p>A year later, Nas says he still struggles to understand why Old Town Road prompted the kneejerk reaction from Billboard\u2019s country purists. \u201cI think maybe it leaned too much on the other side for them,\u201d he says, adding that because his earlier music features more traditional rap sounds, they assumed \u201cOh, this is <em>him</em>?

Especially in, like, middle school or high school. Because it\u2019s just super hard.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s easier for me,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not depending on anybody. There\u2019s no one who\u2019s going to kick me out of the house \u2013 nobody to start treating me shitty.\u201d This may not be the case for \u201canother 20-year-old who doesn\u2019t quite have it figured out and still lives with his parents\u201d. What about his own parents? \u201cMy family knows now. But it\u2019s not something that\u2019s ever brought up or we speak about. We\u2019re quiet on it. Nobody\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, you got a boyfriend?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Does he want that question? He tilts his head and thinks long and hard. \u201cIt would have to be something I grew used to hearing. I don\u2019t want it to be something we never talk about. Because what about the kids in my family? I would like it to be a healthy medium between, \u2018Who are you <em>fucking</em>?\u2019 and just not saying anything.\u201d</p> <p>For the record, Nas\u2019s love life remains a mystery, despite him saying, last year, that he was \u201csomewhat\u201d in a relationship. His family \u2013 which includes seven brothers and sisters \u2013 also remains behind the scenes. \u201cI should talk to them more,\u201d is all he will say. He is not in contact with his mother, and hasn\u2019t been for a long time. When pressed on this, he becomes tight-lipped, saying only that, \u201cPeople have to be willing to help themselves first before you can help them.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>My family know I\u2019m gay now. But it\u2019s not something that\u2019s ever brought up or we speak about. We\u2019re quiet on it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Piping hot mozzarella sticks are brought to our table, and he eagerly bites into one as the song Lucid Dreams plays in the background, Nas singing along softly. It\u2019s a track by Juice WRLD, a rapper who also created a massive internet fanbase for himself, before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/08/rapper-juice-wrld-dies-age-21-chicago\" title=\"\">dying of a drug overdose</a> late last year. When the news broke, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LilNasX/status/1203913545127088128\" title=\"\">Nas performed a cover of Lucid Dreams</a> on stage.</p> <p>In many ways, the two young artists are sharply divergent examples of what sudden, internet-born fame can look like. Since the success of Old Town Road, Nas has had to rethink what he shares. For one, he no longer runs the meme accounts on which he mastered the art of posting viral tweets and jokes. He refuses to own up to running @NasMaraj, a Nicki Minaj fan account, despite sleuthing fans and journalists all but confirming he did through analysis of IP addresses and time stamps. When asked about being a Nicki Minaj \u201cbarb\u201d, or superfan, he gives a devilish grin and speaks into the recorder lying on the table, as if delivering a message directly to the internet. \u201cQuiet on that,\u201d he teases. \u201cUm, that\u2019s never happened.\u201d I can\u2019t quite tell what he would be embarrassed about, other than the idea of fanboying for another rapper.</p> <p>But Nas has to be careful of his digital footprint. He learned this lesson the hard way in February when <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LilNasX/status/1226883959180734470\" title=\"\">he tweeted</a> a glamorous red-carpet photo of R&amp;B singer SZA with a line that suggested they were dating. He wrote, \u201cclean for her. cook for her and everything i do is for her. and if she cheats? that is on me!\u201d As with a lot of memes, the joke didn\u2019t stand up to a lot of scrutiny; it was just Nas\u2019s way of heaping praise on SZA. But many took him literally. \u201cOne morning show on YouTube was like, \u2018Lil Nas X says he\u2019s not gay any more!\u2019 And it has a hundred thousand views.\u201d He worries more that when he is being serious, people will think he\u2019s kidding. Case in point: he felt compelled to write \u201cno joking\u201d before asking his Twitter followers how best to provide <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LilNasX/status/1235590156364550144\" title=\"\">help during the coronavirus</a> pandemic.</p> <p>He is even more cautious when it comes to politics. Last year, the first openly gay Democratic presidential nominee, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-buttigieg\" title=\"\">Pete Buttigieg</a>, asked him to appear in a campaign video. Nas turned down the offer. \u201cI\u2019m not too into politics,\u201d he says now. \u201cI don\u2019t know his political history or motives. The only thing I know\u2026 Wasn\u2019t he from the Democratic party?\u201d <em>Yes.</em> \u201cSee. All I know is he\u2019s from the Democratic party and he\u2019s gay. So it\u2019s like\u2026 I don\u2019t want to base my support off, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re gay, I\u2019m going to support you.\u2019\u201d His words are coming faster now. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re gay. But I don\u2019t know everything you\u2019re planning when you\u2019re running the entire country.\u201d He returns to eating his food, retreating back into his calm, subdued demeanour as quickly as he came out of it. \u201cBut, yeah. That was the reason I said no.\u201d</p> <p>Later, Nas tells me that politics depresses him. As a teenager, he closely followed the protests over police brutality and mass shootings. It frustrated and saddened him to see that nothing really changed. \u201cIt got hard to leave the house,\u201d he says. \u201cI guess ever since that, I\u2019ve tried to stay away. Politics gets me very upset.\u201d</p> <p>The more Nas talks, the more it becomes obvious that what he is deeply suspicious of is less politics than the individual Americans delivering it. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say I support this one person because they\u2019re doing this one thing. Because I don\u2019t know what else they\u2019re doing, or what they\u2019re going to do.\u201d He says he hasn\u2019t yet registered to vote in this year\u2019s presidential election, but \u201cof course I\u2019m going to vote. I encourage my fans to vote.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"07a9541d131730355c5dd2171fd3d01fe141956d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07a9541d131730355c5dd2171fd3d01fe141956d/0_0_5778_6964/830.jpg\" alt=\"Lil Nas X topless with a tulip behind his ear\" width=\"830\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trousers: <a href=\"https://www.heronpreston.com/en/GB\">Heron Preston</a>.

      "bodyText": "When Lil Nas X was growing up in the small, conservative community of Lithia Springs outside Atlanta, Georgia, he was sure of two things. One: he wanted to be an entertainer. Two: he would never come out of the closet. Only one of those predictions proved to be true. As a teenager who blasted SoundCloud rappers in his headphones and spent all his free time scrolling through Twitter, Lil Nas X quickly learned that it was easier to blend in than risk being different. He knew people who had come out at high school, and saw the pain, bullying and homophobia they experienced. He told himself he wasn\u2019t cut out for it. So he dressed in his cousin\u2019s hand-me-downs and, when he could afford them, purchased safe, muted clothes from Zara and H&amp;M. He watched fashion shows on his smartphone, but never thought he would be brave or rich enough to wear such explicitly queer outfits. \u201cThe honest truth is, I planned to die with the secret,\u201d Nas says now of his sexuality. We meet two weeks before the California lockdown, and he digs into the plate of spicy fusilli in front of him, a quick lunch at a West Hollywood restaurant after the Guardian photoshoot and before his afternoon power nap. Hesitant and shy at first, he becomes increasingly playful as our lunch goes on. Today he\u2019s dressed in a matching, traffic cone-orange Heron Preston denim combo \u2013 a contrast to the soft, Edwardian-esque outfits he modelled hours earlier, strutting shirtless in a flower crown while belting out Doja Cat\u2019s viral hit Say So. Was that really his plan, I ask, never to be himself? \u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that changed when I became Lil Nas X.\u201d Today, 20-year-old Lil Nas X (Nas to his friends) is a far cry from his teenage self, Montero Lamar Hill from Lithia Springs. In 12 months, he has gone from \u201cthe black cowboy with the song on TikTok\u201d to a global superstar. He is simultaneously a Gen-Z success story, red carpet fixture, Billboard record holder and, perhaps most surprising to Lil Nas X himself, a queer figurehead. The key to this success has been his track Old Town Road, an infectious blend of hip hop and country, right down to lyrics such as \u201cRidin\u2019 on a tractor/Lean all in my bladder\u201d and \u201cCowboy hat from Gucci/Wrangler on my booty\u201d. The crossover hit was embraced by everyone from Rolling Stone magazine to teens on TikTok, prompting Lil Nas X to quickly release a version featuring country titan Billy Ray Cyrus, known to one generation for his 1992 hit Achy Breaky Heart, and another for being Miley\u2019s dad. \u201cEverything seemed like a dream or a movie,\u201d Nas says of his whirlwind 2019, culminating in six Grammy nominations, including best record for Old Town Road and best album for 2019\u2019s 7. \u201cIt was like the world was playing a prank on me.\u201d Just two years ago, he was a silly, meme-loving 18-year-old who was still figuring it out. He slept on the floor of his sister\u2019s apartment and was about to drop out of college, giving up on the computer science major he half-heartedly pursued at the University of West Georgia. One day, while procrastinating over his course work, he wrote his first song. The track, Shame, saw Nas lean into the rough-edged, macho qualities of the rap styles he grew up listening to: Drake, Lil Uzi Vert and Rae Sremmurd. \u201cIt was just me acting really hard,\u201d he admits. \u201cWhich I did a lot of in the beginning. Because it felt like that\u2019s what I had to do.\u201d He took on a straight persona for those early songs, lewdly rapping that he \u201cmight go and fuck ya motha\u201d on the unpolished and unmixed track Nasarati, formerly available on the rapper\u2019s SoundCloud page. Merely mentioning the song makes him cover his face in embarrassment, hiding his high-beam smile, and shaking his head. \u201cYou heard it?\u201d he says when I point out that nothing on the internet ever truly disappears. \u201cOh goddddd.\u201d He is currently recording his first proper album (he considers 7 to be an EP), and after a year of talking about Old Town Road says he\u2019s tired of answering the same questions. \u201cYou know, \u2018What was it like working with Billy Ray Cyrus?\u2019\u201d he drones, rolling his large, hooded eyes. \u201cIt was great, by the way,\u201d he quickly adds. For better or worse, these questions will not stop any time soon. The song was made in a $20-an-hour studio, on a laptop with a beat found on YouTube (which illegally sampled Nine Inch Nails\u2019 track 34 Ghosts IV). Nas had already amassed a 20K following on Twitter, with an account mainly known for memes and jokes. When he posted the song there, his life would change dramatically. \u201cCountry music is evolving,\u201d he wrote, finding a video of a cowboy riding a bull to accompany the song. Old Town Road took off on the video-centric TikTok, soundtracking clips of teens shedding their suburban attire for cowboy hats and boots, and switching seamlessly between square dancing and hip hop moves. The genre was dubbed \u201ccountry trap\u201d and quickly charted high on the Billboard Hot Country Songs list. Then Billboard stepped in and yanked it off the chart, claiming the track lacked the necessary \u201celements\u201d of the genre, without specifying what those elements were. Many accused Billboard\u2019s decision of being rooted in racial bias. White artists have long borrowed sounds from black rappers, infusing their music with an \u201curban\u201d edge, with little to no pushback from genre-based music charts. It felt like the epitome of hypocrisy. But the outrage that followed Billboard\u2019s decision only helped boost Old Town Road\u2019s popularity. The Billy Ray Cyrus collaboration hit No 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in early April 2019, holding that position for 18 more weeks and beating the previous record (held jointly by Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men for One Sweet Day; and Puerto Rican artist Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee and Justin Bieber for Despacito). A year later, Nas says he still struggles to understand why Old Town Road prompted the kneejerk reaction from Billboard\u2019s country purists. \u201cI think maybe it leaned too much on the other side for them,\u201d he says, adding that because his earlier music features more traditional rap sounds, they assumed \u201cOh, this is him? Then this is all he\u2019s allowed to do.\u201d The predictable outcome of all this would have been for Lil Nas X to remain a one-hit wonder, enjoying the flash-in-the-pan success of Rebecca Black\u2019s Friday and Psy\u2019s Gangnam Style as the internet moved on. Instead, he has grown into the rare kind of pop star who is able to appeal to multiple demographics. Kids love him for his tunes and fun dances (as proven by a video of Nas visiting an elementary school, where the pupils shriek in pure glee as they dance to Old Town Road). Meanwhile, the fashion crowd appreciate his bold, gender-bending style; conservatives in the south vibe with his cowboy persona; and LGBTQ+ fans relish the much-needed, intersectional representation he provides. It was after performing to a crowd of thousands at Glastonbury with Miley Cyrus last summer that, amid increasing speculation about his sexuality, Nas decided to come out, casually, in a tweet. \u201cDeadass thought I made it obvious,\u201d he wrote, accompanied by a deluge of rainbow emojis. \u201cThere was nothing really holding me back any more,\u201d he explains today. In coming out, Nas joined a growing cohort of young entertainers challenging the idea that queer rappers cannot experience mainstream success, from Kevin Abstract of hip hop \u201cboy band\u201d Brockhampton, to the experimental Tyler, the Creator, to the openly bisexual female rapper Doja Cat. Grateful that the announcement hadn\u2019t killed his career, he began pushing the limits with increasingly outlandish red-carpet looks. He wore a neon-green suit, created by the hip black designer Christopher John Rogers, paired with feminine leopard print gloves to the American Music Awards in November last year. Two months later, he was at the Grammys in a leather, Barbie-pink Versace suit, with a harness and see-through mesh T-shirt. As the red carpet looks grew campier, the reactions became more extreme. Pastor Troy, a hardcore rapper, also from Georgia, went on a homophobic rant in response to Nas\u2019s Grammys look, writing on Instagram and Twitter: \u201cWelp I guess I won\u2019t be winning a Grammy\u2026 If this is what I gotta wear. They love to push this shit on our kids!!\u201d Lil Nas X shared the rant with his 4.3 million Twitter followers and wrote in response, \u201cDamn i look good in that pic\u2026\u201d Nas credits his stylist, Hodo Musa (who worked on the Guardian Weekend shoot), for his increasingly eye-catching looks. Yes, he possessed a mild interest in fashion as a teen, he says, but he didn\u2019t have an encyclopaedic knowledge of it. \u201cI\u2019m trying to \u2013 no, I will build myself up as a superstar, and fashion will be a big part of that,\u201d he says. It\u2019s perhaps strange that, unlike musicians from Troye Sivan to Frank Ocean (whose track Biking holds a top spot in Nas\u2019s playlist right now), he does not explore his sexuality in his music. \u201cI 100% want to represent the LGBT community,\u201d he says, adding that he also worries about the safety and wellbeing of fans who may grapple with the decision to come out. \u201cI don\u2019t want to encourage them to do something they don\u2019t 100% want to do. Especially in, like, middle school or high school. Because it\u2019s just super hard.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s easier for me,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not depending on anybody. There\u2019s no one who\u2019s going to kick me out of the house \u2013 nobody to start treating me shitty.\u201d This may not be the case for \u201canother 20-year-old who doesn\u2019t quite have it figured out and still lives with his parents\u201d. What about his own parents? \u201cMy family knows now. But it\u2019s not something that\u2019s ever brought up or we speak about. We\u2019re quiet on it. Nobody\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, you got a boyfriend?\u2019\u201d Does he want that question? He tilts his head and thinks long and hard. \u201cIt would have to be something I grew used to hearing. I don\u2019t want it to be something we never talk about. Because what about the kids in my family? I would like it to be a healthy medium between, \u2018Who are you fucking?\u2019 and just not saying anything.\u201d For the record, Nas\u2019s love life remains a mystery, despite him saying, last year, that he was \u201csomewhat\u201d in a relationship. His family \u2013 which includes seven brothers and sisters \u2013 also remains behind the scenes. \u201cI should talk to them more,\u201d is all he will say. He is not in contact with his mother, and hasn\u2019t been for a long time. When pressed on this, he becomes tight-lipped, saying only that, \u201cPeople have to be willing to help themselves first before you can help them.\u201d Piping hot mozzarella sticks are brought to our table, and he eagerly bites into one as the song Lucid Dreams plays in the background, Nas singing along softly. It\u2019s a track by Juice WRLD, a rapper who also created a massive internet fanbase for himself, before dying of a drug overdose late last year. When the news broke, Nas performed a cover of Lucid Dreams on stage. In many ways, the two young artists are sharply divergent examples of what sudden, internet-born fame can look like. Since the success of Old Town Road, Nas has had to rethink what he shares. For one, he no longer runs the meme accounts on which he mastered the art of posting viral tweets and jokes. He refuses to own up to running @NasMaraj, a Nicki Minaj fan account, despite sleuthing fans and journalists all but confirming he did through analysis of IP addresses and time stamps. When asked about being a Nicki Minaj \u201cbarb\u201d, or superfan, he gives a devilish grin and speaks into the recorder lying on the table, as if delivering a message directly to the internet. \u201cQuiet on that,\u201d he teases. \u201cUm, that\u2019s never happened.\u201d I can\u2019t quite tell what he would be embarrassed about, other than the idea of fanboying for another rapper. But Nas has to be careful of his digital footprint. He learned this lesson the hard way in February when he tweeted a glamorous red-carpet photo of R&amp;B singer SZA with a line that suggested they were dating. He wrote, \u201cclean for her. cook for her and everything i do is for her. and if she cheats? that is on me!\u201d As with a lot of memes, the joke didn\u2019t stand up to a lot of scrutiny; it was just Nas\u2019s way of heaping praise on SZA. But many took him literally. \u201cOne morning show on YouTube was like, \u2018Lil Nas X says he\u2019s not gay any more!\u2019 And it has a hundred thousand views.\u201d He worries more that when he is being serious, people will think he\u2019s kidding. Case in point: he felt compelled to write \u201cno joking\u201d before asking his Twitter followers how best to provide help during the coronavirus pandemic. He is even more cautious when it comes to politics. Last year, the first openly gay Democratic presidential nominee, Pete Buttigieg, asked him to appear in a campaign video. Nas turned down the offer. \u201cI\u2019m not too into politics,\u201d he says now. \u201cI don\u2019t know his political history or motives. The only thing I know\u2026 Wasn\u2019t he from the Democratic party?\u201d Yes. \u201cSee. All I know is he\u2019s from the Democratic party and he\u2019s gay. So it\u2019s like\u2026 I don\u2019t want to base my support off, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re gay, I\u2019m going to support you.\u2019\u201d His words are coming faster now. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re gay. But I don\u2019t know everything you\u2019re planning when you\u2019re running the entire country.\u201d He returns to eating his food, retreating back into his calm, subdued demeanour as quickly as he came out of it. \u201cBut, yeah. That was the reason I said no.\u201d Later, Nas tells me that politics depresses him. As a teenager, he closely followed the protests over police brutality and mass shootings. It frustrated and saddened him to see that nothing really changed. \u201cIt got hard to leave the house,\u201d he says. \u201cI guess ever since that, I\u2019ve tried to stay away. Politics gets me very upset.\u201d The more Nas talks, the more it becomes obvious that what he is deeply suspicious of is less politics than the individual Americans delivering it. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say I support this one person because they\u2019re doing this one thing. Because I don\u2019t know what else they\u2019re doing, or what they\u2019re going to do.\u201d He says he hasn\u2019t yet registered to vote in this year\u2019s presidential election, but \u201cof course I\u2019m going to vote. I encourage my fans to vote.\u201d When Nas came out, he told his fans to listen closely to the penultimate track on the 7 EP, titled C7osure. The muffled-sounding mid-tempo ballad is all about leaving a stifling past behind for a liberated future. Lines such as \u201cI know it don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s time\u2026 But I look back at this moment, I\u2019ll see that I\u2019m fine\u201d suggest the internal conversation Nas had with himself before reversing his decision never to come out. Like any other 20-year-old, he is still figuring out who he is. He reads books about Buddhism to \u201cget a better understanding of life and how to handle things\u201d, and says he\u2019s inspired by HBO\u2019s teen drama Euphoria. \u201cI would love to do a version of that somehow,\u201d he says of the boundary-pushing show that features a trans lead, queer relationships and lots of drug use. The songs on his new album will explicitly explore his queer identity, he says; his form of social advocacy will be \u201cthrough my art\u201d. We pay the check. Nas is ready for a power nap. After that, he\u2019s attending a concert by Noah Cyrus, the youngest daughter of Billy Ray. I sense that Lil Nas X is still not done coming out to the world. He stands up from the booth, his 6ft 3in frame on full display, and says goodbye. He\u2019ll share the rest of himself when he\u2019s ready. Lil Nas X\u2019s debut EP 7 is out now.",

      "body": "<p>David Hockney has a little advice for anyone who fancies taking up art as a lockdown hobby: take out the pencils or brushes, and put away the camera.</p> <p>\u201cI would suggest people could draw at this time,\u201d he said from the house in Normandy where he has been sequestered since France practically closed down last month. \u201cQuestion everything and do not think about photography.\u201d</p> <p>Instead, he recommends everyone drawing with open eyes. \u201cI would suggest they really look hard at something and think about what they are really seeing.\u201d The materials don\u2019t matter: a pencil or an iPad app such as Brushes, which is what he used to create his latest picture of the Normandy landscape, exclusive to the Guardian.</p> <p>Coronavirus shut the world down when Hockney was in France, living in the Normandy countryside. He is occupying himself there depicting the natural world. This week the release of some of his iPad paintings of spring flowers and blossoms splashed joyous colours in a time of grey anxiety. \u201cWe need art, and I do think it can relieve stress,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is stress? It\u2019s worrying about something in the future. Art is now.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"463063b92a7cf8a8cb4a3ede3c3b29e1551d58d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/463063b92a7cf8a8cb4a3ede3c3b29e1551d58d6/0_224_6708_4025/1000..jpg\" alt=\"David Hockney.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Hockney.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robin Utrecht/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At a time when more and more people are enjoying walks, time in the garden, or just relishing the short periods they can spend outdoors, Hockney\u2019s new iPad paintings of Normandy advocate encountering nature for escape, solace and renewal. They\u2019re a timely culmination of a life spent looking at trees, flowers and skies. Even in one of his most famous works, A Bigger Splash, he paid close attention to LA\u2019s palms and lawns.</p> <p>\u201cI have always disliked crowds,\u201d confessed Hockney the Romantic. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s because of my hearing problems. And I like solitude. I am very aware we are part of nature.\u201d</p> <p>Has the coronavirus crisis made us more open to solitary reveries and serious art? \u201cI think at the moment it\u2019s making people think a bit deeper about life. But perhaps it\u2019s my age. I\u2019m 83 (nearly).\u201d</p> <p>Hockney has a passion for nature that rejoices in British rain just as much as French sunshine. His current project returns to the open-air landscape technique he used in Yorkshire a few years ago after he moved from LA to Bridlington.</p> <p>\u201cRuskin said there was no such thing as bad weather in England. I remember being in Bridlington one winter evening when the weather forecast was on. They told us not to go out as there was going to be a terrible snow storm. This made me sit up and I suggested we go out to see it,\u201d he said in a succession of email exchanges.</p> <p>\u201cWe got in our four-wheel-drive truck and drove slowly to Woldgate, not very far and we only went up it about half a mile, and then we stopped. The headlights from the car lit up the snow very dramatically and we watched the snow forming on the tree branches. It was magical, I thought, really memorable.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fde9ac496d2444f46e492cc24a2b27b381771695\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fde9ac496d2444f46e492cc24a2b27b381771695/0_0_1920_1341/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Another of David Hockney\u2019s lockdown paintings.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"698\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Another of David Hockney\u2019s lockdown paintings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Hockney</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However gentle Hockney\u2019s spring blossoms may seem, this story reveals he may have something in him of Turner, who once got himself lashed to a mast in a storm. And that awe drives his artistic struggle.</p> <p>\u201cTo depict nature, we can only try. Nature doesn\u2019t have any straight lines. It doesn\u2019t follow the rules of perspective.\u201d This freedom from human rules is what makes a motif such as the tree he\u2019s just sent me such a boundless theme: every pale dapple of blossom, every twist and turn of a branch is unique. Drawing nature is sheer adventure: \u201cIt makes us see things. This is why photography is a problem ... with cameras everything is pushed away. I was just drawing a tree this morning and Jonathan [his assistant] made a photograph of it ... my drawing got the space a lot better.\u201d</p> <p>Hockney is on a roll right now, painting in the open every day, and as he makes picture after picture he sees these unassuming acts of observation coming together as an epic panorama.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I am doing here is eventually to make my iPad drawings into something like the Bayeux tapestry, ie you will walk past it. The Bayeux tapestry is 90 metres long. It contains no shadows, no reflections and certainly no perspective as that would stop time. It would look very odd. Bayeux is 40 minutes\u2019 drive from here. In European art history it is ignored. Why? It is like a Chinese scroll: very sophisticated. In a book I read recently called 1066, the author dismissed it as cartoonish. I concluded he wasn\u2019t very visual.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/apr/02/david-hockney-spring-ipad-paintings-self-isolating-van-gogh\">How David Hockney depicted a spring for self-isolationists</a> </p> </aside>  <p>David Hockney is an artist who thinks deeply and widely about what he\u2019s doing and his apparently simple pictures of spring blooms are anything but. They\u2019re philosophical investigations of what it is to see something fully and \u201cdepict\u201d it \u2013 his chosen word \u2013 with an intimacy the camera can\u2019t give.</p> <p>If his art is urgent now, it\u2019s not because it is bright and cheery. It is because it is still and pensive. After he mentioned Ruskin, who looked for God in nature, I could not help asking him about his own beliefs. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, but he felt \u201clike Van Gogh, who knew nature was a great mystery to us\u201d. It\u2019s a mystery he\u2019s teaching us to see freshly and find strength in.</p> <p>\u201cThis morning is cloudy here and there has been some frost that affects the blossom a bit, but I\u2019ll find something to draw.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "David Hockney has a little advice for anyone who fancies taking up art as a lockdown hobby: take out the pencils or brushes, and put away the camera. \u201cI would suggest people could draw at this time,\u201d he said from the house in Normandy where he has been sequestered since France practically closed down last month. \u201cQuestion everything and do not think about photography.\u201d Instead, he recommends everyone drawing with open eyes. \u201cI would suggest they really look hard at something and think about what they are really seeing.\u201d The materials don\u2019t matter: a pencil or an iPad app such as Brushes, which is what he used to create his latest picture of the Normandy landscape, exclusive to the Guardian. Coronavirus shut the world down when Hockney was in France, living in the Normandy countryside. He is occupying himself there depicting the natural world. This week the release of some of his iPad paintings of spring flowers and blossoms splashed joyous colours in a time of grey anxiety. \u201cWe need art, and I do think it can relieve stress,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is stress? It\u2019s worrying about something in the future. Art is now.\u201d At a time when more and more people are enjoying walks, time in the garden, or just relishing the short periods they can spend outdoors, Hockney\u2019s new iPad paintings of Normandy advocate encountering nature for escape, solace and renewal. They\u2019re a timely culmination of a life spent looking at trees, flowers and skies. Even in one of his most famous works, A Bigger Splash, he paid close attention to LA\u2019s palms and lawns. \u201cI have always disliked crowds,\u201d confessed Hockney the Romantic. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s because of my hearing problems. And I like solitude. I am very aware we are part of nature.\u201d Has the coronavirus crisis made us more open to solitary reveries and serious art? \u201cI think at the moment it\u2019s making people think a bit deeper about life. But perhaps it\u2019s my age. I\u2019m 83 (nearly).\u201d Hockney has a passion for nature that rejoices in British rain just as much as French sunshine. His current project returns to the open-air landscape technique he used in Yorkshire a few years ago after he moved from LA to Bridlington. \u201cRuskin said there was no such thing as bad weather in England. I remember being in Bridlington one winter evening when the weather forecast was on. They told us not to go out as there was going to be a terrible snow storm. This made me sit up and I suggested we go out to see it,\u201d he said in a succession of email exchanges. \u201cWe got in our four-wheel-drive truck and drove slowly to Woldgate, not very far and we only went up it about half a mile, and then we stopped. The headlights from the car lit up the snow very dramatically and we watched the snow forming on the tree branches. It was magical, I thought, really memorable.\u201d However gentle Hockney\u2019s spring blossoms may seem, this story reveals he may have something in him of Turner, who once got himself lashed to a mast in a storm. And that awe drives his artistic struggle. \u201cTo depict nature, we can only try. Nature doesn\u2019t have any straight lines. It doesn\u2019t follow the rules of perspective.\u201d This freedom from human rules is what makes a motif such as the tree he\u2019s just sent me such a boundless theme: every pale dapple of blossom, every twist and turn of a branch is unique. Drawing nature is sheer adventure: \u201cIt makes us see things. This is why photography is a problem ... with cameras everything is pushed away. I was just drawing a tree this morning and Jonathan [his assistant] made a photograph of it ... my drawing got the space a lot better.\u201d Hockney is on a roll right now, painting in the open every day, and as he makes picture after picture he sees these unassuming acts of observation coming together as an epic panorama. \u201cWhat I am doing here is eventually to make my iPad drawings into something like the Bayeux tapestry, ie you will walk past it. The Bayeux tapestry is 90 metres long. It contains no shadows, no reflections and certainly no perspective as that would stop time. It would look very odd. Bayeux is 40 minutes\u2019 drive from here. In European art history it is ignored. Why? It is like a Chinese scroll: very sophisticated. In a book I read recently called 1066, the author dismissed it as cartoonish. I concluded he wasn\u2019t very visual.\u201d David Hockney is an artist who thinks deeply and widely about what he\u2019s doing and his apparently simple pictures of spring blooms are anything but. They\u2019re philosophical investigations of what it is to see something fully and \u201cdepict\u201d it \u2013 his chosen word \u2013 with an intimacy the camera can\u2019t give. If his art is urgent now, it\u2019s not because it is bright and cheery. It is because it is still and pensive. After he mentioned Ruskin, who looked for God in nature, I could not help asking him about his own beliefs. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, but he felt \u201clike Van Gogh, who knew nature was a great mystery to us\u201d. It\u2019s a mystery he\u2019s teaching us to see freshly and find strength in. \u201cThis morning is cloudy here and there has been some frost that affects the blossom a bit, but I\u2019ll find something to draw.\u201d",

The NSW opposition called for Hazzard to stand down.</li> \n   <li>The number of Covid-19 cases in Australia surpassed 5,500 and now sits at 5,544. There have been 30 deaths, including a woman in her 70s in Victoria on Friday and a man in his 80s in Canberra on Saturday.</li> \n   <li>NSW police conducted the largest operation in Sydney Harbour outside of wartime to move crew and supplies between a series of stranded cruise ships before they depart Australian waters. </li> \n   <li>The federal government announced changes for temporary visa holders help support those who may be stood down or lose work hours as a result of Covid-19. In line with changes being made for Australian citizens and permanent residents, most temporary visa holders with work rights will now be able to access their Australian superannuation to help support themselves during this crisis.</li> \n   <li>International students working in essential industries such as aged care, nursing and supermarkets have had the number of hours they are permitted to work per fortnight extended.</li> \n   <li>NSW Health said 110 returned travellers in quarantine in Sydney hotels have been tested for coronavirus after experiencing symptoms. Their test results were expected today. </li> \n   <li>The deputy chief health officer, Paul Kelly, advised the wider public against wearing face masks, in part due to supply constraints.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Thank you, as always, for following along with us today.

nurses in Australia on working holiday maker (WHM) visas to be able to continue working in hospitals rather than being forced to meet visa requirements \u2013 such as completing \u201cspecified work\u201d often picking fruit,\u201d Labor\u2019s Kristina Keneally and Andrew Giles said in a statement.</p> \n  <p>But they said the announcements today didn\u2019t cover all temporary visa holders

out of their accommodation,\u201d they said. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-04T03:52:32.462Z\">at 4.52am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div

Hazzard says he\u2019s:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>... not blaming the federal government here because it was evolving so fast at the time. As you would recall, this all was moving slowly, between mid-January and the end of January, we only had four people. But Health was still preparing and doing all they needed to do, doing all the work behind the scenes and they took it upon themselves to step up the protocol that they had previously applied for many years to other infectious diseases. So when the 6 March protocol came from the federal government, basically making it discretionary, they [NSW Health] didn\u2019t adopt that. The Health team, the senior practitioner, decided they were going to do an assessment on every ship and that is what they did. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Given the risk assessment they did \u2013 regardless of federal advice they did not have to do an assessment \u2013 the NSW Health staff decided the ship was low risk as only flu was found, and at non-outbreak levels.

One reporter in particular keeps jumping in giving her a grilling and calling on her to resign. It needs to be said that Australia Border Force also had a role to play in this saga \u2013 it\u2019s not all on <strong>NSW Health who were following protocol and assessment processes in place at the time</strong>. Chant says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> If I could just take you back to some of the facts. There was influenza circulating on the cruise ship. And we know that because the point of care test, is pretty accurate and showed it is influenza. So we know that influenza was circulating in that cruise ship, and the majority of patients, over half of the samples that were collected at the time, that the cause of illness was flu. Notwithstanding, it didn\u2019t breach the outbreak level of flu because that would have itself triggered a different response. </p> \n   <p>Can I just assure the public, because I think this is really critical, New South Wales Health has learned lessons and had extensive planning under way to actually disembark people and passengers should we suspect Covid-19 on a cruise ship, or should that have been confirmed. We had always planned to ensure self-isolation for people in the Sydney region, safe transport home through use of health share and other modes of transport and also using hotels for the accommodation of people. If we had known that Covid was on this ship, or it had of been suspected, we would have chosen that way of disembarkation.</p> \n   <p>Having said that, the people who acquired the infection, to the best of our knowledge, got it on the cruise ship. A couple of people may have acquired it earlier on with earlier onset dates and may have acquired it from other means. But certainly, the later ones acquired it on the cruise ship and the reason we suspect that amplified so quickly on the cruise ship was because we know some crew members were actually in the galley area, the food preparation area, when unwell and that would have led to a significant risk of transmission there. </p> \n   <p>So the incubation period of the disease, just to refresh everybody\u2019s memory, is 14 days. We have been following up new cases and linking it to the Ruby Princess for that period because that reflects the fact that they were infected on that time. </p> \n   <p>Be clear, the actions of New South Wales health on the day and the advice of the public health panel was based on the assessment of that information presented to them. They concluded it was a low risk, took the action and tested the results. But we would have got them off in a different way [if the risk assessment had of been high]. As I said, this goes to the fact that the clinicians knew there was activity in influenza. It was low-level influenza.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-04T00:44:40.202Z\">at 1.44am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e87d3d28f08c35a1d119c35\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-04T00:26:59.006Z\">1.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A reporter asks NSW chief health officer <strong>Dr Kerry Chant \u2013</strong> who has worked tirelessly since the epidemic began \u2013 why her resignation isn\u2019t on the premier\u2019s desk over NSW Health\u2019s handling of the Ruby Princess.

Seven of the ship\u2019s passengers have now died after getting the virus and more than 600 passenger are infected.

And I find it disappointing in the strongest way possible that there can be any suggestion that those people are not doing their best. </p> \n   <p>In general terms, can I just say, this city of ours is the gateway to Australia. In normal times we pride ourselves on that. We believe that we actually do lead the way in this country, through Sydney and through New South Wales. But part of that is we have more people coming through our airports and more people coming through our ports than any other state or territory. We have more cruise ships that come through the port of Sydney than any other port in Australia. In a normal course of events, there are about 300 of these cruise ships that come in through the port of Sydney every year.<br></p> \n   <p>The very senior health staff that make the assessments on those cruise ships are actually among the world\u2019s best. There were four, generally, involved in each decision made [about the ships]. Four very senior health staff. They are specialist physicians, doctors with extraordinary training and experience in public health. We have people in that group who make these decisions who are consulting to the World Health Organization, in communicable diseases. When they make decisions, they make decisions the rest of us, if we were one-on-one with that doctor, would be very, very happy to have that advice. </p> \n   <p>I would say to all of you in the public, and actually, it is not so much, I think, the public, there are others who are making comments, but I would say to people who are being critical, know that these frontline staff are sometimes working, as<strong> Dr Kerry Chant</strong> did, she won\u2019t want me to say this, but last Saturday she worked for 31 straight hours before she stood before the media. She hadn\u2019t slept. People don\u2019t do that unless they have extraordinary commitment to all of us. </p> \n   <p><strong>What I would say to the community and to those who are leaping to criticise is, take a step back, and realise that we need everyone of these people, who have worked their hearts out, worked every aspect, every possible thing they could do to keep us safe, and we should be very temperate and careful in any criticism of those people.

He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We can\u2019t afford to see fruit rotting on trees and vines and vegetables left unpicked.

Here are the key moments from today: The fallout from the Ruby Princess saga continues with the NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard defending health officials who allowed passengers to disembark. The NSW opposition called for Hazzard to stand down. The number of Covid-19 cases in Australia surpassed 5,500 and now sits at 5,544. There have been 30 deaths, including a woman in her 70s in Victoria on Friday and a man in his 80s in Canberra on Saturday. NSW police conducted the largest operation in Sydney Harbour outside of wartime to move crew and supplies between a series of stranded cruise ships before they depart Australian waters. The federal government announced changes for temporary visa holders help support those who may be stood down or lose work hours as a result of Covid-19. In line with changes being made for Australian citizens and permanent residents, most temporary visa holders with work rights will now be able to access their Australian superannuation to help support themselves during this crisis. International students working in essential industries such as aged care, nursing and supermarkets have had the number of hours they are permitted to work per fortnight extended. NSW Health said 110 returned travellers in quarantine in Sydney hotels have been tested for coronavirus after experiencing symptoms. Their test results were expected today. The deputy chief health officer, Paul Kelly, advised the wider public against wearing face masks, in part due to supply constraints. Thank you, as always, for following along with us today. We\u2019ll be back to bring you the latest developments tomorrow. In the meantime, stay well and safe. From AAP: Five cruise ships docked in Sydney harbour will be sent out to sea as the NSW government deals with the ugly fallout of the Ruby Princess affair. NSW Police on Saturday helped reprovision two ships, the Spectrum of the Seas and the Radiance of the Seas, before they departed for their home ports. The ships were allowed to dock in Sydney Harbour during the past 24 hours, with 600 foreign national crew members moved between the two before fuel, food and medical supplies were loaded on board. NSW Police said that they both departed on Saturday afternoon as part of \u201cOperation Nemesis\u201d. A third ship, the Celebrity Solstice, entered the harbour on Saturday afternoon with another two - Voyager of the Seas and Ovation of the Seas - to follow. Read more here. NSW Police have given an update on their enforcement of social distancing laws. 12 penalty notices were issued on Friday. They include: Four men at a Wagga home where they were not residents. Police were called to the home after reports of a disturbance. While at the home, officers found and seized methamphetamine and cannabis. Inquiries are continuing, with charges expected, police say. A group of men sitting on a park bench that was fenced off by council tape. Police say one man was given an infringement notice after he did not move along when asked. A 37-year-old man and his 35-year-old female passenger were stopped by Bankstown Police on Bransgrove Road, Revesby. The man submitted to a roadside drug test which proved positive. Police searched the car and located a knife as well as four envelopes in the names of other people. The man was arrested and taken to Bankstown Police Station where he was charged with custody of a knife in a public place, and goods in custody. Police said the pair were also given infringement notices for not having a legitimate reason for being in public. Have you encountered police enforcing Australia\u2019s social distancing laws? Guardian Australia would like to hear about your experience. You can get in touch, anonymously if you wish, via a form here. NSW Health has released its daily Covid-19 update. Here are the key points: 104 new cases were diagnosed between 8pm Thursday and 8pm Friday. 251 patients are being treated in hospitals, including 41 in intensive care, 23 of whom require ventilators. 110 people currently in quarantine in Sydney hotels are being tested for Covid-19 after reporting symptoms. Tests have been done, with the results expected today (so we can expect to hear more about this by Sunday). NSW Health is alerting passengers who were close contacts on flights to monitor for symptoms. There is a second positive case at TAFE Ultimo that is unrelated to the first case. Contact tracing is underway. Parts of the TAFE remain open. A student at Bankstown Senior College has tested positive for Covid-19. Investigations are ongoing to trace close contacts. At the Rose of Sharon childcare centre in Blacktown there are now seven confirmed cases in staff, six confirmed cases in children, and 12 secondary cases (11 household contacts and one friend). The centre is closed. St Mary\u2019s Senior High School has one confirmed case, a student. The school is closed and investigations are ongoing. Gloucester Primary School has one confirmed case in a staff member. The school remains open as it has been over two weeks since staff member\u2019s last attendance. Ben Smee has written an updated piece on the Ruby Princess fallout. The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, has defended the role of health experts who allowed 2,700 passengers to disembark the Ruby Princess cruise ship and make their own way home, following reports that authorities knew about the widespread respiratory sickness on board. The NSW opposition has called for Hazzard to stand down, with the Labor leader, Jodi McKay, describing the incident as one of the most significant health failures in the state\u2019s history. The speed and volume of Covid-19 news has made it difficult to keep up with stories happening elsewhere. We\u2019ve started a new section ICYMI to help you catch up. Naaman Zhou has rounded up some of the big non-coronavirus stories of the past week: One of the messages coming through strongly at these press conferences today is governments are reminding people who are not frontline workers to stay home over Easter. \u201cWe want to make sure that people get the message that this Easter, stay-at-home. Don\u2019t travel, and certainly don\u2019t travel unnecessarily,\u201d Cook says. Cook speaks about the Artania: \u201cWhile the cruise ship remains in WA waters, the ship is under the control of the commonwealth,\u201d he says. \u201cThe WA Department of Health maintains a watching brief at this stage and we continue to liaise with the commonwealth to assist them with any patients or any passengers or crew that need hospitalisation.\u201d He says the ship is in lockdown for an isolation period of 14 days and the remaining crew on board are isolated to their cabins. \u201cObviously they have been on the boat now for quite a while, and we want to just simply have them quarantined to their quarters, isolating from each other, and they will undertake a period of self-isolation until we can be satisfied that there is no further potential outbreaks on board the ship,\u201d Cook says. \u201cAt that stage, we would like to see the ship move away from Australian waters, but that is under the control of the commonwealth.\u201d Cook says one of the new cases was in the Kimberley region. He says three medical teams have been deployed to the region, which is subject to tough travel restrictions. They will work with frontline staff already there. Roger Cook, Western Australia\u2019s health minister, is now speaking. He says there were 14 new cases of Covid-19 overnight, nine of which are Western Australian and the remaining five are related to the Artania cruise ship. The patients are aged between 26 and 84. Kelly is asked a question about why they are not recommending mask use for the broader public. He says one reason is the supply constraints. He says the other is that \u201cusing a mask incorrectly can actually make it more dangerous\u201d. \u201cIf you are not used to wearing a mask, it can become quite uncomfortable, even claustrophobic,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd indeed, it can become quite itchy underneath the mask. So touching a surface with the virus, scratching yourself underneath the mask, can in fact increase your risk rather than decrease your risk.\u201d Kelly is saying authorities are still not recommending the use of masks broadly in the community because of pressure on supplies. \u201cFor the moment, mask use is not recommended for the Australian public, and we can continue to look at ways, and indeed we are actively looking at ways of thinking about mask use into the future,\u201d he says. Kelly says while there are promising signs some of the measures taken to reduce physical contact are working, we need to remain \u201cvigilant\u201d. \u201cI really would caution against thinking we have got through this completely, because we definitely have not, and we really have to be hypervigilant now in collecting the information and making some decisions about what that means in terms of the people that are getting infected, the people that are getting sick, those that are using a hospital system, those that need to be admitted to intensive care, and so on,\u201d he says. He acknowledges the measures are tough. \u201cMany people have been separated from loved ones,\u201d he says. In my own family, there are people in New York, in the UK, in Italy. They cannot be seeing their parents at the moment, my siblings. So these are tricky times,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it is a difficult balancing act, which we will continue to be led by the data and information that we are gathering, experiences we are gathering from other parts of the world, for some months.\u201d The deputy chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, is speaking. He speaks first about the \u201cunfortunate\u201d rise in deaths in the past 24 hours, up by five to 30. He says the good news is that daily increases in new infections are less than they were a week ago. Labor has welcomed some of those changes the government has announced for temporary visa holders and migrant workers. Labor had been calling for relaxed conditions for \u201ctrapped\u201d temporary visa holders in Australia thrown into chaos by global travel bans and border closures. The conditions announced today include allowing backpackers to extend their visas and allowing temporary visa holders to access their superannuation. \u201cThe government has implemented Labor\u2019s calls to relax the requirements for fully qualified nurses in Australia on working holiday maker (WHM) visas to be able to continue working in hospitals rather than being forced to meet visa requirements \u2013 such as completing \u201cspecified work\u201d often picking fruit,\u201d Labor\u2019s Kristina Keneally and Andrew Giles said in a statement. But they said the announcements today didn\u2019t cover all temporary visa holders and migrant workers. \u201cLabor remains concerned for the hundreds of thousands of temporary visa holders in Australia who are trapped here, who can\u2019t go home, and are being forced out of their accommodation,\u201d they said. The United Workers Union, representing workers for Australia\u2019s largest out of hours school care provider, is calling for extra protection for staff and children. In a letter to management signed by 61 staff, Camp Australia workers called for increased access to hand sanitiser, temperature checks for children, and lower children-to-staff ratios so workers could properly care for children while also maintaining social distancing requirements. The United Workers Union says Camp Australia employees want staff currently not eligible for the jobkeeper payment under the government\u2019s guidelines, \u201cincluding international students and casuals who have been with the company for less than 12 months, to also receive the jobkeeper payment\u201d. Good afternoon everyone, Lisa Cox, here, taking over the blog from Melissa Davey. The ABC is reporting about 50 Qantas and Jetstar staff, including pilots and cabin crew, have tested positive for coronavirus. The company\u2019s medical officer Russell Brown yesterday told staff that, in addition to previously announced cases of baggage handlers, the airlines\u2019 numbers included eight pilots and 19 cabin crew, according to the ABC. \u201cMost of those were from overseas, but they were taking the precautions,\u201d Dr Brown said via a webinar. \u201cThey are wearing masks when flying and being careful, and we\u2019re still seeing these cases. \u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with a community that has more spread, the risk goes up, and we have to start thinking about what\u2019s going on here.\u201d Thanks so much for joining me for Guardian Australia\u2019s live coverage throughout the day. I am about to handover to my colleague Lisa Cox to take you through the afternoon. It has been quite an eventful Saturday, with a few key announcements. To recap: Cases in Australia have exceeded 5,500 and there are now 30 deaths after ACT Health reported on Saturday a man in his 80s died at Canberra Hospital. The ACT has had two deaths overall and 93 cases. Amid being called on to resign the NSW health minister Brad Hazzard has strongly defended the handling of the Ruby Princess cruise ship saga by senior health department officials. Changes to visa arrangements have been made. International students working in aged care, as nurses and in supermarkets have had the amount of hours they can work extended to support critical sectors. New Zealanders who are on 444 visas and arrived before 26 February 2001 will have access to welfare payments and the jobkeeper payment. Temporary skilled visa holders who have been stood down, but not laid off, will maintain their visa validity and businesses will have the opportunity to extend their visa as per normal arrangements. They will also be able to access up to $10,000 superannuation this financial year. Stay safe, and inside. Some tragic news from the UK overnight, where two nurses have died after acquiring Covid-19. Areema Nasreen, a 36-year-old NHS nurse from Walsall in the West Midlands, who was believed to have had no underlying health issues, died shortly after midnight on Thursday in intensive care at Walsall Manor hospital, where she had worked for 16 years. Tributes were also paid to another NHS nurse, mother of three Aimee O\u2019Rourke, who is is believed to have contracted the virus before she died. You can read more here. We are expecting the WA premier Mark McGowan to give an update at about 2.15pm AEDT, or 11.15am AWST. Here\u2019s where the situation in WA was as of Friday evening: I put out a call asking for your home gardening projects that you\u2019ve been working on in isolation and got some pretty lovely examples in response. While there are many tough aspects of having to stay home, it looks like some of you are using it as a chance to grow veggies and acquire a green thumb. Here are some of the best responses - thanks for sharing! I put a call out on Twitter earlier asking people what hobbies they\u2019ve picked up during isolation and the overwhelming response was \u201cgardening\u201d. There were reports over the past few weeks that some Bunnings stores had run out of seedlings as people rushed in to buy supplies for home garden projects. So for something a bit more positive, tweet your isolation gardening attempts good or bad at me @MelissaLDavey - I want to see your veggie patches, flower gardens and chickens. I\u2019ll share some of your responses a little later on this live blog. The week before Easter is traditionally very busy for supermarkets. AAP reports Coles and Woolworths have announced new measures to ensure their stores do not breach physical distancing rules during the expected surge next week. Both supermarkets will limit the number of customers allowed in-store, based on the size of the store. \u201cTeam members will be at store entrances to provide assistance and let you know when it is OK to come in,\u201d Coles chief executive Steven Cain said. Woolworths managing director Claire Peters said: \u201cTraditionally, the Thursday in the lead-up to Easter is one of our busiest times in-store. We ask our customers to pre-plan their Easter shopping to avoid the usual Thursday spike in numbers.\u201d Woolworths also announced it would be switching on its pick-up service on Monday for Priority Assistance customers. Family members, neighbours or friends will be able to collect goods. New South Wales opposition leader, Jodi McKay, has called for the NSW health minister Brad Hazzard to resign over the Ruby Princess cruise ship saga. She said: The Ruby Princess is one of the greatest public health failures in New South Wales history. Not only is this government responsible for the crisis, they have sought to cover it up every day since. The buck stops with the health minister. And as a result we are today calling for the health minister to stand aside. He must take responsibility. This is his agency. Australian Greens senator for NSW Dr Mehreen Faruqi has said that the federal government has abandoned international students to the risk of poverty and homelessness. Today the government confirmed it would provide no financial support for international student visa holders during the pandemic. Senator Faruqi has called for income support for international students during the Covid-19 crisis, saying: In this pandemic, international students have lost their jobs, found themselves unable to pay rent or put food on the table, and face living in squalid conditions. Hundreds of international students have contacted me over the last few days to share their stories of unemployment, financial stress and precarious living situations. Now, the government has confirmed they will not lift a finger to support these hundreds of thousands of students who we welcomed into our country and whose fees and work we\u2019ve all benefited from. International students contribute enormously to the Australian community. But the government has abandoned them completely. The government must extend the coronavirus supplement to international students and make jobkeeper payments available to them as well. Minister Tudge says students should look to family support to get them through this. But many of these students come from countries also severely impacted by the pandemic, where lockdowns and health crises have resulted in business closures and losses of income. Family support can no longer be relied upon.\u201d Tasmania has recorded six new cases overnight, including two regional hospital staff. The state government has announced an investigation into the situation. The tally in Tasmania is now 80. The total number of cases in Victoria is 1115 \u2013 an increase of 30 from yesterday. Last night a woman in her 70s died in hospital, taking the number of people who have died in Victoria from coronavirus to eight. The total number of cases in the state includes 587 men and 528 women. Cases range in age from babies to people in their early 90s. There are 73 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Victoria that may have been acquired through community transmission. More than 54,000 tests have been conducted to date. Currently 42 people are in hospital \u2013 including 10 patients in intensive care \u2013 and 527 people have recovered. Of the 1115 cases, there have been 894 in Melbourne and 209 in regional Victoria. A number of cases remain under investigation. Over to Victoria now where health minister Jenny Mikakos is giving an update. She says police carried out 391 checks on return travellers and of those 99 people were not at home. She says: That\u2019s incredibly disappointing. Those individuals are putting their fellow Victorians at risk. They are putting themselves and other members of the community at risk and it\u2019s really important that they understand that since last Sunday we have now been quarantining return travellers in hotels, but for those who returned prior to the start of those changes they are still required to self-quarantine for the full 14 days. No exceptions. So they need to be staying at home. OK I\u2019m going to leave that NSW Health press conference there because it\u2019s going around in circles and there are sound issues, plus there are a few updates that have come through in the meantime from Queensland. We will have a full story on that NSW press conference up a bit later, where the health minister defended senior health staff over the handling of the Ruby Princess cruise ship, saying they had made difficult decisions under immense pressure. But in Queensland there have been 27 new cases overnight, raising the state total to 900. The majority of cases are from patients who have travelled overseas, or have had direct contact with a confirmed case who had travelled overseas. Meanwhile Palm Island police have arrested and charged five men with breaches of the Biosecurity Act and chief health officer Queensland directions. On March 26, a determination was made under the Biosecurity Act restricting non-essential travel to designated remote communities, which included the community of Palm Island. Police allege that five men departed Palm Island in a private dingy on March 30 and travelled to Townsville. Townsville police spoke to the men and advised them they were not permitted to return to Palm Island. Police will allege all five men were located on Palm Island on April 3. Three men aged 19 and two men aged 30 and 46 have been arrested and charged with one count each of failing to comply with an emergency requirement and failing to comply with Covid-19 public health directions. One of the 19-year-old men was also charged with possessing dangerous drugs and two counts of supplying dangerous drugs (methamphetamines and cannabis). The 30-year-old man was also charged with possession of cannabis. All five men have been denied police bail and are due to appear in the Townsville Magistrates Court tomorrow. Townsville district disaster coordinator, acting chief superintendent Glen Pointing said: \u201cThe reckless actions of a few have placed the remainder of the Palm Island community at risk.\u201d \u201cIt is even more disappointing given the great work undertaken by the Palm Island council and broader community in putting measures in place to ensure their island is protected,\u201d he said It\u2019s also important to note that no ship has the capacity to test for Covid-19 on board. NSW health minister Brad Hazzard says New South Wales Health had assured him back on 14 February that they had stepped up their protocols. A when the new federal protocol came out, what New South Wales health was doing was actually far higher than those protocols. Under the federal protocol in place from 6 March, it was entirely discretionary as to whether those processes had to be followed. Hazzard says he\u2019s: ... not blaming the federal government here because it was evolving so fast at the time. As you would recall, this all was moving slowly, between mid-January and the end of January, we only had four people. But Health was still preparing and doing all they needed to do, doing all the work behind the scenes and they took it upon themselves to step up the protocol that they had previously applied for many years to other infectious diseases. So when the 6 March protocol came from the federal government, basically making it discretionary, they [NSW Health] didn\u2019t adopt that. The Health team, the senior practitioner, decided they were going to do an assessment on every ship and that is what they did. Given the risk assessment they did \u2013 regardless of federal advice they did not have to do an assessment \u2013 the NSW Health staff decided the ship was low risk as only flu was found, and at non-outbreak levels. However, they did order everyone to go home and self-isolate anyway, the chief health officer Kerry Chant says. I have to say NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant is doing a tough job here, calmly explaining the steps that led to senior public health officials making the decisions they did about the Ruby Princess cruise ship while the health minister takes a back seat. One reporter in particular keeps jumping in giving her a grilling and calling on her to resign. It needs to be said that Australia Border Force also had a role to play in this saga \u2013 it\u2019s not all on NSW Health who were following protocol and assessment processes in place at the time. Chant says: If I could just take you back to some of the facts. There was influenza circulating on the cruise ship. And we know that because the point of care test, is pretty accurate and showed it is influenza. So we know that influenza was circulating in that cruise ship, and the majority of patients, over half of the samples that were collected at the time, that the cause of illness was flu. Notwithstanding, it didn\u2019t breach the outbreak level of flu because that would have itself triggered a different response. Can I just assure the public, because I think this is really critical, New South Wales Health has learned lessons and had extensive planning under way to actually disembark people and passengers should we suspect Covid-19 on a cruise ship, or should that have been confirmed. We had always planned to ensure self-isolation for people in the Sydney region, safe transport home through use of health share and other modes of transport and also using hotels for the accommodation of people. If we had known that Covid was on this ship, or it had of been suspected, we would have chosen that way of disembarkation. Having said that, the people who acquired the infection, to the best of our knowledge, got it on the cruise ship. A couple of people may have acquired it earlier on with earlier onset dates and may have acquired it from other means. But certainly, the later ones acquired it on the cruise ship and the reason we suspect that amplified so quickly on the cruise ship was because we know some crew members were actually in the galley area, the food preparation area, when unwell and that would have led to a significant risk of transmission there. So the incubation period of the disease, just to refresh everybody\u2019s memory, is 14 days. We have been following up new cases and linking it to the Ruby Princess for that period because that reflects the fact that they were infected on that time. Be clear, the actions of New South Wales health on the day and the advice of the public health panel was based on the assessment of that information presented to them. They concluded it was a low risk, took the action and tested the results. But we would have got them off in a different way [if the risk assessment had of been high]. As I said, this goes to the fact that the clinicians knew there was activity in influenza. It was low-level influenza. A reporter asks NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant \u2013 who has worked tirelessly since the epidemic began \u2013 why her resignation isn\u2019t on the premier\u2019s desk over NSW Health\u2019s handling of the Ruby Princess. Hazzard answers the question, saying: Can I just say that the experts who made the decision were the best in the world. And the appropriate thing at this point is for the investigation to continue. I will make this point, too. Each of the staff of the chief health officer made the decision made it to the best of their ability. And those people are experts in their fields. Hazzard is now addressing criticisms of the handling of the Ruby Princess following reports overnight that NSW Health advisors let passengers disembark from the ship after exchanging emails with its physician and assessing the ship as \u201clow risk\u201d. A chain of emails has been leaked that indicate the department knew about the risk of coronavirus aboard the cruise. Seven of the ship\u2019s passengers have now died after getting the virus and more than 600 passenger are infected. Hazzard is angry at the criticisms, and has defended the handling of the situation by senior NSW Health staff. I have seen senior health staff, allI will say is that I have seen them extremely emotional because of the long hours they have worked and because of the challenges they are facing. And I find it disappointing in the strongest way possible that there can be any suggestion that those people are not doing their best. In general terms, can I just say, this city of ours is the gateway to Australia. In normal times we pride ourselves on that. We believe that we actually do lead the way in this country, through Sydney and through New South Wales. But part of that is we have more people coming through our airports and more people coming through our ports than any other state or territory. We have more cruise ships that come through the port of Sydney than any other port in Australia. In a normal course of events, there are about 300 of these cruise ships that come in through the port of Sydney every year. The very senior health staff that make the assessments on those cruise ships are actually among the world\u2019s best. There were four, generally, involved in each decision made [about the ships]. Four very senior health staff. They are specialist physicians, doctors with extraordinary training and experience in public health. We have people in that group who make these decisions who are consulting to the World Health Organization, in communicable diseases. When they make decisions, they make decisions the rest of us, if we were one-on-one with that doctor, would be very, very happy to have that advice. I would say to all of you in the public, and actually, it is not so much, I think, the public, there are others who are making comments, but I would say to people who are being critical, know that these frontline staff are sometimes working, as Dr Kerry Chant did, she won\u2019t want me to say this, but last Saturday she worked for 31 straight hours before she stood before the media. She hadn\u2019t slept. People don\u2019t do that unless they have extraordinary commitment to all of us. What I would say to the community and to those who are leaping to criticise is, take a step back, and realise that we need everyone of these people, who have worked their hearts out, worked every aspect, every possible thing they could do to keep us safe, and we should be very temperate and careful in any criticism of those people. I think if the average person got some of the criticism that was being thrown at them, they would say, \u2018I am not doing this job any more\u2019. NSW health minister Brad Hazzard is once again having a go at young people for disobeying social distancing measures. However, people of all ages have been seen breaking social distancing rules. However, Hazzard says: Some young people think it won\u2019t affect them, my message as health minister is be very aware this can have extremely deleterious health effects, you could possibly die from this. Young people who think they are not going to be affected, you are wrong. It is quite possible you will be. You won\u2019t be, perhaps, be affected to the extent older people will be, but you could be one of the unlucky ones. No doubt once this update and chastising of young people is over Hazzard will face a grilling over the handling of the Ruby Princess cruise ship saga. The NSW health minister Brad Hazzard made orders last night that there will be slight changes to funeral arrangements. Up until last night a funeral could have a total of 10 people including funeral staff and a celebrant or priest. Upon reflection and working with Victoria and the way that state has implemented the rules, Hazzard says there will now be 10 people allowed in attendance at funerals in addition to those officiating the service. Hazzard has also clarified that caravan parks in NSW can be used by overnight travellers by people, working in the local area and by people whose primary place of residence is unavailable. For example, some people lost their primary homes in bushfires, Hazzard said. He continues: Another issue causing anxiety was our truck drivers have found it challenging because truck stops and places they can stay and rest to comply with work safety requirements have closed. We reviewed that and we need to make sure our city and state functions as best it can and people have access to supplies they need. I want truck drivers to know now they can stop at truck stops and that truck stop operators know we want you to open up those truck stops.\u201d As of 8pm Friday there are a further 104 confirmed cases in NSW, the health minister says. Those additional cases make a total of 2,493. In the past 24 hours more than 3,500 tests have been carried out in NSW. That means 117,633 tests have now been undertaken in the state. Twelve people have died from Covid-19 in NSW. We mentioned that abrasive press conference from US president Donald Trump a little earlier. Here is more from the reporter Trump attacked. Acting immigration minister Alan Tudge said the government is making a number of changes to temporary visa holder arrangements. There are 2.17 million people presently in Australia on a temporary visa. There are more than 8,000 skilled medical professionals on temporary visas supporting the health system. While citizens, permanent residents and many New Zealanders have access to unconditional work rights and government payments (including the new jobkeeper and jobseeker payments), temporary visa holders do not. There has always been an expectation that temporary visa holders are able to support themselves while in Australia. But changes announced by the government today will help support those who may be stood down or lose work hours as a result of Covid-19. In line with changes being made for Australian citizens and permanent residents, most temporary visa holders with work rights will now be able to access their Australian superannuation to help support themselves during this crisis. Temporary visa holders who are unable to support themselves under these arrangements over the next six months are being strongly encouraged by the government to return home. International students are able to work up to 40 hours per fortnight. Those students working in aged care, as nurses and in supermarkets have now had these hours extended to support critical sectors. From 1 May, their hours will return to the maximum 40 hours a fortnight as more Australians are being recruited into these roles. New Zealanders who are on 444 visas and arrived before 26 February 2001 will have access to welfare payments and the jobkeeper payment. Those who arrived after 2001 have access to the jobkeeper payment. They do not have access to jobseeker or other welfare payments. Temporary skilled visa holders who have been stood down, but not laid off, will maintain their visa validity and businesses will have the opportunity to extend their visa as per normal arrangements. They will also be able to access up to $10,000 superannuation this financial year. And as we mentioned earlier, temporary visa changes to secure food supply and support farmers have also been announced. The Victorian health minister Jenny Mikakos and the state\u2019s deputy chief health officer are due to give an update at noon AEDT. In the meantime, Victoria Police have issued a statement saying police conducted 707 spot checks at homes, businesses and non-essential services across the state in the past 24 hours. Twenty-five fines have been issued in that time. The total number of fines is now 57. Since 21 March, police have conducted a total of 12,541 spot checks. The federal government will provide $32.5m to states and territories to immediately bolster frontline services to protect those most at risk of domestic violence as a result of living changes enforced due to the coronavirus pandemic. This week the inaugural Council of Australian Governments Women\u2019s Safety Council was held. It was agreed that, as a priority, funding should be directed to safer housing and emergency accommodation, counselling and outreach, crisis support and helplines as well as men\u2019s behavioural change programs and other perpetrator interventions. This initial round of funding includes a fixed 3% payment to all states and territories with the remainder provided on a per capita basis with a small contingency set aside. The money will flow this month to support services through to 30 June. $20m has already been committed to Commonwealth funded initiatives including 1800RESPECT, Mensline and a new national information campaign with clear information on where Australians experiencing violence during this period can access support. It follows a report on Thursday from Women\u2019s Safety NSW that the impact of Covid-19 was significant, with a higher percentage of frontline domestic violence workers reporting: An increase in client numbers overall (50% up from 41% the week prior) Increasing complexity of client needs (75% up from 70.8%) Escalating or worsening violence (50% up from 44.9%) Violence specifically relating to COVID-19 (50% up from 36.2%) A sharp increase in violence being reported for the first time (47.5% up from 15.9%) \u201cWhat we\u2019re observing is a ramping up on each indicator\u201d, Hayley Foster, Women\u2019s Safety NSW chief executive officer, said. \u201cNot only are we seeing increased client numbers in more locations, we\u2019re also seeing instances where the Covid-19 pandemic is contributing to more extreme violence and abuse as well as cases where violence is erupting in relationships for the first time.\u201d We have some brilliant virologists, epidemiologists and public health experts here in Australia and many of them who have been providing expertise on the Covid-19 response can be found on Twitter, sharing their thoughts about the latest data and developments. I thought I\u2019d share with readers a very quick round-up of just a few of them, because it\u2019s pretty cool to be able to have such access to these minds.

Just turning quickly to the US where once again, president Donald Trump is displaying hostility toward reporters in a press briefing. The US Centers for Disease Control has just recommended that US citizens wear non-medical cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (for example, in grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission. However, Trump said he wouldn\u2019t be taking this advice on board himself. \u201cI won\u2019t be doing it, personally,\u201d he said, adding he doesn\u2019t want to greet world leaders, \u201cpresidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens\u201d while wearing a face covering. \u201cI don\u2019t know, somehow, I don\u2019t see it for myself.\u201d More on the Ruby Princess saga. The Australian reports that it has obtained emails between NSW Health and Australian Border Force that show health officials did not board the cruise ship to test passengers for Covid-19 even though the cruise liner\u2019s on-board doctor told them explicitly in emails there were sick travellers on the ship. You can read the full report by The Australian\u2019s Yoni Bashan here. The New South Wales health minister, Brad Hazzard, and NSW chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, are due to give an update in a couple of hours, at 11am AEDT. I\u2019ll bring you updates from that here when it happens. Australia\u2019s national science agency CSIRO says zoonotic diseases \u2013 diseases which pass from animals to humans \u2013 such as Covid-19 and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) now account for almost 75% of human infectious diseases. This morning CSIRO announced that with the increasing threat of zoonotic diseases, $220m would be directed to upgrading CSIRO\u2019s containment biosecurity research facility in Geelong, Victoria, which is currently testing vaccines to combat the disease. The facility\u2019s rapid work on Covid-19 has also been supported by a further $10m in funding from the government. If you\u2019re interested in learning more about the spread of Covid-19 from bats to humans, here is some great listening for your Saturday morning. In this podcast episode ABC reporter and Science Friction host Natasha Mitchell asks what is it about bats that makes them such exceptional incubators of viruses that \u2013 if they jump species \u2013 can be so darn deadly to humans. She also asks whether before we blame bats for Covid-19, we need to take a good look at our ourselves. In case you missed it the chair of the Australian Healthcare Reform Alliance, Jennifer Doggett has written that maximising the value of our health system resources should be important every day, not just in the middle of a health crisis, and that private hospitals should not be allowed to return to \u2018business as usual\u2019 once the pandemic ends. She says: Most of our private hospitals are now operated on a \u2018for profit\u2019 basis and many are owned by companies based outside of Australia. Healthscope, Australia\u2019s second largest provider of private hospitals, is owned by Canadian private equity firm Brookfield. The third largest private hospital provider, Healthe Care, is part of the Luye Medical Group, owned by Chinese billionaire Liu Dian Bo. Their primary accountability is to their shareholders and not the Australian public. The negative impacts of this \u2018hands off\u2019 approach have been apparent in the difficulties experienced in mobilising private hospitals to support Australia\u2019s response to the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201d You can read the full piece here, and can follow her on Twitter here. The announcements are rolling in this morning. Following the release from the health minister outlined below, the department of agriculture has said temporary changes to visa arrangements are being made to help farmers get the workforce they need to secure Australia\u2019s food and produce supply during the pandemic. The changes allow those within the Pacific Labour Scheme, Seasonal Worker Program and working holiday makers to continue to work in agriculture and food processing until the coronavirus crisis has passed. Deputy prime minister Michael McCormack said the measure meant supporting businesses, providing job opportunities and securing food supply. He said: We can\u2019t afford to see fruit rotting on trees and vines and vegetables left unpicked. It is vital our farmers maximise their hard work and economic returns. We are acting to enable seasonal workers to extend their stay and remain lawfully in Australia until they are able to return to their home countries. The agriculture sector relies on an ongoing workforce and we are committed to providing the means for that to continue while ensuring strict health and safety measures are adhered to, including visa holders following self-isolation requirements when they move between regions.\u201d Before moving to other parts of the country, working holiday makers will need to self-isolate for 14 days and register at the Australia.gov.au website. Those who do not comply will face having their visas cancelled. The National Farmers Federation has developed best practice guidance for farmers regarding requirements for the living and working arrangements for farm workers during the Covid-19 outbreak. The key points: Seasonal Worker Programme and Pacific Labour Scheme workers can extend their stay for up to 12 months to work for approved employers. Approved employers will need to continue to ensure recruitment of Australians first. Working Holiday Makers who work in agriculture or food processing will be exempt from the six month work limitation with the one employer and eligible for a further visa to keep working in these critical sectors if their current visa is due to expire in the next six months. Greg Hunt has just issued a statement saying the government is investing $1.5m into support for clinicians to ensure they are given the best advice on managing Covid-19 patients. The National Covid-19 Clinical Evidence Taskforce will receive the funding from the Medical Research Future Fund to deliver guidelines on the clinical management of patients with suspected or confirmed cases. The Taskforce, which includes a large coalition of peak health professional bodies, will analyse emerging national and international research and data on Covid-19 to provide frontline health care workers with the most up-to-date information and advice. Their recommendations will be continually reviewed and updated in near real-time. The initial set of recommendations will be launched on Saturday and will address priority topics in urgent need of clear and unified guidance, including: Drug treatment of COVID-19 infection Use of oxygen therapies Key elements of critical care, and Disease categories and monitoring. The recommendations will be published in a mobile web app to make it easier for clinicians to access information at point of care. Four residents of Darwin tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday, and all cases are related to interstate or international travel, the Northern Territory chief minister said in a statement overnight. It brings the Territory\u2019s total to 26 cases. A Darwin man, aged in his 40s, had been in self-quarantine after returning home from Africa when he became unwell. Another man, in his 50s, became unwell while in self-quarantine after returning from the United Kingdom. A woman, aged in her 50s, who had travelled to South America became unwell while in self-quarantine. Under national medical guidelines, contact tracing on flights is not required due to the delay between their return to Darwin and becoming unwell. The fourth case, a woman in her 20s, was in self-quarantine and is a close family contact of another Territorian already diagnosed with Covid-19 who had returned from overseas. All four people are now in the care of Royal Darwin Hospital. Good morning, Melissa Davey joining you for another Saturday to bring you all of the Covid-19 updates for Australia throughout the day. If I miss anything, let me know at melissa.davey@theguardian.com or over at Twitter. Let\u2019s recap the last 24 hours or so by starting with some good news. Australia\u2019s chief health officer, Brendan Murphy, said he was \u201cquietly pleased\u201d with the numbers of new cases of Covid-19 slowing, with the rate of the number of new confirmed cases in single digits. However, community transmissions have been growing. There are now 300 community transmission cases in Sydney, 60 in Melbourne and 30 in Brisbane. Australia is now in the \u201csuppression\u201d phase of containing the virus, the prime minister said on Friday. In other updates: Last night, New South Wales Health confirmed that to date, there have been 342 confirmed cases of Covid-19 diagnosed in NSW related to Ruby Princess cruise ship passengers. Defending their handling of the debacle, NSW Health said \u201cTransmission of Covid-19 amongst these passengers could not have been prevented by NSW Health staff. No cases of Covid-19 were identified on board the ship before it docked. The vast majority of these passengers reported they did not develop symptoms until after leaving the Ruby Princess.\u201d Australia\u2019s death toll for Covid-19 is now 28, after WA premier Mark McGowan said on Friday afternoon that a passenger from the Artania cruise ship, in his 60s, had died. My colleague, federal political reporter Daniel Hurst, wrote a handy explainer about what the government\u2019s free childcare package in response to the virus means for you. Meanwhile, sociologist Eva Cox asks whether the announcement is too good to be true. Calls are growing for governments to support the evacuation of Aboriginal elders from remote and regional communities as Covid-19 spreads, indigenous affairs editor, Lorena Allam, reports. Australia exceeded 5,300 confirmed cases on Friday. After seemingly endless back and forth about whether Australia\u2019s modelling on coronavirus will be made public, the prime minister said this information will be released by the government next week after more work, and review by the national cabinet. It is a complex data-set to release. Thanks for joining me this morning, and I hope everyone is coping okay with isolation, checking in on their neighbours, and managing to get out for fresh air and maybe even a cheeky kebab without copping a fine.",

      "bodyText": "Good evening, and welcome to our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. These are the main stories on Saturday 4 April. Two more deaths as cases exceed 5,500 The number of cases in Australia reached 5,544 on Saturday and the death toll rose to 30. A woman in her 70s died in hospital in Victoria on Friday night and a man in his 80s died at the Canberra Hospital in the ACT on Saturday. NSW recorded an additional 104 cases, Victoria recorded 30 new cases and Western Australia 14, nine of which are Western Australian and five linked to the Artania cruise ship. NSW Health said on Saturday that 110 people in quarantine in Sydney hotels had been tested for coronavirus after showing symptoms. They were expected to receive their results on Saturday. Masks still not recommended for Australian public The deputy chief health officer, Paul Kelly, advised the wider public against wearing face masks, in part due to supply constraints, and also because \u201cincorrect use can actually make it more dangerous\u201d. He said that authorities were continuing to look at mask use and advice may change in the future. Largest peacetime maritime operation in Sydney Harbour New South Wales police conducted the largest maritime operation in Sydney Harbour outside of wartime to move crew and supplies between a series of stranded cruise ships before they depart Australian waters. Guardian Australia understands crew members on four Royal Caribbean ships \u2013 Celebrity Solstice, Ovation of the Seas, Voyager of the Seas and Spectrum of the Seas \u2013 are being sorted into groups according to their country of origin before the ships depart Australian waters. Crew members have expressed concerns that the effect of the transfers will be to spread the contagion across several ships. Brad Hazzard called to resign over Ruby Princess disaster The New South Wales health minister has defended health officials after leaked emails showed the doctor on board the Ruby Princess told authorities on 18 March that people who had presented at the onboard medical clinic with flu-like symptoms had tested negative for influenza. The next day, 2,700 passengers were allowed to disembark and make their way home before test swabs had been analysed by state health authorities. NSW Labor leader Jodi McKay has described the incident as one of the most significant health failures in the state\u2019s history and called on Hazzard to stand down. Changes for temporary visa holders Changes have been made to some temporary visas to support essential industries during the coronavirus pandemic. International students working in aged care, as nurses and in supermarkets have had the amount of hours they can work extended to support critical sectors. New Zealanders who are on 444 visas and arrived before 26 February 2001 will have access to welfare payments and the jobkeeper payment. Temporary skilled visa holders who have been stood down, but not laid off, will maintain their visa validity and businesses will have the opportunity to extend their visa as per normal arrangements. They will also be able to access up to $10,000 superannuation this financial year. In other changes, working holiday makers who work in agriculture or food processing will be exempt from the six-month work limitation with the one employer and eligible for a further visa to keep working in these critical sectors and Seasonal Worker Programme and Pacific Labour Scheme workers can extend their stay for up to 12 months to work for approved employers. CSIRO puts $220m towards upgrade of biosecurity research facility Australia\u2019s national science agency CSIRO says zoonotic diseases \u2013 diseases which pass from animals to humans such as Covid-19 and Sars \u2013 now account for almost 75% of human infectious diseases.

Rather, those who have aggressively advocated pursuit of narrowly defined \u201cnational interests\u201d at any cost are doubling down. The consequences of this posturing are many. In Iran, urban administrators are left facing an unprecedented public health crisis. Figures show that 3,160 had died from the disease by 2 April and there are more than 50,000 cases of infection. The rate of infections is not yet slowing, and many of them are in Tehran, the city of which I am mayor. Doubtless there are things that we could do differently, like every country in the world. But we are operating against the backdrop of the most extreme sanctions regime in history. The US embargo not only prohibits American companies and individuals from conducting lawful trade with Iranian counterparts, but given that the sanctions are extra-territorial, all other countries and companies are also bullied into refraining from doing legitimate business with Iranians, even the selling of medicines. As a result, the ability of my colleagues and I to provide the health, logistical and other essential infrastructure necessary to combat the disease has been drastically reduced. We experience this loss every day, and it can be counted in people that would not have died. This unjust treatment of Iran has come about via the policies of one country \u2013 the United States \u2013 whose ruling administration does not seem to prioritise even its own national interests, but instead the narrow interests of a governing party. The outcome of such irresponsible policies and behaviour is not limited to Iran; they have also inflicted harm on the American public. Indeed, the Donald Trump administration\u2019s refusal to halt its economic warfare against Iran is directly impeding our efforts to deal with a virus which knows no borders. Is it in the US\u2019s national interest for the coronavirus pandemic to become permanent? In order to better confront these new global crises, there is a need for politicians to realise that the path to pursuing national interests is not separate or contrary to that of global interests and international accountability. Of equal importance, it must be recognised that as long as the general consensus in international politics does not actively move toward reducing injustice and inequality beyond national and racial boundaries, global crises will continue to indiscriminately endanger every country in the world. The world cannot go on like this. If global leaders fail to seize the opportunity to embrace change, we will all continue to remain highly vulnerable to communicable diseases, environmental catastrophes, global warming, terrorism, violent extremism and other shared threats. \u2022 Pirouz Hanachi is the mayor of Tehran",

They are confident that God is in control; that this is part of his overall plan before a great end-times spiritual revival.\u201d</p> <p>He said: \u201cThere are those who also understand this in terms of \u2018spiritual warfare\u2019, and that Jesus gave Christians authority over every demon and sickness.

A sometime guest on Infowars and at the White House; a multi-level marketing kingpin who has alleged that Hollywood celebrities sacrifice children and that New Zealand\u2019s Christchurch mosque attack was a so-called false flag event; Howard-Browne described Covid-19 as a \u201cphantom plague\u201d on 15 March. In the same sermon, he claimed the public health response to the virus was part of a plot involving the Rockefeller Foundation and World Health Organization, whose goals were forced vaccinations and mass murder. Howard-Browne has repeatedly refused to call off services in the interests of social distancing. In fact, in recent weeks he has insisted that his congregants embrace and shake hands, exhorting them that they were \u201crevivalists, not pansies\u201d. On Monday, he was finally arrested for violating Florida\u2019s rules on social distancing. There are other American religious leaders and preachers who are in equally deep denial about the potentially deadly virus which will almost certainly infect a significant proportion of evangelicals, along with all other Americans. Roy Moore, a pastor, former Alabama supreme court judge and failed Trump-backed Alabama Senate candidate who lost amid allegations of sexual misconduct with underage girls, told Facebook followers he would write a letter to his fellow pastors on what he called their \u201cduty to continue church assemblies, even in the midst of these trying times\u201d. Moore added: \u201cOur faith requires it, our duty demands it, and no law or government can prohibit it.\u201d Kenneth Copeland, a Texas-based \u201cprosperity gospel\u201d preacher who once defended his ownership of three private jets on the grounds that commercial flights would require him to \u201cget in a long tube with a bunch of demons\u201d, told viewers of his Victory Channel in early March that coronavirus was a \u201cweak\u201d strain of the flu, and that fearing the pandemic was a sin. \u201cFear is a spiritual force. Fear is not OK. It is sin. It is a magnet for sickness and disease \u2026 You are giving the devil a pathway to your body,\u201d Copeland said. He also criticized pastors who had suspended in-person services and moved to online streaming. Self-described prophet Lance Walnau wrote in a blogpost that \u201cthis virus will touch just a fraction of the population\u201d, adding that it was less dangerous than seasonal flu. He turned to conspiracy theory for an explanation of the public health response and associated media coverage. \u201cThe left wants the economy distressed because crisis improves their chances of taking office,\u201d Walnau wrote. He then counseled readers to ignore the information being published by media outlets. \u201cThere is a spirit on media that will exaggerate this virus so badly that you will need to insulate your head in order to keep yourself free from paranoia,\u201d Walnau wrote. In the rightwing Catholic-aligned religious journal First Things, meanwhile, editor RR Reno castigated the widespread closure of Catholic churches and the suspension of public masses in Rome. Reno wrote: \u201cIt is imperative that Christian leaders not succumb to the contagious panic, which is a weapon of the enemy to enslave us to our fears.\u201d From Montana, Chuck Baldwin \u2013 a pastor, former politician and purveyor of conspiracy theories about \u201cZionist influence\u201d in the media \u2013 left the question of whether the virus was a hoax open in an online sermon. But he added: \u201cIf it\u2019s not a hoax, the virus is being used as a completely exaggerated, super-hyped, super-inflated psychological ops campaign against the American people \u2013 a coordinated full-court press of intimidation and fear-mongering by government, the mass media and the CDC.\u201d That message was dutifully amplified by the Idaho state representative Heather Scott on her Facebook page. Others on the Christian right acknowledge the reality of the virus, but proffer supernatural causes or remedies. In a blogpost last week, Ralph Drollinger, who has led Bible study for Trump cabinet members, suggested the virus was an instrument of divine judgment, and appeared to blame LGBTQ people. Drollinger later claimed that this was a misinterpretation. Another would-be prophet, Jeremiah Johnson, claimed last week to have had a prophetic dream in which God had spoken to him. In a baseball stadium where Trump, at bat, outwitted a demonic pitcher, Johnson said God had told him: \u201cThe enemy has intended to strike out Donald Trump at a very critical hour in history. But behold, supernatural help is on the way, for I will slow down the advancement of the enemy and allow him to knock this out of the park.\u201d Andr\u00e9 Gagne, an associate professor of theological studies at Concordia University, and a researcher of the Christian right, recently published on the phenomenon of coronavirus denialism among evangelicals. Asked why evangelical leaders are committed to taking such a risk in denying the reality of the infection, or even assisting its spread, Gagne said it was rooted in their theology. \u201cMany of these preachers believe Christians shouldn\u2019t be controlled by a \u2018spirit of fear\u2019,\u201d Gagne said. \u201cThey often quote biblical texts which promise God\u2019s healing and protection to those who have faith. They are confident that God is in control; that this is part of his overall plan before a great end-times spiritual revival.\u201d He said: \u201cThere are those who also understand this in terms of \u2018spiritual warfare\u2019, and that Jesus gave Christians authority over every demon and sickness. And if a Christian dies, no worries: he or she will \u2018be with the Lord\u2019.\u201d Meanwhile, even where they disagree about the virus, religious leaders have found common ground on one subject: the importance of fundraising. While Trump\u2019s spiritual adviser Paula White-Cain has now recommended social distancing to her audience, she and Kenneth Copeland both encouraged their listeners to keep the donations rolling into their churches.",

But not all isolation is welcome \u2013 or chosen \u2013 and even solo sailors are social creatures. After too long alone last winter, I sailed to the Sardinian city of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/aug/02/holiday-guide-sardinias-best-beaches-restaurants-hotels\">Olbia</a> and turned to that old-school travel platform <a href=\"https://www.couchsurfing.com/\">Couchsurfer</a>, effectively asking people to be my friend. \u201cI don\u2019t need a bed,\u201d I messaged strangers, \u201cbut fancy a coffee?\u201d I made amazing friends \u2013 and learned a lesson in setting pride aside to admit you\u2019re lonely.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba88211dd64c02864ffce69fc0329b40f83f3178\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba88211dd64c02864ffce69fc0329b40f83f3178/0_82_4538_2724/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kalamata, before the curfew.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kalamata, before the curfew.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cat Vinton/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However independent you are, emotional support is vital when you\u2019re far from loved ones.

Storms at anchor are marked by small gestures from others \u2013 the guy in Falmouth who raised a glass from his cockpit as I waved at him in a howling gale; the time on the island of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/jul/31/aeolian-islands-cookery-holidays-jeremy-head\">Vulcano </a>, north of Sicily, when a neighbour, sensing my anxiety as we veered in 60mph winds, messaged approval of my anchor\u2019s set, unspoken reassurance that I wouldn\u2019t drag off to sea.

Never underestimate it.</p> <p>The challenge of isolation in bad weather is boredom, particularly when your inside space is less than six square metres. But overriding that is the relief that you\u2019re safe. Living at sea, you take risk seriously (a neighbour in Portugal was lost overboard in high winds).

You learn to appreciate your home even more making it cosy \u2013 being grateful for its sanctuary when there\u2019s a threat outside. You are aware of how precious life is on a regular basis.</p> <p>Simple daily rhythms bring enormous comfort. During 10 days of storm in Villasimius, Sardinia, Radio 4\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0bggw4z\">Book at Bedtime</a> happened to be Jaws. Perfect! There\u2019s the day\u2019s first cup of tea; appreciating the light at sunset; waiting for the plough to appear in the sky; a good dinner. I find cooking therapeutic. But when the boat is leaping about in a storm, and your home is liable to fling kitchen knives at your head, it\u2019s best, I\u2019ve learned, to stick to store-cupboard soups and stews.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4730cf259d39d89c4bec035be7cee6d37d5f93e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4730cf259d39d89c4bec035be7cee6d37d5f93e/0_331_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Susan Smillie on boat cooking\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I started making flatbreads in a frying pan.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cat Vinton/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This won\u2019t be popular advice, or easy, but try to limit internet use. Technical things can go wrong. (For the same reason, I never totally rely on my engine at sea, because bitter experience has taught me it will cut out just as I\u2019m pushed towards some hazard: in Brittany\u2019s notorious Chenal du Four, and again while racing an oncoming storm to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/jun/30/elba-island-italy-emylia-hall-tuscan-archipelago\">Elba</a>\u2019s safe harbour in the Tuscan archipelago). Too much screen time is bad for us anyway, and if we collectively crash the internet through overuse or become vulnerable to viruses (not that one), we are going to be bereft. A reliance on solar power and a cap on data means I use it sparingly \u2013 brilliant journalism to inform, social media to connect, music to lift my spirits, but increasingly I\u2019m turning to nourishing things that can\u2019t fail \u2013 books, cloudspotting, writing, growing herbs. And exercise \u2013 if I can manage some stretching positions in the 2x1 metres of flat space I have, anyone can. It occurred to me yesterday that I could use a mooring line to do some skipping on the harbour wall here at Pylos. In theory. I\u2019m wondering, too, whether a swim around the boat breaks the lockdown. Think I\u2019ll risk it.</p> <p>When your world slows down, food becomes a huge part of your day. And as shopping trips are limited, it\u2019s important to choose fresh stuff that lasts. I\u2019ve learned what keeps best without a fridge \u2013 cabbage, aubergines, courgettes, yoghurt, eggs (turn them regularly) \u2013 and don\u2019t waste a thing (I avoid carrots and broccoli as they deteriorate surprisingly quickly). I make sure I have a breakfast I love \u2013 pancakes or porridge with fruit compote. Toast (currently running low on Marmite, sob!). As favourite things become difficult to get, I adapt. In Italy I missed Greek yoghurt, then realised how simple it is to make. Likewise butter.</p> <p>Finding myself with a load of fish in the little fishing village of Culatra, in Portugal, I learned to fillet and salt them \u2013 new skills, and protein for weeks. At sea 20 nautical miles from the nearest shop in Menorca and craving bread, I started making flatbreads in a frying pan. I\u2019m currently wondering if I could somehow bake a rudimentary loaf in my lidded barbecue (my first Christmas on board, it roasted a whole chicken and potatoes). I\u2019m also pondering either a barbecue or frying-pan cake. It must be possible, right? If there\u2019s ever been a time for experimentation, it is now. Play with food, have fun with it \u2013 but don\u2019t waste it, obviously.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is extraordinarily satisfying to break an addiction to consumption \u2013 I keep a geeky diary of how little I spend</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Things will be tight for many of us newly without income. Without trivialising the seriousness of this, I can at least report that it is extraordinarily satisfying to reduce spending, to break addiction to consumption. I keep a geeky diary of how little I spend day to day (\u00a360 a week on average): writing it down brings more pleasure than spending it. And there is now time to fix things. Repairing rather than replacing is so rewarding \u2013 working with a small budget forces us to be greener and I feel happier as a result. I\u2019ve never been practical (understatement \u2013 I once used a rag to replace a mislaid oil cap in my car and seized the engine), so learning to service my boat engine has been surprisingly satisfying. The pleasure I got from rowing to an empty little cove in Pylos harbour the other day, after spending three days fixing my dinghy, was a high. I think all proper sailors have repaired their toilet. Once you\u2019ve done that, you can tackle anything. Coping in storms and fixing things are two of the things that have amazed me about myself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"238e23fc7503fb8c570a0388f01b88cda88a2e6b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/238e23fc7503fb8c570a0388f01b88cda88a2e6b/0_319_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Susan Smillie fixing her boat sail\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018There is now time to fix things.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cat Vinton/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The strangest thing for sailors, so used to freedom, is to be trapped \u2013 boats shouldn\u2019t be in a harbour in good weather, and we itch to leave. The sacrifice of living in a small space and the effort of maintaining this lifestyle are the price we pay for that freedom. Now that freedom is curtailed \u2013 but it must be. We have the reserves to adapt and find happiness. I\u2019m focusing on the beauty of the natural world immediately around me: the birds that fly around the harbour at sunset, the fish nibbling the quay, the crabs scuttling below. I\u2019m taking enormous comfort from the fact that whatever else we\u2019ve done to them, other species appear to be largely untouched by this thing. The natural world is getting much-needed respite from our reduction in activity and pollution levels. And most importantly, people are noticing, and sharing joy about that. We are becoming aware that this is a chance for real change, and that is the biggest positive of all. When this is over, so too will be the narrative that we can\u2019t change our systems, our society, ourselves. Let\u2019s use this time wisely \u2013 the planet urgently needs change, and so do we.</p>",

This won\u2019t be popular advice, or easy, but try to limit internet use. Technical things can go wrong. (For the same reason, I never totally rely on my engine at sea, because bitter experience has taught me it will cut out just as I\u2019m pushed towards some hazard: in Brittany\u2019s notorious Chenal du Four, and again while racing an oncoming storm to Elba\u2019s safe harbour in the Tuscan archipelago). Too much screen time is bad for us anyway, and if we collectively crash the internet through overuse or become vulnerable to viruses (not that one), we are going to be bereft. A reliance on solar power and a cap on data means I use it sparingly \u2013 brilliant journalism to inform, social media to connect, music to lift my spirits, but increasingly I\u2019m turning to nourishing things that can\u2019t fail \u2013 books, cloudspotting, writing, growing herbs. And exercise \u2013 if I can manage some stretching positions in the 2x1 metres of flat space I have, anyone can. It occurred to me yesterday that I could use a mooring line to do some skipping on the harbour wall here at Pylos. In theory. I\u2019m wondering, too, whether a swim around the boat breaks the lockdown. Think I\u2019ll risk it. When your world slows down, food becomes a huge part of your day. And as shopping trips are limited, it\u2019s important to choose fresh stuff that lasts. I\u2019ve learned what keeps best without a fridge \u2013 cabbage, aubergines, courgettes, yoghurt, eggs (turn them regularly) \u2013 and don\u2019t waste a thing (I avoid carrots and broccoli as they deteriorate surprisingly quickly). I make sure I have a breakfast I love \u2013 pancakes or porridge with fruit compote. Toast (currently running low on Marmite, sob!). As favourite things become difficult to get, I adapt. In Italy I missed Greek yoghurt, then realised how simple it is to make. Likewise butter. Finding myself with a load of fish in the little fishing village of Culatra, in Portugal, I learned to fillet and salt them \u2013 new skills, and protein for weeks. At sea 20 nautical miles from the nearest shop in Menorca and craving bread, I started making flatbreads in a frying pan. I\u2019m currently wondering if I could somehow bake a rudimentary loaf in my lidded barbecue (my first Christmas on board, it roasted a whole chicken and potatoes). I\u2019m also pondering either a barbecue or frying-pan cake. It must be possible, right? If there\u2019s ever been a time for experimentation, it is now. Play with food, have fun with it \u2013 but don\u2019t waste it, obviously. Things will be tight for many of us newly without income. Without trivialising the seriousness of this, I can at least report that it is extraordinarily satisfying to reduce spending, to break addiction to consumption. I keep a geeky diary of how little I spend day to day (\u00a360 a week on average): writing it down brings more pleasure than spending it. And there is now time to fix things. Repairing rather than replacing is so rewarding \u2013 working with a small budget forces us to be greener and I feel happier as a result. I\u2019ve never been practical (understatement \u2013 I once used a rag to replace a mislaid oil cap in my car and seized the engine), so learning to service my boat engine has been surprisingly satisfying. The pleasure I got from rowing to an empty little cove in Pylos harbour the other day, after spending three days fixing my dinghy, was a high. I think all proper sailors have repaired their toilet. Once you\u2019ve done that, you can tackle anything. Coping in storms and fixing things are two of the things that have amazed me about myself. The strangest thing for sailors, so used to freedom, is to be trapped \u2013 boats shouldn\u2019t be in a harbour in good weather, and we itch to leave. The sacrifice of living in a small space and the effort of maintaining this lifestyle are the price we pay for that freedom. Now that freedom is curtailed \u2013 but it must be. We have the reserves to adapt and find happiness. I\u2019m focusing on the beauty of the natural world immediately around me: the birds that fly around the harbour at sunset, the fish nibbling the quay, the crabs scuttling below. I\u2019m taking enormous comfort from the fact that whatever else we\u2019ve done to them, other species appear to be largely untouched by this thing. The natural world is getting much-needed respite from our reduction in activity and pollution levels. And most importantly, people are noticing, and sharing joy about that. We are becoming aware that this is a chance for real change, and that is the biggest positive of all. When this is over, so too will be the narrative that we can\u2019t change our systems, our society, ourselves. Let\u2019s use this time wisely \u2013 the planet urgently needs change, and so do we.",

At least 60 of the club\u2019s 850 globe-trotting members have reportedly been struck down with Covid-19, while one \u2013 the septuagenarian businesswoman Mirna Bandeira de Mello \u2013 has died and been laid to rest during a funeral attended by no one but her son. \u201cIn normal times there would have been millions at her burial,\u201d Christiano Bandeira de Mello lamented in an interview with the Brazilian magazine \u00c9poca. Anna Maria Ramalho, a society columnist who had known the victim since school, said she had been forced to say goodbye by logging on to an online mass. \u201cI\u2019ve lost a life-long friend,\u201d she said. \u201cShe was such a special person, so very down-to-earth.\u201d Coronavirus appears to have breached the country club\u2019s white wooden gates \u2013 just metres from Ipanema beach \u2013 on the afternoon of 7 March \u2013 although exactly how is now a topic of bitter dispute. Hours earlier, descendants of Brazil\u2019s former royal family had gathered at a nearby mansion to toast the engagement of 31-year-old Pedro Alberto de Orl\u00e9ans e Bragan\u00e7a \u2013 the great-great-great grandson of Brazil\u2019s last emperor, Pedro II \u2013 and his 26-year-old partner, Alessandra Fragoso Pires. Guests included Pires\u2019 mother and stepfather, who had jetted in from their home in London, and others from Belgium, Italy and the United States. More than half of the 70-or-so people at the lunch have since tested positive for Covid-19 including the bride\u2019s father and grandfather and the groom\u2019s aunt. Three remain in hospital, in serious condition. \u201cIt\u2019s just horrible,\u201d said one family member who attended the celebration and asked not to be named. \u201cNobody could have imagined the virus would strike with such devastating force.\u201d After lunch, several guests spent the afternoon at the \u201ccountry\u201d \u2013 sparking speculation they had caused its coronavirus cluster \u2013 something strenuously denied by one friend of Brazil\u2019s former monarchy. \u201cOne thing has nothing to do with the other,\u201d they insisted. \u201cNobody knows what happened \u2013 who brought it [the virus] and who didn\u2019t. They were surprised by this.\u201d Whatever the truth, two days later on 9 March, coronavirus continued to contaminate the club\u2019s illustrious membership. At a packed assembly \u2013 reportedly convened to thrash out a dispute between its old guard and a new generation of associates who lack the traditional surnames of past members, but not their deep pockets \u2013 cross words, and then kisses and hugs were exchanged. \u201cLots of people lost their fortunes in the financial crisis \u2013 people who were stinking rich and ended up with nothing \u2013 so they had to sell their membership,\u201d one prominent Rio socialite said of the generational tug-of-war at the club where members are chosen by secret ballot and it costs around \u00a370,000 to join. The 270-strong audience also included people who were at the imperial family\u2019s commemoration \u2013 further fueling suspicions they were to blame for the outbreak. \u201cIt was a tense meeting, big names in business were there,\u201d the high-society source said. \u201cSeveral people left the meeting infected.\u201d The country club is not the only oasis of Brazilian prosperity and influence touched by coronavirus. A pop star, an actress and the daughter of a top government official were infected during a celebrity wedding at a beach resort that boasts of being \u201cconceived with the philosophy of exclusiveness\u201d. Some affluent guests had reportedly flown in from holidays in Europe and Aspen, Colorado. Brazil\u2019s presidential palace has also been hit, with more than 20 members of a delegation that flew to meet Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate testing positive for Covid-19. The president, Jair Bolsonaro, claims he tested negative but has refused to make those results public. The connection between the spread of coronavirus and Brazil\u2019s super-rich has sparked discussion over their role in introducing the ailment to Brazil \u2013 and the gulf between rich and poor in one of the most unequal societies on earth. Many fear that while the first coronavirus wave has crashed over Brazil\u2019s largely white political and economic elite, it is the poor and mostly black masses who will eventually suffer the most \u2013 without the luxury of being able to self-isolate at home or resort to expensive private hospitals. One of the first deaths recorded in Brazil was that of Cleonice Gon\u00e7alves, a 63-year-old domestic helper who was reportedly infected by her wealthy employer when she returned from holiday in Italy. \u201cIt goes without saying that the most vulnerable will always be the most affected, irrespective of whether there is a pandemic or not,\u201d the black feminist intellectual Djamila Ribeiro wrote in the Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper recently. \u201cThese are structural issues.\u201d Others, including some country club members, wonder whether some of Brazil\u2019s mega-moneyed coronavirus patients exposed others to the illness by failing to properly isolate or quarantine themselves \u2013 perhaps believing their economic status meant they were above such mundane measures. One Brazilian tycoon is reportedly being investigated by police for allegedly flying his private jet to the beach last month despite having tested positive for Covid-19. The man \u2013 an investment banker who denies the charges \u2013 is accused of infecting at least two locals in Trancoso, a glamorous seaside town in Bahia state. Rio de Janeiro \u2013 which has so far suffered 1074 coronavirus cases and 47 deaths \u2013 has been in lockdown since late March, forcing a succession of high-society soir\u00e9es to be scrapped. Among the aborted events was a bash for 1,000 people at the beachfront Copacabana Palace hotel to celebrate the marriage of Alexandre Birman, a multi-millionaire footwear designer who makes crocodile and snakeskin shoes for Hollywood stars. A confidant of the Orl\u00e9ans e Bragan\u00e7a family said they had more pressing concerns with two relatives still in intensive care. \u201cThey feel sad, apprehensive and worried \u2026 They are frightened with all this repercussion,\u201d they said. Some have pointed an accusing finger at Brazil\u2019s jet-setting elites for importing the illness after eye-wateringly expensive overseas adventures, with one left-wing website last week announcing: \u201cThe rich and famous have spread coronavirus around Brazil.\u201d Another blog declared: \u201cThe rich have contaminated Brazil.\u201d But a guest at the royal family\u2019s fateful lunch said it was wrong to scapegoat the wealthy for a sickness uninterested in social class. \u201cBoth poor and rich are dying all around the world,\u201d they said. \u201cPeople who travel more might have caught it first but the virus doesn\u2019t choose its victims. It can attack anyone.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Will the coronavirus change the way we spend, shop and invest our money, long after the virus is history? Will we abandon city centre offices, with many more permanently working from home? Or will we return to all our past practices once this grim episode is over?</p> <p>Guardian Money asked experts in finance, the workplace, property, food and the environment to set out what they think will emerge in the medium term.</p> <h2><strong>Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary, TUC</strong></h2> <p><em>\u2018We can\u2019t go back to business as usual\u2019</em></p> <p>Right now the priority has to be fighting Covid-19. But we also have to prepare for the coming recession, and the impact it will have on working families\u2019 jobs and living standards.</p> <p>One thing is clear: even once we\u2019re through this crisis, we can\u2019t go back to business as usual.</p> <p>Individualism, nationalism and free market economics couldn\u2019t surmount this crisis. Instead, in an emergency, it was common purpose, collectivism and social partnership that stepped up.</p> <p>We\u2019ve seen what we can achieve working together and thinking differently \u2013 people staying at home to protect our NHS, businesses and unions working together to keep people in their jobs, manufacturers switching production to life-saving ventilators, neighbours all over the country shopping for older people nearby.</p> <p>We\u2019ve been reminded of how much we all depend on the labour of ordinary working people to keep our homes and our country running. It\u2019s not right that many of the workers we have needed the most \u2013 carers, shop workers, cleaners, warehouse staff, delivery drivers \u2013 still get paid the least.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9964de3c3882b44dba1518d13d8a930614266797\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9964de3c3882b44dba1518d13d8a930614266797/14_26_5112_3067/1000..jpg\" alt=\"A supermarket delivers to a house during the coronavirus lockdown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A supermarket delivers to a house during the coronavirus lockdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Finnbarr Webster/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During this crisis a Conservative government found it necessary to bring unions and civil society into the room \u2013 as well as business. The solutions we found together aren\u2019t perfect but they show the potential of a different kind of leadership.</p> <p>After this immediate crisis is done, we need to remember what worked in an emergency \u2013 and use it to bring in a new era of sharing power, responsibility and wealth. After all, in the aftermath of the pandemic, we still need to tackle the challenges of inequality, new technology and the climate crisis, too.</p> <p>That means finding a new role for collective bargaining, to protect livelihoods. It means making sure businesses aren\u2019t just profit-making machines but instead have a social purpose.</p> <p>We can\u2019t repeat what happened after the 2008 crash, when big banks and corporations bounced back but working families paid the price. Real wages only returned to their pre-2008 levels in early 2020 \u2013 immediately before coronavirus hit.</p> <p>While right now many of us simply want things to return to normal, the reality is that some things have changed for good. We know the years ahead won\u2019t be easy.</p> <p>But together we can build a new normal, where we all get our fair share and can provide a decent life for ourselves and our families. Collectivism is for life \u2013 not just in a crisis.</p> <h2><strong>Terry Smith, manager of </strong><strong>the \u00a317bn Fundsmith Equity</strong></h2> <p><em>\u2018No one seems able to sell everything and buy back at the bottom\u2019</em></p> <p>What should investors do in the current market panic? Four strategies spring to mind:</p> <p>1. Sell everything and buy back at the bottom</p> <p>2. Try to buy those companies which will benefit from the crisis</p> <p>3. Buy so-called \u201cvalue\u201d stocks which have been hit hard in the market fall</p> <p>4. Just own high-quality companies and try to ignore events</p> <p>The first strategy suffers from one major drawback \u2013 no one seems to be able to do it. It takes more foresight, mental flexibility and emotional stability than most investors possess to be able to foresee a disaster, sell and then buy back in when things look at their bleakest.</p> <p>Trying to pick companies that might profit from the crisis is maybe easier. Think disinfectant manufacturers like Reckitt Benckiser and mask manufacturers like 3M. But the crisis will be temporary and they have other businesses, some of which were already challenged before the economy turned down.</p> <p>Buying so-called \u201cvalue\u201d stocks has fared very badly and has not shown any improvement so far in this market downturn. The Fundsmith Equity Fund year to date has outperformed the Benchmark MSCI World Index by nearly 8% but it outperformed the MSCI World Value Index by over 14%.</p> <p>I have never been a believer in the philosophy that so-called \u201cvalue\u201d investments would perform well in an economic and market downturn. Shares that are lowly-rated are so mostly for good reasons. Their businesses are mostly heavily cyclical, highly leveraged, they have poor returns on capital and/or they face other structural or management issues. It\u2019s not a combination likely to protect your investment in difficult times.</p> <p>Which brings me to the final strategy. I haven\u2019t a clue what will emerge from the current apocalyptic state. Rather like some of the companies I most admire, I try to spend very little time considering matters that I can neither predict nor control and focus instead on those that I can affect. I just try to own good businesses.</p> <h2><strong>Phil Spencer, TV property expert</strong></h2> <p><em>\u2018The market is likely to take a fair while to recover\u2019</em></p> <p>It seems that for all intents and purposes the UK housing market is shut. It is temporarily closed for business. Nothing more, nothing less. It has not crashed, slumped or even slowed down. It has just stopped.</p> <p>Aside from physical viewings not being allowed to take place at the moment, the real crunch point is that surveys and bank valuations cannot take place. Which basically means you can\u2019t raise a mortgage \u2026 or certainly not under even half sensible terms. It doesn\u2019t matter what market you\u2019re dealing in \u2013 whether its wellington boots or bags of popcorn \u2013 for a marketplace to function, people have to be able to trade within it. There has to be liquidity. While the banks are unable to safely lend money, the housing market is unable to function. It\u2019s as simple as that.</p> <p>The primary question in my mind is how long will this situation remain?</p> <p>Working on that assumption \u2013 it begs the question, how comfortable are the banks going to be lending money to individuals whose future income may be uncertain? And then added into that perfect little storm, will be the fact that even when things do get going again, how long will it be before borrowers, valuers or lenders will be able to trust any price or reliable market data? </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9512504c14c77a2d00cb48af9a7c82a8087eea98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9512504c14c77a2d00cb48af9a7c82a8087eea98/335_326_2964_1779/1000..jpg\" alt=\"The UK housing market is shut.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The UK housing market is shut.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This does not necessarily mean a price crash or a fall in underlying property values. But it does mean transaction volumes will dry up for a period of time. To give this some context, in China, property transactions were around zero for the three weeks following movement restrictions and have since (two months later) recovered to 50% of their four-year average.</p> <p>So my expectation is that while the actual pandemic and social lockdown etc may even turn out to be short-lived, the property market itself is likely to take a fair while longer to return to full health. I\u2019m absolutely sure it will get there \u2013 a combination of low interest rates and rising inflation will certainly help \u2013 but it might be a wee while yet. Hold on tight folks! In the meantime, there\u2019s a wealth of free information on my advice site <a href=\"https://www.moveiq.co.uk/\" title=\"\">moveiq.co.uk</a></p> <h2><strong>Peter Hargreaves, </strong><strong>founder of Hargreaves Lansdown</strong></h2> <p><em>\u2018Coronavirus is going to change things dramatically\u2019</em></p> <p>Right now I\u2019m in total isolation because I have a heart condition, as well as my age. I think coronavirus is going to change things dramatically. At the very least it will make luddites embrace the internet. Even I\u2019ve shifted to doing internet banking for the first time. There\u2019s still an awful lot of people not on the internet.</p> <p>It was sheer luck that I sold a lot of my shares just before the crash. [Hargreaves sold \u00a3550m in Hargreaves Lansdown shares in early February, when the price was around \u00a317.50 a share compared with around \u00a313 now]. It was the biggest sale by a single private investor in the UK of all time. I\u2019ve had a lot of stick about it. But I started work on it in December \u2013 it was not the sort of thing of thing you can do overnight.</p> <p>When the world comes out of this, more and more people will be converted to the new economy, how everything can be bought online, and how we won\u2019t need the high street. If you are in retail today, you are done for.</p> <p>I\u2019ve put \u00a320m into the Blue Whale Growth fund [Hargreaves co-founded Blue Whale in 2017]. The team there are keener on some of their tech stocks than they have ever been.</p> <p>Some people are saying buy the cyclical stocks that will recover after a recession. But I\u2019m not sure a lot of the cyclical stocks are going to come back in the way they used to.</p> <h2><strong>Jo Whitfield, chief executive, Co-op Food</strong></h2> <p><em>\u2018Budgets will be tighter and the biggest change will be the shift to online\u2019</em></p> <p>It\u2019s easy to see the longer-term picture as one of doom and gloom, and there will be challenges, but there will also be much change for good and a great party to kick things off. Once freed from lockdown, we can expect shoppers to celebrate in some style with family and friends who they haven\u2019t seen for some time. Restaurants and cafes should experience a boom as we go mad for a while on eating out, but home cooking is also becoming a way of life as we face into staying at home, and this shift will continue.</p> <p>Consumers are having to prepare more meals at home and are falling in love with baking and home cooking. Dusting off old family recipes and involving the family more in creating meal occasions. We see this growing as people shop differently to make more meals themselves from scratch. </p> <p>Neighbourliness will also be a big theme post-coronavirus. There is a thriving community spirit as people look after their own and their neighbours. The street party spirit of older generations could well return as we enjoy being free from the confines of our homes but also strengthen new-found friendships. </p> <p>Budgets will be tighter, given the economic fallout from coronavirus, and we will look for value for money. And we are moving to an \u201conly when necessary shopping\u201d mentality. In the future, this little and often approach could help accelerate the move to less frequent big shops and an increase in top-up shopping. Local producers are seeing uplifts in sales and local farm shops and other community stores will benefit beyond coronavirus from a new customer base which will stay loyal.</p> <p>The biggest change will be the shift to online. Demand is outstripping delivery slots but this will see many move into home-delivered or click-and-collect services in the future. </p> <h2><strong>Caroline Lucas, Green party MP</strong></h2> <p><em>\u2018Even Conservative MPs are calling for a universal basic income\u2019</em></p> <p>Coronavirus is changing us as a society, but it\u2019s also revealing who we can truly be. We are seeing people\u2019s roles and jobs afresh . People who yesterday were \u201cunskilled\u201d are now essential workers \u2013 and rightly so.

      "bodyText": "Will the coronavirus change the way we spend, shop and invest our money, long after the virus is history? Will we abandon city centre offices, with many more permanently working from home? Or will we return to all our past practices once this grim episode is over? Guardian Money asked experts in finance, the workplace, property, food and the environment to set out what they think will emerge in the medium term. Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary, TUC \u2018We can\u2019t go back to business as usual\u2019 Right now the priority has to be fighting Covid-19. But we also have to prepare for the coming recession, and the impact it will have on working families\u2019 jobs and living standards. One thing is clear: even once we\u2019re through this crisis, we can\u2019t go back to business as usual. Individualism, nationalism and free market economics couldn\u2019t surmount this crisis. Instead, in an emergency, it was common purpose, collectivism and social partnership that stepped up. We\u2019ve seen what we can achieve working together and thinking differently \u2013 people staying at home to protect our NHS, businesses and unions working together to keep people in their jobs, manufacturers switching production to life-saving ventilators, neighbours all over the country shopping for older people nearby. We\u2019ve been reminded of how much we all depend on the labour of ordinary working people to keep our homes and our country running. It\u2019s not right that many of the workers we have needed the most \u2013 carers, shop workers, cleaners, warehouse staff, delivery drivers \u2013 still get paid the least. During this crisis a Conservative government found it necessary to bring unions and civil society into the room \u2013 as well as business. The solutions we found together aren\u2019t perfect but they show the potential of a different kind of leadership. After this immediate crisis is done, we need to remember what worked in an emergency \u2013 and use it to bring in a new era of sharing power, responsibility and wealth. After all, in the aftermath of the pandemic, we still need to tackle the challenges of inequality, new technology and the climate crisis, too. That means finding a new role for collective bargaining, to protect livelihoods. It means making sure businesses aren\u2019t just profit-making machines but instead have a social purpose. We can\u2019t repeat what happened after the 2008 crash, when big banks and corporations bounced back but working families paid the price. Real wages only returned to their pre-2008 levels in early 2020 \u2013 immediately before coronavirus hit. While right now many of us simply want things to return to normal, the reality is that some things have changed for good. We know the years ahead won\u2019t be easy. But together we can build a new normal, where we all get our fair share and can provide a decent life for ourselves and our families. Collectivism is for life \u2013 not just in a crisis. Terry Smith, manager of the \u00a317bn Fundsmith Equity \u2018No one seems able to sell everything and buy back at the bottom\u2019 What should investors do in the current market panic? Four strategies spring to mind: 1. Sell everything and buy back at the bottom 2. Try to buy those companies which will benefit from the crisis 3. Buy so-called \u201cvalue\u201d stocks which have been hit hard in the market fall 4. Just own high-quality companies and try to ignore events The first strategy suffers from one major drawback \u2013 no one seems to be able to do it. It takes more foresight, mental flexibility and emotional stability than most investors possess to be able to foresee a disaster, sell and then buy back in when things look at their bleakest. Trying to pick companies that might profit from the crisis is maybe easier. Think disinfectant manufacturers like Reckitt Benckiser and mask manufacturers like 3M. But the crisis will be temporary and they have other businesses, some of which were already challenged before the economy turned down. Buying so-called \u201cvalue\u201d stocks has fared very badly and has not shown any improvement so far in this market downturn. The Fundsmith Equity Fund year to date has outperformed the Benchmark MSCI World Index by nearly 8% but it outperformed the MSCI World Value Index by over 14%. I have never been a believer in the philosophy that so-called \u201cvalue\u201d investments would perform well in an economic and market downturn. Shares that are lowly-rated are so mostly for good reasons. Their businesses are mostly heavily cyclical, highly leveraged, they have poor returns on capital and/or they face other structural or management issues. It\u2019s not a combination likely to protect your investment in difficult times. Which brings me to the final strategy. I haven\u2019t a clue what will emerge from the current apocalyptic state. Rather like some of the companies I most admire, I try to spend very little time considering matters that I can neither predict nor control and focus instead on those that I can affect. I just try to own good businesses. Phil Spencer, TV property expert \u2018The market is likely to take a fair while to recover\u2019 It seems that for all intents and purposes the UK housing market is shut. It is temporarily closed for business. Nothing more, nothing less. It has not crashed, slumped or even slowed down. It has just stopped. Aside from physical viewings not being allowed to take place at the moment, the real crunch point is that surveys and bank valuations cannot take place. Which basically means you can\u2019t raise a mortgage \u2026 or certainly not under even half sensible terms. It doesn\u2019t matter what market you\u2019re dealing in \u2013 whether its wellington boots or bags of popcorn \u2013 for a marketplace to function, people have to be able to trade within it. There has to be liquidity. While the banks are unable to safely lend money, the housing market is unable to function. It\u2019s as simple as that. The primary question in my mind is how long will this situation remain? Working on that assumption \u2013 it begs the question, how comfortable are the banks going to be lending money to individuals whose future income may be uncertain? And then added into that perfect little storm, will be the fact that even when things do get going again, how long will it be before borrowers, valuers or lenders will be able to trust any price or reliable market data? This does not necessarily mean a price crash or a fall in underlying property values. But it does mean transaction volumes will dry up for a period of time. To give this some context, in China, property transactions were around zero for the three weeks following movement restrictions and have since (two months later) recovered to 50% of their four-year average. So my expectation is that while the actual pandemic and social lockdown etc may even turn out to be short-lived, the property market itself is likely to take a fair while longer to return to full health. I\u2019m absolutely sure it will get there \u2013 a combination of low interest rates and rising inflation will certainly help \u2013 but it might be a wee while yet. Hold on tight folks! In the meantime, there\u2019s a wealth of free information on my advice site moveiq.co.uk Peter Hargreaves, founder of Hargreaves Lansdown \u2018Coronavirus is going to change things dramatically\u2019 Right now I\u2019m in total isolation because I have a heart condition, as well as my age. I think coronavirus is going to change things dramatically. At the very least it will make luddites embrace the internet. Even I\u2019ve shifted to doing internet banking for the first time. There\u2019s still an awful lot of people not on the internet. It was sheer luck that I sold a lot of my shares just before the crash. [Hargreaves sold \u00a3550m in Hargreaves Lansdown shares in early February, when the price was around \u00a317.50 a share compared with around \u00a313 now]. It was the biggest sale by a single private investor in the UK of all time. I\u2019ve had a lot of stick about it. But I started work on it in December \u2013 it was not the sort of thing of thing you can do overnight. When the world comes out of this, more and more people will be converted to the new economy, how everything can be bought online, and how we won\u2019t need the high street. If you are in retail today, you are done for. I\u2019ve put \u00a320m into the Blue Whale Growth fund [Hargreaves co-founded Blue Whale in 2017]. The team there are keener on some of their tech stocks than they have ever been. Some people are saying buy the cyclical stocks that will recover after a recession. But I\u2019m not sure a lot of the cyclical stocks are going to come back in the way they used to. Jo Whitfield, chief executive, Co-op Food \u2018Budgets will be tighter and the biggest change will be the shift to online\u2019 It\u2019s easy to see the longer-term picture as one of doom and gloom, and there will be challenges, but there will also be much change for good and a great party to kick things off. Once freed from lockdown, we can expect shoppers to celebrate in some style with family and friends who they haven\u2019t seen for some time. Restaurants and cafes should experience a boom as we go mad for a while on eating out, but home cooking is also becoming a way of life as we face into staying at home, and this shift will continue. Consumers are having to prepare more meals at home and are falling in love with baking and home cooking. Dusting off old family recipes and involving the family more in creating meal occasions. We see this growing as people shop differently to make more meals themselves from scratch. Neighbourliness will also be a big theme post-coronavirus. There is a thriving community spirit as people look after their own and their neighbours. The street party spirit of older generations could well return as we enjoy being free from the confines of our homes but also strengthen new-found friendships. Budgets will be tighter, given the economic fallout from coronavirus, and we will look for value for money. And we are moving to an \u201conly when necessary shopping\u201d mentality. In the future, this little and often approach could help accelerate the move to less frequent big shops and an increase in top-up shopping. Local producers are seeing uplifts in sales and local farm shops and other community stores will benefit beyond coronavirus from a new customer base which will stay loyal. The biggest change will be the shift to online. Demand is outstripping delivery slots but this will see many move into home-delivered or click-and-collect services in the future. Caroline Lucas, Green party MP \u2018Even Conservative MPs are calling for a universal basic income\u2019 Coronavirus is changing us as a society, but it\u2019s also revealing who we can truly be. We are seeing people\u2019s roles and jobs afresh . People who yesterday were \u201cunskilled\u201d are now essential workers \u2013 and rightly so. I hope that will lead to a reassessment of jobs and wages, so that in future no one working in an essential role is undervalued or left in poverty. We\u2019re very lucky in Brighton to have a huge range of independent food shops. I don\u2019t necessarily think the panic-buying and early response to coronavirus will see them replace supermarkets. But I think people are appreciating how fragile our food supply system is and how dependent it is on invisible armies of poorly paid people. But I know there are no guarantees. We\u2019ve seen too many false dawns, ignored too many warnings in the past. And there are some responses to this pandemic which, if they become hardwired and permanent, will do huge damage to the environment and to people\u2019s lives. There are things being said now, though, which cannot be unsaid. Michael Gove asserting on the Marr programme that \u201cwe\u2019ve got to put the lives of the vulnerable ahead of everything else\u201d; Conservative MPs calling for a universal basic income. The coronavirus may turn out to be the locomotive of history which accelerates the transition to a better, fairer society. But we will have to fight to ensure it happens. Edwin Booth, head of family-owned supermarket chain Booths \u2018A sharing of value will save mankind, greater wealth in fewer hands will not\u2019 Customers are and will continue to be anxious, seeking reassurance that the food that they buy is safe, healthy and from a trusted source. In the aftermath of Brexit, there is an opportunity for the government to collaborate with food industries and farming to create a framework for increased food production throughout the United Kingdom.

Sort of. \u201cActually, whilst I\u2019m glad you brought it up, in my defence it wasn\u2019t me. It was the other Hugo Boss.\u201d</p> <p>This is a confusing time for the identity of the Birmingham-born comedian formerly known as Joe Lycett. As we meet during a break in filming for series two of Joe Lycett\u2019s Got Your Back \u2013 his Channel 4 show that\u2019s like a comic take on Watchdog \u2013 it is now one week since he changed his name to Hugo Boss by deed poll. The intention: a stunt to protest against the fashion brand, which has been accused of aggressively pursuing small companies and charities who use the word \u201cBoss\u201d in their name. The execution: using his new name to wind up the couture company in gloriously silly manner.</p> <p>\u201cI will now make a number of statements which I REALLY hope do not get confused with the opinions of @HUGOBOSS,\u201d tweeted the comic. \u201cJust to clarify, these are the statements of Hugo Boss, not of Hugo Boss. Hugo Boss microwaves fish in the office. Hugo Boss always asks: \u2018What percentage are you on?\u2019 before he lets you borrow his charger. Hugo Boss has a smelly bum bum.\u201d</p> <p>But what started as one of the campaigns in the upcoming show has caused all sorts of difficulties. After all, what does he now do with the name of a programme whose first season was called Joe Lycett\u2019s Got Your Back? Completely change the whole thing?

There are loads of things I want to do that they have to stop me from [doing]. Last series, I wanted to steal a car to show how easy it is to nick new ones that don\u2019t have physical keys. And they went: \u2018No, we can\u2019t do that because that\u2019s just committing crime.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Traversing this legal minefield seems to have paid off, though. Joe Lycett\u2019s Got Your Back has captured the public\u2019s imagination to the point where they now approach him in the street asking for help with weirdly specific problems. (\u201cThings like: \u2018The lip of the kettle I bought doesn\u2019t work properly, what can I do?\u2019\u201d). There is something genuinely impressive about his show\u2019s commitment to taking companies to task. Lycett insists that they are obsessive about \u201cjournalistic rigour\u201d in pursuing corporations over their poor practices. It is hard to imagine this will not still feel relevant while the nation is on lockdown: even in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak, some of the stories to really capture public attention are tales of corporate wrongdoing.</p> <p>Twitter is awash with people railing against Mike Ashley\u2019s suggestion that the nation cannot function without knock-off leggings. The employment practices of Wetherspoons owner Tim Martin are all over the #COVIDIOTS hashtag. And the internet cannot stop pointing out that the wage bill of Virgin Atlantic staff is the kind of money Richard Branson accidentally drops between sofa cushions \u2013 so his request for them to take unpaid leave seems, well, a bit rich.</p> <p>So, if anything, coronavirus might have made this show even more urgent. There is a quip that really sticks in the mind in the days after our interview, one that was made weeks before the full devastation that Covid-19 might make to society became clear but that has nonetheless proven eerily prescient.</p> <p>\u201cI did say half-jokingly when we launched that I wanted to destroy capitalism with this programme. Give us one more series and capitalism will probably have destroyed itself by then. We\u2019ll just be doing the clearing up.\u201d Maybe.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI feel bad about having designed uniforms for the Nazis,\u201d sighs Hugo Boss as he stares into a plate of falafel. \u201cI definitely shouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d It is rare to hear Boss talk about his past so candidly but, over a plant-based lunch in a London health food restaurant, he is coming clean. Sort of. \u201cActually, whilst I\u2019m glad you brought it up, in my defence it wasn\u2019t me. It was the other Hugo Boss.\u201d This is a confusing time for the identity of the Birmingham-born comedian formerly known as Joe Lycett. As we meet during a break in filming for series two of Joe Lycett\u2019s Got Your Back \u2013 his Channel 4 show that\u2019s like a comic take on Watchdog \u2013 it is now one week since he changed his name to Hugo Boss by deed poll. The intention: a stunt to protest against the fashion brand, which has been accused of aggressively pursuing small companies and charities who use the word \u201cBoss\u201d in their name. The execution: using his new name to wind up the couture company in gloriously silly manner. \u201cI will now make a number of statements which I REALLY hope do not get confused with the opinions of @HUGOBOSS,\u201d tweeted the comic. \u201cJust to clarify, these are the statements of Hugo Boss, not of Hugo Boss. Hugo Boss microwaves fish in the office. Hugo Boss always asks: \u2018What percentage are you on?\u2019 before he lets you borrow his charger. Hugo Boss has a smelly bum bum.\u201d But what started as one of the campaigns in the upcoming show has caused all sorts of difficulties. After all, what does he now do with the name of a programme whose first season was called Joe Lycett\u2019s Got Your Back? Completely change the whole thing? Or rename just one episode, risking it being incorrectly billed in the press? \u201cPresumably I\u2019ll have to find a way of changing my name between episodes,\u201d shrugs the comedian. \u201cThe logistics of it are a nightmare.\u201d On top of that, his manager has registered a desire for him to return to his previous name \u201cas soon as possible\u201d and the DVLA has refused to issue him a new driving licence, as it had some concerns about the calligraphy of his new signature. \u201cIt\u2019s a cock and balls, so they said it could be deemed as offensive,\u201d he laughs.

As Latin America\u2019s worst hit country, Brazil officially has 9,056 coronavirus cases \u2013 including actors, singers, government ministers and Fabio Wajngarten, press secretary of the president, Jair Bolsonaro. With 14 million Brazilians living in densely populated favelas where basic sanitation is frequently lacking, informal workers are struggling from lost income during lockdown, and social isolation is challenging or impossible. The first case has already been reported in an Amazon indigenous community. Bolsonaro called the pandemic a \u201clittle flu\u201d and insisted Brazilians would be immune because they were used to jumping in sewage. His government has distributed just 54,000 tests for a population of about 210 million. Last month the health ministry stopped releasing the numbers of suspected cases. \u201cIn Brazil that\u2019s certainly a critical issue, if not a crisis,\u201d said Albert Ko, department chair and professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Medicine, noting that widespread testing helped Taiwan, South Korea and Germany blunt the epidemic\u2019s rise. \u201cIt is clear we have to improve the issue of tests, and improve a lot,\u201d health minister Luiz Mandetta told reporters this week. Estimates vary wildly. This week, Edmar Santos, health secretary for Rio de Janeiro, said the state could have 50 to 100 infected people for each of its 1,074 confirmed cases. Brazil\u2019s official toll of 359 deaths is just \u201cthe tip of the iceberg,\u201d said Fernando Bozza, a researcher in infectious diseases at the government research institute Fiocruz who is modelling the pandemic. \u201cYou have a mountain of other deaths that are either directly or indirectly associated with the epidemic and they are not notified.\u201d R\u00eallo, who works in private and public hospitals in Rio, said test results can take up to seven days to arrive.

At the Em\u00edlio Ribas public hospital in the state capital, tests are taking up to 15 days to come back, said Ana Ribeiro, its epidemiological service coordinator. The hospital \u2013 one of Brazil\u2019s most respected infectious disease institutions \u2013 is currently waiting for 134 test results, including those of three who have died. \u201cThere are many people getting symptoms and they cannot handle it,\u201d Ribeiro said. Cemeteries in S\u00e3o Paulo are burying 30 to 40 people a day with coronavirus symptoms but, in most cases, no test result, the Folha de S Paulo newspaper reported. The non-profit group Viva Rio runs six health centres, called UPAs, in Rio de Janeiro, all near favelas and all almost exclusively dealing with respiratory cases. \u201cPeople are not going to UPAS for other reasons,\u201d said general coordinator Jos\u00e9 Pacheco. \u201cI just select the most vulnerable or most serious to test; the vast majority are not tested.\u201d S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo, the second biggest city in Rio state, has 10 confirmed cases. Resident Fab\u00edola Lima, a financial specialist, believes there are many more. She lives with her three sisters, all of whom went to private hospitals after suffering classic coronavirus symptoms like fever, headaches and dry coughs. They were told tests were not available, and sent home. They too were not included in the official tally. \u201cThis number being released is totally unreal. This makes people think everything\u2019s normal,\u201d Lima said, while her sister Christiane, coughed incessantly in the background. Despite outbreaks of Zika, dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever in recent years, the past three Brazilian governments slashed funding for science and technology, said Rodrigo Brindeiro, a molecular biologist at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro who helped design the test Fiocruz uses. Brazil is now competing in international markets to buy the test ingredients it needs. \u201cOur failure was long-term,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that if the diagnosis does not improve rapidly there will be a lot of underreporting in these favelas of Rio and this is extremely worrying.\u201d In an email, the health ministry said 40,000 more molecular tests were being delivered this week and another 15 million \u201care being acquired\u201d. It has taken delivery of half a million antibody tests donated by mining giant Vale, which is expected to deliver millions more. Mandetta said the antibody tests have \u201cvarious degrees of sensitivity\u201d. Health ministry documents sent to states and towns said the tests were probably just 25% accurate in diagnosing negative cases. These antibody tests will only spot people carrying coronavirus four to seven days after they become infected, said Brindeiro. As Brazilians chafed under lockdown and largely ignored Bolsonaro\u2019s demands to get back to work, there are signs that many people also sought reliable information instead of his anti-science, anti-media, populist posturing. Brazil\u2019s biggest newspaper, the Folha de S Paulo \u2013 which Bolsonaro has described as \u201cgarbage\u201d \u2013 reported a record 70 million readers in March. An interview with biologist Atila Iamarino Iamarino on the TV show Roda Viva this week drew its biggest audience since Bolsanaro himself appeared in 2018, and has been viewed 3 million times on YouTube. Concerns over the lack of testing were voiced. \u201cYou have the tests, which are the flashlight you can point in any direction and know what\u2019s happening there,\u201d said Iamarino. \u201cWithout this flashlight, what you can use is a candle.\u201d",

She\u2019s now looking forward to turning 100 in July. Wheelie nice gestures Around the country, residents have been leaving gifts and messages on their wheelie bins to support the key workers collecting their rubbish each week. Refuse collectors in Hounslow, west London, were even treated to a bottle of champagne on their round, along with dozens of morale-boosting notes. \u201cThank you so much for working on the \u2018frontline\u2019! We appreciate what you do for us week by week and appreciate your reliability, energy and efficiency. Stay safe and wash your hands!\u201d one message read.

You really are our key workers.\u201d Lighting it up for the NHS A convoy of police cars lined up outside a hospital in Northumberland on Thursday night to flash their blue lights in support of the NHS workers inside. They joined police officers around the country who descended on hospitals to show their support for NHS staff at 8pm for the \u201cClap for Carers\u201d. The officers from Northumbria police stood beside their vehicles and clapped, while staff from Northumberland specialist emergency care hospital in Cramlington looked on. A number of Northumbria police cars also headed to the home of the former Sunderland councillor Margaret Beck, a much-loved community figure, who died on 27 March after contracting Covid-19. PCSO Alison Ross said: \u201cMargaret was an amazing woman, popular and loved by everyone. \u201cWhile tonight is all about showing our support to the NHS and to those people looking after us during this unprecedented time, I also wanted to make sure Margaret\u2019s family, and the wider community, had an opportunity to pay their respects to a wonderful woman.\u201d Netflix for women in refuge A women\u2019s aid charity in Birmingham has raised more than \u00a31,000 to provide Netflix streaming to families in refuge who have limited resources to entertain children. Birmingham and Solihull Women\u2019s Aid (BSWA) raised the cash needed to install the streaming service across its six refuge sites, at a cost of \u00a3200 a month, in just three days. \u201cThese women have already left their home and, in some cases, all of their belongings behind and gone to live in a completely new place with their children,\u201d said Anna Fawcett, the charity\u2019s fundraising manager. \u201cThis means they put on the telly and entertain themselves, have a film night, do something small with their children. It\u2019s something that we all overlook, but everybody at the moment is making very good use of their streaming systems.\u201d With its two charity shops closed due to the coronavirus lockdown, BSWA had little other means of raising the funds needed, and Fawcett said they were overjoyed to have received the money so quickly. \u201cIt just shows that when given the opportunity to help out, people really do dig in and think of others,\u201d she said. 600% boom in online library memberships There has been a 600% rise in online library membership in some areas of the country, as people turn to e-books and audio books in the coronavirus lockdown. Hampshire county council has had a 770% increase in new digital users, Cornwall council a 630% increase and Hertfordshire county council an increase of 332%, the Local Government Association (LGA) revealed. Councils have been working to provide additional online resources, using the hashtag #LibrariesFromHome to promote their services. As libraries are restricted in the number of e-books and audio books they can provide due to costs and licensing limits, the LGA is calling on the government and publishers to work together to unlock an additional \u00a35m to enable libraries to increase their capacity. Cllr Gerald Vernon-Jackson, the chair of the LGA\u2019s culture, tourism and sport board, said: \u201cCouncil libraries provide a vital service for residents and act as community hubs in normal times. Their online digital contribution has now become equally important as people turn to them as a way to help pass the time at home. \u201cExtra funding would help libraries extend their licences and meet this growing demand.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "\u201cIt is a miracle that New York works at all,\u201d EB White once wrote. \u201cThe whole thing is implausible.\u201d Every New Yorker instinctively understands the truth of that observation. The city\u2019s infrastructure is a disaster; its apartments are famously tiny; everything is overpriced; there are too many people in too small a space; and the whole city will one day have to reckon with the ravages of an encroaching sea. Top: A construction worker in the financial district of New York City. Bottom left: New York stock exchange. Bottom right: A commuter talks on the phone while walking through the Fulton Street metro station. Yet New York has grown from a tiny New World trading post to a muscular global metropolis whose very name evokes dynamism and fierce, unruly vitality. It has survived booms, busts, world wars, the threat of cold war nuclear annihilation, 9/11, gentrification and more, and thrived. The city swallows people of every nation and language and spits out New Yorkers; it generates vast fortunes; and it is responsible for a dazzling expression of art, literature, music and intellectual life. By comparison many other world capitals feel like sleepy museum exhibitions. Top: Grand Central Station at 3pm in Manhattan, New York. Bottom: A doorman in New York City. Now, however, this city of eight million people has met its match: a deadly virus, invisible to the human eye and ruthlessly efficient. Covid-19 has stretched New York\u2019s health infrastructure to breaking point. Every day cases, and deaths, mount. A military hospital ship is docked, imposingly, in New York harbor. There are field hospitals in Central Park. Millions of New Yorkers have shut themselves into their homes. This is a city under quarantine. \u201cNo longer were there individual destinies,\u201d Albert Camus writes in The Plague: \u201cOnly a collective destiny, made of plague and emotions shared by all.\u201d Top left: An EMT at Bellevue hospital center in Manhattan. Top right: A member of the press takes video of the temporary morgue at Bellevue hospital. Bottom left: Creative face masks in midtown. Bottom right: Used vinyl gloves and a dead pigeon on the streets of Manhattan. The photographer Jordan Gale ventured out to capture this strange new world. In Woody Allen\u2019s film Manhattan, the narrator found it impossible to look at the city without feeling that it \u201cpulsated to the great tunes of George Gershwin\u201d \u2013 the jazzy, life-affirming exuberance of Rhapsody in Blue. Yet New York, now, is eerily quiet. \u201cAny noise you hear is startling,\u201d Gale said. He was walking down a street in SoHo when he realized that the only sound was a clip on his camera bag, clacking as he walked. Top left: Empty streets outside Central Park. Top right: Empty park seats at Bryant Park in Manhattan. Bottom: The Brooklyn Bridge deserted at 4pm. \u201cThe city is a vacant lot,\u201d he said. \u201cRoads are empty. Sidewalks are empty. Stores are boarded up. The owners clearly believe looting could start any minute.\u201d In residential areas occasional people can still be seen in the street; they are making expeditions to the grocery store or bodega or taking the daily walks which increasingly feel like a minimum mental health requirement. The commercial areas of New York, on the other hand, are ghost towns. Top: A lone person along the streets in the Bronx.

      "bodyText": "Detainees in a US immigration jail are begging to be released after potential Covid-19 exposure, saying the conditions are so brutal that they would rather suffer deportation than remain locked up. Three men incarcerated at the Winn correctional center in a remote part of Louisiana told the Guardian that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) has isolated 44 of them together after they were possibly exposed to coronavirus. Some of the detainees are so desperate to leave that they are seeking voluntary deportation.

A 27 March situation report (SitRep) document produced by the Unified Command of Washington\u2019s State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC) projects that a combination of acute demand at food banks and schools, supply problems for food and cleaning supplies, plus staffing shortages, will mean government and NGOs will struggle to provide for hungry people whose incomes have disappeared as the state\u2019s economy stutters. This raises the prospect of food bank shortages in Washington but also nationwide, as food banks across the US are being increasingly utilized by unprecedented numbers of people in an economy that has been abruptly slowed to fight the spreading pandemic. Washington state has experienced one of the earliest and most serious outbreaks of Covid-19 in the US.

The political landscape will be recast beyond recognition. Where there was no effective opposition, a void, a limbo, now in Keir Starmer the party has a grand prosecutor well qualified to hold the government\u2019s feet to the fire. Until now Boris Johnson had nothing to fear from a four-times vanquished and demoralised foe, with a leader so discredited a plurality of his<strong> </strong>own voters<strong> </strong>tell YouGov he <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2020/04/02/96f89/2?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=daily_questions&amp;utm_campaign=question_1\">changed their party for the worse</a>. From now on Johnson faces the challenge of an unrecognisably remade opposition.

No digging has found anything but decency and a background of pro bono work: \u201ca bit dull\u201d is the worst they can think of. Not since Tony Blair in 1994 has a Labour leader emerged from the party\u2019s byzantine structures with support from every section, backed by a majority of MPs, trade unions, affiliates and now its members, too. He has promised unity and this solid support may augur an end to the party\u2019s civil wars. The respectful tone of the leadership campaign in the three finalists\u2019 hustings drew praise from all sides: peace was possible. His cool authority swayed many Jeremy Corbyn supporters and Momentum members, when only a short while ago it was glumly assumed only a Corbynite stood a chance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/mar/30/labour-leadership-interviews-sir-keir-starmer\">Labour leadership interviews: Sir Keir Starmer \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The sheer scale of last December\u2019s electoral rout, gifting Boris Johnson an 80-seat majority, sent a seismic shock through the party membership. Activists contended with the raw incompetence of every aspect of the Corbyn-led campaign, from his incredible manifesto, ballooning weekly with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/14/general-election-pay-gap-promises-from-labour-and-lib-dems-as-johnson-navigates-floods-anger-live-news\">new billions pledged</a>, to basic failures to deliver election leaflets on time. Many were appalled to encounter voters, not just in north London but in the north of England, too, revolted by the party\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/09/jews-brexit-boris-johnson-jeremy-corbyn\">failure to root out antisemitism</a>. Starmer\u2019s slogan, \u201cAnother future is possible\u201d, felt as vital for the party itself as for the country.</p> <p>A new leader has a short time to signal to voters that this is a party transformed. Using the very thing that most shamed Labour, his first totemic act will be to summon representatives of the Jewish community to help him set up a rigorously independent process to expunge the antisemites: never again those weasel excuses, \u201cwe oppose all forms of racism\u201d.</p> <p>What a hard time to arrive in post. Stricken and locked-down, there is no appetite for party politics as Britain, like every other country, at least temporarily rallies round the government of the day: up against a near-zero opposition, YouGov this week scored Johnson the <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1264105/boris-johnson-approval-rating-tory-government-popularity-yougov-coronavirus\">highest positive rating</a> of any government since 2003 \u2013 because nothing can save us but the state. After Corbyn\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52048213\">unseemly gloating</a> that coronavirus proved his policies right, expect pitch-perfect nuance from Starmer. He conceded in his webinar with members this week, \u201cany government would struggle\u201d, before pointing to confused messages, slow action and the harsh light the crisis has shone on a decade of austerity. Steering off callow opportunism, expect forensically focused critiques to make this ill-prepared government writhe. Even the Tory press howls at its shocking ineptitude and dishonesty about testing and protective equipment.</p> <p>Where does Starmer stand? Treading the tightrope stretched across a divided party, some Corbynites suspect he\u2019s a covert Blairite, while some pragmatists worry about his radical pledges. These include \u201ccommon ownership\u201d of rail, mail, energy and water, but wait for interpretations: it need not mean Whitehall-run monoliths. Costly though it is, expect no backsliding on free tuition fees, because he sincerely believes in universal free education. But without power, policies are tinkling cymbals: ahead is the long, hard slog of solid and skilful opposition. In the aftermath of coronavirus and Brexit, plunged into a depressed economy, no one can guess the mood of politics in four years\u2019 time, but there is every reason to think this singularly ill-equipped government will not come through it well \u2013 and Keir Starmer will.</p> <p>On Sunday, when he announces his new shadow cabinet, it will stand in stark contrast to Boris Johnson\u2019s team. An ill-assorted cabinet, chosen for hot Brexit passions not character or competence in a crisis, will face an impressively capable line-up on the bench opposite. Gone will be the more comically inept Labour spokesmen of recent years. While Lisa Nandy and Rebecca Long-Bailey have been promised places, new faces will be the story of day. Waiting on the backbenches is an array of talent to choose from, with an exceptionally strong cohort of women \u2013 there are too many to list.</p> <p>Corbyn apparatchiks must go, but a Labour leader doesn\u2019t directly control the party machine. Power to remove chief officers rests with the national executive committee, which may at first look finely balanced. But with Starmer arriving with the wind in his sails, support for the dead regime may fade away, just as Militant vanished into the ether. Momentum itself has changed: Laura Parker, its national co-ordinator, is a Starmer campaigner and an emblem of the party\u2019s future, unlike Momentum\u2019s founder, Jon Lansman, a veteran Bennite. Will there be peace at last? Rule changes require consent of the unruly party conference floor, whose votes are needed to reform the divisive trigger ballots and reselections of MPs that spread so much bitterness through local parties. Commanding his party may seem a petty irrelevance in the force-nine gale of the coronavirus crisis, but a leader without a grip on their party looks an unconvincing prime minister of the nation. Here is the transformation: in selecting Starmer, Labour in all its divisions shows it has at last emerged as a serious party determined on seeking power.</p> <p>\u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "The country today gains an opposition leader who will for the first time subject the government\u2019s competence in this coronavirus crisis to relentless scrutiny. The political landscape will be recast beyond recognition. Where there was no effective opposition, a void, a limbo, now in Keir Starmer the party has a grand prosecutor well qualified to hold the government\u2019s feet to the fire. Until now Boris Johnson had nothing to fear from a four-times vanquished and demoralised foe, with a leader so discredited a plurality of his own voters tell YouGov he changed their party for the worse. From now on Johnson faces the challenge of an unrecognisably remade opposition. A trusted, tried and tested, big-brained grown-up arrives as a formidable opponent to this ramshackle, impromptu and patently incompetent prime minister. Starmer has swept the board, a man risen without enemies. No digging has found anything but decency and a background of pro bono work: \u201ca bit dull\u201d is the worst they can think of. Not since Tony Blair in 1994 has a Labour leader emerged from the party\u2019s byzantine structures with support from every section, backed by a majority of MPs, trade unions, affiliates and now its members, too. He has promised unity and this solid support may augur an end to the party\u2019s civil wars. The respectful tone of the leadership campaign in the three finalists\u2019 hustings drew praise from all sides: peace was possible. His cool authority swayed many Jeremy Corbyn supporters and Momentum members, when only a short while ago it was glumly assumed only a Corbynite stood a chance. The sheer scale of last December\u2019s electoral rout, gifting Boris Johnson an 80-seat majority, sent a seismic shock through the party membership. Activists contended with the raw incompetence of every aspect of the Corbyn-led campaign, from his incredible manifesto, ballooning weekly with new billions pledged, to basic failures to deliver election leaflets on time. Many were appalled to encounter voters, not just in north London but in the north of England, too, revolted by the party\u2019s failure to root out antisemitism. Starmer\u2019s slogan, \u201cAnother future is possible\u201d, felt as vital for the party itself as for the country. A new leader has a short time to signal to voters that this is a party transformed. Using the very thing that most shamed Labour, his first totemic act will be to summon representatives of the Jewish community to help him set up a rigorously independent process to expunge the antisemites: never again those weasel excuses, \u201cwe oppose all forms of racism\u201d. What a hard time to arrive in post. Stricken and locked-down, there is no appetite for party politics as Britain, like every other country, at least temporarily rallies round the government of the day: up against a near-zero opposition, YouGov this week scored Johnson the highest positive rating of any government since 2003 \u2013 because nothing can save us but the state. After Corbyn\u2019s unseemly gloating that coronavirus proved his policies right, expect pitch-perfect nuance from Starmer. He conceded in his webinar with members this week, \u201cany government would struggle\u201d, before pointing to confused messages, slow action and the harsh light the crisis has shone on a decade of austerity. Steering off callow opportunism, expect forensically focused critiques to make this ill-prepared government writhe. Even the Tory press howls at its shocking ineptitude and dishonesty about testing and protective equipment. Where does Starmer stand? Treading the tightrope stretched across a divided party, some Corbynites suspect he\u2019s a covert Blairite, while some pragmatists worry about his radical pledges. These include \u201ccommon ownership\u201d of rail, mail, energy and water, but wait for interpretations: it need not mean Whitehall-run monoliths. Costly though it is, expect no backsliding on free tuition fees, because he sincerely believes in universal free education. But without power, policies are tinkling cymbals: ahead is the long, hard slog of solid and skilful opposition. In the aftermath of coronavirus and Brexit, plunged into a depressed economy, no one can guess the mood of politics in four years\u2019 time, but there is every reason to think this singularly ill-equipped government will not come through it well \u2013 and Keir Starmer will. On Sunday, when he announces his new shadow cabinet, it will stand in stark contrast to Boris Johnson\u2019s team. An ill-assorted cabinet, chosen for hot Brexit passions not character or competence in a crisis, will face an impressively capable line-up on the bench opposite. Gone will be the more comically inept Labour spokesmen of recent years. While Lisa Nandy and Rebecca Long-Bailey have been promised places, new faces will be the story of day. Waiting on the backbenches is an array of talent to choose from, with an exceptionally strong cohort of women \u2013 there are too many to list. Corbyn apparatchiks must go, but a Labour leader doesn\u2019t directly control the party machine. Power to remove chief officers rests with the national executive committee, which may at first look finely balanced. But with Starmer arriving with the wind in his sails, support for the dead regime may fade away, just as Militant vanished into the ether. Momentum itself has changed: Laura Parker, its national co-ordinator, is a Starmer campaigner and an emblem of the party\u2019s future, unlike Momentum\u2019s founder, Jon Lansman, a veteran Bennite. Will there be peace at last? Rule changes require consent of the unruly party conference floor, whose votes are needed to reform the divisive trigger ballots and reselections of MPs that spread so much bitterness through local parties. Commanding his party may seem a petty irrelevance in the force-nine gale of the coronavirus crisis, but a leader without a grip on their party looks an unconvincing prime minister of the nation. Here is the transformation: in selecting Starmer, Labour in all its divisions shows it has at last emerged as a serious party determined on seeking power. \u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",

Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, said: \u201cIt is the job now of our movement to support them in this as they move forward to ensure our party plays its full part in our national political life in these unprecedented times.\u201d Momentum, the grassroots group of Corbyn supporters, released a statement signalling its intent to hold Starmer to account in terms of keeping support for public ownership of national services, a green new deal, scrapping tuition fees, closing immigration detention centres and taxing the top 5% of earners. \u201cHis mandate is to build on Jeremy\u2019s transformative vision, and this means appointing a broad shadow cabinet who believe in the policies and will work with members to make them a reality,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cIn this new era Momentum will play a new role. We\u2019ll hold Keir to account and make sure he keeps his promises, champion big ideas like the green new deal, build the power of Labour members and do everything we can to get a Labour government elected.\u201d",

Josep Borrell, the EU\u2019s high representative for foreign affairs, made his comments in a declaration on Friday in which he backed the UN\u2019s call for an immediate global ceasefire to allow the world to focus on the pandemic. \u201cThe European Union also stresses that sanctions should not impede the delivery of essential equipment and supplies necessary to fight the coronavirus and limit its spread worldwide,\u201d he said. The EU would apply humanitarian exceptions to ensure that sanctions currently in place would not hamper any efforts to fight the disease, he said, that it \u201calso encourages other jurisdictions to provide the necessary clarifications to ensure that their respective sanctions are no obstacle to the global fight against the pandemic\u201d. Borrell\u2019s comments came after the US ignored calls to suspend its sanctions on Venezuela and Iran, and after Cuban officials said the six-decade US embargo of their country had blocked a shipment of coronavirus aid from Asia\u2019s richest man, Jack Ma. Ma, the Chinese founder of the wholesale website Alibaba, had tried to send face masks, coronavirus rapid test kits and ventilators to Cuba through his foundation, but the shipment was blocked at the last minute after the air freight carrier hired to take it pulled out. Cuban officials said Colombia\u2019s Avianca airline declined to take the aid to Cuba because its main shareholder was a US-based company and could face legal action for doing business with Havana, the Associated Press reported. The White House intensified economic sanctions earlier this week on Venezuela and Iran, two countries described by the Trump administration as the US\u2019s greatest enemies. With more than 53,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus, a death toll of almost 3,300, and an economy hammered by falling oil prices, Iran has been struggling to contain one of the earliest Covid-19 outbreaks outside China. In Cuba, which has distributed medical aid around the world, the outbreak is at an earlier stage, with 269 confirmed cases and six deaths. In an attempt to prevent the further introduction of coronavirus, the Cuban government has closed all air and sea connections with the exception of essential cargo and government flights. It has also placed 3,241 people in quarantine. The pandemic is yet to gather pace in Venezuela, where 153 confirmed cases have been reported. With only 73 intensive care beds in the country and an economy reeling from an economic crisis and years of sanctions, the country is perhaps the least able to cope with the situation. Only a quarter of Venezuela\u2019s doctors have access to a reliable supply of water and two-thirds are without soap, gloves or masks, according to a survey by a local medical NGO last month. Borrell\u2019s statement called for international solidarity. \u201cNow is the time to devote all our energy and resources to fight the world\u2019s common challenge, the coronavirus,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is time to focus on global health. Only together can we protect the most vulnerable people in our societies, both medically and economically, from this virus and the human suffering that it brings.\u201d",

In America, presidential primary elections have gone down like skittles, the Democratic national convention has been postponed and campaigns are frozen in time.</p> <p>All of which raises the question: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/us/politics/election-postponed-canceled.html\">can the 2020 general election itself survive</a>?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/24/donald-trump-coronavirus-briefings-2020-campaign-rallies\">Are Trump's coronavirus briefings the new 2020 campaign rallies?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The presidential vote is due to take place on 3 November. The date is set by federal law and Donald Trump has no power to delay it alone. That would require legislation enacted by Congress and signed by the president. Such an outcome still remains unthinkable to most. But many unthinkable events have unfolded in the last month.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re in completely uncharted waters here and I don\u2019t think anybody knows what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.fordham.edu/info/24277/ma_in_elections_and_campaign_management_faculty/6866/monika_l_mcdermott\">Monika McDermott</a>, a political science professor at Fordham University in New York. \u201cBy November the picture might be completely unrecognisable. We don\u2019t even know if the election is going to happen as scheduled. There\u2019s talk out there about postponing it or changing it to a mail-in only election.\u201d</p> <p>The profound uncertainty has upended political campaigns like nothing else in living memory. It was a month ago \u2013 3 March \u2013 that the former vice-president Joe Biden <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/03/joe-biden-super-tuesday-victory-democratic-primary\">won 10 states on Super Tuesday</a>, the biggest day in the primary calendar, and took firm control of the Democratic race. Trump, meanwhile, was holding regular campaign rallies in packed arenas.</p> <p>Now, Biden finds himself holed up in his basement in Wilmington, Delaware, struggling to break into the national conversation through TV interviews and virtual campaign events. Trump has been denied the lifeblood of rallies but switched to his other favourite medium \u2013 television \u2013 with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/24/donald-trump-coronavirus-briefings-2020-campaign-rallies\">daily coronavirus taskforce briefings</a> from the White House. <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/president_trump_job_approval-6179.html\">Polls suggest</a> he is benefiting moderately from a \u201crally around the flag effect\u201d.</p> <p>Media coverage that would normally be all about the race for the White House is dominated instead by an extraordinary public health and economic crisis, with the US <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/04/01/coronavirus-latest-news/\">death toll from the virus expected to top 100,000</a>. Trump and Biden continue to work on the assumption that, come November, the worst of the pandemic will be over. The US held <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/21/us/politics/1918-flu-pandemic-elections.html\">midterm elections in 1918</a> even in the grip of the Spanish flu that killed 675,000 people nationwide.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a5476cd44da745d0ce8943c8f5f02c3a2651770a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5476cd44da745d0ce8943c8f5f02c3a2651770a/0_0_3500_2287/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Joe Biden speaks about the coronavirus pandemic in Wilmington, Delaware, on 12 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"653\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Biden speaks about the coronavirus pandemic in Wilmington, Delaware, on 12 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Barr\u00eda/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fifteen states and one territory have postponed their primaries already this year, denying Biden the chance to knock out his rival, the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, sooner rather than later. But Wisconsin <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/02/politics/wisconsin-primary-april-7-coronavirus/index.html\">intends to go ahead next week,</a> despite legal challenges, an objection from Sanders and shortages of poll workers that could force the national guard to step in.</p> <p>June will now be a bumper month, with nearly 700 delegates up for grabs in 10 states and the District of Columbia on 2 June alone \u2013 assuming the primaries can go ahead. On Thursday the Democratic National Committee announcing it was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/us/politics/milwaukee-democratic-convention-delayed.html\">delaying its presidential nominating convention</a> in Milwaukee by a month until the week of 17 August.</p> <p>But changing general election day would be much more difficult. Faced with the inconsistency of states voting on different dates, Congress passed a law in 1845 that stipulated federal elections must be held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November (the day and time of year were chosen to suit farmers).</p> <p>Congress would have to pass a new law to postpone the 2020 election and even then would run into constitutional hurdles stating the new Congress must be sworn in on 3 January and the new president\u2019s term must begin on 20 January.</p> <p>The inauguration date was set in 1933 when the 20th amendment to the constitution was ratified. There have only been 27 amendments in all. To make another, revising the inauguration date, would require approval by a two-thirds majority of both the House of Representatives and Senate, then ratification by three-quarters of the states.</p> <p>If the election does go ahead as expected on 3 November, states that already allow early and absentee voting will be well placed. Washington state, for example, has carried out elections by mail for years and its primary last month went ahead as planned. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/paloma/the-trailer/2020/04/02/the-trailer-the-fear-and-politics-around-expanding-voting-by-mail/5e84980e602ff10d49ada414/\">But 17 states require some kind of excuse</a> for requesting an absentee ballot. Many would need to change their rules at huge cost to run a mail-only election.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.prri.org/staff/robert-p-jones-ph-d/\">Robert P Jones</a>, founder and chief executive of the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI), said: \u201cThere is a patchwork of state constitutions. The west coast is ahead of the curve whereas other states might have to scramble. One challenge is the United States postal service is economically unstable, so vote by mail may not be as simple as it seems right now.\u201d</p> <p>Such logistical problems could fuel concerns over the result in what is expected to be another very close election, Jones added. \u201cWe could end up with concerns about the legitimacy of the election. Last time it was only 10,000 votes in Michigan. It\u2019s not hard to think we might have votes misdirected or \u2018return to sender\u2019.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3282a51b2d0b82c0ead7bc34bb98a8038d2d9971\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3282a51b2d0b82c0ead7bc34bb98a8038d2d9971/0_0_4416_2944/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders walks near the Senate chamber during the coronavirus relief bill at Capitol Hill in Washington DC, on 25 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernie Sanders walks near the Senate chamber during the coronavirus relief bill at Capitol Hill in Washington DC on 25 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erik S Lesser/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Party politics are already a factor. Democrats sought $2bn in funding for absentee and vote-by-mail options in the recent coronavirus emergency relief bill but only got $400m. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/30/trump-republican-party-voting-reform-coronavirus\">Trump admitted on Fox News</a>: \u201cThe things they had in there were crazy. They had things \u2013 levels of voting that, if you ever agreed to it, you\u2019d never have a Republican elected in this country again.\u201d</p> <p>At Friday\u2019s White House coronavirus taskforce briefing he elaborated by claiming without evidence: \u201cI think a lot of people cheat with mail-in voting. I think people should vote with ID \u2013 voter ID. I think voter ID is very important and the reason they don\u2019t want voter ID is because they intend to cheat. </p> <p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be mail-in voting.

      "bodyText": "The coronavirus pandemic has taken a wrecking ball to the Olympics, Edinburgh Festival and UN\u2019s Cop26 climate conference. In America, presidential primary elections have gone down like skittles, the Democratic national convention has been postponed and campaigns are frozen in time. All of which raises the question: can the 2020 general election itself survive? The presidential vote is due to take place on 3 November. The date is set by federal law and Donald Trump has no power to delay it alone. That would require legislation enacted by Congress and signed by the president. Such an outcome still remains unthinkable to most. But many unthinkable events have unfolded in the last month. \u201cWe\u2019re in completely uncharted waters here and I don\u2019t think anybody knows what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d said Monika McDermott, a political science professor at Fordham University in New York. \u201cBy November the picture might be completely unrecognisable. We don\u2019t even know if the election is going to happen as scheduled. There\u2019s talk out there about postponing it or changing it to a mail-in only election.\u201d The profound uncertainty has upended political campaigns like nothing else in living memory. It was a month ago \u2013 3 March \u2013 that the former vice-president Joe Biden won 10 states on Super Tuesday, the biggest day in the primary calendar, and took firm control of the Democratic race. Trump, meanwhile, was holding regular campaign rallies in packed arenas. Now, Biden finds himself holed up in his basement in Wilmington, Delaware, struggling to break into the national conversation through TV interviews and virtual campaign events. Trump has been denied the lifeblood of rallies but switched to his other favourite medium \u2013 television \u2013 with daily coronavirus taskforce briefings from the White House. Polls suggest he is benefiting moderately from a \u201crally around the flag effect\u201d. Media coverage that would normally be all about the race for the White House is dominated instead by an extraordinary public health and economic crisis, with the US death toll from the virus expected to top 100,000. Trump and Biden continue to work on the assumption that, come November, the worst of the pandemic will be over. The US held midterm elections in 1918 even in the grip of the Spanish flu that killed 675,000 people nationwide. Fifteen states and one territory have postponed their primaries already this year, denying Biden the chance to knock out his rival, the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, sooner rather than later. But Wisconsin intends to go ahead next week, despite legal challenges, an objection from Sanders and shortages of poll workers that could force the national guard to step in. June will now be a bumper month, with nearly 700 delegates up for grabs in 10 states and the District of Columbia on 2 June alone \u2013 assuming the primaries can go ahead. On Thursday the Democratic National Committee announcing it was delaying its presidential nominating convention in Milwaukee by a month until the week of 17 August. But changing general election day would be much more difficult. Faced with the inconsistency of states voting on different dates, Congress passed a law in 1845 that stipulated federal elections must be held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November (the day and time of year were chosen to suit farmers). Congress would have to pass a new law to postpone the 2020 election and even then would run into constitutional hurdles stating the new Congress must be sworn in on 3 January and the new president\u2019s term must begin on 20 January. The inauguration date was set in 1933 when the 20th amendment to the constitution was ratified. There have only been 27 amendments in all. To make another, revising the inauguration date, would require approval by a two-thirds majority of both the House of Representatives and Senate, then ratification by three-quarters of the states. If the election does go ahead as expected on 3 November, states that already allow early and absentee voting will be well placed. Washington state, for example, has carried out elections by mail for years and its primary last month went ahead as planned. But 17 states require some kind of excuse for requesting an absentee ballot. Many would need to change their rules at huge cost to run a mail-only election. Robert P Jones, founder and chief executive of the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI), said: \u201cThere is a patchwork of state constitutions. The west coast is ahead of the curve whereas other states might have to scramble. One challenge is the United States postal service is economically unstable, so vote by mail may not be as simple as it seems right now.\u201d Such logistical problems could fuel concerns over the result in what is expected to be another very close election, Jones added. \u201cWe could end up with concerns about the legitimacy of the election. Last time it was only 10,000 votes in Michigan. It\u2019s not hard to think we might have votes misdirected or \u2018return to sender\u2019.\u201d Party politics are already a factor. Democrats sought $2bn in funding for absentee and vote-by-mail options in the recent coronavirus emergency relief bill but only got $400m. Trump admitted on Fox News: \u201cThe things they had in there were crazy. They had things \u2013 levels of voting that, if you ever agreed to it, you\u2019d never have a Republican elected in this country again.\u201d At Friday\u2019s White House coronavirus taskforce briefing he elaborated by claiming without evidence: \u201cI think a lot of people cheat with mail-in voting. I think people should vote with ID \u2013 voter ID. I think voter ID is very important and the reason they don\u2019t want voter ID is because they intend to cheat. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be mail-in voting. It should be: you go to a booth and you proudly display yourself. You don\u2019t send it in the mail where people pick up \u2013 all sorts of bad things can happen by the time they signed that, if they signed that by the time it gets in and is tabulated.\u201d Republicans have long stoked fears of fraud in mail-in voting. But according to the Washington Post, in Washington state\u2019s last election, 4.4m ballots were cast but fewer than a hundred were flagged and none led to a criminal fraud investigation. What remains unknown is whether the pandemic will help or hurt Trump at the ballot box. He declared a national emergency on 13 March but has been fiercely condemned for previously downplaying the virus, squandering crucial weeks and leaving the country unprepared. The president has \u201chas blood on his hands\u201d, argued the Boston Globe editorial board this week, while Biden\u2019s supporters say the former vice-president would bring precisely the stable leadership the country needs. The PRRI says that, in less than three weeks, Trump has seen the highest increase in his favourability rating since the institute began tracking it in 2015. Its analysis of 1,008 adults polled between 17 and 22 March found that overall Trump\u2019s favorability increased from 40% in February to 49% in March, with unfavorable opinion decreasing 10 points. Favourability in the battleground states of Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin jumped 13 points. Jones explained: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a typical American reaction at times of national crisis, a \u2018rally around the flag effect\u2019.

Standing in front of me at the lectern in Downing Street, Boris Johnson said: \u201cI must level with you...\u201d. What was coming next could only be bad news: these aren\u2019t words typically used by a prime minister who trades in bluster, bluff and optimism.</p> <p>He continued: \u201cMore families, many more families, are going to lose loved ones before their time.\u201d It was a chilling remark and that was the moment everything changed in terms of reporters\u2019 understanding of the crisis\u2019s severity and unprecedented scale. You could hear a pin drop as we listened to the rest of Johnson\u2019s address. Just inside Downing Street\u2019s side door, where we retrieved belongings such as phones and laptopsthat are not allowed in the main building, we hurriedly rang newsdesks to double-check they had heard Johnson\u2019s startling words for themselves. The next day I travelled to Northumberland to see my parents, who are in their 60s, and asked them to take the advice very seriously.

It took a newspaper\u2019s general reporters just a matter of hours to find out the pair were holidaymakers from China staying at a hotel in York. For weeks, we watched what was happening in China and our questions to Downing Street were about how to get people back from Wuhan and the quarantine facility set up in Wirral, interspersed with the usual topics such as Brexit, HS2 and floods.</p> <p>By early March, it was clear cases were rising, and we were invited to helpful technical briefings with Whitty and the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, held in No 9 Downing Street, and on one occasion upstairs in No 10, in the beautiful Pillared Room, which we usually only see once a year at the prime minister\u2019s Christmas reception for journalists. We got the government\u2019s Covid-19 strategy an hour before one of the press conferences to familiarise ourselves with it. It was there we saw the shocking estimate that up to a fifth of the workforce could be off sick. Trump-style, Johnson took questions from nearly every reporter in the room \u2013 staying far longer than usual. The day hadn\u2019t all been smooth, though. At one point we were herded out of No 9\u2019s lobby meeting room to get ready for the press conference and left filing copy crouched on the paving slabs of the country\u2019s most famous street. A reporter from the Financial Times, Laura Hughes, and I talked about how filing from roadsides felt like general election territory.</p> <p>Journalists continued to traipse into Downing Street for the daily televised press conferences in person until the weekend of 21-22 March, every day feeling more anxious in the office, sharing stories of relatives\u2019 and friends\u2019 health. The last one I attended personally was on Thursday 19 March, when, in a nod to social distancing, the chairs were arranged in a staggered way. This should have happened days earlier. I was sitting near Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby, ITV\u2019s Robert Peston and the Guido Fawkes reporter Tom Harwood. It was one of Johnson\u2019s more bizarre performances, where he asked us all if it was useful to keep doing the question and answer sessions, and joked about wearying us with them. We had a brief chat surrounding the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman and press secretary afterwards, known as a \u201chuddle\u201d, where we were told journalists would be key workers. We all knew we were standing too close and broke it up after a few minutes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ec8c3f57981b40c1c30706ad7d5726af7dc5eec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ec8c3f57981b40c1c30706ad7d5726af7dc5eec/0_0_3500_2100/1000..jpg\" alt=\"A virtual press conference in Downing Street.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A virtual press conference in Downing Street.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: 10 Downing Street/Crown copyright/Andrew Parsons/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The next day we all began working from home and set about creating weird and wonderful office spaces.

      "bodyText": "I was in the midst of the usual reporter\u2019s juggle, trying to write on a notepad balanced on one thigh while resting a dictation machine on the other, when the prime minister\u2019s tone suddenly changed, prompting me to look up. Standing in front of me at the lectern in Downing Street, Boris Johnson said: \u201cI must level with you...\u201d. What was coming next could only be bad news: these aren\u2019t words typically used by a prime minister who trades in bluster, bluff and optimism. He continued: \u201cMore families, many more families, are going to lose loved ones before their time.\u201d It was a chilling remark and that was the moment everything changed in terms of reporters\u2019 understanding of the crisis\u2019s severity and unprecedented scale. You could hear a pin drop as we listened to the rest of Johnson\u2019s address. Just inside Downing Street\u2019s side door, where we retrieved belongings such as phones and laptopsthat are not allowed in the main building, we hurriedly rang newsdesks to double-check they had heard Johnson\u2019s startling words for themselves. The next day I travelled to Northumberland to see my parents, who are in their 60s, and asked them to take the advice very seriously. We washed our hands so much that weekend we ended up with cracked skin. My reporting on the coronavirus stretches back quite far. Because I happened to be passing through Victoria in London one day at the end of January, I was sent to the Department of Health\u2019s press conference. There, the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, told us two people from the same family were being treated for the virus at the infectious disease unit at Newcastle\u2019s Royal Infirmary. It took a newspaper\u2019s general reporters just a matter of hours to find out the pair were holidaymakers from China staying at a hotel in York.

Back then, her face was scabbed, she was thin, and her skin was pale and grey. Her husband had just died. It happened while she was in hospital having an operation. While she was there, she contracted a serious infection. She had young children at home. She was too contagious to work. She was referred to us by her social worker because of delays in her receiving universal credit.

While she was there, she contracted a serious infection. She had young children at home. She was too contagious to work.

      "body": "<p>With the party on its knees, an implausible leftwing Labour leader with pacifist inclinations is replaced by a strait-laced lawyer from the soft left. A few short years later, Britain is plunged into deadly turmoil, one that exposes hitherto ignored injustices, while an ideologically shapeshifting Tory prime minister with surging popularity expands the state\u2019s role in the economy to an unprecedented degree. But Labour\u2019s radicalism remains undimmed; the party recognises that revolutionary times require revolutionary answers.</p> <p>The implausible Labour leader was George Lansbury in 1935; his successor was Clement Attlee; and the Tory prime minister who seemed to be the master of all before him was Winston Churchill. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/04/keir-starmer-wins-labour-leadership-election\">Keir Starmer wins a decisive victory</a> to become the 22nd leader of the Labour party in its 115-year history, a new 1945 seems, for now, a distant prospect. He assumes the leadership in unenviable circumstances. Labour was battered in December\u2019s election; the party has been traumatised by half a decade of internal strife; the Brexit culture war has polarised the nation and wreaked havoc among the party\u2019s electoral coalition; and the UK is being convulsed by its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/03/john-mcdonnell-calls-for-wealth-tax-to-pay-for-coronavirus-measures\">greatest crisis</a> since the guns fell silent three-quarters of a century ago.</p> <p>But Starmer can succeed, and anyone with progressive sympathies should actively will his leadership to do so. His democratic mandate is rooted in <a href=\"https://keirstarmer.com/plans/10-pledges/\">a policy prospectus</a> which, before 2015, would have been deemed unthinkably radical by mainstream Labour: hiking taxes on the rich and big business to fund public investment; democratic public ownership of utilities and services; expanding the welfare state; the abolition of tuition fees; a green industrial revolution; defending migrants\u2019 rights; an end to illegal wars. Starmer declared that Labour\u2019s 2017 manifesto \u2013 which punctured a suffocating generation of \u201cthere is no alternative\u201d\u2013 was the party\u2019s foundational document.</p> <p>In one of his campaign videos, Starmer rightly declared that Labour must hold Boris Johnson to account for the promises made in his election campaign. The same applies to Starmer; here are red lines that cannot be crossed, the reasons thousands of members who voted for Jeremy Corbyn in two leadership elections have placed their trust in him. What hurt Corbyn, in the end, was not being seen as dangerously extreme. It was instead that Brexit unfairly made him seem like a flip-flopper who would say anything to win power. But there is cause for optimism: Starmer\u2019s allies are emphatic that his commitments are an authentic expression of his own beliefs.</p> <p>When Corbyn became leader, many of his opponents within the Labour party embraced a scorched earth policy. They desperately wanted him to fail, craving vindication more than displacing a Tory government. They cheered every misstep and failure throwing relentless tasty morsels to insatiable vultures in the rightwing media. They actively destabilised his leadership. Some on the aggrieved left may ask why they should behave any differently. It would achieve nothing except to prolong the Tory nightmare and alienate the wider membership. Now is the time for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/21/defeat-left-labour-activism-party\">critical friendship</a>; dissent should be in the context of willing the triumph of a radical Labour government.</p> <p>There will be those who now want the left to go and find the nearest ditch to die in. So, let\u2019s be clear from the outset: we aren\u2019t going anywhere. Already, those who caricatured Corbynism as an era of authoritarian Stalinism are demanding bloodthirsty purges, to permanently smash the left once and for all. In the coming days and weeks, those elements will do all they can to provoke and demoralise the left. Don\u2019t listen to them: this is your party. Every socialist who rips up their membership card, who retreats from political activity, who finds sanctuary in a dead-end leftwing sect, will be cause for celebration for those hankering for a Blairite revival.</p> <p>The mistake many \u201ccentrist\u201d voices have made is to dismiss political phenomena they do not like \u2013 from Corbynism to Brexit to Trump \u2013 as simply being mass irrationality, stupidity and hysteria. But Corbyn secured a landslide victory in 2015 because all of the other flanks of the Labour party were politically and intellectually exhausted. Labour\u2019s social democrats had abandoned social democracy; the last consistent social democrats left standing were Labour\u2019s left flank. All of its sister parties were in crisis, including those \u2013 like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/03/the-guardian-view-on-germanys-social-democrats-turning-left-is-a-risky-but-necessary-gamble\">German Social Democrats</a> \u2013 who had stuck to the \u201cthird way\u201d playbook. Just two years after what was then one of the party\u2019s worst defeats, and in the aftermath of a vicious civil war, Labour <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/corbyn-election-results-votes-away-prime-minister-theresa-may-hung-parliament-a7782581.html\">came within 2,227 votes and seven constituencies</a> of forming a government in 2017.</p> <p>Today\u2019s two major success stories for the European left are the Spanish and Portuguese governments, where social democratic parties have swung leftwards after making <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/12/spain-ruling-socialists-strike-coalition-deal-with-podemos-sanchez\">pacts with the radical left</a>. It is no coincidence that younger voters in the US, Spain, Portugal and the UK embraced the new left movements at the same time, from Bernie Sanders to Podemos: free-market ideology robbed them of security and prosperity, leading them to demand radical answers.</p> <p>That isn\u2019t going to change: and that\u2019s why the left is going precisely nowhere. Why, at the very moment our ideas have been consecrated as the party\u2019s mainstream, would we perform hari-kari? That remains the success of Corbyn and his supporters and cannot be airbrushed from history despite the undoubted attempts to do so. As it was under Attlee, Hugh Gaitskell and Harold Wilson, the left is a legitimate power within the party again, one which cannot be ignored.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/coronavirus-britain-economy-government-blame-labour\">Blaming Labour won't work this time \u2013 the Tories will have to own this crisis  | Larry Elliott</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Starmer has committed to the policies long advocated by the left; and so the left\u2019s role now is to act as the protectors and defenders of those ideas, to ensure that those red lines are not violated, and to develop a vision of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/coronavirus-crisis-new-society\">what post-coronavirus Britain will look like</a>. The left may have succeeded in giving otherwise cautious Labour politicians the courage of their convictions again, but pressure must be maintained to ensure this remains so.

      "bodyText": "With the party on its knees, an implausible leftwing Labour leader with pacifist inclinations is replaced by a strait-laced lawyer from the soft left. A few short years later, Britain is plunged into deadly turmoil, one that exposes hitherto ignored injustices, while an ideologically shapeshifting Tory prime minister with surging popularity expands the state\u2019s role in the economy to an unprecedented degree. But Labour\u2019s radicalism remains undimmed; the party recognises that revolutionary times require revolutionary answers. The implausible Labour leader was George Lansbury in 1935; his successor was Clement Attlee; and the Tory prime minister who seemed to be the master of all before him was Winston Churchill. As Keir Starmer wins a decisive victory to become the 22nd leader of the Labour party in its 115-year history, a new 1945 seems, for now, a distant prospect. He assumes the leadership in unenviable circumstances. Labour was battered in December\u2019s election; the party has been traumatised by half a decade of internal strife; the Brexit culture war has polarised the nation and wreaked havoc among the party\u2019s electoral coalition; and the UK is being convulsed by its greatest crisis since the guns fell silent three-quarters of a century ago. But Starmer can succeed, and anyone with progressive sympathies should actively will his leadership to do so. His democratic mandate is rooted in a policy prospectus which, before 2015, would have been deemed unthinkably radical by mainstream Labour: hiking taxes on the rich and big business to fund public investment; democratic public ownership of utilities and services; expanding the welfare state; the abolition of tuition fees; a green industrial revolution; defending migrants\u2019 rights; an end to illegal wars. Starmer declared that Labour\u2019s 2017 manifesto \u2013 which punctured a suffocating generation of \u201cthere is no alternative\u201d\u2013 was the party\u2019s foundational document. In one of his campaign videos, Starmer rightly declared that Labour must hold Boris Johnson to account for the promises made in his election campaign. The same applies to Starmer; here are red lines that cannot be crossed, the reasons thousands of members who voted for Jeremy Corbyn in two leadership elections have placed their trust in him. What hurt Corbyn, in the end, was not being seen as dangerously extreme. It was instead that Brexit unfairly made him seem like a flip-flopper who would say anything to win power. But there is cause for optimism: Starmer\u2019s allies are emphatic that his commitments are an authentic expression of his own beliefs. When Corbyn became leader, many of his opponents within the Labour party embraced a scorched earth policy. They desperately wanted him to fail, craving vindication more than displacing a Tory government. They cheered every misstep and failure throwing relentless tasty morsels to insatiable vultures in the rightwing media. They actively destabilised his leadership. Some on the aggrieved left may ask why they should behave any differently. It would achieve nothing except to prolong the Tory nightmare and alienate the wider membership. Now is the time for critical friendship; dissent should be in the context of willing the triumph of a radical Labour government. There will be those who now want the left to go and find the nearest ditch to die in. So, let\u2019s be clear from the outset: we aren\u2019t going anywhere. Already, those who caricatured Corbynism as an era of authoritarian Stalinism are demanding bloodthirsty purges, to permanently smash the left once and for all. In the coming days and weeks, those elements will do all they can to provoke and demoralise the left. Don\u2019t listen to them: this is your party. Every socialist who rips up their membership card, who retreats from political activity, who finds sanctuary in a dead-end leftwing sect, will be cause for celebration for those hankering for a Blairite revival. The mistake many \u201ccentrist\u201d voices have made is to dismiss political phenomena they do not like \u2013 from Corbynism to Brexit to Trump \u2013 as simply being mass irrationality, stupidity and hysteria. But Corbyn secured a landslide victory in 2015 because all of the other flanks of the Labour party were politically and intellectually exhausted. Labour\u2019s social democrats had abandoned social democracy; the last consistent social democrats left standing were Labour\u2019s left flank. All of its sister parties were in crisis, including those \u2013 like the German Social Democrats \u2013 who had stuck to the \u201cthird way\u201d playbook. Just two years after what was then one of the party\u2019s worst defeats, and in the aftermath of a vicious civil war, Labour came within 2,227 votes and seven constituencies of forming a government in 2017. Today\u2019s two major success stories for the European left are the Spanish and Portuguese governments, where social democratic parties have swung leftwards after making pacts with the radical left. It is no coincidence that younger voters in the US, Spain, Portugal and the UK embraced the new left movements at the same time, from Bernie Sanders to Podemos: free-market ideology robbed them of security and prosperity, leading them to demand radical answers. That isn\u2019t going to change: and that\u2019s why the left is going precisely nowhere. Why, at the very moment our ideas have been consecrated as the party\u2019s mainstream, would we perform hari-kari? That remains the success of Corbyn and his supporters and cannot be airbrushed from history despite the undoubted attempts to do so. As it was under Attlee, Hugh Gaitskell and Harold Wilson, the left is a legitimate power within the party again, one which cannot be ignored. Starmer has committed to the policies long advocated by the left; and so the left\u2019s role now is to act as the protectors and defenders of those ideas, to ensure that those red lines are not violated, and to develop a vision of what post-coronavirus Britain will look like. The left may have succeeded in giving otherwise cautious Labour politicians the courage of their convictions again, but pressure must be maintained to ensure this remains so. While the left has understandably expended much energy on electoral politics in the past five years, in post-pandemic Britain there must be a revival in extra-parliamentary struggles \u2013 from the climate emergency to workers\u2019 rights \u2013 to build popular support for a decisive rupture from a broken status quo. Unlike most Labour leaders, Starmer\u2019s politics is rooted in extra-parliamentary politics: those instincts should be appealed to. Those who hoped that a Starmer triumph would end the remorseless attacks from the rightwing media will soon be disappointed: it will fall to the left to push back against them. And while many Labour MPs, for a time, will be relieved that their Corbynite nightmare is over, the party\u2019s right went for Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband as well as Corbyn. They will come for Starmer, too: the Labour leader may find his only genuine defenders are the left. Starmer has many challenges, not least winning back older voters who have abandoned Labour. But the left should wish him well; the quid pro quo is Starmer stands by his promises. Now is the time for critical friendship, to wish a genuinely decent and progressive politician well: because his success is our only chance to rid the UK of the cruel injustices that both scar and define our society. \u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist",

Meanwhile, China has gone for the direct approach: \u201c<a href=\"https://supchina.com/2020/02/11/all-the-hilariously-aggressive-coronavirus-banners-found-in-china/\">If you hang out in public today / Grass will grow on your grave next year</a>.\u201d</p> \n<p>But the British government has opted for a different focus. With \u201cStay at home, protect the NHS and save lives\u201d, the message seems to be if you act responsibly you can protect your prized asset \u2013 and, as a byproduct, that will save lives.</p> \n<p>Boris Johnson, of course, has form with vacuous three-word slogans \u2013 be it \u201cTake back control\u201d or \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d. And now we have a triptych slogan \u2013 three three-worders for the price of one. The first and last bit make perfect sense. Of course, we should stay at home to save lives. It\u2019s only when you add the bit in the middle that the slogan becomes questionable.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/coronavirus-latest-at-a-glance-friday\">Coronavirus latest: at a glance</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>First, there\u2019s the rank hypocrisy of a government that has spent 10 years doing the exact opposite of ordering us to protect the NHS. In fact, the Tory-led coalition was so little trusted with the NHS that David Cameron had to create his own slogan in 2011 to reassure the public: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/251349/Cameron-NHS-is-safe-in-our-hands\">The NHS is safe in our hands</a>\u201d.</p> \n<p>Over the next decade, the Tories went on to neglect the NHS at best, pillage it at worst. Pre-Covid-19, the number of NHS <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/25/hospital-beds-at-record-low-in-england-as-nhs-struggles-with-demand\">hospital beds</a> had fallen dramatically and we were short of an estimated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/25/boris-johnson-conservatives-nhs-funding\">43,000 nurses</a>.</p> \n<p>The Tory government also did its best to quietly sell off parts of the NHS. In 2013 the government sold 80% of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/25/uk-blood-plasma-company-sale-nhs-supplies\"> the state-owned blood plasma supplier</a> to the US private equity firm Bain Capital for $200m. This despite the obscenity of Britain\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-43910567\">contaminated blood scandal</a> when more than 4,500 haemophiliacs became infected with hepatitis and HIV in the 1970s and 1980s after being poisoned with blood products brought on the cheap from abroad. In 2016 Britain\u2019s plasma supplier was <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/how-bio-products-our-blood-plasma-supplier-ended-up-with-china-zg00fthqn\">sold on</a> to a Chinese company for \u00a3820m (along with the government\u2019s remaining 20% stake). Protect the NHS? The Tories flogged the country\u2019s lifeblood for tuppence ha\u2019penny.</p> \n<p>Johnson talks with pride about \u201cour NHS\u201d and our heroic NHS workers. Yet this is the same man who voted against scrapping the 1% pay-rise cap for NHS nurses in 2017, and was a member of the government that cheered when a pay rise for nurses was blocked.</p> \n<p>Then it was the turn of the health secretary, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foAYpXqzUtQ\">Matthew Hancock,</a> to tell us how proud he was of us for staying at home, protecting the NHS and saving lives. </p> \n<p>There is something distasteful about a government telling us to protect the NHS when the government itself is so obviously failing to do so in this terrible crisis. As of Thursday, only <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51943612\">7,000</a> out of 550,000 frontline NHS workers have been tested for Covid-19. Not only does this<strong> </strong>mean the government is failing to protect the NHS and its workers \u2013 it hasn\u2019t even been able to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/nhs-staff-protection-doctor-ppe-coronavirus\">provide the required personal protective equipment</a> \u2013 it is, in turn, failing to protect us all because the public could be treated by infected staff members.</p> \n<p>But there\u2019s something about \u201cStay at home, protect the NHS and save lives\u201d that offends on an even deeper level. The slogan is a throwback to the Vote Leave campaign of 2016, which also famously weaponised the NHS. Back then, Johnson was pictured in front of a campaign bus with the following words plastered across it: \u201cWe send the EU \u00a3350million a week, let\u2019s fund our NHS instead.\u201d (A figure that <a href=\"https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/boris-johnson-350-million-a-week-nhs-claim-1-6264572\">he later revised</a> downwards by \u00a3100m). Johnson has always been aware that the NHS is an emotional trigger for the British people, and he has been quick to exploit it. This time round, he\u2019s using it just as cynically \u2013 but rather than bribing us with what can be added to the NHS, he\u2019s threatening us with what we can lose. Johnson is toying not only with our pride in the health service, but also our sense of ownership of it.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/30/coronavirus-crisis-tories-cuts\">In this crisis, the Tory cuts can no longer be hidden by empty gestures | Nesrine Malik</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Whether carrot or stick, it is offensive to assume we need an incentive to save lives. You can see it even more clearly in the choreography of the catchphrase at the daily press briefing, bookended by two towering union flags.

      "bodyText": "In most countries, slogans about the national effort to combat coronavirus have focused on survival or the human spirit. Iran has gone for the simple approach (\u201cStay at home\u201d), Switzerland the communal (\u201cThis affects us all\u201d), Italy is trying to spread a message of reassurance (\u201cEverything will be all right\u201d), India is pleading (\u201cGo corona go!\u201d) and practical (\u201cPrepare, don\u2019t panic\u201d), and Argentina is focusing on gratitude to health workers (\u201cThanks from my heart\u201d). Meanwhile, China has gone for the direct approach: \u201cIf you hang out in public today / Grass will grow on your grave next year.\u201d But the British government has opted for a different focus. With \u201cStay at home, protect the NHS and save lives\u201d, the message seems to be if you act responsibly you can protect your prized asset \u2013 and, as a byproduct, that will save lives. Boris Johnson, of course, has form with vacuous three-word slogans \u2013 be it \u201cTake back control\u201d or \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d. And now we have a triptych slogan \u2013 three three-worders for the price of one. The first and last bit make perfect sense. Of course, we should stay at home to save lives. It\u2019s only when you add the bit in the middle that the slogan becomes questionable. First, there\u2019s the rank hypocrisy of a government that has spent 10 years doing the exact opposite of ordering us to protect the NHS. In fact, the Tory-led coalition was so little trusted with the NHS that David Cameron had to create his own slogan in 2011 to reassure the public: \u201cThe NHS is safe in our hands\u201d. Over the next decade, the Tories went on to neglect the NHS at best, pillage it at worst. Pre-Covid-19, the number of NHS hospital beds had fallen dramatically and we were short of an estimated 43,000 nurses. The Tory government also did its best to quietly sell off parts of the NHS. In 2013 the government sold 80% of the state-owned blood plasma supplier to the US private equity firm Bain Capital for $200m. This despite the obscenity of Britain\u2019s contaminated blood scandal when more than 4,500 haemophiliacs became infected with hepatitis and HIV in the 1970s and 1980s after being poisoned with blood products brought on the cheap from abroad. In 2016 Britain\u2019s plasma supplier was sold on to a Chinese company for \u00a3820m (along with the government\u2019s remaining 20% stake). Protect the NHS? The Tories flogged the country\u2019s lifeblood for tuppence ha\u2019penny. Johnson talks with pride about \u201cour NHS\u201d and our heroic NHS workers. Yet this is the same man who voted against scrapping the 1% pay-rise cap for NHS nurses in 2017, and was a member of the government that cheered when a pay rise for nurses was blocked. Then it was the turn of the health secretary, Matthew Hancock, to tell us how proud he was of us for staying at home, protecting the NHS and saving lives. There is something distasteful about a government telling us to protect the NHS when the government itself is so obviously failing to do so in this terrible crisis. As of Thursday, only 7,000 out of 550,000 frontline NHS workers have been tested for Covid-19. Not only does this mean the government is failing to protect the NHS and its workers \u2013 it hasn\u2019t even been able to provide the required personal protective equipment \u2013 it is, in turn, failing to protect us all because the public could be treated by infected staff members. But there\u2019s something about \u201cStay at home, protect the NHS and save lives\u201d that offends on an even deeper level. The slogan is a throwback to the Vote Leave campaign of 2016, which also famously weaponised the NHS. Back then, Johnson was pictured in front of a campaign bus with the following words plastered across it: \u201cWe send the EU \u00a3350million a week, let\u2019s fund our NHS instead.\u201d (A figure that he later revised downwards by \u00a3100m). Johnson has always been aware that the NHS is an emotional trigger for the British people, and he has been quick to exploit it. This time round, he\u2019s using it just as cynically \u2013 but rather than bribing us with what can be added to the NHS, he\u2019s threatening us with what we can lose. Johnson is toying not only with our pride in the health service, but also our sense of ownership of it. Whether carrot or stick, it is offensive to assume we need an incentive to save lives. You can see it even more clearly in the choreography of the catchphrase at the daily press briefing, bookended by two towering union flags. Between each of the three elements there is an arrow to clarify the priorities \u2013 staying at home leads to protecting the NHS, and protecting the NHS in turn leads to saving lives. This slogan might be intended to appeal to our love of the NHS, but in fact it debases it. The government has taken the concept of the NHS, stripped it of its core egalitarian beauty, and transformed it into little more than a material asset. If we don\u2019t stay at home we fail to protect the NHS, and stand to lose that which is rightfully ours. Like tens of millions of British people, I have stood in the street and applauded NHS and care workers. Like them, I am inordinately proud of, and thankful to, the NHS. But we don\u2019t need to be threatened with its devastation, or bribed with the promise of its salvation, to be encouraged to save lives. The slogan has made staying at home purely about self-interest rather than solidarity and our common humanity. But we are bigger and better than that. However much we love the NHS, however much we want to protect the NHS, we are staying at home to save lives \u2013 not to safeguard our national assets. If we protect the NHS in the process, so much the better. A government that believed in its people would be content with a kinder, simpler slogan: stay at home and save lives. \u2022 Simon Hattenstone is a Guardian features writer",

On Thursday the company reported a backlog of 115,000 tests, though it declined to say how many of the samples awaiting processing were from California.</p> <p>When coronavirus first began spreading through the country, large commercial labs like Quest and Labcorp were the only ones with the infrastructure to quickly gain federal approval for their tests, and soon hospitals in California were being encouraged by these companies and by the government to send their samples to San Juan Capistrano for processing.</p> <p>Meanwhile, academic medical centers were scrambling to get approval to do their tests in-house, said Atul Butte, who leads the Institute for Computational Health Sciences at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cNow, our own internal tests are faster,\u201d Butte said. \u201cBut it took us a while to get those up and running.\u201d</p> <p>In the meantime Quest was flooded, and quickly overwhelmed. Initially, the commercial lab gained approval for a bespoke test that needed to be manually processed by lab technicians, which the company said in a statement to the Guardian is \u201cless suited\u201d to a situation where tens of thousands of tests need to be processed each day. Quest said it has now started processing tests at 12 laboratories across the country, some of which are now using to an automated system developed by the Swiss diagnostic company Roche.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"792f3e2beb3e0c6774e0020fe022c273d7c2a1f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/792f3e2beb3e0c6774e0020fe022c273d7c2a1f9/0_0_5000_3263/1000..jpg\" alt=\"A healthcare worker instructs people how to take a self-administered mouth swab at a drive-through Covid-19 testing site in Redondo Beach, California\" width=\"1000\" height=\"653\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A healthcare worker instructs people how to take a self-administered mouth swab at a drive-through Covid-19 testing site in Redondo Beach, California</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBut once you get behind, it\u2019s very hard to catch up,\u201d said Jennifer Doudna, a researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, who has transformed her 2,500-sq-ft scientific laboratory into a pop-up lab Covid-19 testing center. Doudna and her team are using robotics to process at least 1,000 samples a day, collected at the university\u2019s student health center and other nearby hospitals and clinics, to deliver test results within 24 hours.</p> <p>\u201cWe hope that having pop-up labs like ours will really help bring down the backlog,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we can help people quickly understand when they may have an infection.\u201d</p> <p>Having more academic labs and state and county health labs process tests also allows health centers to send their samples somewhere local, rather than mailing them across the state \u2013 or even farther for processing.</p> <p>At the Contra Costa county medical center, the physician Madhvi Shah said she\u2019s relieved that the wait time for test results has somewhat reduced in the past week. \u201cInitially, they were taking almost 10 days or up to two weeks,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople would be getting their negatives or positives way after they\u2019d waited out their quarantine period.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike some other hospitals and health centers in California, the Contra Costa health service has access to a number of rapid-result tests, which the county\u2019s lab can process within 24 hours. The tests are reserved for patients in high-risk groups including those who are on dialysis, or are undergoing chemotherapy, as well as for healthcare workers who need to know quickly if they may have passed an infection on to patients.</p> <p>Over the past week, the standard tests that Contra Costa sends for processing at Quest are being processed within five to seven days, Shah said. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily the worst thing,\u201d she said. But especially with so many patients sheltering at home, often with family members to whom they worry they\u2019ll pass the disease, \u201cI do wish we could give them results faster.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not only patients that are anxious to know the results of coronavirus tests \u2013 epidemiologists and infectious disease experts have warned that while California\u2019s early and restrictive shelter-in-place mandates appear to have slowed a surge of illness that could overwhelm hospitals, delays and backlogs in testing have limited their ability to track the virus\u2019 spread.</p> <p>\u201cAs this pandemic goes through its course,\u201d said Butte at UCSF, \u201cWe\u2019re going to need more numbers.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Nearly two-thirds of the coronavirus tests conducted in California are still awaiting results \u2013 in part due to an initial bottleneck at a single laboratory \u2013 leaving medical providers and patients in the dark, and health officials without the information they need to understand the disease\u2019s spread. Of approximately 94,800 tests conducted in California, about 59,500 results were still pending as of Thursday, even as the state\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, promised to \u201csubstantially increase\u201d testing this week. The nation\u2019s most populous state has been among the worst hit by the virus, but testing efforts have been hampered not only by the processing backlog but by a shortage of testing kits themselves. California ranks 39th out of 50 states and the District of Columbia in per capita testing, according to data collected by the Covid Tracking Project. The major reason for the backlog has been a massive bottleneck at Quest Diagnostics, a large commercial lab that launched coronavirus testing at a facility in San Juan Capistrano, near Los Angeles. On Thursday the company reported a backlog of 115,000 tests, though it declined to say how many of the samples awaiting processing were from California. When coronavirus first began spreading through the country, large commercial labs like Quest and Labcorp were the only ones with the infrastructure to quickly gain federal approval for their tests, and soon hospitals in California were being encouraged by these companies and by the government to send their samples to San Juan Capistrano for processing. Meanwhile, academic medical centers were scrambling to get approval to do their tests in-house, said Atul Butte, who leads the Institute for Computational Health Sciences at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cNow, our own internal tests are faster,\u201d Butte said. \u201cBut it took us a while to get those up and running.\u201d In the meantime Quest was flooded, and quickly overwhelmed. Initially, the commercial lab gained approval for a bespoke test that needed to be manually processed by lab technicians, which the company said in a statement to the Guardian is \u201cless suited\u201d to a situation where tens of thousands of tests need to be processed each day. Quest said it has now started processing tests at 12 laboratories across the country, some of which are now using to an automated system developed by the Swiss diagnostic company Roche. \u201cBut once you get behind, it\u2019s very hard to catch up,\u201d said Jennifer Doudna, a researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, who has transformed her 2,500-sq-ft scientific laboratory into a pop-up lab Covid-19 testing center. Doudna and her team are using robotics to process at least 1,000 samples a day, collected at the university\u2019s student health center and other nearby hospitals and clinics, to deliver test results within 24 hours. \u201cWe hope that having pop-up labs like ours will really help bring down the backlog,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we can help people quickly understand when they may have an infection.\u201d Having more academic labs and state and county health labs process tests also allows health centers to send their samples somewhere local, rather than mailing them across the state \u2013 or even farther for processing. At the Contra Costa county medical center, the physician Madhvi Shah said she\u2019s relieved that the wait time for test results has somewhat reduced in the past week. \u201cInitially, they were taking almost 10 days or up to two weeks,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople would be getting their negatives or positives way after they\u2019d waited out their quarantine period.\u201d Unlike some other hospitals and health centers in California, the Contra Costa health service has access to a number of rapid-result tests, which the county\u2019s lab can process within 24 hours. The tests are reserved for patients in high-risk groups including those who are on dialysis, or are undergoing chemotherapy, as well as for healthcare workers who need to know quickly if they may have passed an infection on to patients. Over the past week, the standard tests that Contra Costa sends for processing at Quest are being processed within five to seven days, Shah said. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily the worst thing,\u201d she said. But especially with so many patients sheltering at home, often with family members to whom they worry they\u2019ll pass the disease, \u201cI do wish we could give them results faster.\u201d It\u2019s not only patients that are anxious to know the results of coronavirus tests \u2013 epidemiologists and infectious disease experts have warned that while California\u2019s early and restrictive shelter-in-place mandates appear to have slowed a surge of illness that could overwhelm hospitals, delays and backlogs in testing have limited their ability to track the virus\u2019 spread. \u201cAs this pandemic goes through its course,\u201d said Butte at UCSF, \u201cWe\u2019re going to need more numbers.\u201d",

Police confirmed they were investigating the blaze at Spencer\u2019s Lane, Aintree, close to the M57 motorway.</p> \n<p>Fire crews managed to get the fire under control quickly and were photographed parked outside the field shortly after it was extinguished.</p> \n<p>The media regulator, Ofcom, said on Thursday it was monitoring broadcasters who spread the discredited conspiracy theory, although coverage has spread more widely on social networks, such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and Nextdoor.</p> \n<p>Speaking at Saturday\u2019s Downing Street press conference, cabinet secretary Michael Gove said the theories were \u201cdangerous nonsense\u201d. Professor Steve Powis, national medical director of NHS England, condemned them as \u201cthe worst kind of fake news\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m absolutely outraged, absolutely disgusted, that people would be taking action against the very infrastructure that we need to respond to this health emergency,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is absolute and utter rubbish.\u201d </p> \n<p>Just hours before the reported incident in Liverpool, Anderson dismissed the theories as \u201cbizarre\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Three recent mobile phone mast fires around the UK are being investigated as possible arson, amid concerns that people are attacking telecoms infrastructure because of a conspiracy theory linking 5G technology to the spread of coronavirus. The mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, also revealed he had received threats relating to the \u201cbizarre\u201d theory, which has gained traction on social media. On Friday, emergency services were called to reports that a 5G mast was on fire in Liverpool shortly before 11pm. Police confirmed they were investigating the blaze at Spencer\u2019s Lane, Aintree, close to the M57 motorway. Fire crews managed to get the fire under control quickly and were photographed parked outside the field shortly after it was extinguished. The media regulator, Ofcom, said on Thursday it was monitoring broadcasters who spread the discredited conspiracy theory, although coverage has spread more widely on social networks, such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and Nextdoor. Speaking at Saturday\u2019s Downing Street press conference, cabinet secretary Michael Gove said the theories were \u201cdangerous nonsense\u201d. Professor Steve Powis, national medical director of NHS England, condemned them as \u201cthe worst kind of fake news\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely outraged, absolutely disgusted, that people would be taking action against the very infrastructure that we need to respond to this health emergency,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is absolute and utter rubbish.\u201d Just hours before the reported incident in Liverpool, Anderson dismissed the theories as \u201cbizarre\u201d. He said he was amazed by the amount of traction the conspiracy was getting on social media, and that all scientific and government advice showed the technology posed no harm to people. Speaking to the Guardian, the mayor revealed he had received threats relating to the theory and had reported them to Merseyside police. \u201cThe suggestion that Covid-19 is somehow linked to 5G is patently beyond the realms of credibility \u2013 utterly bizarre,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Liverpool these masts are being upgraded and ironically the very people that are using this technology are the ones who are believing these theories. I was mildly threatened yesterday by someone telling me to take them down. \u201cThe reality is there is huge pressure on the network at the moment with so many people at home and that\u2019s why engineers are upgrading it. The idea that I have entered into some kind of machiavellian plot with the government is ridiculous.\u201d Social media posts from celebrities, such as the singer Anne-Marie, have helped spread the theory, while Amanda Holden, a judge on Britain\u2019s Got Talent, shared a link to an online petition promoting the false rumour that the symptoms of coronavirus are caused by residing near a 5G mast. The petition was removed following inquiries from the Guardian. Cheers actor Woody Harrelson and former Dancing on Ice judge Jason Gardiner are also among stars who have shared theories. The government is increasingly concerned about the impact of the spread of such false theories. A spokesperson for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport, which has responsibility for telecoms policy, warned people to stop damaging key infrastructure during a national emergency: \u201cThese are baseless theories, there is absolutely no credible evidence of a link between 5G and coronavirus. Threats or violence towards any key worker or damage to mobile phone masts will not be tolerated.\u201d On Thursday, police in Belfast appealed for information after a mobile phone mast was damaged in an arson attack, with online footage suggesting the motive was opposition to 5G networks. The video clip shows an incident on the Antrim Road in north Belfast on Thursday night, in which flames can be seen at the base of a mobile telephone mast. According to a report in the Irish News, voices can be heard stating \u201cFuck the 5G\u201d and \u201cViva la revolution\u201d as the fire burns. Facebook removed one anti-5G group in which members were being encouraged to supply footage of them destroying mobile phone equipment. Video footage of a 70ft (20m) telephone mast on fire in Birmingham this week has also circulated widely alongside claims it was targeted by anti-5G protesters. The problem has become so bad that engineers working for Openreach, which provides home broadband services, have posted pleas on anti-5G Facebook groups, asking to be spared from on-street abuse as they are not involved in maintaining mobile networks. The industry lobby group Mobile UK said the incidents were affecting efforts to maintain networks that were supporting home working and providing critical connectivity to the emergency services, vulnerable consumers and hospitals. Telecoms engineers are considered key workers under the government\u2019s guidelines. International radiation experts have repeatedly made clear that the new high-speed telephone system does not pose a risk to humans, while pointing out that the coronavirus has spread widely in many countries without any 5G coverage, such as Iran.",

A Momentum spokesperson said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In four and a half years, Jeremy Corbyn and the movement around him has changed our party and country for the better, giving a voice to the hopes of millions who felt unrepresented in politics. </p> \n   <p>Austerity as a political project has been defeated and the dark days when Labour cheered on privatisation, pursued illegal wars and demonised migrants are long gone. Our membership has tripled in size, we have doubled the number of socialist MPs and our party brims with ideas and vision for a socialist future. </p> \n   <p>Keir has pledged support for most of the programme, including the public ownership of rail, mail, energy and water, a green new deal, kicking the privatisers out of the NHS, scrapping tuition fees, closing down detention centres and taxing the top 5%. </p> \n   <p>His mandate is to build on Jeremy\u2019s transformative vision, and this means appointing a broad shadow cabinet who believe in the policies and will work with members to make them a reality. </p> \n   <p>In this new era Momentum will play a new role. We\u2019ll hold Keir to account and make sure he keeps his promises, champion big ideas like the green new deal, build the power of Labour members and do everything we can to get a Labour government elected. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>During the leadership contest Starmer ran as a unity candidate and he very intentionally avoided saying anything that might alienate Corbynites in the party.

Here it is.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is the honour and the privilege of my life to be elected as leader of the Labour arty. It comes at a moment like none other in our lifetime.</p> \n   <p>Coronavirus has brought normal life to a halt. Our cities, our towns and our villages are silent, our roads deserted. Public life has all but come to a standstill and we\u2019re missing each other.<br></p> \n   <p>People are frightened by the strangeness, anxious about what will happen next. And we have to remember that every number is a family shaken to its foundation.<br></p> \n   <p>Unable even to carry out the most poignant of ceremonies, a funeral, in the way that they would like. It reminds us of how precious life is, but also how fragile.</p> \n   <p>It reminds us of what really matters, our family, our friends, our relationships. The love we have for one another. Our health.</p> \n   <p>Our connections with those that we don\u2019t know. A greeting from a stranger, a kind word from a neighbour. These make up society. They remind us that we share our lives together. We have to trust one another and look after one another.</p> \n   <p>And I can see this happening, people coming together to help the isolated and the vulnerable, checking on their neighbours.</p> \n   <p>So many volunteering for the NHS, millions of people doing their bit to stop this virus and to save lives.</p> \n   <p>Our willingness to come together like this as a nation has been lying dormant for too long. When millions of us stepped out onto our doorsteps to applaud the carers visibly moved there was hope of a better future. In times like this, we need good government, a government that saves lives and protects our country.</p> \n   <p>It\u2019s a huge responsibility and whether we voted for this government or not, we all rely on it to get this right. That\u2019s why in the national interest the Labour Party will play its full part.</p> \n   <p>Under my leadership we will engage constructively with the government, not opposition for opposition\u2019s sake. Not scoring party political points or making impossible demands. But with the courage to support where that\u2019s the right thing to do.</p> \n   <p>But we will test the arguments that are put forward. We will shine a torch on critical issues and where we see mistakes or faltering government or things not happening as quickly as they should we\u2019ll challenge that and call that out.</p> \n   <p>Our purpose when we do that is the same as the government\u2019s, to save lives and to protect our country, a shared purpose.</p> \n   <p>But that is not the only task for the Labour party. The weeks ahead are going to be really difficult. I fear there are going to be some awful moments for many of us.</p> \n   <p>But we will get through this. The curve will flatten, the wards will empty, the immediate threat will subside. And we have scientists working on vaccines.</p> \n   <p>But when we do get through this we cannot go back to business as usual. This virus has exposed the fragility of our society. It\u2019s lifted a curtain.</p> \n   <p>Too many will have given too much. Some of us will have lost too much. We know in our hearts, things are going to have to change.</p> \n   <p>We can see so clearly now who the key workers really are.<br></p> \n   <p>When we get through this it\u2019ll be because of our NHS staff, our care workers, our ambulance drivers, our emergency services, our cleaners, our porters.</p> \n   <p>It will be because of the hard work and bravery of every key worker a they took on this virus and kept our country going.</p> \n   <p>For too long they\u2019ve been taken for granted and poorly paid. They were last and now they should be first.</p> \n   <p>In their courage and their sacrifice and their bravery, we can see a better future. This crisis has brought out the resilience and human spirit in all of us.</p> \n   <p>We must go forward with a vision of a better society built on that resilience and built on that human spirit. That will require bravery and change in our party as well.</p> \n   <p>I want to thank Rebecca and Lisa for running such passionate and powerful campaigns and for their friendship and support along the way.</p> \n   <p>I want to thank our Labour party staff who worked really hard and my own amazing campaign team, full of positivity, with that unifying spirit.</p> \n   <p>I want to pay tribute to Jeremy Corbyn, who led our party through some really difficult times, who energised our movement and who\u2019s a friend as well as a colleague.</p> \n   <p>And to all of our members, supporters and affiliates I say this: whether you voted for me or not I will represent you, I will listen to you and I will bring our party together.</p> \n   <p>But we have to face the future with honesty.</p> \n   <p>Antisemitism has been a stain on our party. I have seen the grief that it\u2019s brought to so many Jewish communities.</p> \n   <p>On behalf of the Labour party, I am sorry.</p> \n   <p>And I will tear out this poison by its roots and judge success by the return of Jewish members and those who felt that they could no longer support us.</p> \n   <p>The Labour party is an incredible and powerful force for good.</p> \n   <p>Together with those that went before us we\u2019ve changed the lives of millions of people for the better.</p> \n   <p>We created the NHS. We created the welfare state. We passed equalities legislation, the Race Relations Act, we set up the Open University. We built hospitals and schools, established Sure Start and played our part in bringing about peace in Northern Ireland.</p> \n   <p>But we\u2019ve just lost four elections in a row.

They concluded that differential turnout and cohort replacement were the major drivers of electoral change. Slightly over a decade later, S\u00e4rlvik and Crewe (1983) saw sufficient change (21% of voters switched) that they considered there to have been a \u2018decade of dealignment\u2019. However, even the switching seen there seems modest when compared to the levels seen in 2015 (43%) and 2017 (33%). Across the four elections from 2005 to 2017, around 60 per cent of voters switched parties at least once.1 Far from being the minority of the electorate, swing voters \u2014 defined as people who switch their support to different parties between elections \u2014 now comprise the majority of the modern British electorate.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Here are two of the charts from the book that illustrate this point.</p> \n  <p>This chart shows the percentage of voters at general elections from 1966 onwards, voting for a different party from the one they backed at the previous election.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a517fb668cf8acdfe85f75fffe51bf38703158a\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a517fb668cf8acdfe85f75fffe51bf38703158a/0_0_497_336/497..jpg\" alt=\"Individual-level voter volatility at general elections between 1966 and 2017.\" width=\"497\" height=\"336\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Individual-level voter volatility at general elections between 1966 and 2017.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Electoral Shocks</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>And this chart shows how the proportion of voters identifying with a particular party, and strongly identifying with a particular party, has declined over the same period.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7eb48d29d56cddeb920ce62e5a5355d5e4c74b8\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7eb48d29d56cddeb920ce62e5a5355d5e4c74b8/0_0_479_324/479..jpg\" alt=\"Electoral Shocks\" width=\"479\" height=\"324\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Electoral Shocks</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Declining levels of party identification since 1964/Electoral Shocks</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-04T09:46:27.483Z\">at 10.46am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e884f048f080bdb9f53412b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-04T09:19:26.968Z\">10.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Boris Johnson says all parties 'have duty to work together at this moment of national emergency'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Some Conservatives have suggested that <strong>Boris Johnson </strong>should invite the next Labour leader to join <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/covid-coalition-government-considered-by-senior-conservatives\">some form of government of national unity to deal with the coronavirus crisis</a>.

This morning the Labour party is going to announce who has been elected to replace Jeremy Corbyn as leader. Even before the coronavirus pandemic forced the UK, and much of the world, into lockdown, the contest was attracting less interest than some previous ones because Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, was - and is - expected to win easily, and this morning the announcement will be entirely overshadowed by the crisis facing the nation. Plans for a special conference, where the result was going to be unveiled, were cancelled, and instead Labour will just be press releasing the results at 10.45am. </p> \n  <p>But the fact that this announcement will not register as a major news event does not mean it does not matter.

      "bodyText": "Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has won a resounding victory in the Labour leadership contest. He got 56.2% of the first-preference votes, beating Rebecca Long-Bailey (on 27.6%) and Lisa Nandy (on 16.2%). See 11.17am. Angela Rayner was elected deputy leader, with Rosena Allin-Khan as runner-up but a long way behind. See 11.28am. The result marks a decisive break with the Jeremy Corbyn era. Although Starmer was reluctant to criticise Corbyn to any significant extent during the leadership contest, and although he has committed to keeping the key elements of the 2019 Labour manifesto, his background and political outlook make him a very different sort of leader. Corbyn\u2019s enemies in the party have warmly welcomed the result (see 12.45pm), while Corbyn\u2019s supporters have urged Starmer not to abandon Corbyn\u2019s radicalism. (See 11.45am.) You can read the results in full on the Labour website here. Starmer has agreed to meet Boris Johnson next week to discuss the government\u2019s response to the coronavirus crisis. Johnson said in an open letter to opposition party leaders that all parties \u201chave a duty to work together at this moment of national emergency\u201d. (See 10.19am.) But, in his victory speech, Starmer said that working constructively with the government would not mean avoiding being critical when that was deserved. He said: Under my leadership we will engage constructively with the government, not opposition for opposition\u2019s sake. Not scoring party political points or making impossible demands. But with the courage to support where that\u2019s the right thing to do. But we will test the arguments that are put forward. We will shine a torch on critical issues and where we see mistakes or faltering government or things not happening as quickly as they should we\u2019ll challenge that and call that out. Starmer said that there must be no return to \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d after the coronavirus crisis is over. In his victory speech he said: When we do get through this we cannot go back to business as usual. This virus has exposed the fragility of our society. It\u2019s lifted a curtain. Too many will have given too much. Some of us will have lost too much. We know in our hearts, things are going to have to change. We can see so clearly now who the key workers really are. When we get through this it\u2019ll be because of our NHS staff, our care workers, our ambulance drivers, our emergency services, our cleaners, our porters. It will be because of the hard work and bravery of every key worker as they took on this virus and kept our country going. For too long they\u2019ve been taken for granted and poorly paid. They were last and now they should be first. In their courage and their sacrifice and their bravery, we can see a better future. This crisis has brought out the resilience and human spirit in all of us. He issued a fresh apology for antisemitism in the Labour party and promised to \u201ctear out this poison\u201d. In his victory speech he said: Antisemitism has been a stain on our party. I have seen the grief that it\u2019s brought to so many Jewish communities. On behalf of the Labour party, I am sorry. And I will tear out this poison by its roots and judge success by the return of Jewish members and those who felt that they could no longer support us. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Boris Johnson has posted this on Twitter following his call with Sir Keir Starmer. Here are some tweets from journalists about the result. From Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby From HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh From Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall Here are tweets from two of the Labour MPs most critical of Jeremy Corbyn. From Ben Bradshaw From Pat McFadden Labour has also announced the results today of elections to fill three posts on the national executive committee, the party\u2019s governing body. As Sienna Rodgers reports at LabourList, all three posts have gone to candidates backed by \u201ccentrist\u201d groups, not Corbynites. Rodgers explains: In another huge victory for Corbynsceptics today, all three candidates were endorsed by Blairite group Progress and \u2018old right\u2019 organisation Labour First ... Multiple slates were put forward by organisations belonging to the Labour left, however, with Momentum and the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy backing different candidates. Rodgers puts it more bluntly here. By the end of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s time as leader he had majority support on the NEC. But these results will shift the balance a bit, and Sir Keir Starmer will also be able to count on the strong support of some NEC union members who tended to back Corbyn. Control of the NEC is vital because, without its backing, Starmer won\u2019t be able to make any significant changes at party HQ, such as installing a new general secretary. Sir Keir Starmer has accepted Boris Johnson\u2019s offer (see 10.19am) to meet next week to discuss the coronavirus crisis. A spokesperson for the new Labour leader said: This afternoon Keir Starmer spoke with the prime minister about the current national emergency. Keir offered to work constructively with the government on how best to respond to the coronavirus outbreak, accepted the prime minister\u2019s offer to meet next week and agreed arrangements for privy council briefings and discussions. And this is from Ed Miliband, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s predecessor as Labour leader. Miliband is seen as someone who may well be offered a post in Starmer\u2019s shadow cabinet. Here is Jeremy Corbyn on the result. The Conservative party has issued this statement from Amanda Milling, the Conservative party co-chair. Echoing Boris Johnson (see 10.19am), she is urging Starmer to work with the government in fighting the coronavirus. Milling said: I congratulate Keir Starmer on becoming the new leader of the Labour party. The coronavirus is the biggest threat this country has faced in decades, so I call on Keir Starmer to put aside the divisiveness and infighting that has plagued the top of the Labour party for the last five years, and work with the government to support the national effort. At this moment of national emergency, it is important that we all work together to fight this virus by staying at home, to protect our NHS and save lives. Given that even ministers like Matt Hancock have admitted that some aspects of the government\u2019s handling of coronavirus deserve criticism, this will look like an attempt to co-opt Labour into No 10\u2019s strategy to neutralise any political blowback in the future. Here is Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, on the election result. And here is the statement that Lisa Nandy has released congratulating Sir Keir Starmer on his victory. And this is from Rebecca Long-Bailey, the leadership candidate supported by the Corbynite left. She is urging everyone in Labour to support Starmer, who she says will be a \u201cbrilliant prime minister\u201d. This is from Angela Rayner, who has been self-isolating at home while recovering from coronavirus. The Labour MP Jess Phillips, who stood for the Labour leadership herself before withdrawing when it became clear that she would not get enough CLP or union nominations to get onto the final ballot, has just told Sky News that if Starmer offers her a post in the shadow cabinet, she will probably accept. Here is my colleague Rowena Mason\u2019s full story about the leadership election result. Momentum, the Labour organisation for Jeremy Corbyn supporters, has put out a statement saying that it intends to hold Starmer to account and that he should appoint a \u201cbroad\u201d shadow cabinet (ie, one that includes members of the Corbynite left). A Momentum spokesperson said: In four and a half years, Jeremy Corbyn and the movement around him has changed our party and country for the better, giving a voice to the hopes of millions who felt unrepresented in politics. Austerity as a political project has been defeated and the dark days when Labour cheered on privatisation, pursued illegal wars and demonised migrants are long gone. Our membership has tripled in size, we have doubled the number of socialist MPs and our party brims with ideas and vision for a socialist future. Keir has pledged support for most of the programme, including the public ownership of rail, mail, energy and water, a green new deal, kicking the privatisers out of the NHS, scrapping tuition fees, closing down detention centres and taxing the top 5%. His mandate is to build on Jeremy\u2019s transformative vision, and this means appointing a broad shadow cabinet who believe in the policies and will work with members to make them a reality. In this new era Momentum will play a new role. We\u2019ll hold Keir to account and make sure he keeps his promises, champion big ideas like the green new deal, build the power of Labour members and do everything we can to get a Labour government elected. During the leadership contest Starmer ran as a unity candidate and he very intentionally avoided saying anything that might alienate Corbynites in the party. \u201cI profoundly believe that if our party can\u2019t pull together and unify, then we\u2019re going to carry on losing,\u201d Starmer told Andrew Neil in an interview, explaining this strategy. But the left still have their doubts about his intentions, fuelled by stories like this one in last week\u2019s Sunday Times (paywall) claiming that Starmer was planning \u201cto purge Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s allies in the shadow cabinet and party headquarters within weeks of becoming Labour leader\u201d. And here are the results for the deputy leadership. Here are the overall number of votes cast. Here are are the results of the first round. Here are the results of the second round. And here are the results of the third round. Here are the full results of the Labour leadership election. Here are the overall results. And here are the results section by section. Angela Rayner won the deputy leadership on the third round, after the votes of Dawn Butler and Ian Murray were eliminated, the party has confirmed. I will post full details of the results in a moment. Labour has still not released the full results of the ballot yet, but it says that Sir Keir Starmer won with 56.2% of the vote, and Angela Rayner won with 52.6% of the vote. Sky says that\u2019s what Starmer got on the first ballot. It is not clear yet whether or not Rayner won on the first ballot. Sir Keir Starmer has released the text of his victory statement. It is long, but I will post it in full anyway. Here it is. It is the honour and the privilege of my life to be elected as leader of the Labour arty. It comes at a moment like none other in our lifetime. Coronavirus has brought normal life to a halt. Our cities, our towns and our villages are silent, our roads deserted. Public life has all but come to a standstill and we\u2019re missing each other. People are frightened by the strangeness, anxious about what will happen next. And we have to remember that every number is a family shaken to its foundation. Unable even to carry out the most poignant of ceremonies, a funeral, in the way that they would like. It reminds us of how precious life is, but also how fragile. It reminds us of what really matters, our family, our friends, our relationships. The love we have for one another. Our health. Our connections with those that we don\u2019t know. A greeting from a stranger, a kind word from a neighbour. These make up society. They remind us that we share our lives together. We have to trust one another and look after one another. And I can see this happening, people coming together to help the isolated and the vulnerable, checking on their neighbours. So many volunteering for the NHS, millions of people doing their bit to stop this virus and to save lives. Our willingness to come together like this as a nation has been lying dormant for too long. When millions of us stepped out onto our doorsteps to applaud the carers visibly moved there was hope of a better future. In times like this, we need good government, a government that saves lives and protects our country. It\u2019s a huge responsibility and whether we voted for this government or not, we all rely on it to get this right. That\u2019s why in the national interest the Labour Party will play its full part. Under my leadership we will engage constructively with the government, not opposition for opposition\u2019s sake. Not scoring party political points or making impossible demands. But with the courage to support where that\u2019s the right thing to do. But we will test the arguments that are put forward. We will shine a torch on critical issues and where we see mistakes or faltering government or things not happening as quickly as they should we\u2019ll challenge that and call that out. Our purpose when we do that is the same as the government\u2019s, to save lives and to protect our country, a shared purpose. But that is not the only task for the Labour party. The weeks ahead are going to be really difficult. I fear there are going to be some awful moments for many of us. But we will get through this. The curve will flatten, the wards will empty, the immediate threat will subside. And we have scientists working on vaccines. But when we do get through this we cannot go back to business as usual. This virus has exposed the fragility of our society. It\u2019s lifted a curtain. Too many will have given too much. Some of us will have lost too much. We know in our hearts, things are going to have to change. We can see so clearly now who the key workers really are. When we get through this it\u2019ll be because of our NHS staff, our care workers, our ambulance drivers, our emergency services, our cleaners, our porters. It will be because of the hard work and bravery of every key worker a they took on this virus and kept our country going. For too long they\u2019ve been taken for granted and poorly paid. They were last and now they should be first. In their courage and their sacrifice and their bravery, we can see a better future. This crisis has brought out the resilience and human spirit in all of us. We must go forward with a vision of a better society built on that resilience and built on that human spirit. That will require bravery and change in our party as well. I want to thank Rebecca and Lisa for running such passionate and powerful campaigns and for their friendship and support along the way. I want to thank our Labour party staff who worked really hard and my own amazing campaign team, full of positivity, with that unifying spirit. I want to pay tribute to Jeremy Corbyn, who led our party through some really difficult times, who energised our movement and who\u2019s a friend as well as a colleague. And to all of our members, supporters and affiliates I say this: whether you voted for me or not I will represent you, I will listen to you and I will bring our party together. But we have to face the future with honesty. Antisemitism has been a stain on our party. I have seen the grief that it\u2019s brought to so many Jewish communities. On behalf of the Labour party, I am sorry. And I will tear out this poison by its roots and judge success by the return of Jewish members and those who felt that they could no longer support us. The Labour party is an incredible and powerful force for good. Together with those that went before us we\u2019ve changed the lives of millions of people for the better. We created the NHS. We created the welfare state. We passed equalities legislation, the Race Relations Act, we set up the Open University. We built hospitals and schools, established Sure Start and played our part in bringing about peace in Northern Ireland. But we\u2019ve just lost four elections in a row. We\u2019re failing in our historic purpose. Be in no doubt I understand the scale of the task, the gravity of the position that we\u2019re in. We\u2019ve got a mountain to climb. But we will climb it, and I will do my utmost to reconnect us across the country, to re-engage with our communities and voters, to establish a coalition across our towns and our cities and our regions with all creeds and communities to speak for the whole of the country. Where that requires change, we will change. Where that requires us to rethink, we will rethink. Our mission has to be to restore trust in our party as a force for good and a force for change. This is my pledge to the British people. I will do my utmost to guide us through these difficult times, to serve all of our communities and to strive for the good of our country. I will lead this great party into a new era, with confidence and with hope. So that when the time comes, we can serve our country again in government. And Angela Rayner is the new deputy leader, the Press Association has confirmed. Labour has confirmed the result. Sir Keir Starmer has won, the Press Association is reporting. The page on the Labour website, where the leadership result is due to get posted, has crashed. This is from Labour First, a Labour group supporting Sir Keir Starmer. We have not had official confirmation from the party yet. John McDonnell has confirmed he is standing down as shadow chancellor. From the FT\u2019s Jim Pickard: These are from Sunder Katwala, a former general secretary of the Fabian Society. This is from the Labour MP Yvette Cooper who, as the Times reports this morning (see 9.57am) is being seen as a possible candidate of one of the top shadow cabinet jobs if Sir Keir Starmer wins. Winning the next election does look, on the face of it, a near-impossible task for the next Labour leader. The Conservatives have a working majority of nearly 90, Labour needs to gain 124 seats to win the next election outright and current polling (see 10.01am) suggests the Tories have a 24-point lead. But on the plus side (even before you try to make allowance for the long-term impact of the coronavirus pandemic) today\u2019s electorate is more volatile than ever. That is the key conclusion in Electoral Shocks: The Volatile Voter in a Turbulent World, the latest book from the British Election Study team. Published at the end of last year, it focuses on detailed analysis of voting behaviour in the 2015 and 2107 general elections but its core finding is probably more relevant than ever. (Coronavirus is potentially much more disruptive than \u201celectoral shocks\u201d like Brexit and the 2008 financial crisis covered in the book.) A majority of us are now floating voters, the book\u2019s seven authors argue. When Butler and Stokes looked at panel data of vote choice in the 1960s, they observed that only around 13% of those who voted in both elections switched their vote choices between elections (Butler and Stokes 1969). They concluded that differential turnout and cohort replacement were the major drivers of electoral change. Slightly over a decade later, S\u00e4rlvik and Crewe (1983) saw sufficient change (21% of voters switched) that they considered there to have been a \u2018decade of dealignment\u2019. However, even the switching seen there seems modest when compared to the levels seen in 2015 (43%) and 2017 (33%). Across the four elections from 2005 to 2017, around 60 per cent of voters switched parties at least once.1 Far from being the minority of the electorate, swing voters \u2014 defined as people who switch their support to different parties between elections \u2014 now comprise the majority of the modern British electorate. Here are two of the charts from the book that illustrate this point. This chart shows the percentage of voters at general elections from 1966 onwards, voting for a different party from the one they backed at the previous election. And this chart shows how the proportion of voters identifying with a particular party, and strongly identifying with a particular party, has declined over the same period. Some Conservatives have suggested that Boris Johnson should invite the next Labour leader to join some form of government of national unity to deal with the coronavirus crisis. Johnson has not (yet?) adopted the idea, but this morning he released an open letter to the leaders of opposition parties inviting them to attend a briefing on coronavirus next week. \u201cI want to listen to your views,\u201d he said. He added all parties \u201chave a duty to work together at this moment of national emergency\u201d. Meetings of this kind between government and the opposition are, actually, rather routine, and it is not obvious that the opposition party leaders will hear anything that Johnson and his medical and scientific advisers have not been saying at their daily press conferences. In an interview with Prospect magazine recently, former Labour leader Neil Kinnock said Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s successor should steer clear of a government of national unity. Corbyn himself has also opposed the idea, telling the Daily Telegraph this week that: It\u2019s the duty of opposition parties to hold it to account, and that is exactly what we\u2019re doing. I think we should be challenging the government and challenging them on the economic response, challenging them on job security, and that is the way to get better government and better decisions. If everybody got together and said: \u2018We\u2019re all absolutely in this together we won\u2019t criticise each other\u2019, that is a negation of what our democratic society is about. Lisa Nandy posted this on Twitter this morning. The new Labour leader will take over a party that is trailing in the polls by a huge margin. Here are the results of a YouGov poll released yesterday showing the Conservatives 24 points ahead of Labour. And this chart, from Ipsos MORI (pdf), shows how Labour has fared in the polls throughout the entirety of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership. In its preview story on the Labour leadership the Times says that Sir Keir Starmer is \u201cpreparing to resurrect the frontline political careers of several senior female Labour MPs who spent much of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership on the back benches\u201d. The story (paywall) goes on: [Starmer] will begin appointing his shadow cabinet next week but it will not meet face to face until the government relaxes social distancing rules. Several Labour MPs who declined to serve or were ignored under Mr Corbyn are expected to be promoted. They are likely to include Rachel Reeves, the shadow work and pensions secretary under Ed Miliband, who is chairwoman of the business select committee ... Senior roles are also expected for Jess Phillips and Lisa Nandy, who both stood against Sir Keir for the leadership. Ms Nandy served in Mr Corbyn\u2019s shadow cabinet but stood down after nine months. Yvette Cooper, the chairwoman of the home affairs select committee and a minister under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, could also return. She might be tempted back if Sir Keir offered her the role of shadow chancellor or shadow home secretary. Roles could also be offered to Lucy Powell, the former shadow education secretary, as well as Angela and Maria Eagle. James Schneider, a former aide to Jeremy Corbyn who has been supporting the Rebecca Long-Bailey campaign, thinks the thrust of the story is unfair to his old boss. Some bookmakers have suspended taking bets on Sir Keir Starmer winning because they think it is such an inevitability. But, as the political betting expert Mike Smithson points out, there are odds on what his winning margin might be. Good morning. This morning the Labour party is going to announce who has been elected to replace Jeremy Corbyn as leader. Even before the coronavirus pandemic forced the UK, and much of the world, into lockdown, the contest was attracting less interest than some previous ones because Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, was - and is - expected to win easily, and this morning the announcement will be entirely overshadowed by the crisis facing the nation. Plans for a special conference, where the result was going to be unveiled, were cancelled, and instead Labour will just be press releasing the results at 10.45am. But the fact that this announcement will not register as a major news event does not mean it does not matter. Hopefully the next Labour leader will be with us a lot longer than coronavirus, and the result revealed this morning will over time shape our politics considerably. Starmer and his two rivals, Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, and Lisa Nandy, have all been asked to pre-record video messages to be released in case they win. Labour will also be announcing the results of the deputy leadership election. Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, is widely expected to get the job, but she is up against four other candidates: Richard Burgon, Dawn Butler, Ian Murray and Rosena Allin-Khan. Here is my colleague Rajeev Syal\u2019s preview story. And this is how Rajeev\u2019s story starts. Keir Starmer\u2019s plans to transform the Labour party will be dictated by the scale of his anticipated victory on Saturday, key supporters have said, as senior Jeremy Corbyn supporters expressed concerns they could be purged from key positions. Allies of the former director of public prosecutions say they will be watching to see whether he can achieve an emphatic win before assessing how quickly he can remake the party in his own image, with a clearout of those responsible for the damaging 2019 election defeat. MPs who support Starmer, 57, are hoping that a resounding victory will put pressure on some of the key individuals close to Corbyn to step down. They are said to include Karie Murphy, Corbyn\u2019s chief of staff and one of the election\u2019s directors, and Jennie Formby, the party\u2019s general secretary. I will be covering the results, the build-up to their announcement (such as there is any) and providing reaction and analysis. I will be wrapping up at around lunchtime. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

But, for some Republicans, it\u2019s also a political opportunity: anti-abortion activists are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/ohio-texas-abortion-us-coronavirus-outbreak\">ruthlessly using the pandemic</a> as an excuse to crack down on reproductive rights. Six conservative states \u2013 Indiana, Iowa, Mississippi, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas \u2013 have categorized abortions as non-essential, except in very limited cases, effectively banning access to the procedure during the pandemic.</p> <p>Federal judges have <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-04-02/red-states-block-abortion-coronavirus-outbreak\">stopped the bans from going into effect</a> in most of these states. However, on Tuesday an <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/emaoconnor/texas-abortion-ban-coronavirus-upheld-court\">appeals court ruled</a> that Texas could reinstate its abortion ban. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/tarahaelle/2020/04/01/texas-governor-says-attending-church-is-essential-but-abortions-can-wait-indefinitely/#4bbf89318ab3\">On the same day</a> women were told that their reproductive rights were considered dispensable, Texas\u2019s Governor Greg Abbott declared that religious services were \u201cessential\u201d and in-person gatherings could continue during the pandemic. This is despite the fact that there have been multiple cases of coronavirus spreading in <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2020/04/02/texas-churches-coronavirus-stay-open/\">places of worship</a>, with people dying as a result.</p> <p>Getting an abortion in Texas wasn\u2019t exactly easy before Covid-19; the state has <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-abortion-patients-20-times-longer-care/\">21 clinics for </a><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-abortion-patients-20-times-longer-care/\">6 million women of reproductive age</a>. But now desperate women are going to be forced to put themselves in danger by traveling long distances to get care in neighboring states. According to the <a href=\"https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2020/04/covid-19-abortion-bans-would-greatly-increase-driving-distances-those-seeking-care\">Guttmacher Institute</a> the Texas ban has increased one-way distances to an abortion clinic from 12 miles to 243 miles; that\u2019s an increase of almost 2,000%. As is the case with all restrictions on abortion, the burden will fall disproportionately on low-income women without the resources to travel.</p> <p>It is also likely that the Texas abortion ban will result in more women attempting dangerous DIY procedures. According to a recent study women in Texas are already <a href=\"https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/texas/article/DIY-abortion-attempts-three-times-as-prevalent-in-14962685.php\">three times more likely</a> to try to end their pregnancy on their own than women in other states.</p> <p>There is nothing pro-life about exploiting an emergency to further a political agenda. There\u2019s nothing pro-life about forcing women to give birth during a pandemic. There\u2019s nothing pro-life about women having to put themselves in danger to get the help they need, and the services the constitution is supposed to protect. But, as has always been clear, anti-abortion fanatics don\u2019t care about \u201clife\u201d, they care about control.</p> <p>The Texas abortion ban is supposed to be temporary. But our civil liberties are most fragile during times of fear and crisis; rights that are lost are not easily won back. It\u2019s not just our physical health that we need to worry about during this pandemic; it\u2019s the health of our democracy. As is already apparent, a small minority of zealots will do everything they can to use this crisis to eradicate the <a href=\"https://rewire.news/article/2020/04/03/covid-19-could-bring-the-end-of-roe-v-wade/\">right to an abortion in America</a>.</p> <h2>Don\u2019t nag your husband during the lockdown, ladies</h2> <p>The Malaysian government recently put out a series of online posters advising the country\u2019s women not to nag their husbands during the coronavirus lockdown.

This advice did not go down very well and the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/malaysian-government-apologises-over-coronavirus-lockdown-tips-for-women\">has now apologized</a>.</p> <h2>Peru and Panama institute sex-based curfew to combat coronavirus spread</h2> <p>In Panama, women are <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/01/world/panama-coronavirus-sex-intl/index.html\">allowed to leave home</a> to buy necessities on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

      "bodyText": "Sign up for the Week in Patriarchy, a newsletter on feminism and sexism sent every Saturday. Texas says abortion not essential, church services are Coronavirus is an unprecedented public health crisis. But, for some Republicans, it\u2019s also a political opportunity: anti-abortion activists are ruthlessly using the pandemic as an excuse to crack down on reproductive rights. Six conservative states \u2013 Indiana, Iowa, Mississippi, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas \u2013 have categorized abortions as non-essential, except in very limited cases, effectively banning access to the procedure during the pandemic. Federal judges have stopped the bans from going into effect in most of these states. However, on Tuesday an appeals court ruled that Texas could reinstate its abortion ban. On the same day women were told that their reproductive rights were considered dispensable, Texas\u2019s Governor Greg Abbott declared that religious services were \u201cessential\u201d and in-person gatherings could continue during the pandemic. This is despite the fact that there have been multiple cases of coronavirus spreading in places of worship, with people dying as a result. Getting an abortion in Texas wasn\u2019t exactly easy before Covid-19; the state has 21 clinics for 6 million women of reproductive age. But now desperate women are going to be forced to put themselves in danger by traveling long distances to get care in neighboring states. According to the Guttmacher Institute the Texas ban has increased one-way distances to an abortion clinic from 12 miles to 243 miles; that\u2019s an increase of almost 2,000%. As is the case with all restrictions on abortion, the burden will fall disproportionately on low-income women without the resources to travel. It is also likely that the Texas abortion ban will result in more women attempting dangerous DIY procedures. According to a recent study women in Texas are already three times more likely to try to end their pregnancy on their own than women in other states. There is nothing pro-life about exploiting an emergency to further a political agenda. There\u2019s nothing pro-life about forcing women to give birth during a pandemic. There\u2019s nothing pro-life about women having to put themselves in danger to get the help they need, and the services the constitution is supposed to protect. But, as has always been clear, anti-abortion fanatics don\u2019t care about \u201clife\u201d, they care about control. The Texas abortion ban is supposed to be temporary. But our civil liberties are most fragile during times of fear and crisis; rights that are lost are not easily won back. It\u2019s not just our physical health that we need to worry about during this pandemic; it\u2019s the health of our democracy. As is already apparent, a small minority of zealots will do everything they can to use this crisis to eradicate the right to an abortion in America. Don\u2019t nag your husband during the lockdown, ladies The Malaysian government recently put out a series of online posters advising the country\u2019s women not to nag their husbands during the coronavirus lockdown. Posters also urged women not to be \u201csarcastic\u201d and to dress up and wear makeup. This advice did not go down very well and the government has now apologized. Peru and Panama institute sex-based curfew to combat coronavirus spread In Panama, women are allowed to leave home to buy necessities on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Men can go out on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. Nobody can leave the house on Sunday. Similar sex-based measures are in place in Peru. It\u2019s like a dystopic Craig David song. It\u2019s also a nightmare for trans people: police in Panama have already detained a transgender woman for being out on the wrong day. 31 March was International Day of Transgender Visibility Idaho celebrated it by pushing through two anti-transgender bills. The state\u2019s Republican governor approved discriminatory legislation that prohibits transgender people from changing the sex on their birth certificate and banned transgender girls and women from competing in female sports. Australia offers free childcare during coronavirus crisis The Australian government is promoting this plan as a way to keep childcare centers open during the crisis. While free childcare sounds brilliant, Eva Cox unpicks the problems with the program in the Guardian. \u201cRather than using the crisis as the means to reform the problematic high-fee structures and maldistribution of childcare services \u2013 let alone needed reforms to very low pay rates \u2013 good PR appears to be the aim.\u201d Pregnant women, listen up! \u201cFile for the [US government] stimulus for your fetus,\u201d a viral tweet this week advised. \u201cYou either get paid, or Republicans will have to admit a fetus isn\u2019t a child.\u201d Gender reveal party causes large fire in Florida Please, please, please can the awful gender reveal party craze end?

Last week, for example, the government agreed to change its coronavirus job retention scheme guidance after campaigning by Lewis: firms can now rehire and furlough employees who left their job for a new job, which then fell through due to Covid-19. Lewis explains: \u201cI talk to the powers-that-be, in confidence, [and] I spoke to somebody significant, who I didn\u2019t really have a relationship with before this. I\u2019m trying to find answers. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m prioritising the bigger and more desperate needs in terms of getting information to try to help people. Many people are facing a destruction of income that is catastrophic for their financial and mental health.\u201d Despite spending his life fighting for consumers, often speaking in deliberately combative terms about \u201crip-off\u201d companies, he feels sympathetic to the plight of businesses hit hard by the lockdown. He is urging those who can afford it to accept vouchers instead of refunds for unusable tickets from airlines, theatres and festivals. \u201cWe want as few victims of coronavirus as possible, and that means, where we can, we need to show compassion and consideration \u2013 even to companies.\u201d Over the past fortnight, Lewis \u2013 who sold his website for more than \u00a380m in 2012 but remains editor-in-chief \u2013 has also set up his own fund for charities providing poverty relief during the outbreak. He has pledged \u00a31.9m of his estimated \u00a3128m fortune to the fund, and is calling for more rich donors to join him. \u201cI\u2019m talking to people in charities who are just desperate, saying we want to help people but all our fundraising streams have dried up.\u201d He hopes to keep workers in at least 400 charities in their jobs, as well as providing emergency funding to those most in need. But on a more emotional level, his donation \u201cwas partly to make myself feel better, if I\u2019m honest. Because I thought: I can\u2019t just sit here. I\u2019ve got to do something. I\u2019ve got to make sure, as best I can, that someone\u2019s going to give these people food.\u201d",

And governments spurred into action. Since mid-March \u2013 when the government first recommended self-isolation measures as a way to tackle the spread of the world-altering respiratory disease Covid-19 \u2013 a public shaming frenzy has spread across social media. Thousands of people are blaming, naming, and shaming others for their improper pandemic practices; those targeted include <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/03/19/coronavirus-spring-break-party/\">drunk spring breakers</a>, coughing commuters, flower markets, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/17/pop-stars-criticise-fans-over-coronavirus-inaction-billie-eilish-taylor-swift-ariana-grande-camila-cabello\">Stereophonics fans</a>, and romcom screenwriter Richard Curtis\u2019s daughter.</p> \n<p>When it comes to the crime of not taking a global pandemic seriously, perhaps online shaming is the perfect punishment. After all, if you go to a packed public place or hoard paracetamol, you\u2019re endangering other people\u2019s lives. Yet is pointing the finger actually a productive way to change others\u2019 behaviour? Are we simply spreading discord at an already distressing time? At worst, are we blaming individuals for the inconsistent and confused measures implemented by the government?</p> \n<p>The term \u201c<a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Covidiot\">covidiot</a>\u201d was first uploaded to the online slang decoder Urban Dictionary on 16 March and was defined as: \u201cSomeone who ignores the warnings regarding public health or safety.\u201d On Twitter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/covidiot\">#covidiot</a> skyrocketed on the evening of 22 March; overnight, <a href=\"https://keyhole.co/hashtag-tracking/dashboard/3LmEQ9/covidiot?realtimePreview=true\">nearly 3,000 tweets</a> used it to call out poor practices. That same day, Hilda \u2013 a 49-year-old who runs the Facebook and Twitter accounts for Columbia Road flower market in east London \u2013 received an influx of notifications.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The worst was someone saying, \u2018I hope you and your family stay healthy and alive but sadly I doubt all of them will\u2019</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m still feeling slightly traumatised by it,\u201d says Hilda, whose name has been changed on her request, after a BBC journalist tweeted a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dinosofos/status/1241697657690734593\">picture of the market</a>, which appeared heavily crowded despite social distancing rules. The picture was \u201cliked\u201d nearly 4,000 times, with commenters bemoaning the \u201cstupidity\u201d of those in attendance. Hilda began to receive angry comments, tweets, emails, and phone calls complaining that the market should be shut down. To make matters worse, the social media accounts she runs are for market shopkeepers, and she had no control over whether the market as a whole opened (that decision lay with the local council).</p> \n<p>\u201cThe worst thing I had to open and read was someone saying, \u2018I hope you and your family stay healthy and alive but sadly I doubt all of them will,\u2019\u201d Hilda says. \u201cThey were very vitriolic \u2026 The world feels really dark and horrible.\u201d A day later, after newspapers splashed pictures from Columbia Road and other markets, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, branded those who visited crowded places \u201cvery selfish\u201d \u2013 that evening, new lockdown measures were put in place by the government. Yet Hilda argues that, at the time, people hadn\u2019t broken any rules. \u201cThe government advice was if you\u2019re healthy, go outside and exercise\u2026 that\u2019s what people were doing.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hilda is far from the only person to be \u201cpandemic-shamed\u201d. On 16 March, activist Scarlett Curtis uploaded an Instagram video of herself washing her hands for nearly 30 seconds, and commenters complained she used an improper technique. \u201cPlease can we not shame anyone during this hard time,\u201d she countered. \u201cNow is the time for community not judgment.\u201d</p> \n<p>Perhaps the most egregious shaming came on 18 March, when CBS News tweeted a video of American spring breakers partying in Miami. In the video, drunk students flagrantly disregard social distancing recommendations, one declaring: \u201cIf I get corona, I get corona.\u201d The video was subtitled with the full names of every student interviewed.</p> \n<p>The clip was \u201cliked\u201d more than 96,000 times and was flooded with comments berating the students\u2019 appearances and intelligence. People began tweeting the students\u2019 names and linking to their social media profiles, writing: \u201cI have a feeling the following people will have a hard time finding a job upon graduation\u201d (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/kate_m_mcg/status/1240465770569662465\">288 likes</a>) and \u201cHospitals take note of these names. Do not give these selfish dumbfucks beds and/or respirators\u201d (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/aldentanaka/status/1240410951045623808\">84 likes</a>). Some went further and contacted the students\u2019 schools, with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/macndemocracy/status/1240477462779195392\">one tweeter</a> asking for a student\u2019s scholarship to be rescinded (the same student later deleted their Facebook page).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"65a9450f-4bec-4555-bdb0-c829a2782b42\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What do the restrictions involve?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Shopping for basic necessities, as infrequently as possible</li>\n     <li>One form of exercise a day \u2013 for example a run, walk, or cycle \u2013 alone or with members of your household</li>\n     <li>Any medical need, to provide care or to help a vulnerable person</li>\n     <li>Travelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the instruction to stay at home, the government will:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Close all shops selling non-essential goods, including clothing and electronic stores and other premises including libraries, playgrounds and outdoor gyms, and places of worship</li>\n     <li>Stop all gatherings of more than two people in public \u2013 excluding people you live with</li>\n     <li>Stop all social events, including weddings, baptisms and other ceremonies, but excluding funerals</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Parks will remain open for exercise, but gatherings will be dispersed.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The anger behind these messages is understandable \u2013 mass-gatherings endanger people\u2019s lives by facilitating the spread of the virus. And just three days earlier, internet shaming arguably had a productive outcome. After a Tennessee man received a barrage of angry comments for stockpiling 17,700 bottles of hand sanitiser to sell for inflated prices, he expressed remorse and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/technology/matt-colvin-hand-sanitizer-donation.html\">donated his stock to a local church.</a></p> \n<p>Shaming has also been used effectively to improve employees\u2019 lives during the pandemic: after Waterstones\u2019 chief executive, James Daunt, announced its stores would be staying open, an online backlash prompted him to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/waterstones-staff-say-their-health-is-at-risk-as-stores-stay-open\">reverse the decision</a> within a day. The same happened to Sports Direct, while Wetherspoon\u2019s was shamed online and off (with branches graffitied) after its chairman, Tim Martin, claimed that he couldn\u2019t afford to pay staff. A tweet calling Martin a \u201ctwat\u201d gained more than 30,000 likes, and the pay decision was reversed after he met with hospitality experts.</p> \n<p>Yet pandemic shaming can also have dire consequences. On 18 March, the Polish press reported that a professor infected with coronavirus, Wojciech Rokita, died after being flooded with hateful <a href=\"https://kielce.wyborcza.pl/kielce/7,47262,25805201,kolejny-raz-zszedl-ze-sceny-niepokonany.html?disableRedirects=true\">online comments</a>. Rumours had spread \u2013 both online and in local media \u2013 that 54-year-old Rokita had not complied with his quarantine and had <a href=\"https://www.polsatnews.pl/wiadomosc/2020-03-18/nie-zyje-lekarz-zakazony-koronawirusem-mial-mierzyc-sie-z-nieprawdopodobnym-hejtem/\">visited a car showroom</a> after being diagnosed with coronavirus. On 19 March, a lawyer representing Rokita\u2019s family claimed the professor had not violated his quarantine, and had taken his own life as a result of the \u201cwave of hate\u201d he faced online.</p> \n<p>The story of the remorseful Tennessee hoarder is also less uplifting on second glance. The <em>New York Times</em> reported that the man received hate mail and death threats, with one stranger banging on his door late at night. \u201cYour behaviour is probably going to end up with someone killing you and your wife and your children,\u201d read one email. The man has also lost his livelihood \u2013 he is now banned from selling on eBay and Amazon, previously his sole form of income.</p> \n<p>It is hardly surprising that online shaming can have tragic consequences, but when it comes to coronavirus, you could argue that shamers endanger one person in order to save many more. Yet do the shamed actually change their minds as a result of hateful comments? Is shaming actually productive?</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat they were saying was absolutely outrageous,\u201d says Laura, a 17-year-old who received online hate after attending a Stereophonics gig in Manchester on 13 March (her name has been changed on her request). Laura emphasises that when she attended the concert, mass gatherings hadn\u2019t been banned by the government (although some artists had cancelled their gigs). \u201cI had people telling me I was going to kill people, someone private messaged me saying, \u2018I hope you feel great about yourself when you\u2019re the one who\u2019s killed your whole family,\u2019\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t change my mind, they didn\u2019t make me regret that I went,\u201d Laura goes on. She received the comments on a tweet she posted after the gig, and therefore notes: \u201cWhat they were saying was irrelevant because what had happened had already been and gone, so they couldn\u2019t have stopped me from going.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6397723a-89fe-4de7-80bc-982c5aa7f79f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JbvWniXcNhA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Three days earlier, 24-year-old Jardin May from Texas received a flood of comments after tweeting, \u201cCoronavirus is everywhere. BOOK THAT FLIGHT. Take that trip. You probably won\u2019t die from it, but even if you do \u2026 You wanna die with the Eiffel Tower in the background \u2026\u201d</p> \n<p>May says some commenters educated her about coronavirus \u2013 those who were calm and polite taught her that she shouldn\u2019t be concerned about herself, but rather the elderly and vulnerable people she might infect. \u201cA lot of the stuff I know about coronavirus I didn\u2019t learn till the calmer people in the comments were like, \u2018Hey, just be careful\u2019,\u201d May says. \u201cBut Twitter took it and ran with it.\u201d</p> \n<p>A fortnight later, May is still receiving notifications from the tweet, and she is continually being branded \u201cfucking stupid and selfish\u201d, a \u201cbitch\u201d, \u201cmurderer\u201d, and a \u201cmoron\u201d. \u201cThey were extremely aggressive, they were like, \u2018Oh I hope your family dies\u2019; \u2018I hope you get sick and you die from it,\u2019\u201d May says of the initial messages she received. \u201cI did feel like a lot of people were wasting their breath, because if you\u2019re doing angry tweeting and cursing and threats, I\u2019m not gonna read it.\u201d</p> \n<p>The venom generated hasn\u2019t prevented the state from adopting online shaming during the coronavirus crisis. While individuals use it to police behaviour, now the actual police are using it to denounce members of the public. On 27 March, Derbyshire police released drone footage which labelled anonymous dog walkers and exercisers on the Peaks as indulging in outlawed \u201cnot essential\u201d travel. The former justice secretary, David Gauke, described the shaming as \u201cbadly misjudged\u201d.</p> \n<p>And last Sunday (29 March) after tweeting a photo of his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/29/stephen-kinnock-targeted-by-police-for-visiting-father-neil\">physically distanced birthday visit</a> to his father Neil, Labour MP Stephen Kinnock was criticised by the South Wales police Twitter account \u2013 \u201cA lovely thing to do, however this is not essential travel.\u201d When Kinnock replied pointing out he had been delivering \u201cnecessary supplies\u201d, the force thanked him for the \u201cclarification\u201d. The Twittersphere was divided over whether this was a good use of police time.</p> \n<p>Dr June Tangney, a psychology professor at George Mason University, and author of <em><a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2002-00509-000\">Shame and Guilt</a></em>, doubts shaming will prevent poor pandemic behaviour. \u201cBy shaming people, we\u2019re actually encouraging the opposite,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen people feel shamed, they tend to get very defensive, they tend to blame other people, they\u2019re disinclined to take responsibility, and they\u2019re not any more likely to change their behaviour.\u201d</p> \n<p>So why are we really shaming others during a pandemic? Dr Lydia Woodyatt is a social sciences professor at Flinders University whose research has shown that schadenfreude motivates online shaming. \u201cThe same things that drive hostility and collective action offline can drive shaming behaviour online: anger, identification with others in the cause, schadenfreude, belief that our actions together will make a difference,\u201d she explains. She points to recent research by PhD students at her university which found that when an online leader emphasises the nobility of the \u201cgoal\u201d of their shaming, people are more likely to shame.</p> \n<p>You\u2019d struggle to find a more noble goal than saving lives, so it makes sense that there\u2019s been an increase in shaming in recent weeks. Yet Woodyatt also points to a simpler explanation \u2013 with social isolation increasingly common, more and more people are online for longer stretches of time, and this is an issue that encompasses the entire world. \u201cThe sense of loss of control can mean that people try and take control of what they feel they can control,\u201d she adds.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Shame is one of our most primitive feelings ... if it happens on a grand scale it can be psychologically traumatic</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Dr Aaron Balick</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Schadenfreude and a bit of boredom might explain the reaction to a tweet posted by nightclub owner Fraser Carruthers on 16 March. Responding to Boris Johnson\u2019s recommendation that the public stop visiting pubs, Carruthers tweeted: \u201cI am a nightclub owner in Kensington and Chelsea. You can\u2019t tell the nation to avoid \u2018pubs and clubs\u2019 and not officially \u2018close us\u2019 so that we can claim our insurance.\u201d When online sleuths discovered that he had previously tweeted \u201cAnyone but Corbyn\u201d, they mocked the 37-year-old as deserving of his fate.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was a mind-blowing response,\u201d says Carruthers, who says he had \u201chundreds and hundreds\u201d of messages for \u201cthree days non-stop\u201d. He was particularly alarmed by commenters who wished he and his family would end up on the street. \u201cIt really makes you think there are some horrible people in this world.\u201d Carruthers believes the response was so strong because of the \u201cstigma\u201d of Kensington and Chelsea, but notes he didn\u2019t actually vote Conservative in the 2019 election \u2013 he voted for the Animal Welfare party.</p> \n<p>Of course, in the middle of a global pandemic, nightclub owners aren\u2019t the people we should feel sorriest for. Yet the vitriol Carruthers received demonstrates that online shaming isn\u2019t always altruistic. <a href=\"https://www.freud.org.uk/2013/10/23/psychodynamics-social-networking/\">Dr Aaron Balick</a>, a psychotherapist from London and author of <em>The Psychodynamics of Social Networking</em>, argues that online shamers are \u201chardly doing it for the safety of society. They\u2019re doing it because they get to be right and someone else gets to be wrong.\u201d</p> \n<p>Balick says pandemic shaming may be caused by fear, as \u201cpeople tend to regress when they\u2019re frightened\u201d. Yet like Tangney, he believes shaming is counterproductive and potentially dangerous. \u201cShame is one of our most primitive feelings. It does hurt, very, very deeply, and if it happens on a grand scale, like on Twitter, it can be psychologically traumatic,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>Arguably, the repercussions of online shaming aren\u2019t as severe as they were five years ago, when journalist Jon Ronson wrote his book <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/15/publicly-shamed-jon-ronson-is-shame-necessary-jennifer-jacquet-review-think-before-you-tweet\">So You\u2019ve Been Publicly Shamed</a>,</em> chronicling the trauma, job losses, and damaged lives of the internet-shamed. Nowadays, trending topics move so quickly that it is difficult for one individual to capture the entire internet\u2019s attention for long. Even actor Vanessa Hudgens, who employed her best vocal fry to say, \u201cLike yeah, people are going to die, which is terrible \u2026 but inevitable?\u201d on Instagram on 16 March, got away relatively unscathed. Though Hudgens was flooded with hate and forced to issue an apology, model <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrissyteigen/status/1240123787993133058\">Chrissy Teigen came to her defence</a> and gained 75,000 likes for tweeting that when people make misjudged comments, \u201cu don\u2019t have [to] ruin their lives\u201d.</p> \n<p>And indeed, if we now know the consequences of online shaming, we should also know the consequences of what we post online. May, the tweeter who encouraged people to book cheap flights, says she doesn\u2019t think the backlash was unfair because she was aware that \u201cthis is the internet\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s open for everyone to leave their opinion\u201d.</p> \n<p>It is also possible that while shaming doesn\u2019t change the behaviour of the shamed, it can adjust cultural norms. An anonymous 27-year-old says that seeing others hectored online changed his own habits. \u201cIn general it just made me take it way more seriously,\u201d he says, explaining that he had initially still planned to go on holiday and had a \u201ccavalier\u201d attitude to the dangers. \u201cOnline hectoring [of others] did force me to see that behaviour as selfish and individualistic \u2026 perhaps more than straight up relaying that information in a calm and dispassionate way would have done.\u201d</p> \n<p>Yet overall, the experts do not believe in the power of public shame. \u201cBy increasing hostility in an otherwise volatile environment we are just promoting the norm of hostility and aggression as a means of coping,\u201d Woodyatt says. \u201cI think we should all agree that is not a good idea. Humans can communicate social norms in calm and non-aggressive ways. We are all in this together.\u201d </p> \n<p>Jon Ronson, too, is not a fan of pandemic shaming (though he notes that we can and should criticise public figures who are putting people in danger). \u201cAs we\u2019re forced to isolate,\u201d he says, \u201cwe need to be able to connect with other people. It can make the difference between being happy and stoical and being depressed. The very best thing Twitter could be right now is a nice place for people to visit and find connection.\u201d</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 and the domestic violence helpline is 0808 2000 247.

That same day, Hilda \u2013 a 49-year-old who runs the Facebook and Twitter accounts for Columbia Road flower market in east London \u2013 received an influx of notifications. \u201cI\u2019m still feeling slightly traumatised by it,\u201d says Hilda, whose name has been changed on her request, after a BBC journalist tweeted a picture of the market, which appeared heavily crowded despite social distancing rules. The picture was \u201cliked\u201d nearly 4,000 times, with commenters bemoaning the \u201cstupidity\u201d of those in attendance. Hilda began to receive angry comments, tweets, emails, and phone calls complaining that the market should be shut down. To make matters worse, the social media accounts she runs are for market shopkeepers, and she had no control over whether the market as a whole opened (that decision lay with the local council). \u201cThe worst thing I had to open and read was someone saying, \u2018I hope you and your family stay healthy and alive but sadly I doubt all of them will,\u2019\u201d Hilda says. \u201cThey were very vitriolic \u2026 The world feels really dark and horrible.\u201d A day later, after newspapers splashed pictures from Columbia Road and other markets, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, branded those who visited crowded places \u201cvery selfish\u201d \u2013 that evening, new lockdown measures were put in place by the government. Yet Hilda argues that, at the time, people hadn\u2019t broken any rules. \u201cThe government advice was if you\u2019re healthy, go outside and exercise\u2026 that\u2019s what people were doing.\u201d Hilda is far from the only person to be \u201cpandemic-shamed\u201d. On 16 March, activist Scarlett Curtis uploaded an Instagram video of herself washing her hands for nearly 30 seconds, and commenters complained she used an improper technique. \u201cPlease can we not shame anyone during this hard time,\u201d she countered. \u201cNow is the time for community not judgment.\u201d Perhaps the most egregious shaming came on 18 March, when CBS News tweeted a video of American spring breakers partying in Miami. In the video, drunk students flagrantly disregard social distancing recommendations, one declaring: \u201cIf I get corona, I get corona.\u201d The video was subtitled with the full names of every student interviewed. The clip was \u201cliked\u201d more than 96,000 times and was flooded with comments berating the students\u2019 appearances and intelligence. People began tweeting the students\u2019 names and linking to their social media profiles, writing: \u201cI have a feeling the following people will have a hard time finding a job upon graduation\u201d (288 likes) and \u201cHospitals take note of these names. Do not give these selfish dumbfucks beds and/or respirators\u201d (84 likes). Some went further and contacted the students\u2019 schools, with one tweeter asking for a student\u2019s scholarship to be rescinded (the same student later deleted their Facebook page). The anger behind these messages is understandable \u2013 mass-gatherings endanger people\u2019s lives by facilitating the spread of the virus. And just three days earlier, internet shaming arguably had a productive outcome. After a Tennessee man received a barrage of angry comments for stockpiling 17,700 bottles of hand sanitiser to sell for inflated prices, he expressed remorse and donated his stock to a local church. Shaming has also been used effectively to improve employees\u2019 lives during the pandemic: after Waterstones\u2019 chief executive, James Daunt, announced its stores would be staying open, an online backlash prompted him to reverse the decision within a day. The same happened to Sports Direct, while Wetherspoon\u2019s was shamed online and off (with branches graffitied) after its chairman, Tim Martin, claimed that he couldn\u2019t afford to pay staff. A tweet calling Martin a \u201ctwat\u201d gained more than 30,000 likes, and the pay decision was reversed after he met with hospitality experts. Yet pandemic shaming can also have dire consequences. On 18 March, the Polish press reported that a professor infected with coronavirus, Wojciech Rokita, died after being flooded with hateful online comments. Rumours had spread \u2013 both online and in local media \u2013 that 54-year-old Rokita had not complied with his quarantine and had visited a car showroom after being diagnosed with coronavirus. On 19 March, a lawyer representing Rokita\u2019s family claimed the professor had not violated his quarantine, and had taken his own life as a result of the \u201cwave of hate\u201d he faced online. The story of the remorseful Tennessee hoarder is also less uplifting on second glance. The New York Times reported that the man received hate mail and death threats, with one stranger banging on his door late at night. \u201cYour behaviour is probably going to end up with someone killing you and your wife and your children,\u201d read one email. The man has also lost his livelihood \u2013 he is now banned from selling on eBay and Amazon, previously his sole form of income. It is hardly surprising that online shaming can have tragic consequences, but when it comes to coronavirus, you could argue that shamers endanger one person in order to save many more. Yet do the shamed actually change their minds as a result of hateful comments? Is shaming actually productive? \u201cWhat they were saying was absolutely outrageous,\u201d says Laura, a 17-year-old who received online hate after attending a Stereophonics gig in Manchester on 13 March (her name has been changed on her request). Laura emphasises that when she attended the concert, mass gatherings hadn\u2019t been banned by the government (although some artists had cancelled their gigs). \u201cI had people telling me I was going to kill people, someone private messaged me saying, \u2018I hope you feel great about yourself when you\u2019re the one who\u2019s killed your whole family,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cThey didn\u2019t change my mind, they didn\u2019t make me regret that I went,\u201d Laura goes on. She received the comments on a tweet she posted after the gig, and therefore notes: \u201cWhat they were saying was irrelevant because what had happened had already been and gone, so they couldn\u2019t have stopped me from going.\u201d Three days earlier, 24-year-old Jardin May from Texas received a flood of comments after tweeting, \u201cCoronavirus is everywhere. BOOK THAT FLIGHT. Take that trip. You probably won\u2019t die from it, but even if you do \u2026 You wanna die with the Eiffel Tower in the background \u2026\u201d May says some commenters educated her about coronavirus \u2013 those who were calm and polite taught her that she shouldn\u2019t be concerned about herself, but rather the elderly and vulnerable people she might infect. \u201cA lot of the stuff I know about coronavirus I didn\u2019t learn till the calmer people in the comments were like, \u2018Hey, just be careful\u2019,\u201d May says. \u201cBut Twitter took it and ran with it.\u201d A fortnight later, May is still receiving notifications from the tweet, and she is continually being branded \u201cfucking stupid and selfish\u201d, a \u201cbitch\u201d, \u201cmurderer\u201d, and a \u201cmoron\u201d. \u201cThey were extremely aggressive, they were like, \u2018Oh I hope your family dies\u2019; \u2018I hope you get sick and you die from it,\u2019\u201d May says of the initial messages she received. \u201cI did feel like a lot of people were wasting their breath, because if you\u2019re doing angry tweeting and cursing and threats, I\u2019m not gonna read it.\u201d The venom generated hasn\u2019t prevented the state from adopting online shaming during the coronavirus crisis. While individuals use it to police behaviour, now the actual police are using it to denounce members of the public. On 27 March, Derbyshire police released drone footage which labelled anonymous dog walkers and exercisers on the Peaks as indulging in outlawed \u201cnot essential\u201d travel. The former justice secretary, David Gauke, described the shaming as \u201cbadly misjudged\u201d. And last Sunday (29 March) after tweeting a photo of his physically distanced birthday visit to his father Neil, Labour MP Stephen Kinnock was criticised by the South Wales police Twitter account \u2013 \u201cA lovely thing to do, however this is not essential travel.\u201d When Kinnock replied pointing out he had been delivering \u201cnecessary supplies\u201d, the force thanked him for the \u201cclarification\u201d. The Twittersphere was divided over whether this was a good use of police time. Dr June Tangney, a psychology professor at George Mason University, and author of Shame and Guilt, doubts shaming will prevent poor pandemic behaviour. \u201cBy shaming people, we\u2019re actually encouraging the opposite,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen people feel shamed, they tend to get very defensive, they tend to blame other people, they\u2019re disinclined to take responsibility, and they\u2019re not any more likely to change their behaviour.\u201d So why are we really shaming others during a pandemic? Dr Lydia Woodyatt is a social sciences professor at Flinders University whose research has shown that schadenfreude motivates online shaming. \u201cThe same things that drive hostility and collective action offline can drive shaming behaviour online: anger, identification with others in the cause, schadenfreude, belief that our actions together will make a difference,\u201d she explains. She points to recent research by PhD students at her university which found that when an online leader emphasises the nobility of the \u201cgoal\u201d of their shaming, people are more likely to shame. You\u2019d struggle to find a more noble goal than saving lives, so it makes sense that there\u2019s been an increase in shaming in recent weeks. Yet Woodyatt also points to a simpler explanation \u2013 with social isolation increasingly common, more and more people are online for longer stretches of time, and this is an issue that encompasses the entire world. \u201cThe sense of loss of control can mean that people try and take control of what they feel they can control,\u201d she adds. Schadenfreude and a bit of boredom might explain the reaction to a tweet posted by nightclub owner Fraser Carruthers on 16 March. Responding to Boris Johnson\u2019s recommendation that the public stop visiting pubs, Carruthers tweeted: \u201cI am a nightclub owner in Kensington and Chelsea. You can\u2019t tell the nation to avoid \u2018pubs and clubs\u2019 and not officially \u2018close us\u2019 so that we can claim our insurance.\u201d When online sleuths discovered that he had previously tweeted \u201cAnyone but Corbyn\u201d, they mocked the 37-year-old as deserving of his fate. \u201cIt was a mind-blowing response,\u201d says Carruthers, who says he had \u201chundreds and hundreds\u201d of messages for \u201cthree days non-stop\u201d. He was particularly alarmed by commenters who wished he and his family would end up on the street. \u201cIt really makes you think there are some horrible people in this world.\u201d Carruthers believes the response was so strong because of the \u201cstigma\u201d of Kensington and Chelsea, but notes he didn\u2019t actually vote Conservative in the 2019 election \u2013 he voted for the Animal Welfare party. Of course, in the middle of a global pandemic, nightclub owners aren\u2019t the people we should feel sorriest for. Yet the vitriol Carruthers received demonstrates that online shaming isn\u2019t always altruistic. Dr Aaron Balick, a psychotherapist from London and author of The Psychodynamics of Social Networking, argues that online shamers are \u201chardly doing it for the safety of society. They\u2019re doing it because they get to be right and someone else gets to be wrong.\u201d Balick says pandemic shaming may be caused by fear, as \u201cpeople tend to regress when they\u2019re frightened\u201d. Yet like Tangney, he believes shaming is counterproductive and potentially dangerous. \u201cShame is one of our most primitive feelings. It does hurt, very, very deeply, and if it happens on a grand scale, like on Twitter, it can be psychologically traumatic,\u201d he says. Arguably, the repercussions of online shaming aren\u2019t as severe as they were five years ago, when journalist Jon Ronson wrote his book So You\u2019ve Been Publicly Shamed, chronicling the trauma, job losses, and damaged lives of the internet-shamed. Nowadays, trending topics move so quickly that it is difficult for one individual to capture the entire internet\u2019s attention for long. Even actor Vanessa Hudgens, who employed her best vocal fry to say, \u201cLike yeah, people are going to die, which is terrible \u2026 but inevitable?\u201d on Instagram on 16 March, got away relatively unscathed. Though Hudgens was flooded with hate and forced to issue an apology, model Chrissy Teigen came to her defence and gained 75,000 likes for tweeting that when people make misjudged comments, \u201cu don\u2019t have [to] ruin their lives\u201d. And indeed, if we now know the consequences of online shaming, we should also know the consequences of what we post online. May, the tweeter who encouraged people to book cheap flights, says she doesn\u2019t think the backlash was unfair because she was aware that \u201cthis is the internet\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s open for everyone to leave their opinion\u201d. It is also possible that while shaming doesn\u2019t change the behaviour of the shamed, it can adjust cultural norms. An anonymous 27-year-old says that seeing others hectored online changed his own habits. \u201cIn general it just made me take it way more seriously,\u201d he says, explaining that he had initially still planned to go on holiday and had a \u201ccavalier\u201d attitude to the dangers. \u201cOnline hectoring [of others] did force me to see that behaviour as selfish and individualistic \u2026 perhaps more than straight up relaying that information in a calm and dispassionate way would have done.\u201d Yet overall, the experts do not believe in the power of public shame. \u201cBy increasing hostility in an otherwise volatile environment we are just promoting the norm of hostility and aggression as a means of coping,\u201d Woodyatt says. \u201cI think we should all agree that is not a good idea. Humans can communicate social norms in calm and non-aggressive ways. We are all in this together.\u201d Jon Ronson, too, is not a fan of pandemic shaming (though he notes that we can and should criticise public figures who are putting people in danger). \u201cAs we\u2019re forced to isolate,\u201d he says, \u201cwe need to be able to connect with other people. It can make the difference between being happy and stoical and being depressed. The very best thing Twitter could be right now is a nice place for people to visit and find connection.\u201d In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 and the domestic violence helpline is 0808 2000 247. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14 and the national family violence counselling service is 1800 737 732. In the US, the suicide prevention lifeline is 1-800-273-8255 and the domestic violence hotline is 1-800-799-SAFE (7233). Other international helplines can be found at www.befrienders.org",

Braithwaite Hall said tenants required written consent to do so, and that it had taken legal action against one. Dark Peak said it retained complete control of burning practices on its land. Marsden said tenants could not carry out any burning.</p> <p>A National Trust spokeswoman said: \u201cWe don\u2019t allow burning on deep peat and over recent years have moved away from using controlled grouse-moor burning as a matter of course. There are a diminishing number of historic agreements where burning may occasionally be used but we are working with these tenants to introduce more sustainable land-management practice.\u201d</p> <p>Routine burning is now no longer allowed on 34 sections of moorland spanning Yorkshire, Lancashire and Derbyshire, according to BBYM. \u201cYorkshire Water, United Utilities and the National Trust are to be commended for ending routine burning of moorland,\u201d said Luke Steele of BBYM.</p> <p>Steele said there had been 550 incidents of grouse-moor burning recorded across Yorkshire since the burning season began in October. </p> <p>The environment minister, Zac Goldsmith, has promised to stop the practice.

Yorkshire Water and United Utilities have said that all burning on their land must now cease until further notice.

And three estates overseen by the National Trust \u2013 Marsden, Braithwaite Hall and Dark Peak \u2013 also told the group that tenants were no longer allowed to conduct routine burning. Braithwaite Hall said tenants required written consent to do so, and that it had taken legal action against one. Dark Peak said it retained complete control of burning practices on its land. Marsden said tenants could not carry out any burning. A National Trust spokeswoman said: \u201cWe don\u2019t allow burning on deep peat and over recent years have moved away from using controlled grouse-moor burning as a matter of course. There are a diminishing number of historic agreements where burning may occasionally be used but we are working with these tenants to introduce more sustainable land-management practice.\u201d Routine burning is now no longer allowed on 34 sections of moorland spanning Yorkshire, Lancashire and Derbyshire, according to BBYM. \u201cYorkshire Water, United Utilities and the National Trust are to be commended for ending routine burning of moorland,\u201d said Luke Steele of BBYM. Steele said there had been 550 incidents of grouse-moor burning recorded across Yorkshire since the burning season began in October. The environment minister, Zac Goldsmith, has promised to stop the practice. And the committee on climate change has recommended that a grouse-moor burning ban be introduced within the year. But owners of large grouse moors have threatened legal action if such a ban is introduced. The issue has been thrown into sharp relief by the coronavirus outbreak. Yorkshire Water and United Utilities have said that all burning on their land must now cease until further notice. The National Trust said: \u201cWe are keen to alleviate pressure on the emergency services, and are working with estate managers and tenants to ensure any burning is stopped immediately.\u201d The move follows requests from emergency services and local councils, which fear that burning increases the risk of wildfires, and that fumes might affect people suffering from Covid-19.",

But we don\u2019t, so we need the government to look at the package travel arrangements and allow credit notes to be given to customers.\u201d</p> <p>Sunak agreed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/02/bus-firms-get-400m-bailout-to-maintain-services\">cover the losses of bus companies in England</a> over the next three months to ensure that services can still run.</p> <p>Bus industry executives lobbied the government after ministers advised people against all non-essential travel, and passenger numbers \u201cfell off a cliff\u201d. A \u00a3167m fund will ensure that bus companies can cover their costs on essential services so that key employees, such as NHS staff, can get to work. The funding, which adds to an existing \u00a3200m bus subsidy scheme, follows similar agreements in Scotland and Wales.</p> <p>Stagecoach, a key player in the industry, said on Friday that its local regional bus companies were currently seeing sales at about 15% of normal levels. The company, which will suspend it Megabus coaches between major towns and cities this weekend, said the new funding would mean \u201ckey workers can still get to and from work, and that communities can still access other services\u201d, such as shopping for food or picking up medicines.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d60aa53a76e87a498204434f24d548a8565f902c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d60aa53a76e87a498204434f24d548a8565f902c/0_274_4287_2572/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Stagecoach has seen its coach ticket sales fall dramatically.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stagecoach has seen its coach ticket sales fall dramatically.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Elsmere, who chairs the coach industry insurance scheme, said private coaches also provided vital services that would be missed if firms were allowed to go bust. Stately homes, hotels, schools and charitable events depend on groups travelling by coach. \u201cPeople think it is just for pleasure, but it underpins so many businesses.\u201d</p> <p>Sunak and the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, have argued the bus bailout was needed because firms such as Stagecoach provide vital infrastructure. A similar scheme to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/02/bus-firms-get-400m-bailout-to-maintain-services\">subsidise rail companies</a> \u2013 effectively ending the franchise system as we know it \u2013 was justified on that basis.</p> <p>This argument is not limited to bus, coach and rail companies. P&amp;O Ferries has argued that it can be described as vital infrastructure. Last week it asked the government for a \u00a3150m bailout after passenger numbers dried up. The company, which is owned by the Dubai firm DP World, operates more than 30,000 voyages a year in Europe and accounts for about 15% of Britain\u2019s trade. It said income from its 8.4 million passengers a year normally subsidises its income from freight lorries, but the lockdown has plunged it into a \u00a3250,000 daily loss.</p> <p>Virgin Atlantic is also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/01/virgin-atlantic-bailout-backed-by-rolls-royce-airbus-and-heathrow\">seeking a bailout</a>, backed by lobbying from the aviation manufacturers Rolls-Royce and Airbus, who argue that Virgin is a major aircraft buyer and vital for the success of a key industry. Heathrow Airport, leader of another suffering sector, is also backing a Virgin bailout because the Branson-controlled airline is one of its main customers.</p> <p>Retail and steel, two sectors that were hurting even before the pandemic struck, are also desperate for help. The industry lobby group UK Steel told the Treasury the nation\u2019s steel companies were \u201cfast approaching a cashflow crisis\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d0844808d543793aa8eb24df6f6dd1c3e56b5b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d0844808d543793aa8eb24df6f6dd1c3e56b5b3/0_144_3196_1917/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Rishi Sunak\u2019s loan scheme was heavily criticised, and has now been modified.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rishi Sunak\u2019s loan scheme was heavily criticised, and has now been modified.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WPA Pool/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sir Phillip Green\u2019s Arcadia group is putting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/02/philip-green-asks-for-taxpayer-support-to-prop-up-arcadia\">14,500 staff on the government furlough scheme</a> in a bid to prop up his crumbling retail empire. Meanwhile, the Horticultural Trades Association warned the government that the sector, which includes hundreds of garden centres, was facing losses of \u00a3687m by the end of June.</p> <p>Energy companies, under pressure from cash-strapped households cancelling their monthly direct debt payments, have already asked the government to support a loan scheme worth up to \u00a3100m a month. Without the funds, the industry has warned it will struggle to offer payment holidays to businesses and households struggling to pay their energy bills.</p> <p>A spokesman for Energy UK, the industry lobby group, said; \u201cPeople are cancelling direct debits in increasing numbers. That\u2019s a problem for suppliers working on thin margins. It means there isn\u2019t the cushion needed to withstand an indefinite break by businesses and households in paying their bills.\u201d</p> <p>The chancellor is expected to hold the line this week and resist what he sees as special pleading from multiple sectors \u2013 even if some exceptional cases such as rail and buses are getting through. He will say his revamped loan scheme will allow all employers to access the funds they need to cope over the next few months.</p> <p>Success will probably rest on how well the banks and other commercial lenders understand his new proposals and allow firms to access the new loans. Time is short for many companies and they will need funds fast.</p> <p>Last week Sunak admitted that of 130,000 inquiries to access loans, only 1,000 had been agreed. Businesses will cheer if the reformed bailouts expand the rate of loan agreements. If the new efforts don\u2019t work, those calls for sector-specific bailouts will get much louder.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Every sector of the British economy is suffering and asking the government to do more. Such is the scale of the economic hit that the country is facing from the coronavirus pandemic that even the widening of the government\u2019s bailout last week has failed to assuage business leaders\u2019 concerns. The travel industry is seeking a relaxation of consumer protection rules, charities say they face a \u00a34bn shortfall amid rocketing demand for their services, and Sir Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Atlantic says it needs a multi-million pound rescue package. Even in normal times such requests would pose a quandary for governments. But now they are flooding in at once. Against this backdrop, the chancellor was forced to update the government\u2019s rescue plan last week. Sunak said he would prevent banks from requesting personal guarantees for emergency loans to small businesses and would extend the reach of his \u00a3330bn coronavirus business interruption loan scheme \u2013 under which the government offers interest-free 12-month loans. Larger firms not currently eligible for loans \u2013 the so-called \u201csqueezed middle\u201d of this crisis who were too big for the small-firms schemes but not large enough for the major bailout loans \u2013 would benefit from a new scheme under which the government would provide a guarantee of 80% so that banks could make loans of up to \u00a325m to firms with an annual turnover of between \u00a345m and \u00a3500m. Business lobby groups backed the upgrades to the rescue plan, albeit with a warning that the small print should not prove a barrier to firms accessing vital funds. Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \u201cThe announcement of a new loan scheme for mid-sized companies closes a significant gap in existing support.\u201d However, for some sectors it is not just a question of accessible finance. Travel firms said the difference between staying afloat and going bust could be changes to regulations as much as access to credit. Marc Vincent, the finance director of Newmarket Holidays, said the UK needs to follow the example of other EU governments, which have overturned consumer protection rules requiring travel firms to pay customer refunds within 14 days. Vincent said a switch to credit notes, which can be used to buy a holiday at a later date or redeemed for cash after two years, would protect hundreds of travel firms that have usually paid in advance for airline tickets and hotels that are also in lockdown. Travel firms are among many industries that have temporarily ceased their main operations, but have incurred higher costs in other areas after keeping staff working to answer customer calls or provide other services. It means they can only use the government\u2019s furlough scheme \u2013 which pays 80% of staff salaries up to a cap of about \u00a325,000 to workers sent home \u2013 to subsidise the cost of some staff while others remain active on the company payroll. \u201cWhile a pub will close down and furlough everyone, we need extra people to handle cases, which in many cases are complicated and take longer to deal with,\u201d said Vincent. Kristy Elsmere, joint managing director of the coach company Woods Travel Group, said a legal change allowing the use of credit notes would be an important reform, even though most of the company\u2019s regular customers were accepting vouchers or re-booking trips later in the year. Referring to one industry-specific bailout announced last week, she said: \u201cSome coach companies also run buses and have benefited from the new \u00a3400m bus rescue scheme, so they will have some cash coming in from that. But we don\u2019t, so we need the government to look at the package travel arrangements and allow credit notes to be given to customers.\u201d Sunak agreed to cover the losses of bus companies in England over the next three months to ensure that services can still run. Bus industry executives lobbied the government after ministers advised people against all non-essential travel, and passenger numbers \u201cfell off a cliff\u201d. A \u00a3167m fund will ensure that bus companies can cover their costs on essential services so that key employees, such as NHS staff, can get to work. The funding, which adds to an existing \u00a3200m bus subsidy scheme, follows similar agreements in Scotland and Wales. Stagecoach, a key player in the industry, said on Friday that its local regional bus companies were currently seeing sales at about 15% of normal levels. The company, which will suspend it Megabus coaches between major towns and cities this weekend, said the new funding would mean \u201ckey workers can still get to and from work, and that communities can still access other services\u201d, such as shopping for food or picking up medicines. Elsmere, who chairs the coach industry insurance scheme, said private coaches also provided vital services that would be missed if firms were allowed to go bust. Stately homes, hotels, schools and charitable events depend on groups travelling by coach. \u201cPeople think it is just for pleasure, but it underpins so many businesses.\u201d Sunak and the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, have argued the bus bailout was needed because firms such as Stagecoach provide vital infrastructure. A similar scheme to subsidise rail companies \u2013 effectively ending the franchise system as we know it \u2013 was justified on that basis. This argument is not limited to bus, coach and rail companies. P&amp;O Ferries has argued that it can be described as vital infrastructure. Last week it asked the government for a \u00a3150m bailout after passenger numbers dried up. The company, which is owned by the Dubai firm DP World, operates more than 30,000 voyages a year in Europe and accounts for about 15% of Britain\u2019s trade. It said income from its 8.4 million passengers a year normally subsidises its income from freight lorries, but the lockdown has plunged it into a \u00a3250,000 daily loss. Virgin Atlantic is also seeking a bailout, backed by lobbying from the aviation manufacturers Rolls-Royce and Airbus, who argue that Virgin is a major aircraft buyer and vital for the success of a key industry. Heathrow Airport, leader of another suffering sector, is also backing a Virgin bailout because the Branson-controlled airline is one of its main customers. Retail and steel, two sectors that were hurting even before the pandemic struck, are also desperate for help. The industry lobby group UK Steel told the Treasury the nation\u2019s steel companies were \u201cfast approaching a cashflow crisis\u201d. Sir Phillip Green\u2019s Arcadia group is putting 14,500 staff on the government furlough scheme in a bid to prop up his crumbling retail empire. Meanwhile, the Horticultural Trades Association warned the government that the sector, which includes hundreds of garden centres, was facing losses of \u00a3687m by the end of June. Energy companies, under pressure from cash-strapped households cancelling their monthly direct debt payments, have already asked the government to support a loan scheme worth up to \u00a3100m a month. Without the funds, the industry has warned it will struggle to offer payment holidays to businesses and households struggling to pay their energy bills. A spokesman for Energy UK, the industry lobby group, said; \u201cPeople are cancelling direct debits in increasing numbers. That\u2019s a problem for suppliers working on thin margins. It means there isn\u2019t the cushion needed to withstand an indefinite break by businesses and households in paying their bills.\u201d The chancellor is expected to hold the line this week and resist what he sees as special pleading from multiple sectors \u2013 even if some exceptional cases such as rail and buses are getting through. He will say his revamped loan scheme will allow all employers to access the funds they need to cope over the next few months. Success will probably rest on how well the banks and other commercial lenders understand his new proposals and allow firms to access the new loans. Time is short for many companies and they will need funds fast. Last week Sunak admitted that of 130,000 inquiries to access loans, only 1,000 had been agreed. Businesses will cheer if the reformed bailouts expand the rate of loan agreements. If the new efforts don\u2019t work, those calls for sector-specific bailouts will get much louder.",

Little wonder that a documentary about a gay, gun-toting, polyamorous, imprisoned tiger breeder with a sideline in country music and running for political office has captured our attention. An audience on lockdown, with no access to their usual entertainment, without sport, without live music, festivals cancelled, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/20/tiger-king-joe-exotic-netflix-series\">Wimbledon</a> cancelled, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/01/edinburghs-five-festivals-cancelled-due-to-coronavirus\">Edinburgh fringe</a> cancelled, at a time when watching the evening news requires a run-up of Greg Rutherford proportions, has gobbled it up. I can\u2019t think why.</p> <p>The rivalry between Joe Exotic, the private zookeeper of the title, and Carole Baskin, who runs a big cat rescue sanctuary, is so extravagant and multifaceted that even though the directors have called it \u201cShakespearean\u201d, you get the impression Shakespeare would have thought, nah, I\u2019ll leave it thanks. Every episode piles on the intrigue with such disregard for any sense of proportion that it is hard to watch without one\u2019s jaw lolling open.</p> <p>Whether it is a true and honest representation of the story is about as clear as your conscience if you\u2019ve ever paid to pose with a tiger cub. Baskin has called the series \u201csalacious and sensational\u201d, which, given that it airs a theory that she fed her ex-husband to her rescue tigers, seems like a reasonable complaint. Rebecca Chaiklin, who co-directed the series, <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2020-03-26/joe-exotic-tiger-king-netflix-burning-questions\">has responded</a>, saying they were \u201ccompletely forthright with the characters. With any project that goes on for five years, things evolve and change and we followed it as any good storyteller does.\u201d This post-release saga was surely inevitable, given how litigious the participants in the series are <em>in the series</em> and could prove to be almost as gripping as the show.</p> <p>It has been bleak to realise that some viewers are treating Exotic as a hero; I dread to think how he would perform if he were allowed to run for office again. But the utter madness of <em>Tiger King</em> has been a distraction for when distraction has been needed and everyone has to to switch off, if just for a moment.</p> <h2>Greta Gerwig, keeping actors hydrated at all times</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"89599a7a457840a9dbdc34e1031438f1a5d6d42b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89599a7a457840a9dbdc34e1031438f1a5d6d42b/992_302_1936_1161/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Greta Gerwig, writer and director of Little Women.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greta Gerwig, writer and director of Little Women.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marion Curtis/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Remember when a news day could be dominated by the story of a disposable coffee container appearing in the background of a blockbuster fantasy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/10/game-of-thrones-star-denies-responsibility-for-coffee-cup-blunder\">TV show</a> set in medieval-ish times, when mead was supposed to be glugged from pewter cups, rather than macchiatos sipped out of paper ones?</p> <p><em>Game of Thrones</em> should be grateful to Greta Gerwig for proving that making a gaffe like that is easier than you would think.

Certainly a boo-boo, as Louisa May Alcott\u2019s story is set in the early 1860s, but the big question is, why are they both there, to do one water bottle\u2019s job?</p> <h2>James McAvoy: X-Man leads the philanthropic big guns</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e58415b9605a684cd06f192c1cef3ff8b760573\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e58415b9605a684cd06f192c1cef3ff8b760573/867_309_2194_1317/1000..jpg\" alt=\"James McAvoy in X-Men: First Class (2011)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">NHS superhero: James McAvoy in X-Men: First Class (2011).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: 20th Century Fox/Everett/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br>Don\u2019t panic, but the very future of celebrity is in peril right now.

      "bodyText": "If you have been slapping down terrifying news stories like you\u2019re playing a frantic game of Whack-a-Mole, then you might have found solace in the engrossing Netflix documentary Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness. The series has been such a success that it inspired my mother to send me a meme for the first time, one featuring its star, Joe Exotic. Little wonder that a documentary about a gay, gun-toting, polyamorous, imprisoned tiger breeder with a sideline in country music and running for political office has captured our attention. An audience on lockdown, with no access to their usual entertainment, without sport, without live music, festivals cancelled, Wimbledon cancelled, the Edinburgh fringe cancelled, at a time when watching the evening news requires a run-up of Greg Rutherford proportions, has gobbled it up. I can\u2019t think why. The rivalry between Joe Exotic, the private zookeeper of the title, and Carole Baskin, who runs a big cat rescue sanctuary, is so extravagant and multifaceted that even though the directors have called it \u201cShakespearean\u201d, you get the impression Shakespeare would have thought, nah, I\u2019ll leave it thanks. Every episode piles on the intrigue with such disregard for any sense of proportion that it is hard to watch without one\u2019s jaw lolling open. Whether it is a true and honest representation of the story is about as clear as your conscience if you\u2019ve ever paid to pose with a tiger cub. Baskin has called the series \u201csalacious and sensational\u201d, which, given that it airs a theory that she fed her ex-husband to her rescue tigers, seems like a reasonable complaint. Rebecca Chaiklin, who co-directed the series, has responded, saying they were \u201ccompletely forthright with the characters. With any project that goes on for five years, things evolve and change and we followed it as any good storyteller does.\u201d This post-release saga was surely inevitable, given how litigious the participants in the series are in the series and could prove to be almost as gripping as the show. It has been bleak to realise that some viewers are treating Exotic as a hero; I dread to think how he would perform if he were allowed to run for office again. But the utter madness of Tiger King has been a distraction for when distraction has been needed and everyone has to to switch off, if just for a moment. Greta Gerwig, keeping actors hydrated at all times Remember when a news day could be dominated by the story of a disposable coffee container appearing in the background of a blockbuster fantasy TV show set in medieval-ish times, when mead was supposed to be glugged from pewter cups, rather than macchiatos sipped out of paper ones? Game of Thrones should be grateful to Greta Gerwig for proving that making a gaffe like that is easier than you would think. Gerwig\u2019s outstanding adaptation of Little Women, so good it made me cry twice, once because it was sad, once because I was so happy that it was so good, has been rumbled for leaving a plastic bottle and a flask in the background of a scene. Madelyn Rancourt, a superfan who said she saw the film seven times, posted a video to TikTok in which she pointed out that in one scene, behind Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet lurks a plastic water bottle and a reusable water bottle. Certainly a boo-boo, as Louisa May Alcott\u2019s story is set in the early 1860s, but the big question is, why are they both there, to do one water bottle\u2019s job? James McAvoy: X-Man leads the philanthropic big guns Don\u2019t panic, but the very future of celebrity is in peril right now. The rules are shifting beneath the Louboutin-clad feet of the rich and famous. You cannot so much as post about jumping the queue by paying for a private coronavirus test without people shouting about your privilege, the hashtag #imprisonaceleb has been trending and don\u2019t get me started on what happens when, like David Geffen, you point out that you are isolating on a superyacht. While everyone has learned the hard way that a sincere singalong is not quite what is needed right now, some people in the spotlight have brought out the philanthropic big guns. James McAvoy not only donated \u00a3275,000 to a fundraiser for protective equipment for NHS staff \u2013 and the fact that fundraisers are necessary is obscene and will haunt this government \u2013 but has also applied to be an NHS volunteer. By all accounts, the body coach Joe Wicks\u2019s daily PE lessons on YouTube are saving the sanity of many parents and he is donating all advertising revenue from them straight to the NHS. In the US, Dolly Parton has donated $1m to Vanderbilt University, to help fund research into treatment for the coronavirus, and has encouraged other people \u201cwho can afford it\u201d to do the same. Britney Spears has offered to buy food and nappies for people in need, if they DM her on Instagram. Just when you think it\u2019s all over for famous people, decent celebrities make a last stand. \u2022 Rebecca Nicholson is an Observer columnist",

      "body": "<p>If a week is a long time in politics, then it\u2019s an eternity in a pandemic. A month ago nobody \u2013 save perhaps employees of globally dispersed corporations \u2013 had heard of Zoom, the video-conferencing system. Now it has apparently become a critical part of our national infrastructure as many in the population try to work from home. Zoom is currently the most popular Apple download and second most popular Android download in the world. Just as \u201cto Google\u201d has become a synonym for \u201csearch online\u201d, now \u201cZoom\u201d has become a verb.</p> <p>This is, of course, great for Zoom Video Communications Inc. Its share price has more than doubled in the same few weeks that most stocks have plummeted. However, becoming top dog in a networked marketplace has its downsides. One of them is that journalists start digging into your past. Another is that you acquire new responsibilities.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Zoom clearly had no idea what data Facebook was collecting</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>History first. Zoom followed rule No 1 in the playbook for internet companies: get big fast. The way to do that is to offer your service free \u2013 with the option of charging for superior services. At the moment Zoom offers free video conferencing for up to 100 participants, with a 40-minute time limit. If you want longer meetings, you have to pay for it. As with all such \u2018free\u2019 internet services, Zoom has had its <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90483041/forget-facebook-zoom-is-the-tech-industrys-newest-problem-child\">share of anti-social uses</a> \u2013 child abuse, porn and privacy violations, for example. To these has now been added a new problem of \u2018Zoombombing\u2019, where occasionally families and groups have had their discussions interrupted by trolls broadcasting pornography, Nazi propaganda and other crap.</p> <p>I write as a satisfied Zoom user \u2013 correction: customer, because I pay for the service. I prefer it to alternatives such as Skype, FaceTime and Microsoft Teams for larger conferences, partly because of the way it \u201cforegrounds\u201d the person who happens to be speaking at any moment. And it\u2019s clear that the service is a boon for people in the isolation zones of most countries at the moment, so it\u2019s adding tangible social value to our lives.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/apr/01/from-houseparty-to-zoom-our-digital-lives-in-lockdown\">From Houseparty to Zoom: our digital lives in lockdown - podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But some things about it need to be fixed, or at least clarified. The first of these involve Zoom\u2019s relationship with Facebook. An investigation by <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/k7e599/zoom-ios-app-sends-data-to-facebook-even-if-you-dont-have-a-facebook-account\">Motherboard</a> revealed that the Zoom iOS app was sending data to Facebook even if the user didn\u2019t have a Facebook account. This stemmed from a decision by Zoom to use Facebook\u2019s Software Development Kit (SDK) to provide a \u201cLogin with Facebook\u201d facility \u2013 ostensibly to make it easier for new users to sign up. This was all part of the Get Big Fast rule, no doubt, but the way Zoom handled the disclosure was not exactly reassuring. It did quickly update the app and stopped the data transfer. But then it blew the gaff on <a href=\"https://blog.zoom.us/wordpress/2020/03/27/zoom-use-of-facebook-sdk-in-ios-client/\">its corporate blog</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe were made aware on Wednesday, March 25, 2020,\u201d it wrote, \u201cthat the Facebook SDK was collecting device information unnecessary for us to provide our services.\u201d Ponder that for a moment. The level of carelessness implied by \u201cwe were made aware\u201d is staggering. As the veteran analyst <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/\">Ben Thompson</a> observed in his newsletter, Zoom clearly had no idea what data Facebook was collecting. The only inference one can draw is that nobody in the company had actually <em>read</em> Facebook\u2019s terms and conditions for the SDK \u2013 which say: \u201cWe can analyse your app, website, content, and data for any purpose, including commercial.\u201d Then there\u2019s the issue of security, and of encryption in particular.</p> <p>\u201cWe take security seriously and we are proud to exceed industry standards when it comes to your organisation\u2019s communications,\u201d <a href=\"https://zoom.us/security\">says the </a><a href=\"https://zoom.us/security\">Zoom website</a>. Any host of a meeting can \u201csecure a meeting with end-to-end encryption\u201d. Well, that\u2019s not quite right, at least if by \u201cend to end\u201d you mean encryption where the service provider has no way of decrypting the content (as, say, with WhatsApp or Signal). The encryption on Zoom communications at the moment <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/03/31/zoom-meeting-encryption/\">is the kind</a> that protects your communications with any website with \u2018https\u2019 in its URL. But the content is unencrypted while it is passing through Zoom\u2019s cloud servers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/02/zoom-technology-security-coronavirus-video-conferencing\">\u2018Zoom is malware\u2019: why experts worry about the video conferencing platform</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There may be good reasons for this, but at the very least the company\u2019s website shouldn\u2019t be making exaggerated claims about encryption. It should privilege facts over marketing puffery.</p> <p>And the moral of all this? Zoom is providing a service of real value in these desperate times, but it needs to grow up.

      "bodyText": "If a week is a long time in politics, then it\u2019s an eternity in a pandemic. A month ago nobody \u2013 save perhaps employees of globally dispersed corporations \u2013 had heard of Zoom, the video-conferencing system. Now it has apparently become a critical part of our national infrastructure as many in the population try to work from home. Zoom is currently the most popular Apple download and second most popular Android download in the world. Just as \u201cto Google\u201d has become a synonym for \u201csearch online\u201d, now \u201cZoom\u201d has become a verb. This is, of course, great for Zoom Video Communications Inc. Its share price has more than doubled in the same few weeks that most stocks have plummeted. However, becoming top dog in a networked marketplace has its downsides. One of them is that journalists start digging into your past. Another is that you acquire new responsibilities. History first. Zoom followed rule No 1 in the playbook for internet companies: get big fast. The way to do that is to offer your service free \u2013 with the option of charging for superior services. At the moment Zoom offers free video conferencing for up to 100 participants, with a 40-minute time limit. If you want longer meetings, you have to pay for it. As with all such \u2018free\u2019 internet services, Zoom has had its share of anti-social uses \u2013 child abuse, porn and privacy violations, for example. To these has now been added a new problem of \u2018Zoombombing\u2019, where occasionally families and groups have had their discussions interrupted by trolls broadcasting pornography, Nazi propaganda and other crap. I write as a satisfied Zoom user \u2013 correction: customer, because I pay for the service. I prefer it to alternatives such as Skype, FaceTime and Microsoft Teams for larger conferences, partly because of the way it \u201cforegrounds\u201d the person who happens to be speaking at any moment. And it\u2019s clear that the service is a boon for people in the isolation zones of most countries at the moment, so it\u2019s adding tangible social value to our lives. But some things about it need to be fixed, or at least clarified. The first of these involve Zoom\u2019s relationship with Facebook. An investigation by Motherboard revealed that the Zoom iOS app was sending data to Facebook even if the user didn\u2019t have a Facebook account. This stemmed from a decision by Zoom to use Facebook\u2019s Software Development Kit (SDK) to provide a \u201cLogin with Facebook\u201d facility \u2013 ostensibly to make it easier for new users to sign up. This was all part of the Get Big Fast rule, no doubt, but the way Zoom handled the disclosure was not exactly reassuring. It did quickly update the app and stopped the data transfer. But then it blew the gaff on its corporate blog. \u201cWe were made aware on Wednesday, March 25, 2020,\u201d it wrote, \u201cthat the Facebook SDK was collecting device information unnecessary for us to provide our services.\u201d Ponder that for a moment. The level of carelessness implied by \u201cwe were made aware\u201d is staggering. As the veteran analyst Ben Thompson observed in his newsletter, Zoom clearly had no idea what data Facebook was collecting. The only inference one can draw is that nobody in the company had actually read Facebook\u2019s terms and conditions for the SDK \u2013 which say: \u201cWe can analyse your app, website, content, and data for any purpose, including commercial.\u201d Then there\u2019s the issue of security, and of encryption in particular. \u201cWe take security seriously and we are proud to exceed industry standards when it comes to your organisation\u2019s communications,\u201d says the Zoom website. Any host of a meeting can \u201csecure a meeting with end-to-end encryption\u201d. Well, that\u2019s not quite right, at least if by \u201cend to end\u201d you mean encryption where the service provider has no way of decrypting the content (as, say, with WhatsApp or Signal). The encryption on Zoom communications at the moment is the kind that protects your communications with any website with \u2018https\u2019 in its URL. But the content is unencrypted while it is passing through Zoom\u2019s cloud servers. There may be good reasons for this, but at the very least the company\u2019s website shouldn\u2019t be making exaggerated claims about encryption. It should privilege facts over marketing puffery. And the moral of all this? Zoom is providing a service of real value in these desperate times, but it needs to grow up. It\u2019s playing in the big league now. What I\u2019m reading Capital work \u201dThomas Piketty takes on the ideology of inequality\u201d. An illuminating review by Marshall Steinbaum in the Boston Review of Thomas Piketty\u2019s massive and important new book. Going bacterial? Why the phrase \u201cgoing viral\u201d doesn\u2019t sound so good any more. Lovely essay by Lee Siegel in the New York Times. Start to finish \u201cHow will the Coronavirus end?\u201d Ed Yong\u2019s long essay in the Atlantic. Best thing I\u2019ve read on the pandemic so far.",

But to be clear, that just means the virus was detectable \u2013 not that it was viable or that contact with those services would have been able to infect someone. <em>(Editor\u2019s note: RNA, or ribonucleic acid, carries the virus\u2019s genetic information.)</em></p> \n<p><strong>Dr Akiko Iwasaki: </strong>It just means that there are parts of the virus that still remain. The virus needs many other components to be intact. If you have bits and pieces of RNA, that\u2019s not going to make a virus, you need an entire intact genome. Just because you had a little piece of RNA doesn\u2019t mean that there\u2019s an infection.</p> \n<h2><strong>How long can the virus survive on surfaces?</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Marcus: </strong>The New England Journal of Medicine just <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2004973?query=featured_home\">published a study</a> that tested how long the virus can remain stable on different kinds of surfaces within a controlled laboratory setting. They found that it was still detectable on copper for up to four hours, on cardboard for up to 24 hours, and on plastic and steel for up to 72 hours.</p> \n<p>But it\u2019s important to note that the amount of virus decreased rapidly over time on each of those surfaces. And so the risk of infection from touching them would probably decrease over time as well.</p> \n<h2><strong>Could you become infected from just a single particle of coronavirus?</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Iwasaki: </strong>There\u2019s a certain amount of viral particle that you need to be exposed to become infected. If you just had one viral particle on your finger, it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019re going to be infected. Some viruses are very potent, you only need like 10 particles to get infected, while others you [may] need millions. The fewer viral particles you\u2019re exposed to, the less likely you\u2019re going to get infected. That\u2019s why the amount of virus on a surface is important.</p> \n<h2><strong>How many people are being contaminated via surfaces as opposed to airborne particles or direct contact with an infected person?</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Marcus: </strong>As far as we know right now, people are much more likely to be infected by close contact with an infected person than by touching a contaminated surface. That said, it\u2019s still important to be conscious of what we\u2019re touching, especially high-touch surfaces, and be careful about cleaning our hands after touching things. For example, public transit or grocery stores and places where there tend to be a lot of people.</p> \n<p><strong>Iwasaki: </strong>The virus is pretty stable on [materials] like plastic and steel \u2013 they can persist for a few days. So it\u2019s very possible that someone who\u2019s sick will deposit the virus on to the surface and then somebody else will touch it and touch their face.</p> \n<h2><strong>Is there a risk of being infected by groceries and packages that we have delivered?</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Marcus: </strong>It\u2019s a low risk, but it\u2019s possible that if someone is delivering a package to your house and they are sick, that may be a route for transmission. I would recommend that any time something new comes into your household, be conscious of washing your hands after handling it.</p> \n<p><strong>Iwasaki: </strong>The [virus\u2019s] stability is pretty good on the cardboard. Once you get those packages, open them, quickly throw away the cardboard, wash your hands, and try to avoid touching your face. Take any measures that you can to minimize contact from the surface of the package to your face.</p> \n<h2><strong>Is it possible the contents of a package could have been contaminated by whoever packed it?</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Iwasaki: </strong>There\u2019s definitely a possibility of contamination, but it\u2019s much more likely that the outer cardboard itself will come into contact with a lot more people than what\u2019s inside. And if it takes days to get to your home, whatever virus that was inside will be deactivated already.</p> \n<h2><strong>Do you have any tips for cleaning surfaces?</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Marcus: </strong>It\u2019s good to routinely clean any high-touch surfaces, like door handles and toilets.

Small changes to routines and schedules: radio shows starting later, lasting longer, presenters moved out, brought in\u2026 The BBC, generally, is trying to keep its radio DJs broadcasting from their proper BBC studios, though Ken Bruce, as an older national treasure, has been allowed to host his show from home<strong>,</strong> as has Dotty on 1Xtra. There\u2019s an acknowledgement that consistency is needed, but also fewer specialist shows, more familiar warmth.</p> <p>And so, from tomorrow, 6 Music\u2019s weekday schedule will change, and Radio 2\u2019s evening one, too. On 2, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/sara-cox\">Sara Cox\u2019s</a> show will extend for another hour, until 8pm, and then Jo Whiley and Trevor Nelson will share the evening 8-10pm slot, each doing a week on, week off. On 6, <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lauren-laverne\">Lauren Laverne</a></strong> has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000gvtf\">a longer show,</a> starting at the later time of 8.30am; Mary Anne Hobbs and Shaun Keaveny will share afternoons, alternating weeks. And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/craig-charles\">Craig Charles</a> will take over <em>Drivetime</em> from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/apr/13/prisoner-soul-loneliness-lamacq-review\">Steve Lamacq</a>, who\u2019s been told by doctors to stay at home for health reasons. You wonder why Lamacq can\u2019t do a Ken Bruce, but perhaps the bosses are worried about too many home DJ set-ups and everything going haywire.</p> <p>Anyway. Laverne, always good at reading a room, even a virtual one, has done well since the lockdown. Brave enough to acknowledge the emotional difficulties people are going through, last week she asked for stories from those forced to live alone during these strange days. Sweetly, she articulated how, actually, being separate at these times is an immensely communal act: \u201cEveryone\u2019s taken on these different struggles,\u201d she said, \u201cand we\u2019re all doing it because we\u2019re part of a community. We\u2019re isolating or we\u2019re in lockdown because we care about our NHS workers, because we care about vulnerable people in our community, and because we\u2019re trying to do the right thing for everyone.\u201d Awwwwww.</p> <p>Over on Radio 1, <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000gvvl\">Greg James</a></strong> was as upbeat and cool as ever. Less acknowledgement of solo sadness \u2013 most of his listeners are at home with their parents, after all \u2013 and, instead, more music and silliness. A quarantined couple declared that since they\u2019d moved in, they\u2019d fallen in love; Justin Timberlake chatted to an eight-year-old listener about <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/24/the-greatest-showman-review-hugh-jackman-pt-barnum\">The Greatest Showman</a></em>.</p> <p>After James, <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m000h51m\">Scott Mills</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m000h51m\"> and Chris Stark</a> continued the positive vibe. On Wednesday, it being Aprils Fools\u2019 Day, Stark pranked Mills by setting up an interview with 5 Live\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jul/03/bbc-radio-5-live-female-presenters\">Eleanor Oldroyd</a> in which she asked Mills about how the coronavirus had affected the music industry. This wasn\u2019t funny, mostly because the ever-diligent Mills had really done his homework. He carefully answered all Oldroyd\u2019s stupid questions with grace and full information.</p> <p>On Thursday, the BBC pushed its luck by getting listeners across Radios 1, 2, 6, 1Xtra and Asian Network to do a mass singalong at 9am (perhaps it\u2019s jealous of lovely PE coach <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2020/mar/24/why-35-million-people-want-joe-wicks-to-be-their-pe-teacher\">Joe Wick\u2019s 9am popularity</a>.) Each station had chosen a song from listeners\u2019 suggestions, and, just after 9, all five were played across the stations, in order. Greg James started, crashing across all four channels with a lovely speech about how \u201cradio is a great pal to us all\u201d and urging listeners to \u201chashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/uksingalong?src=hashtag_click\">UKSingalong</a>\u201d. Each DJ handed over to the next, in time-honoured Smashie and Nicey manner, and though the songs weren\u2019t quite all singalongs, they were solid bangers: Florence and the Machine\u2019s You Got the Love (emotional); Neil Diamond, Sweet Caroline (dum dum duuum); Prince, Raspberry Beret (yasss); Koffee\u2019s Toast (vibes); and Panjabi MC, Mundian to Bach Ke (full-on kitchen disco). The whole effect was\u2026 very sweet. Radio giving a virtual cuddle. As radio can.</p> <p>Meanwhile, on Radio 4 on Friday, a different approach to self-isolation. Producer-presenter<a href=\"https://cathyfitzgerald.co.uk/\"> Cathy FitzGerald</a> put out a request for people to record a message, telling her about how they were coping. The result, <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000h25n\">Life on Lockdown</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000h25n\">,</a> was, as FitzGerald\u2019s programmes usually are, full of quiet humour and humanity. We heard upsetting reports from Italy, where, every evening, a van drives around with a loudspeaker announcing how many have died. Mark Steel told us he was dancing naked to My Sharona.</p> <p>And a woman with lung cancer, awaiting a now-vital operation, told of how she was focusing on the present moment: \u201cFinding joy in the small things. And in each other. But for now I\u2019m reminded that it\u2019s finally the first day of spring. And I can hear the birds outside, they\u2019ve been singing for days.\u201d I contributed to this immensely moving show, one voice among many, my small piece of material sewn by Fitzgerald to that of others \u2013 solo efforts joined together to make up a comfort blanket for us all. <br></p> <h2>Three (non-American) true crime murder series</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p071fs1t\">Shreds</a></strong> <br>This BBC series came out a year ago and tells the incredible \u2013 and incredibly depressing \u2013 tale of police corruption in a murder case that took place in Cardiff\u2019s Tiger Bay in 1988. Twenty-year-old Lynette White was killed in an unlit flat above a betting shop; the story reveals how her death is linked to the gentrification of Cardiff.

      "bodyText": "Lauren Laverne (6 Music) | BBC Sounds Radio 1 Breakfast With Greg James (Radio 1) | BBC Sounds Scott Mills (Radio 1) | BBC Sounds Life on Lockdown (Radio 4) | BBC Sounds The same, but different. Small changes to routines and schedules: radio shows starting later, lasting longer, presenters moved out, brought in\u2026 The BBC, generally, is trying to keep its radio DJs broadcasting from their proper BBC studios, though Ken Bruce, as an older national treasure, has been allowed to host his show from home, as has Dotty on 1Xtra. There\u2019s an acknowledgement that consistency is needed, but also fewer specialist shows, more familiar warmth. And so, from tomorrow, 6 Music\u2019s weekday schedule will change, and Radio 2\u2019s evening one, too. On 2, Sara Cox\u2019s show will extend for another hour, until 8pm, and then Jo Whiley and Trevor Nelson will share the evening 8-10pm slot, each doing a week on, week off. On 6, Lauren Laverne has a longer show, starting at the later time of 8.30am; Mary Anne Hobbs and Shaun Keaveny will share afternoons, alternating weeks. And Craig Charles will take over Drivetime from Steve Lamacq, who\u2019s been told by doctors to stay at home for health reasons. You wonder why Lamacq can\u2019t do a Ken Bruce, but perhaps the bosses are worried about too many home DJ set-ups and everything going haywire. Anyway. Laverne, always good at reading a room, even a virtual one, has done well since the lockdown. Brave enough to acknowledge the emotional difficulties people are going through, last week she asked for stories from those forced to live alone during these strange days. Sweetly, she articulated how, actually, being separate at these times is an immensely communal act: \u201cEveryone\u2019s taken on these different struggles,\u201d she said, \u201cand we\u2019re all doing it because we\u2019re part of a community. We\u2019re isolating or we\u2019re in lockdown because we care about our NHS workers, because we care about vulnerable people in our community, and because we\u2019re trying to do the right thing for everyone.\u201d Awwwwww. Over on Radio 1, Greg James was as upbeat and cool as ever. Less acknowledgement of solo sadness \u2013 most of his listeners are at home with their parents, after all \u2013 and, instead, more music and silliness. A quarantined couple declared that since they\u2019d moved in, they\u2019d fallen in love; Justin Timberlake chatted to an eight-year-old listener about The Greatest Showman. After James, Scott Mills and Chris Stark continued the positive vibe. On Wednesday, it being Aprils Fools\u2019 Day, Stark pranked Mills by setting up an interview with 5 Live\u2019s Eleanor Oldroyd in which she asked Mills about how the coronavirus had affected the music industry. This wasn\u2019t funny, mostly because the ever-diligent Mills had really done his homework. He carefully answered all Oldroyd\u2019s stupid questions with grace and full information. On Thursday, the BBC pushed its luck by getting listeners across Radios 1, 2, 6, 1Xtra and Asian Network to do a mass singalong at 9am (perhaps it\u2019s jealous of lovely PE coach Joe Wick\u2019s 9am popularity.) Each station had chosen a song from listeners\u2019 suggestions, and, just after 9, all five were played across the stations, in order. Greg James started, crashing across all four channels with a lovely speech about how \u201cradio is a great pal to us all\u201d and urging listeners to \u201chashtag UKSingalong\u201d. Each DJ handed over to the next, in time-honoured Smashie and Nicey manner, and though the songs weren\u2019t quite all singalongs, they were solid bangers: Florence and the Machine\u2019s You Got the Love (emotional); Neil Diamond, Sweet Caroline (dum dum duuum); Prince, Raspberry Beret (yasss); Koffee\u2019s Toast (vibes); and Panjabi MC, Mundian to Bach Ke (full-on kitchen disco). The whole effect was\u2026 very sweet. Radio giving a virtual cuddle. As radio can. Meanwhile, on Radio 4 on Friday, a different approach to self-isolation. Producer-presenter Cathy FitzGerald put out a request for people to record a message, telling her about how they were coping. The result, Life on Lockdown, was, as FitzGerald\u2019s programmes usually are, full of quiet humour and humanity. We heard upsetting reports from Italy, where, every evening, a van drives around with a loudspeaker announcing how many have died. Mark Steel told us he was dancing naked to My Sharona. And a woman with lung cancer, awaiting a now-vital operation, told of how she was focusing on the present moment: \u201cFinding joy in the small things. And in each other. But for now I\u2019m reminded that it\u2019s finally the first day of spring. And I can hear the birds outside, they\u2019ve been singing for days.\u201d I contributed to this immensely moving show, one voice among many, my small piece of material sewn by Fitzgerald to that of others \u2013 solo efforts joined together to make up a comfort blanket for us all. Three (non-American) true crime murder series Shreds This BBC series came out a year ago and tells the incredible \u2013 and incredibly depressing \u2013 tale of police corruption in a murder case that took place in Cardiff\u2019s Tiger Bay in 1988. Twenty-year-old Lynette White was killed in an unlit flat above a betting shop; the story reveals how her death is linked to the gentrification of Cardiff. Five men were convicted of her murder, and this well-made, gripping series explains what happened and how White\u2019s murder still has repercussions today. Presenter-producer Ceri Dawn Jackson holds our hand throughout. Tortoise: My Mother\u2019s Murder The Tortoise podcast offers in-depth journalism \u2013 slow news \u2013 that requires proper investigation and reporting. (Interestingly, it discussed the coronavirus back in January.) A four-parter within its series of individual shows, My Mother\u2019s Murder is presented by Paul Galizia, whose mother, Daphne Caruana Galizia, was a journalist who exposed corruption in Malta, her home. Paul searches for the truth behind her assassination by car bomb in October 2017. The uncovering of what happened led to the resignation of Malta\u2019s prime minister, Joseph Muscat, at the end of last year. The Nobody Zone For 30 years, someone kept pushing innocent people in front of London tube trains. That someone was Kieran Kelly, now seen as Ireland\u2019s most prolific serial killer.

      "bodyText": "A five-year old child is among 708 people whose deaths with coronavirus were announced on Saturday in the UK, as Britain\u2019s death toll rose to 4,313, the biggest increase since the outbreak began. The latest figures show the recorded death toll from the virus in the UK has risen by 20%, and above 4,000 for the first time. The Department of Health (DoH) said the number of coronavirus-related hospital deaths stood at 4,313 as of 5pm on Friday, up from 3,605 the day before. The oldest patient was 104. Forty of those who died had no known underlying conditions and were aged between 48 and 93. The figures came shortly after a hospital in Hertfordshire told people not to attend its A&amp;E department, even in an emergency. Watford general hospital has closed its A&amp;E to new patients and visitors until further notice, due to problems with its oxygen equipment. People have been instructed to go to their next nearest hospital with an emergency department or to seek advice via 111 in a non-urgent situation. The hospital said the decision was taken as a \u201cresult of a technical issue with our hospital\u2019s oxygen equipment\u201d. It added that the problem did not \u201cpose any risk to our patients\u201d. \u201cA small number of patients are being transferred to other hospitals in the area, with each patient being fully assessed in line with existing safety guidelines before they are moved,\u201d a West Hertfordshire hospitals NHS trust spokesman said. The hospital is known to be under significant strain from the pandemic. The Watford Observer reported that several wards were dedicated to Covid-19 patients and, as of 5pm Thursday, a confirmed 29 patients at West Hertfordshire trust hospitals had died after testing positive. The DoH figures also showed that the number of new people tested daily in the UK has slipped back below 10,000. A total of 9,406 people were reported as being tested in the 24 hours to 9am on 4 April. For the previous two days, the equivalent figure was above 10,000. The total number of people in the UK tested since the outbreak began is now 183,190. The number of confirmed cases had reached 41,903 as of 9am on Saturday. In England, 637 more patients who tested positive for Covid-19 were reported to have died on Saturday, bringing the total number of confirmed deaths in hospital to 3,939. The death toll in Scotland increased by 46 to 218, while in Wales it was up by 13, to 154. There were 212 deaths in the Midlands, more than in London, where there were 127. The north-west had 97 deaths, the north-east and Yorkshire 73, the east of England 70, the South East 41 and the South West 17. Among the dead are five London bus workers who tested positive for Covid-19, the Unite union said. Unite\u2019s regional secretary, Peter Kavanagh, said: \u201cEach of these deaths is a terrible tragedy and the thoughts of everyone at Unite goes to the families of the bus workers who have died of coronavirus. Unite will assist the families of our members in every possible way during this terrible time.\u201d The union said it had been working continuously with Transport for London and the operators to ensure the safety of drivers and others in the industry whom it said were performing a heroic job in getting NHS and care workers to their places of work. Prof Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, who has been advising the government on its strategy to cope with the pandemic, warned that the infection rate would remain high for \u201cweeks and weeks\u201d if people flout social distancing rules this weekend. Ferguson said earlier that while the epidemic was expected to plateau in the next week to 10 days, people\u2019s behaviour was critical to determining what happens next. His warning followed similar pleas by Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock for people to continue with the social distancing measures and resist the temptation to enjoy the sunshine forecast for swaths of the UK on Saturday and Sunday. On Friday, England\u2019s chief nursing officer, Ruth May, urged people to think of two nurses who died after contracting coronavirus. Areema Nasreen and Aimee O\u2019Rourke died alongside two healthcare assistants, it was announced on Friday. May, speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference, said: \u201cThis weekend is going to be very warm and it will be very tempting to go out and enjoy those summer rays. But please, I ask you to remember Aimee and Areema. Please stay at home for them.\u201d She added: \u201cI worry that there\u2019s going to be more and I want to honour them today and recognise their service.\u201d",

The first report of a UK scam relating to coronavirus was received on 9 February, and a further 20 were received by the end of the month. Financial regulators recently warned savers about fraudsters seeking to exploit fears over the coronavirus outbreak. Last week the Pensions Regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Money and Pensions Service issued a joint statement urging people not to make rash pension decisions as criminals try to exploit public concerns over the current market turmoil to dupe victims out of their cash.",

An audit of 119 organisations by the domestic abuse charity <a href=\"https://safelives.org.uk/\">SafeLives</a> found, however, that even as pressure on frontline services increased, most were being forced to reduce vital services.</p> <p>The groups were surveyed during the last week of March, with 26 of them able to confirm increased caseloads owing to Covid-19.

      "bodyText": "More than 25 organisations helping domestic violence victims have reported an increase in their caseload since the start of the UK\u2019s coronavirus epidemic. One group, Chayn, said that analysis of online traffic showed that visitors to its website had more than trebled last month compared with the same period last year. An audit of 119 organisations by the domestic abuse charity SafeLives found, however, that even as pressure on frontline services increased, most were being forced to reduce vital services. The groups were surveyed during the last week of March, with 26 of them able to confirm increased caseloads owing to Covid-19. Three-quarters said they had had to reduce service delivery to victims. Most domestic abuse organisations provide face-to-face or phone support, but a quarter say they can not \u201ceffectively support\u201d adult abuse victims owing to technical issues, inability to meet victims, and staff sickness. A separate study highlights the plight of domestic-violence survivors.

More than half offered a score of five or less, with three saying they felt \u201cnot safe at all\u201d. One said: \u201cI\u2019m in a controlling, emotionally abusive relationship and fear it could escalate due to heightened stress surrounding the current virus situation.\u201d Another added that she was having to sit in her car to get away from the perpetrator.

      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://www.emilymandel.com/\">Emily St John Mandel</a> is a Canadian novelist now residing in New York. Her fourth novel, the<em> </em> dystopian fiction of <em>Station Eleven</em>, propelled her to fame in 2014. It was a bestseller in both the UK and the US, winning the Arthur C Clarke award for science fiction, and nominations for the National Book Award and the Pen/Faulkner award. Her new novel is <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-glass-hotel-9781509882809.html\">The Glass Hotel</a></em>.</p> <p><em><strong>The </strong></em><em><strong>Glass Hotel</strong></em><strong> centres on </strong><strong> </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>2008</strong><strong> financial crash. Why was that a period you wanted to explore?<br></strong>It\u2019s a period in recent history that I remember so vividly. It was such an unsettling, chaotic time. In particular, I was fascinated by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/bernard-madoff\">Bernie Madoff</a> story. <em>The Glass Hotel</em> is not about Bernie Madoff or his staff, his family or his investors. But it is the same crime in the novel. Madoff almost seemed like the embodiment of that era. There was such popular rage directed against him because we thought our economies were solid and it turned out to be something of a house of cards. And here was this fabulously wealthy conman who\u2019d been gambling with retirement savings.</p> <p><strong>It\u2019s not Madoff\u2019s story but your protagonist, </strong><strong>Jonathan Alkaitis</strong><strong>, is a very similar character. What is it about that personality type that interested you?<br></strong>The compartmentalisation. We all compartmentalise to some extent: you\u2019re a different person at work than you are at home, a different person with your family than with acquaintances. But to be able to split your life in that way: to devote your professional energies to running a massive fraud and at the same time be a husband and a friend and a father. There\u2019s something fascinating in that to me.</p> <p><strong>The life of Jonathan\u2019s fake trophy wife inside \u201cthe kingdom of money\u201d is vacuous and unfulfilling. Was that your starting point?</strong><br>It was partly a desire to write about money as its own country. I think if you live with an enormous amount of money, that puts you in a very different world, with its own customs and mores. You see it most vividly at the airport: there are first-class lounges, and a first-class section on the plane. But at different levels of money, they\u2019re no longer on the same plane. They\u2019re in their private jets.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I'd always wanted to write a ghost story. It's a genre that I love</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Ghostliness and hauntings permeate the novel</strong><strong>. Would you describe </strong><strong>it as a ghost story?</strong><br>Absolutely. It\u2019s funny \u2013 I set out to write a book that was quite narrowly focused on the collapse and aftermath of a massive Ponzi scheme but by the end I\u2019d written a ghost story wherein a Ponzi scheme was just one element. The truth is that I\u2019d always wanted to write a ghost story. It\u2019s a form that I love.</p> <p><strong>Reinvention and transformation are strong themes. It seems that for some characters it\u2019s a strength, but for others a way to avoid reality and their own demons</strong><strong>.<br></strong>Yes, I think that generally speaking a capacity for reinvention is wonderful. Often that can take the form of resilience when someone\u2019s life is not going particularly well. To have the courage to do something completely different: I think that\u2019s usually admirable. But sometimes that can just be an escape hatch.</p> <p><strong>Your previous novel, </strong><em><strong>Station Eleven</strong></em><strong>, featured a global pandemic \u2013 </strong><strong>Georgia Flu</strong><strong>. In light of the coronavirus, does the novel now seem worryingly prescient?<br></strong>It doesn\u2019t, but only because I read so much about pandemics when I was writing it. This is not to make light of pandemics at all \u2013 it\u2019s a terrible situation \u2013 but this is just something that happens from time to time in human history. There have been pandemics before and there will be again. I think the unfortunate reality is that every few years <em>Station Eleven</em> will seem horribly relevant.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s your favourite dystopian novel?</strong><br><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/oct/27/canticle-for-leibowitz-cormac-mccarthy-hugo\">A Canticle for Liebowitz</a> </em>by Walter Miller. It\u2019s an old novel \u2013 it came out in 1960 \u2013 and it\u2019s about the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust. It\u2019s a very sharp, beautifully written work. It\u2019s somewhat haunting and I read it when I was 15 years old and it\u2019s stayed with me in a very vivid way.</p> <p><strong>What about your favourite ghost story?<br></strong><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/may/31/sarah-waters-the-little-stranger\">The Little Stranger</a></em> by Sarah Waters. I just thought it was wonderful. The creepiness and ambiguity of it was stunning.</p> <p><strong>Which writers have most influenced your own writing?<br></strong>Raymond Chandler has definitely been an influence. Also Ir\u00e8ne N\u00e9mirovsky \u2013 her most famous novel is <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/mar/26/fiction.features\">Suite Francaise</a></em>, which was not finished when she was arrested by the Nazis and died at Auschwitz. But even as an incomplete novel it\u2019s a masterpiece of lucidity and clarity, and I\u2019m always writing towards that prose style. And also an American novelist named Dan Chaon: he does really interesting things with structure and genre that I admire.</p> <p><strong>Which novelists working today do you admire </strong><strong>most?<br></strong>Those who are doing really interesting things with the form \u2013 pushing it forward in some way. So Ali Smith is one of my very favourites. And on this side of the Atlantic I would also say <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/24/jennifer-egan-quantum-leap-manhattan-beach-visit-from-the-goon-squad\">Jennifer Egan</a>: her novel <em>A Visit from the Goon Squad</em> was hugely influential for me in the boldness of its structure.</p> <p><strong>What kind of reader were you as a child?<br></strong>I was a voracious reader. My family never had much money but we did have an incredible number of books so I just read my way through my parents\u2019 book collection. I\u2019m sure it was often quite inappropriate but I read everything.</p> <p><strong>Which books and authors have stayed with you since childhood?<br></strong>Susan Cooper\u2019s series <em>The Dark </em><em>Is Rising</em>. Nobody in the US has ever heard of her but I thought she was wonderful. Also <em>The Chronicles of Narnia</em> and the Tolkien books \u2013 the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> cycle.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the last really great book you read?<br></strong><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-bluest-eye-9780099759911.html\">The Bluest Eye</a></em> by Toni Morrison \u2013 it\u2019s a masterpiece.</p> <p><strong>What</strong><strong>\u2019s on your bedside table to read next?<br></strong>Ronan Farrow\u2019s book, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/20/catch-and-kill-ronan-farrow-review\">Catch and Kill</a></em> \u2013 I\u2019m looking forward to that very much.</p> <p><strong>Which literary figures \u2013 dead or alive \u2013 would you most like to meet?</strong><br>I would love to meet Alice Munro. She was friends with my grandmother years and years ago. My grandmother\u2019s been dead for 25 years but she used to talk about Alice. I\u2019d love to meet Munro to talk about her work, which I love, but also to ask if she remembered my grandmother.</p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/emily-st-john-mandel/the-glass-hotel/9781509882809\">The Glass Hotel</a></em> by Emily St John Mandel is published by Pan Macmillan in ebook and audio formats on 30 April and in hardback on 6 August (\u00a314.99)</p>",

Yep, the current sporting lockdown means it\u2019s come to this, but as the former National Hunt jockey Andrew Thornton said in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlHb8kcoCZg&amp;has_verified=1\">one preview of today\u2019s virtual Grand National that I viewed</a> yesterday: \u201cAnything\u2019s better than nothing.\u201d He\u2019s not wrong. </p> <p>As we enter our third week of sport-free house arrest in the UK, stay tuned for coverage of a race that won\u2019t so much stop a nation like the famous Melbourne Cup, but provide some much-needed amusement for an already stationary nation as its citizens remain on lockdown and in need of some more than welcome sporting distraction.</p> <p><strong>The flag is due to drop at 5pm (BST)</strong> and we\u2019re reasonably hopeful there won\u2019t be a false start, but stay tuned in the meantime for what we are loosely going to term buildup. It\u2019s a bit of fun for all the family and with any profits made by bookmakers going to NHS Charities Together (more of which anon), the cause could scarcely be more worthy in the current weird climate. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-04T14:43:58.432Z\">at 3.43pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

Red Rum wins by half-a-length from Manifesto. Red Rum surprises absolutely nobody by winning the Race of Champions. A dual winner, Manifesto was second. Tiger Roll gets on the podium in third. Race of Champions: Tiger Roll and Davy Russell continue to make the running as they approach the 18th fence, with Amberleigh House in third. Monty\u2019s Pass and Mr Frisk - possibly the last winner I backed in this race back in the mid-nineties - are well placed. Monty\u2019s Pass is a faller ... Tiger Roll leads them over Beecher\u2019s Brook from L\u2019Escargot and Don\u2019t Push It ... Race of Champions: Oh dear. The 1976 winner Rag Trade is a faller at the first, with Red Rum, Aldaniti and Tiger Roll in good positions. Aldaniti falls at the third. Bob Champion is on his feet and OK. Manifesto jumps well at The Chair, while Silver Birch refuses, the lazy git ... The Race of Champions: Inspired Gaming in Manchester are the brains behind today\u2019s wheeze and as faintly ludicrous as the whole thing is, their work is certainly impressive. They\u2019re about to stage a race of Champions, pitting 40 of the best Grand National winners from the past against each other. L\u2019Escargot and Red Rum are among the favourites. And we\u2019re off: Well, not really. But ITV coverage of today\u2019s Virtual Grand National has begun, with presenter and nominative determinism\u2019s Nick Luck broadcasting live from his study, where he has a nice piano in the background. There\u2019s posh. Update: Huw has won \u00a37,000 on The Chase and at the behest of his wife, is going to spend his winnings on new bedroom furnishings and a little holiday. Well done, Huw. Coral PR man Simon Clare tweets ... It seems today\u2019s virtual Grand National has captured the imagination of a very bored British public who are desperate for some sporting entertainment. To the pre-parade ring we go ... Normally at this time of year, the ITV cameras would be in the pre-parade ring interviewing various trainers, owners and stable lads as their horses are saddled and any last-minute adjustments are made. This year, TV viewers have to forego all that pre-race pomp and ceremony because The Chase is on and won\u2019t be over until 5pm. In case you\u2019re interested, a man named Huw has just failed to identify Chloe Madeley as the daughter of TV presenter Judy Finnigan. Apart from Elizabeth Taylor, who won the Grand National on board The Pie in the 1944 movie National Velvet, a total of 30 horses have been ridden by women down the years in the Grand National. Charlotte Brew was the first to get the leg up, in 1977, when her mount Barony Forth refused at the 26th fence. Geraldine Reece became first women to complete the course, finishing in eighth and last place on board Cheers five years later. While no woman has ever ridden the winner of the Grand National, Katie Walsh became the highest place finisher when she came third on Seabass in 2012. In this year\u2019s virtual affair, there are three women taking their chance. Bryony Frost, whose father Jamie won the 1989 race on Little Polveir, rides 28-1 shot Yala Enki, Rachael Blackmore and Burrows Saint look a decent bet at 12-1 and Lisa O\u2019Neill is a long shot on Shattered Love.

Confined to barracks with too much time on his hands like the rest of us when he\u2019d much prefer to be gadding around Aintree, Chris Cook reads his racing runes. Although today\u2019s race has been pre-recorded, those privy to the result have been sworn to secrecy and punters with online betting accounts will be able to have a punt on the race, should they so desire. The odds on each horse are fixed and stakes are restricted to a maximum of a \u00a310 win or \u00a310 each way per person.

Walk In The Mill (James Best) 16-1 The strict UK lockdown means that this virtual race could pull in more viewers than the actual Aintree spectacular, writes Greg Wood. And he\u2019s not even joking! Following the cancellation of the actual Grand National, originally slated to take place at Aintree today, due to the coronavirus pandemic, ITV Racing have decided to stage a computer-simulated running of the world\u2019s most famous steeplechase instead. Using Computer Generated Imagery (CGI), a field of 40 virtual horses and riders will tackle the famous fences over four-and-a-half miles, cheered on by tens of thousands of virtual racegoers and followed \u2013 in a nice touch \u2013 by a virtual ambulance which won\u2019t be a drain a NHS resources. \u201cThe simulation itself is made up of mathematical algorithms using data taken from the horses\u2019 previous performances,\u201d say the Racing Post. \u201cThe race\u2019s outcome uses a number of factors such as age, weight, form and weather conditions but also contains details such as fallers, unseated riders and collapsed fences. \u201cData on all of the 40 runners from this year\u2019s race have been added and the computer has generated odds. The three previous Virtual Grand Nationals have been strikingly accurate, with Tiger Roll completing the virtual-real life double in 2018.\u201d Greetings all and welcome to this afternoon\u2019s live coverage of what is ostensibly \u2026 well, a cartoon. Yep, the current sporting lockdown means it\u2019s come to this, but as the former National Hunt jockey Andrew Thornton said in one preview of today\u2019s virtual Grand National that I viewed yesterday: \u201cAnything\u2019s better than nothing.\u201d He\u2019s not wrong. As we enter our third week of sport-free house arrest in the UK, stay tuned for coverage of a race that won\u2019t so much stop a nation like the famous Melbourne Cup, but provide some much-needed amusement for an already stationary nation as its citizens remain on lockdown and in need of some more than welcome sporting distraction. The flag is due to drop at 5pm (BST) and we\u2019re reasonably hopeful there won\u2019t be a false start, but stay tuned in the meantime for what we are loosely going to term buildup. It\u2019s a bit of fun for all the family and with any profits made by bookmakers going to NHS Charities Together (more of which anon), the cause could scarcely be more worthy in the current weird climate.",

      "body": "<p>Areema Nasreen spent her teenage years caring for her sick grandmother. The eldest daughter of parents from Mirpur, Pakistan, she grew up in Birmingham with four brothers and three sisters, and took huge comfort from looking after her <em>nani amma</em> \u2013 an experience that propelled her to keep on helping people.</p> <p>Last January, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/nhs-nurse-dies-coronavirus-hospital-where-she-worked-areema-nasreen-walsall\">Nasreen </a>fulfilled a lifelong ambition of graduating from university to become a fully qualified nurse at Walsall Manor Hospital. Last Friday, it was announced that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/03/two-young-nurses-die-as-nhs-braces-for-more-coronavirus-losses\">Nasreen and fellow nurse Aimee O\u2019Rourke</a>, both mothers of three children, had died, along with two healthcare assistants. The 36-year-old became the youngest NHS worker to die from Covid-19, leaving her family raw with grief.</p> <p>Speaking to the <em>Observer</em>, Kazeema, 33, paid tribute to her sister\u2019s sacrifice. \u201cShe was a legend,\u201d she said through tears. \u201cEveryone remembers her with so much love and heartbreak because she had so much love to give. She was like a mum to us. She looked after us all.\u201d</p> <p>The three sisters had spent five hours chatting at home before Nasreen went into intensive care two weeks ago. \u201cMe and her were like twins,\u201d said Kazeema. \u201cWe got married on the same day, into the same family. We even had the same due date.\u201d</p> <p>Kazeema and younger sister Ash, 32, had sat by her bedside at home. \u201cReema just wanted to sit and talk that day. She called mum in Pakistan and told her not to worry. She had to hold her breath really hard because the coughing was so bad. She just said to her: \u2018I\u2019ll be fine, don\u2019t worry. Don\u2019t be upset otherwise I\u2019ll get upset\u2019. And then we took her to hospital.\u201d</p> <p>Nasreen began her career at Walsall Manor Hospital in 2003 as a housekeeper, the year after she got married. She began nursing soon after and was a popular presence on the ward. One colleague, who didn\u2019t want to give her name, told the <em>Observer</em>: \u201cWe love her and miss her. She was an amazing nurse and so grateful for the privilege to do what we do. She always put her patients first and herself last.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>She loved her work, her patients and her colleagues and she always had a smile</p> <footer> <cite>Fatima Parkar, nurse</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Speaking to the <em>Observer</em>, relative Dr Samara Afzal said the family\u2019s heartbreaking loss was \u201cdeeply compounded\u201d by the severe, isolated restrictions of lockdown. \u201cNormally, hundreds of people would come to the house and be there to support family members,\u201d she said. \u201cBut with a pandemic, it\u2019s impossible and it\u2019s hard to know how someone is coping without being face to face.\u201d</p> <p>Nasreen\u2019s elderly parents had initially been stranded in Pakistan by flight cancellations, unable to get home to Birmingham as their daughter was being put on a ventilator in intensive care. Nasreen\u2019s three children, aged from seven to 16 years, were not permitted to visit their mother in hospital. Her funeral was held last Friday, and attended only by immediate family members.</p> <p>\u201cThe [funeral procession] drove along our road and that was enough for us,\u201d said Kazeema. \u201cEveryone respected the distancing rule \u2013 Reema would have been really upset if we hadn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>The younger sisters were taking care to comfort their niece and nephews. \u201cI was putting my nephew to bed and he asked if I was going to be his mum now and I just said, \u2018Of course, we\u2019ve always been your mums\u2019.\u201d Kazeema began to cry. She had followed in her sister\u2019s footsteps to work in Walsall Manor Hospital a few years ago. \u201cMe and my younger sister always supported Reema: we always looked after the kids and cooked for her and her husband when she was following her dream of going to uni. I don\u2019t know if I could live up to what she did. She was an angel.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s tragic,\u201d said Afzal. \u201cShe was so full of life and such a positive person to be around, always the life and soul at family gatherings and weddings. She was so dedicated to her job and her family, too.

      "bodyText": "Areema Nasreen spent her teenage years caring for her sick grandmother. The eldest daughter of parents from Mirpur, Pakistan, she grew up in Birmingham with four brothers and three sisters, and took huge comfort from looking after her nani amma \u2013 an experience that propelled her to keep on helping people. Last January, Nasreen fulfilled a lifelong ambition of graduating from university to become a fully qualified nurse at Walsall Manor Hospital. Last Friday, it was announced that Nasreen and fellow nurse Aimee O\u2019Rourke, both mothers of three children, had died, along with two healthcare assistants. The 36-year-old became the youngest NHS worker to die from Covid-19, leaving her family raw with grief. Speaking to the Observer, Kazeema, 33, paid tribute to her sister\u2019s sacrifice. \u201cShe was a legend,\u201d she said through tears. \u201cEveryone remembers her with so much love and heartbreak because she had so much love to give. She was like a mum to us. She looked after us all.\u201d The three sisters had spent five hours chatting at home before Nasreen went into intensive care two weeks ago. \u201cMe and her were like twins,\u201d said Kazeema. \u201cWe got married on the same day, into the same family. We even had the same due date.\u201d Kazeema and younger sister Ash, 32, had sat by her bedside at home. \u201cReema just wanted to sit and talk that day. She called mum in Pakistan and told her not to worry. She had to hold her breath really hard because the coughing was so bad. She just said to her: \u2018I\u2019ll be fine, don\u2019t worry. Don\u2019t be upset otherwise I\u2019ll get upset\u2019. And then we took her to hospital.\u201d Nasreen began her career at Walsall Manor Hospital in 2003 as a housekeeper, the year after she got married. She began nursing soon after and was a popular presence on the ward. One colleague, who didn\u2019t want to give her name, told the Observer: \u201cWe love her and miss her. She was an amazing nurse and so grateful for the privilege to do what we do. She always put her patients first and herself last.\u201d Speaking to the Observer, relative Dr Samara Afzal said the family\u2019s heartbreaking loss was \u201cdeeply compounded\u201d by the severe, isolated restrictions of lockdown. \u201cNormally, hundreds of people would come to the house and be there to support family members,\u201d she said. \u201cBut with a pandemic, it\u2019s impossible and it\u2019s hard to know how someone is coping without being face to face.\u201d Nasreen\u2019s elderly parents had initially been stranded in Pakistan by flight cancellations, unable to get home to Birmingham as their daughter was being put on a ventilator in intensive care. Nasreen\u2019s three children, aged from seven to 16 years, were not permitted to visit their mother in hospital. Her funeral was held last Friday, and attended only by immediate family members. \u201cThe [funeral procession] drove along our road and that was enough for us,\u201d said Kazeema. \u201cEveryone respected the distancing rule \u2013 Reema would have been really upset if we hadn\u2019t.\u201d The younger sisters were taking care to comfort their niece and nephews. \u201cI was putting my nephew to bed and he asked if I was going to be his mum now and I just said, \u2018Of course, we\u2019ve always been your mums\u2019.\u201d Kazeema began to cry. She had followed in her sister\u2019s footsteps to work in Walsall Manor Hospital a few years ago. \u201cMe and my younger sister always supported Reema: we always looked after the kids and cooked for her and her husband when she was following her dream of going to uni. I don\u2019t know if I could live up to what she did. She was an angel.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s tragic,\u201d said Afzal. \u201cShe was so full of life and such a positive person to be around, always the life and soul at family gatherings and weddings. She was so dedicated to her job and her family, too. She was a fantastic role model and influence for Asian women.\u201d Former patients of Nasreen, who was frequently described by colleagues as \u201cconfident and bubbly\u201d, paid tribute on a Facebook post by Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust, remembering her as \u201cprofessional and kind\u201d, \u201ca fabulous nurse,\u201d \u201ca smiling hero\u201d. \u201cShe loved her work, her patients and her colleagues and she always had a smile,\u201d said nurse Fatima Parkar at Walsall Manor Hospital. \u201cI was very proud of her because, like me, she was a mature student.

Yes, even if you are alone, mid-virus. \u201cAt a moment like this,\u201d the same connoisseur continues, \u201cquirky tableware is particularly uplifting.\u201d</p> <p>We can\u2019t be sure, admittedly, that daily bulletins on the lockdown habits of more successful 17th-century people, on matters such as skincare (\u201cthere\u2019s been no better time than now to look after number one\u201d) and a new, working from home wardrobe (\u201cyes, you\u2019re confined.

      "bodyText": "With classic plague literature now fairly thoroughly mined for instructive similarities with our current predicament \u2013 official cover-ups, forced isolation, mad clerics, makeshift burials, heavy-handed policing etc \u2013 perhaps it is time to turn to some of the differences. One of the major ones being, of course, the earlier absence of influencers. As terrifying as it would have been for anyone stuck in the London described by Defoe or inside Camus\u2019s Oran, these imprisoned citizens were, at least, spared survival tips dreamed up in the remote homes and gardens of fund managers, celebrity chefs, professional tidier-uppers, titled brand ambassadors, \u201ctablescaping\u201d experts. You might be banged up, scared and brooding on things left undone and unsaid, in 1665, but at least nobody thought this was the perfect time to inform you that \u201cthis period of self-isolation is a good chance to experiment with more decadent table settings\u201d. Yes, even if you are alone, mid-virus. \u201cAt a moment like this,\u201d the same connoisseur continues, \u201cquirky tableware is particularly uplifting.\u201d We can\u2019t be sure, admittedly, that daily bulletins on the lockdown habits of more successful 17th-century people, on matters such as skincare (\u201cthere\u2019s been no better time than now to look after number one\u201d) and a new, working from home wardrobe (\u201cyes, you\u2019re confined. Your style needn\u2019t be\u201d) wouldn\u2019t have made pestilence and economic catastrophe more endurable, even for those unable to sit it out in Oxford or Salisbury. \u201cHas there ever,\u201d suggests Samuel Pepys, \u201cbeen a better time to organise your old wigs?\u201d Today, there are presumably people confined to garden-less flats with hostile fellow-occupants who find that articles such as \u201cWhy we decided not to self-isolate in our Cornwall holiday home\u201d, along with joyous diaries from isolated mansions (\u201cI\u2019m also planting a vegetable garden\u201d) are just the thing \u2013 like the government\u2019s separate bathroom advice \u2013 to get them through another day of confinement. Maybe people don\u2019t need, personally, to feel blessed in the face of illness and redundancy, to benefit from the example of busy professionals for whom, it emerges, the ideal isolated day might begin with entries in a gratitude notebook. Has there ever been a better time to start one? As for material, the FT\u2019s Marie Kondo-inspired hints on gratitude practice (as a means to finding \u201cjoy at work in the age of coronavirus\u201d) include \u201cbe thankful for being healthy\u201d. No disrespect to Kondo, whose tidying is unrivalled, but, as with fellow influencers, some of her hints could challenge civilians now dependent for survival on universal credit or facing other threats \u2013 from abuse to overcrowding \u2013 to their gratitude or online shopping practice. Maybe it\u2019s because this contagion\u2019s projected remedy - self-isolation - is situated, literally, in the world of interiors, that the restrictions have been so widely understood as an athleisure-buying/self-care/crafting/decluttering opportunity, as opposed to an impending economic catastrophe. But maybe I\u2019ve forgotten similarly abundant guidance on fermenting turnips, dumping cleaners and gratitude practice after the 2008 banking collapse, generally from the very people it was least likely to touch. While some of our more fatuous celebrities seem to have piped down a bit, since contributions including Madonna\u2019s from her bath and David Geffen\u2019s from his yacht helped propel the hashtag #guillotine2020, the stream of virus-inspired lifestyle advice on things it has never been a better time to do has gone ever more Marie Antoinette. \u201cIt suddenly makes sense,\u201d city dwellers without the space for a flock of sheep are told, \u201cto own hens.\u201d Both UK lives and the UK economy were already imperilled on 17 March, the day after shutdown, when the revered fund manager Dame Helena Morrissey drew on her long experience of getting dressed and sometimes working from home to reach out. \u201cTake time to do your hair and makeup as usual,\u201d she advised on her Instagram account. Avoid black - \u201ctoo draining for most of us on video\u201d \u2013 and white - \u201ctoo stark\u201d. With this additional explanation for the gender pay gulf: \u201cI\u2019ve learned,\u201d she wrote, \u201cthat a jewel-coloured poloneck with a necklace looks both polished and appropriate for remote meetings.\u201d Definitely something to try when this is over. Among those professionally supplying emergency lockdown hints is Kirstie Allsopp, whose early retreat to a spare home in Devon, with an infected partner \u2013 \u201cHeather, our nanny, is still in Lanzarote\u201d \u2013 was widely covered. Channel 4 recruited Jamie Oliver, 1,000 of whose staff lost their jobs last year, to provide recipes \u201cspecifically tailored for the unique times we\u2019re living in\u201d. Oliver, now fully regenerated as a country squire, approaches this solemn task from a gigantic house that mercifully survived the collapse of his restaurant group with \u00a371.5m debts. The Sun took the chance to show readers \u201cinside Jamie Oliver\u2019s incredible \u00a36 million Essex country pad where he\u2019s isolating with Jules and his kids\u201d. \u201cWho better than Jamie to help us all navigate the day-to-day challenge of eating well and feeding our families?\u201d asked a Channel 4 person, who must have known that the obvious answer was (before the BBC sensibly hired her) the brilliant @BootstrapCook. Jack Monroe once struggled to feed her child and has been characteristically generous in lockdown, tweeting uses for ancient/doomed-looking ingredients. And whose navigation could be worse? A tie, I\u2019d say, between Richard Branson and David Cameron, reaching out from island and hut respectively. Although special Marie Antoinette points for the members of the royal family photographed empathising in the country, while their London homes stand empty. It isn\u2019t that self-isolation wisdom and encouragement can\u2019t be comforting. I\u2019ve enjoyed, in particular, the Guardian\u2019s streaming gems, the Getty museum challenge and a terrific New Statesman compilation featuring Hilary Mantel\u2019s recourse to Ivy Compton-Burnettt, Anthony Powell and her old bottles of scent. Finally: something for my new gratitude notebook. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 April 2020 because an earlier version incorrectly referred to Kirstie Allsopp\u2019s husband. In fact he is her partner. \u2022 Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist",

The real test will be in two or three weeks\u2019 time. How long can we keep a lockdown going?\u201d</p> <p>Countries that introduced stringent coronavirus measures sooner than the UK have been forced to increasingly tighten their approach. In France, where police have checked more than 3.7 million citizens to ascertain if they are complying with its lockdown, tens of thousands of extra officers and gendarmes are being deployed across the country this weekend to ensure coronavirus measures are obeyed.</p> <p>Some fear that Italy presents a warning of the social unrest that can build during a lengthy lockdown. More than three weeks in, reports of localised disorder have emerged, with<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/italy-sets-aside-400m-for-food-vouchers-as-social-unrest-mounts\"> tensions swelling across the poorer southern regions as people run out of food and money</a>.</p> <p>The Spanish government announced on Saturday that it would seek parliamentary approval to extend its near-total lockdown to 26 April. Police in the country said that they had arrested more than 1,100 people and fined nearly 90,000 since the measures began in mid-March.</p> <p>As the UK\u2019s response faces its greatest challenge this weekend with the arrival of warmer weather and the start of the Easter school holidays, senior policing figures lined up to reissue pleas for people to avoid travel and stay at home. Ken Marsh, head of the Metropolitan Police Federation, which represents 30,000 officers in the capital, said: \u201cPlease, please, please, park your backside on a sofa and don\u2019t get off it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b0829cfdb072b488a5864055df01d40c136e3b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b0829cfdb072b488a5864055df01d40c136e3b5/0_44_3500_2101/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Boscombe beach near Bournemouth yesterday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boscombe beach near Bournemouth yesterday. Police have been ordered to deter people from visiting coastal areas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Marsh said that the public should put themselves in the position of police and other emergency workers. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely frightening: everybody is being told to stay at home and stay two metres from others, but my colleagues can\u2019t \u2013 in order to enforce correctly. It\u2019s bonkers,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The demand for the public to obey the lockdown was echoed by John Apter, the national chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales, which represents officers outsde the capital. \u201cDuring the hot weather this weekend I ask the public to give us their support and to work with us,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we all work together, we can get through this. We can save lives and support our NHS. All I ask is that the public gives us their support in this time of crisis.\u201d</p> <p>The stakes were raised last Friday when Professor Neil Ferguson, a leading scientist advising the government, warned that the infection rate in the UK could remain high for \u201cweeks and weeks\u201d if people flouted social distancing rules this weekend.</p> <p>Ministers have stressed that \u201cstay at home\u201d is an instruction, not a request. Their demands, however, arrive amid concern over whether all younger people, who are less likely to become seriously ill, will observe the strict rules.</p> <p>Some individuals, the <em>Observer</em> has been told, are flouting coronavirus measures by continuing to go on dates with new people \u2013 albeit in homes. In London, rule flouting by groups of young people has been partly blamed for the closure of green spaces such as Victoria Park in the east of the city.</p> <p>This weekend, signs appeared at entrances to Hampstead Heath in north London urging visitors enticed by the sun to maintain a distance of two metres from others and not to take public transport or drive to the outdoor space.</p> <p>Brockwell Park in south London will be closed on Sunday because so many people had flouted the government\u2019s social distancing advice, Lambeth Council said.</p> <p>It tweeted: \u201cDespite clear advice, over 3000 people spent today in Brockwell Park, many of them sunbathing or in large groups. This is unacceptable. Unfortunately, the actions of a minority now means that, following police advice, Brockwell Park will be closed tomorrow. StayHome.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Elsewhere in the UK, police have been ordered to try to deter people from visiting coastal areas, national parks and other popular destinations. At Brighton station, officers were asking all arrivals to return home if they had journeyed to the seaside to enjoy the sun. Further west along the south coast, senior police figures said they had to trust the public to enforce the lockdown because they could not guard every beach and destination.</p> <p>Chief constable Shaun Sawyer said Devon and Cornwall\u2019s 700 miles of coastline was \u201cunpoliceable other than by the public themselves\u201d. He added: \u201cOf course, we\u2019ll focus on core areas. We\u2019re certainly looking at the arterial roads into the south-west \u2013 the M4, M5, A303 and then, within the peninsula, the A30. But we have a very small workforce. Devon and Cornwall police requires the public both within and outside our geography to play their part.\u201d</p> <p>Boris Johnson announced the national lockdown on Monday 23 March, and said the government would review it within three weeks, which means a decision is likely to be announced in the next few days.</p> <p>\u201cI cannot imagine it not being extended beyond three weeks,\u201d said Dhindsa.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The coronavirus lockdown could crumble as public frustration builds in the weeks ahead, a crime commissioner warned on Saturday night as police stepped up calls for people to stay at home during this weekend\u2019s sunny weather. The Derbyshire police and crime commissioner, Hardyal Dhindsa, said \u201cisolation fatigue\u201d could set in and pose a genuine threat to the lockdown, especially after the likely decision to extend the measures beyond the current three-week period. Dhindsa, whose force was criticised for \u201cnanny policing\u201d after using a drone to \u201clockdown shame\u201d Peak District hikers , said: \u201cIn this early phase of isolation, people\u2019s awareness is quite high, but the longer it goes on, people\u2019s frustration at not being able to do what they want to will grow. The real test will be in two or three weeks\u2019 time. How long can we keep a lockdown going?\u201d Countries that introduced stringent coronavirus measures sooner than the UK have been forced to increasingly tighten their approach. In France, where police have checked more than 3.7 million citizens to ascertain if they are complying with its lockdown, tens of thousands of extra officers and gendarmes are being deployed across the country this weekend to ensure coronavirus measures are obeyed. Some fear that Italy presents a warning of the social unrest that can build during a lengthy lockdown. More than three weeks in, reports of localised disorder have emerged, with tensions swelling across the poorer southern regions as people run out of food and money. The Spanish government announced on Saturday that it would seek parliamentary approval to extend its near-total lockdown to 26 April. Police in the country said that they had arrested more than 1,100 people and fined nearly 90,000 since the measures began in mid-March. As the UK\u2019s response faces its greatest challenge this weekend with the arrival of warmer weather and the start of the Easter school holidays, senior policing figures lined up to reissue pleas for people to avoid travel and stay at home. Ken Marsh, head of the Metropolitan Police Federation, which represents 30,000 officers in the capital, said: \u201cPlease, please, please, park your backside on a sofa and don\u2019t get off it.\u201d Marsh said that the public should put themselves in the position of police and other emergency workers. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely frightening: everybody is being told to stay at home and stay two metres from others, but my colleagues can\u2019t \u2013 in order to enforce correctly. It\u2019s bonkers,\u201d he said. The demand for the public to obey the lockdown was echoed by John Apter, the national chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales, which represents officers outsde the capital. \u201cDuring the hot weather this weekend I ask the public to give us their support and to work with us,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we all work together, we can get through this. We can save lives and support our NHS. All I ask is that the public gives us their support in this time of crisis.\u201d The stakes were raised last Friday when Professor Neil Ferguson, a leading scientist advising the government, warned that the infection rate in the UK could remain high for \u201cweeks and weeks\u201d if people flouted social distancing rules this weekend. Ministers have stressed that \u201cstay at home\u201d is an instruction, not a request. Their demands, however, arrive amid concern over whether all younger people, who are less likely to become seriously ill, will observe the strict rules. Some individuals, the Observer has been told, are flouting coronavirus measures by continuing to go on dates with new people \u2013 albeit in homes. In London, rule flouting by groups of young people has been partly blamed for the closure of green spaces such as Victoria Park in the east of the city. This weekend, signs appeared at entrances to Hampstead Heath in north London urging visitors enticed by the sun to maintain a distance of two metres from others and not to take public transport or drive to the outdoor space. Brockwell Park in south London will be closed on Sunday because so many people had flouted the government\u2019s social distancing advice, Lambeth Council said. It tweeted: \u201cDespite clear advice, over 3000 people spent today in Brockwell Park, many of them sunbathing or in large groups. This is unacceptable. Unfortunately, the actions of a minority now means that, following police advice, Brockwell Park will be closed tomorrow. StayHome.\u201d Elsewhere in the UK, police have been ordered to try to deter people from visiting coastal areas, national parks and other popular destinations. At Brighton station, officers were asking all arrivals to return home if they had journeyed to the seaside to enjoy the sun. Further west along the south coast, senior police figures said they had to trust the public to enforce the lockdown because they could not guard every beach and destination. Chief constable Shaun Sawyer said Devon and Cornwall\u2019s 700 miles of coastline was \u201cunpoliceable other than by the public themselves\u201d. He added: \u201cOf course, we\u2019ll focus on core areas. We\u2019re certainly looking at the arterial roads into the south-west \u2013 the M4, M5, A303 and then, within the peninsula, the A30. But we have a very small workforce. Devon and Cornwall police requires the public both within and outside our geography to play their part.\u201d Boris Johnson announced the national lockdown on Monday 23 March, and said the government would review it within three weeks, which means a decision is likely to be announced in the next few days. \u201cI cannot imagine it not being extended beyond three weeks,\u201d said Dhindsa.",

      "bodyText": "The government risks losing an offer from South Korea of 400,000 coronavirus test kits a week to a rival country because they have not yet been tested by Public Health England, it has been claimed. A shareholder in the South Korean LG conglomerate has sourced the kits from five companies in the country and has offered them to the UK through a contact who was the former deputy leader of the Conservative party in Westminster council. Nick Markham says he has been in touch with the government, but they are dragging their heels and insisting they won\u2019t make a decision until the kits are tested. He says the production facilities and kits already manufactured are in huge demand, and countries including Ukraine and Romania have already sent military planes out to snap up the supplies. \u201cIt is like the wild west out there. Even Morocco has sent a plane but we can\u2019t get the government to make a commitment. The key thing is put an option on the production or we\u2019re going to lose it,\u201d he said. Markham said he had been in touch with the health secretary, Matt Hancock, who passed the offer on to Lord Bethall, a junior minister who is heading up the procurement effort. \u201cI get that they want to test the kit, but everyone is hiding behind this \u2018we can\u2019t decide until it\u2019s tested\u2019, which is perfectly reasonable, but we will get gazumped,\u201d said Markham. He said JP Lee, the shareholder in LG Chemicals, was \u201can Anglophile\u201d after spending time at the London School of Economics and wanted to help the UK. \u201cHe told me that he doesn\u2019t understand why Britain isn\u2019t out here, that the rest of the world is,\u201d said Markham. Seoul\u2019s fight against coronavirus has been lauded as one of the world\u2019s most successful and more than 120 countries have sought its advice. It took an aggressive approach to testing, and manufacturing of diagnostic kits has been increased to hundreds of thousands a day after approval was granted to export to the US. NHS Scotland has already decided to receive some equipment from South Korea. Markham is the chair of London and Continental Railways, a property company owned by the government, but was previously a TV executive and part of the team that merged Granada and Carlton TV and launched Freeview. He said he took on this role voluntarily because of his contacts in government and says he is \u201csympathetic\u201d to the Department of Health, which has been overwhelmed with offers of help. The kits could be available by the end of next week with production capacity rising to a million kits a week. The 400,000 kits would cost $10m (\u00a38.1m) but all JP Lee needs is for the government to take out an option on the supply. \u201cThen if the kits didn\u2019t pass the PHE test, which they will, or if the government says it has already secured enough testing kits, then nothing comes of it, it\u2019s a win-win situation,\u201d he said. Hancock announced two days ago that his goal was to increase the number of tests for NHS health workers to 100,000 a day by the end of April, but scientists said on Friday they were struggling to get the kits. If the government already has the volume it needs, Markham will stand this effort down, but he is concerned that this is not the case and Britain could be losing a valuable opportunity in the fight against coronavirus. Markham has teamed up with entrepreneur Steve Whatley, founder of the Inchora investment company that focuses on under-served communities, to develop what he called a \u201cOperation Little Boat\u201d drive to get hundreds of testing centres open by using volunteer staff not in the NHS with some clinical experience, such as dentists and optometrists. Last week Sir Paul Nurse, the chair of the Francis Crick Institute, said a \u201cDunkirk spirit\u201d approach was needed to meet the testing challenge. The Department for Health has been approached for comment.",

In neighbouring Turkey, more than 18,000 cases have been confirmed, and the rate of infection is on the steepest upward curve of any country in the world.

The past winter brought snow and waves of illness, including frostbite, diarrhoea, rickets and asthma. Syria is ill-prepared for an outbreak: weak state structures, an internally displaced population of seven million, and large parts of the country falling outside central government control make controlling the spread of the virus almost impossible. Al-Hawl camp is one of the most vulnerable places on earth to a Covid-19 outbreak, analysis from the International Rescue Committee shows. Social distancing is impossible in the camp, with large family groups, even multiple families, living in single tents. People need to queue for food, water and medical care. \u201cThis is also a weakened population,\u201d Carboni said. \u201cThey have limited access to healthcare and psychologically they don\u2019t know what will happen to them, they live in a permanent state of limbo.\u201d Children are suffering acutely inside the confines of al-Hawl. \u201cThese are children who are highly traumatised, they have experienced war, almost all of them have seen family members killed,\u201d Carboni said. \u201cAnd they have nothing, they are on their own, these kids are held in a space with nothing, no school, no books, no playground, no toys.\u201d Currently, there are 19 Australian women and 47 Australian children held in the camp.

But the Australian government has consistently refused to repatriate its citizens, despite the urgings of the Kurdish forces running the camp, its ally America, and other countries such as the UK, Germany, Denmark and France repatriating their citizens. A small group of Australian orphans has been repatriated to Australia, but no family members with adults have been brought back since the Australians were taken to the camp a year ago.

      "bodyText": "Scientists are being forced to shut down or scale back fieldwork to assess the impact of last summer\u2019s devastating bushfires on threatened species amid the coronavirus crisis, prompting concerns it could affect wildlife recovery. Several universities have shut down fieldwork to comply with restrictions on travel and physical contact and government agencies working on the recovery have had to scale back some of their operations. Urgent work such as feral-animal baiting has been able to continue in many fire-hit regions, and departments have adjusted their working methods to use local contractors rather than fly their own teams into locations such as Kangaroo Island, where there have been calls for a ban on non-essential travel. But some of the monitoring work that was due to assess the severity of the impact on at-risk wildlife has been suspended because of the difficulty in transporting experts to fire-ravaged locations. All of the scientists Guardian Australia spoke to said they agreed with the measures that had been imposed to protect public health, particularly when many sites are near smaller regional communities. But the necessary suspensions are a blow for research into which species have survived in remnant habitat, how they are coping in the months after the fires, and what recovery actions are necessary for plants and animals that have been pushed closer to extinction by the disaster. \u201cIt means we can\u2019t follow the complete trajectory of recovery and we can\u2019t determine the initial impacts,\u201d Mark Lintermans, an associate professor at the Centre for Applied Water Science at the University of Canberra, said. Lintermans is a fish expert and had been working in the Cotter River and Kosciuszko national park regions to assess how the fires had affected species such as the stocky galaxias, one of the fish identified by the government as the most at risk. He was able to do some fieldwork before the restrictions were imposed but said a months-long gap would make it harder to follow \u201cthe complete trajectory\u201d of at-risk species. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about potential lost opportunities to have a better recovery response because we don\u2019t have that information about the severity of the impact. There\u2019s a lot of worry that goes on,\u201d he said.

The Victorian government provided no specifics on how Covid-19 was affecting its recovery work, supplying only a statement saying work \u201cis continuing, to protect our native wildlife and biodiversity\u201d in line with advice from the state\u2019s chief health officer. Lisien Loan, the director of conservation and wildlife for South Australia\u2019s environment and water department, said teams had been able to do a lot of immediate work after fires on Kangaroo Island and around Cudlee Creek before the shutdown. Individual landowners are assisting with rabbit control in the Adelaide Hills region, where it complies with social distancing measures.

Some work is being modified in accordance with current government health advice but we continue to be focused on the challenge,\u201d the department said. Environment groups have expressed concern about the effects of the back-to-back crises of the bushfires and Covod-19. In particular, they are seeking clarity on whether the $50m the government budgeted for wildlife after the fires will still be increased as planned given the enormous financial stimulus required to assist workers and businesses affected by the shutdown. \u201cLooking forward there is an opportunity for economic stimulus spending to intersect with bushfire and wildlife recovery, and once people are able to get into these areas safely, there is potential to create new jobs in land management and ecosystem restoration,\u201d James Trezise of the Australian Conservation Foundation said. A spokesman for the environment minister, Sussan Ley, said the $50m was \u201ca down payment and there has been a clear commitment to further funding in the future\u201d. The government announced this week that as part of that $50m it would spend up to $12m on a new round of grants for recovery work. \u201cClearly, Covid-19 restrictions mean that some activities will not be able to start immediately but the process of identifying submissions and planning their role in the recovery process is an important one,\u201d Ley said in the announcement. On Thursday, Wires and Landcare said public donations meant the two organisations were offering $20,000 grants \u2013 up to a total of $1m \u2013 for community environment groups to do habitat regeneration work.",

And sure, it would be nice if conservatives suddenly faced the reality that their \u201csmall government\u201d narrative of the past 40 years has been reduced to ashes. But even within the prime minister\u2019s words we see that the policies, while sensible and essential, are not a signal of changed outlook. The focus remains very much on businesses rather than workers, and Morrison\u2019s own words betray that the underlying view point remains. This week when announcing the childcare payments, he told reporters, \u201cin this new normal that we\u2019re living in, it\u2019s no longer about entitlement.

Don\u2019t be fooled into thinking we now have a socialist government. Right now Morrison likes to talk about the economy snapping back, and putting an end to this spending. Clearly the government wants to return to its mantra of tax cuts and smaller government. Consider, the budget estimated the cost of flattening the income tax rate to 30% for those earning between $45,000 to $200,000 would cost $95bn in its first five years. Given the current level of federal crisis spending totals $213.6bn, foregoing the tax cuts would, as John Quiggin has noted, essentially offset the spending in a mere 10 years. But no, the tax cuts are sacrosanct \u2013 which means the debt will be paid with cuts that come as a result of lower revenue due to tax cuts and lower than anticipated economic growth. Just as the GFC did nothing to change conservatives\u2019 minds, and neither has climate change, don\u2019t expect the coronavirus to bring about a Damascene conversion in favour of government services and assistance. The only thing that will do that is if the public demands it \u2013 and votes for it. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

      "bodyText": "\u201cIt\u2019s a bit strange. I\u2019ve been here 25 years, 10 of them in intensive care. This is like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen before,\u201d Michelle Spence says. \u201cI\u2019ve described it as like preparing for a war. There\u2019s no doubt about it.\u201d Spence is the nurse unit manager of Royal Melbourne Hospital\u2019s intensive care unit, a 32-bed operation staffed by teams of highly-trained clinicians. Not infrequently, at least 30 of those beds will be occupied by critically ill patients. But right now, there\u2019s a lull. The effect of physical distancing restrictions aimed at slowing the spread of coronavirus has slowed the flow of patients into the hospital. Fewer people on the streets means fewer road accidents and less of the trauma that is the bread and butter of intensive care and emergency hospital departments. It\u2019s given doctors, nurses, allied health workers and the myriad support workers in Australia\u2019s major hospitals something their colleagues in Italy, the United States and Spain missed out on: time. Time to plan. Time to buy supplies and test equipment. Time to build space and hire and train staff. Hospitals care for critically ill patients every day but not in the numbers or at the scale that has become globally associated with Covid-19. Guardian Australia interviewed health workers around the country, from densely populated cities such as Melbourne, up to remote communities in the Torres Strait, about how they are preparing for a potential influx of patients requiring treatment for the highly contagious disease. The approach hospitals are taking varies based on geography and the volume of resources and clinicians they have to call on. But frontline workers uniformly described the work under way as regimented, repetitive, with \u201cthousands of hours\u201d put in. Most expressed a single fear. That even the best planning will not be enough if individuals do not follow government restrictions related to physical contact. \u201cI think right now, the general public and the community can save more lives than intensive care will be able to,\u201d Chris MacIsaac, the head of Royal Melbourne hospital\u2019s intensive care unit, says. \u201cIt\u2019s vital that the curve is flattened so the peak is not as high.\u201d The major metropolitan hospital In the intensive care unit of Royal Melbourne hospital, a major public hospital in the inner suburb of Parkville, doctors and nurses are practising intubation of a coronavirus patient experiencing respiratory failure. The hospital\u2019s ICU has not yet had a Covid-19-positive patient but clinicians are running simulations using a dummy. It\u2019s a complex task, typically performed by one to two critical care doctors and specially-trained nurses who administer medication to stop the patient breathing, insert a tube into the mouth and through the voice box, and initiate artificial breathing using a ventilator. It\u2019s a procedure that comes with a high risk of exposure to the infection, so Royal Melbourne is practising intubating patients using a minimum number of staff, clothed in personal protective equipment (known as PPE), in a negative pressure room. The drills are run daily in intensive care, the emergency department and theatres. MacIsaac says the whole hospital is now running as an emergency operations centre. It\u2019s a framework that exists for major external emergencies, such as a disaster with mass casualties, that demand a large-scale response. \u201cThis is a little different because we\u2019ve got such a lead-up time, but the structure of control and command has been in place for weeks,\u201d he says. For hospitals responding to the coronavirus pandemic, the critical element is their ability to care simultaneously for a large influx of seriously ill patients. In the worst-hit countries, hospitals have been overwhelmed and the contagious nature of Covid-19 has led to high rates of infections, as well as deaths, among healthcare workers. One of the greatest times of risk of contamination is when staff remove protective equipment, so clinicians are refreshing their knowledge of how to don and doff protective gear safely. ICU patients require sophisticated treatment. Monitoring of heart rates and oxygen levels. Administration of medication and nutrition. Teams are regularly practising how to flip a patient into a prone position, a technique that has been effective for some Covid-19 patients whose oxygen levels fall dangerously low. \u201cLooking after a critically ill patient is more than just connecting them to machines,\u201d MacIsaac says. \u201cA lot of care goes into looking after a critically ill patient and they require highly trained people.\u201d The hospital currently has 32 staffed beds in its intensive care unit. They\u2019re looking to increase that to 100 by repurposing other parts of the precinct, including the old ICU that closed in 2016, and the recovery room of the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre. Even that might not be enough. MacIsaac says right now they could ventilate 50 patients. The hospital is in negotiations with the Victorian government as to what their allocation from any new supplies will be. But it is his view that \u201cthe rate-limiting step\u201d in their capacity to treat people will not be equipment. \u201cWhat we\u2019re putting a lot of effort into is staffing,\u201d he says. Across the country, state health departments have been seeking expressions of interest from nurses and midwives, medical workers, allied health professionals, paramedics and patient services assistants. Spence, as the nurse unit manager, has carriage of a recruitment drive that will train 100 to 200 additional nurses to work in intensive care. Team members are cold-calling and interviewing potentially suitable candidates but the majority will be nurses who are already working on other wards within the hospital. Typically, they would complete a six-month training course but there is only time for what Spence calls a fast-tracked program in survival skills. \u201cWe\u2019re providing that over four days,\u201d she says. The equipment problem As hospitals race to prepare themselves for the pandemic\u2019s peak, three critical resourcing issues repeatedly crop up: access to ventilators, personal protective equipment and beds. Ventilators are used to assist the failing lungs of the most seriously-ill Covid-19 patients. Shortages in places like Italy have caused disaster and pointless loss of life as ICUs struggle to meet extraordinary demand with limited resources. In Australia, estimates of the current level of resourcing suggest there are 2,378 beds across 191 ICUs, each with a ventilator. The government wants to dramatically boost that number. The question is: are there enough ventilators \u2013 and the staff needed to operate them \u2013 to support such a surge? Modelling released this week suggests Australia has capacity to surge to an additional 4,261 beds, up by 189%. But there are only an extra 2,361 invasive ventilators to support such a surge. To address a potential shortfall, the federal government has set up a ventilator taskforce, made up of government and industry experts, which is working urgently to bolster stocks. The current strategy is four-fold. First, significantly boost the production of Australia\u2019s only onshore manufacturer of ventilators, a company named Resmed. Second, activate all reserves of ventilators that exist in Australia, including those currently being used in veterinary clinics. Third, purchase more ventilators from overseas suppliers, like Draeger, a German company. And finally, set up arrangements for new domestic manufacturers to utilise existing ventilator designs held by overseas manufacturers, already approved by foreign regulators, to begin producing the machines or parts in Australia. There is confidence from members of the taskforce that this will be enough to meet even the worst-case scenarios. But adequate supply of ventilators is not the only problem. The Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association\u2019s chief executive, Alison Verhoeven, says the issue will be ensuring the machines are deployed in a way that maximises their coverage of the population. \u201c[It will be about] having smart plans in place to shift patients out of areas where there might not be ventilators available \u2013 and I\u2019m thinking rural and regional areas \u2013 to centralised facilities,\u201d Verhoeven told the Guardian. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the planning that state health departments have been doing and each of them will have slightly different responses.\u201d Similarly, access to PPE \u2013 masks, gowns, goggles, and gloves \u2013 remains a risk to hospital preparedness. Adequate PPE is critical to safely treating Covid-19 patients. Yet many hospitals are already reporting dwindling stocks, particularly in the not-for-profit sector. University of Sydney decision sciences expert, Professor Ben Fahimnia, said he would not be surprised if \u201chospitals will soon rely on public donations of face masks for health workers\u201d. \u201cBuilding new production capacity in Australia where we have spent decades economising through offshoring is not easy,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if it is possible to force local production today, it is very unlikely to keep pace with this current pandemic-spurred demand.\u201d The referral centre This week, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said Australia\u2019s trajectory \u2013 that is the rate at which Covid-19 infections are increasing \u2013 was showing \u201cpromising, encouraging\u201d signs of slowing after the implementation of enforced social distancing measures. \u201cBut there are no guarantees,\u201d he said. Dr Bruce Ashford a head and neck surgeon at Wollongong hospital, on the New South Wales coast thinks it\u2019s too early for optimism. He is coordinating the hospital\u2019s Covid-19 task force, a multidisciplinary team that includes respiratory, emergency and logistical specialists. Ashford describes planning a response to the pandemic as \u201clooking over a cliff into the unknown\u201d. \u201cIf we get to three to four weeks down the track and things aren\u2019t mayhem, we\u2019ll be encouraged,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I just don\u2019t think there\u2019s enough history to indicate how this is going to go, which is why we have to plan for the worst-case scenario.\u201d Wollongong hospital is the major referral centre in the Illawarra Shoalhaven local health district, which comprises eight hospitals. It has had what Ashford calls a \u201cdisproportionate\u201d number of Covid-19 patients relative to population size. This week the hospital recorded its first death, a 75-year-old man who had been a passenger on the Ovation of the Seas cruise ship. Ashford and colleagues have spent countless hours poring over issues such as how patients with Covid-19 will move through the hospital upon their arrival. Core areas \u2013 emergency, theatres, intensive care \u2013 have been arranged so they are close together, the goal being to minimise contact between Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 patients. The ICU is being separated and expanded to 45 beds for Covid-19 patients and 21 for critically ill non-Covid patients. There\u2019s capacity to increase that by another 10, with 40 to 50 ventilators. Coordinating a response to a 24/7 emergency is complex and several people need to contribute. Doctors and nurses, cleaners, supply and logistics teams, caterers. Strategies have had to be developed to help Covid-19 patients, who can receive no visitors, communicate with their loved ones. At the same time, the day-to-day running of the health service continues and the impact of every decision on other, smaller, hospitals in the region has to be weighed. \u201cThe whole effort is based around this idea that everything before a pandemic seems like an overreaction and everything after seems like an underreaction,\u201d Ashford says. He says one advantage in Australia\u2019s favour is that the health system has been able to observe and learn from the experience in other countries. This week, the health minister, Greg Hunt, announced an extra $1.3bn towards integrating the private hospital system into the Covid-19 response. \u201cHowever, does that mean our efforts are going to be adequate? Probably not,\u201d Ashford says. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that there\u2019s something so special about Australia that we\u2019re going to be different to the rest of the world. \u201cYou look at New York, Milan and Madrid, they are on their last legs. And you think, what would that be like for us?\u201d A hospital committee including a medical ethicist and senior clinicians is discussing what will be done in the event there are more critically ill patients than resources or ventilators to care for them. There are similar committees, or frameworks, looking at this dilemma in other health districts around the country. Ashford says if it gets to that stage, extremely tough decisions will be inevitable and there will be frank conversations with patients and families about their wishes, as well the constraints on the hospital. Sara Arcioni, a senior registrar in the hospital\u2019s ICU, says frontline workers are used to the emotional load that comes with treating critically ill patients. \u201cIt\u2019s just that we may be dealing with many more,\u201d she says. The nation\u2019s capital Around the country, plans are being drawn up for how hospitals could increase their capacity beyond their existing facilities. Important regional facilities like Wagga Wagga base hospital have increased ICU capacity and set up procedures to separate the flow of suspected patients, while in Sydney, the Royal Prince Alfred hospital has prepared a dedicated and specially-designed Covid-19 intensive care unit. Major hotels, already being used as quarantine zones for returned travellers, could be converted into wards. In Victoria, the government is developing plans to convert the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition centre into a hospital and morgue. In Canberra this week, the ACT government announced it was working with healthcare company Aspen Medical to rapidly build a temporary emergency department for moderately to severely ill Covid-19 patients. It is also setting up an unregistered workforce made up of volunteers from the community \u2013 academics, students and a range of people with health backgrounds \u2013 after issuing a callout. Nine hundred people registered. At present, Australia\u2019s capital has emergency departments at two of its hospitals \u2013 Canberra hospital in the city\u2019s south and Calvary Public hospital in the city\u2019s north \u2013 and has recorded 93 cases of coronavirus, including two deaths this week. From Monday, Canberra healthcare workers will start looking more actively for evidence of transmission of the disease in the community by testing a random selection of people who would otherwise not meet the criteria for testing. David Caldicott is an emergency department consultant to Calvary Hospital and a lecturer at the Australian National University Medical School. He said there was anxiety, but not panic, in the emergency community about the potential impact of Covid-19 on frontline workers\u2019 own health. \u201cEmergency folk are practical folk. I know several of my colleagues, myself included, have made their first will,\u201d Caldicott says. He says the biggest concern for health workers was that people who were not in essential roles such as aged care, retail, delivery and cleaning, followed the physical distancing measures. \u201cThe frontline is at your front door. It\u2019s entirely up to the public to decide how bad this is going to be,\u201d he says. At Canberra\u2019s hospitals, teams are running drills in full PPE to prepare for how they will manage different types of Covid-19 positive patients, such as a woman in labour, or a deteriorating patient who needs to be transferred to theatre. Working in PPE \u2013 mask, goggles, gown and gloves \u2013 takes a physical toll. It\u2019s hot and there\u2019s a risk of dehydration. The greatest physical burden is often borne by nurses who have the most direct contact with patients. Bernadette McDonald, the chief executive of Canberra Health Services, said considerable time was being spent on staff welfare and support for workers who might be feeling anxiety. Some major Australian hospitals have been expanding their existing staff support services by bringing in additional psychologists and social workers, and organisations that will supply meals and nutrition for frontline teams. \u201cAt this point in time they are the most important people because they\u2019re the people who care for everyone that gets sick,\u201d McDonald says. The regions In Emerald in Queensland\u2019s central highlands a rural fever clinic has been built out of four dongas, each consisting of two rooms, a shower and toilet. Only a week ago, the site was empty space next to the practice run by GP and obstetrician Ewan McPhee, who is also the president of the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine. The clinic \u2013 one of 100 GP-led respiratory clinics the federal government is funding as part of its Covid-19 response \u2013 has been set up to direct patients with symptoms away from the hospital. Nurses and GPs at the clinic will swab people who meet the criteria for coronavirus testing. Emerald itself has a population of about 15,000 people. There are another 45,000 in the wider district. Emerald hospital has 30 beds and four ventilators. \u201cThe worst-case scenario for Emerald in the next three months would be 60 people requiring ventilation and we only have four ventilators,\u201d McPhee says. Federal and state leaders and mayors of councils have pleaded with Australians in recent weeks not to make unnecessary travel into regional and remote communities where the health infrastructure is not set up to cope with a massive surge in patients. Rural Australia already battles with shortages of frontline medical workers. The arrival of Covid-19 and quarantine restrictions has complicated that further in some places with doctors that were on fly-in fly-out arrangements. Emerald has not yet had a patient test positive for Covid-19 but McPhee is concerned the disease will ultimately make its way into the community via southern Queensland. He thinks the testing criteria needs to be expanded so that doctors can test when they suspect a patient has coronavirus and start monitoring community transmission. Separating Covid and non-Covid patients is immediately difficult for rural hospitals in terms of having the physical building space available. McPhee says medical teams in Emerald were having to consider solutions such as managing some hospital patients in their homes. Some very unwell patients would need to be transferred by helicopter or with the Royal Flying Doctor Service to Rockhampton or Brisbane. If the town becomes overrun, they would have to either convert the clinic into a treatment space, or call on the military to establish a field hospital. McPhee said there was enormous pressure on rural health workers who would have \u201cnowhere to hide\u201d in the face of such an emergency and he feels the urgency of the situation has not been fully grasped. \u201cIt\u2019s the community that has to make the decision about their future. We can\u2019t fix the problem once it\u2019s in a surge situation,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s going to save Emerald. It\u2019s not going to be a GP-led respiratory clinic. It\u2019s going to be people doing the right thing.\u201d Further north, Tony Brown is the incident controller for the Covid-19 response for the Torres and Cape hospital and health service. Ordinarily he works as a rural generalist, gynaecologist and obstetrician on Thursday Island but for the duration of the pandemic he will be based in Cairns. The majority of the population in the area covered by the Torres and Cape Health Service is Indigenous. There have been no confirmed Covid-19 cases so far and much of the health strategy is focused on trying to keep the disease out of the community. There is a 14-day quarantine requirement for travellers to the islands. If a doctor or nurse suspects a patient has coronavirus, that person has to isolate themselves at home. Brown says the health service intends to transfer confirmed positive cases to accommodation in Cairns for isolation but \u201cwe need to be ready for anything\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming our way and how many people are going to be affected,\u201d Brown says. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities are among the Australians most at risk of becoming severely ill due to Covid-19. Last week frontline doctors said they were preparing for \u201cdeath and suffering\u201d in these communities because of a lack of resources and many have gone into lockdown. The Torres and Cape hospital and health service has four hospitals \u2013 Thursday Island, Bamaga, Cooktown and Weipa \u2013 the largest of which has 26 beds and the smallest about six. There are 31 primary healthcare clinics run by nurses. Three new ventilators are on order but the plan is for any patient requiring ventilation to be flown to Cairns. If demand on the small health teams becomes too great, they would need to ask for assistance, including from the army. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the capacity to deal with only a certain number of people in our hospitals because we only have so many resources to manage them,\u201d Brown said. \u201cSo we have a tipping point where we turn to the state and say \u2018we\u2019re not coping\u2019.\u201d With Christopher Knaus",

It\u2019s a melting pot, which I love, but Bondi gets out of hand easily \u2013 we have a lot of travellers and they have a carefree attitude.\u201d But to point to the backpacker community alone as responsible for local infection rates is to miss the reality of Bondi\u2019s broader community. The suburb has long been home to professionals and young families from all over the world and less than half of its population is born in Australia, with many residents from Europe, South Africa, America and Brazil. At a local childcare centre where a parent tested positive for the virus, children speak Italian, French, German, Swedish, Hungarian, Russian, Chinese, Spanish and Italian. Long-haul travel, responsible for bringing the vast majority of Covid-19 infections into Australia but also for connecting expats with their families, is as much a way of life as the beach. The Waverley mayor, Paula Masselos, says it is the kindness of the community and its adaptability that stands it in good stead for the future. \u201cWe are all in this together.\u201d Brand Bondi, after all, reaches well beyond its bay and, to Tan, its pull is stronger than ever. He has been receiving messages from people all over the world telling him how images of Bondi are keeping them sane during lockdown. \u201cWithout the beach,\u201d he says, \u201cyou feel a bit lost.\u201d",

Now, as Covid-19 fractures the economy and brings entire industries to their knees, Bowtell\u2019s skills have again found a new purpose. Fourteen of his 20 3D printers are now being used to manufacture thousands of face shields for healthcare workers, who are struggling to access personal protective equipment amid widespread shortages. \u201cWith 3D printing, we\u2019ve been able to go from making hands to making face shields in a matter of, well, days,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cTo completely revamp our line, that\u2019s how agile this technology is and how flexible it is.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s mind-blowing.\u201d Bowtell\u2019s story is not unique. All across the country, catastrophe has caused remarkable transformations. Industry in the pandemic age is finding strange ways to meet the strangest of demands. Local gin distilleries are making hand sanitiser. Carmakers are offering design expertise for hospital ventilators. Detmold, a food packaging company, is now producing surgical masks. Textor, a company that previously created materials for nappies, sanitary pads and baby wipes, has repurposed its business toward personal protective equipment (PPE) with the help of the CSIRO. The manufacturing industry\u2019s guide during this pandemic-induced transformation is the Advanced Manufacturing Growth Centre, a not-for-profit working with the federal government. It is trying to help the sector pivot into Covid-19-related work, setting up a central portal where businesses can register their skills, supplies, and capabilities. \u201cOnce we set up the portal, heaven broke loose,\u201d the AMGC managing director, Dr Jens Goennemann, told the Guardian. \u201cUp to today, we had 1,000 registrations from companies who not only said \u2018I want to help\u2019, but they said how they could do that.\u201d \u201cSo that means we can make a heat map of different skills and capabilities, which we can then throw at the most targeted need.\u201d The speed of the pivot has been remarkable. But it has also raised a broader question. Before the crisis, only a single Australian factory, Med-Con\u2019s Shepparton plant, was producing surgical masks. Similarly, there was only one significant onshore producer of ventilators, a company named Resmed. Labor senator Kim Carr, a former industry minister, says this highlights a failing that extends well beyond just PPE and ventilators. How, he asks, has Australia allowed key strategic industries to disappear? And why has it taken a crisis for Australia\u2019s shortcomings to be so greatly exposed? \u201cThis is a profound problem now,\u201d Carr says. \u201cFor even the most simple-minded of our rightwing economists, understanding the implications of these matters surely now demonstrates the importance of us developing a more economically complex society and a more sovereign nation.\u201d The consequences of shortages in PPE, as one example, have been thrown into sharp relief in recent weeks. The paucity of supplies forced hospitals to stop elective surgeries and left aged care providers with serious threats to their ability to deliver services. Workers at dialysis units have been left to scrounge for their own masks, despite their patients being one of the most at-risk groups from Covid-19. A cancer treatment centre had to begin producing its own sanitiser using donated chemicals after vast quantities mysteriously went missing from its stores. Catholic Healthcare Australia, which represents members with 80 hospitals, warned the federal health minister, Greg Hunt, the situation was dire and that it held \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about PPE access. Local manufacturing has now become a critical part of the pandemic response, both in Australia and across the world. The World Health Organization has urged every country to boost its domestic PPE production by 40%. \u201cWithout secure supply chains, the risk to healthcare workers around the world is real,\u201d WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. \u201cIndustry and governments must act quickly to boost supply, ease export restrictions and put measures in place to stop speculation and hoarding.

It has also sent the army in to help Med-Con, which is aiming to double or triple its production. Exports of PPE have also been banned. Some say Australia\u2019s current situation exposes a failing of crisis planning. The chair of the Australian Healthcare Reform Alliance, Jennifer Doggett, said the gradual offshoring of PPE production was \u201cclearly extremely risky\u201d in the event of a pandemic. \u201cThis situation should prompt a rethink of our approach over the past several decades to move away from domestic manufacturing towards a reliance on imports,\u201d she said. \u201cThis may save money in the short term but it is costing us now.

But Ferrier also says the problem is partly explained by the way hospitals had changed their stocking of PPE in recent years. \u201cSince the 1990s there has been a movement towards a \u2018just in time\u2019 supply practice that replaced a \u2018just in case\u2019 practice, where hospitals held vast quantities of supplies that often went out of date,\u201d he said. \u201cThe \u2018just in time\u2019 practice has served the system well, but was always predicated on the ability for the manufacture and medical supply chain to respond nimbly to changes in demand.\u201d Goennemann, a leader in the industry, disputes suggestions that manufacturing is in decline in Australia.

When asked how else 3D printing might be deployed in practice, Goennemann points to the supply of ventilators, which are needed to assist breathing in the most seriously ill Covid-19 patients. A lack of ventilators has been a critical issue in countries like Italy, where doctors in swamped intensive care units have been forced to make heart-wrenching decisions about who gets access to the life-saving machines. Australia has about 2,300 ventilators in intensive care units across the country. The government wants to increase the number of ICU beds dramatically to prepare for the peak of the pandemic, and is attempting to source more ventilators through a combination of domestic production, procurement from abroad, and the conversion of existing equipment, including from veterinarians. Goennemann says Resmed, the main ventilator manufacturer, could struggle to get parts due to the disruption of global supply chains. That\u2019s where 3D printing can help. \u201cI don\u2019t want to speak on behalf of Resmed, but that\u2019s an area where we have critical supply, and parts can be 3D printed onshore rather than being procured offshore,\u201d he said.

That night after the races, the foursome met up. There was an almost instant connection between John and Marcia. He thought she was very nice and \u201cvery pretty\u201d. He remembers she had her waist-long hair tucked up into a blue cap. \u201cI\u2019m impressed he remembers,\u201d Marcia says drily.</p> <p>They saw each other again the following day, with Marcia introducing him to her family. But after that it was a long-distance relationship, with John based in Sydney and Marcia in Canberra. There were plenty of long phone calls and letters exchanged. So what was in the letters? \u201cThe normal rubbish that you carry on with trying to impress the girl,\u201d says John.</p> <p>They got engaged quickly and were married seven months after meeting. \u201cWe were over the long-distance thing and we knew we were going to be together,\u201d says John. \u201cSo better just to get married and move in together and be done with it.\u201d</p> <p>But it meant that Marcia had to give up her promising finance job in Canberra and move to Sydney. There was another complication: John had been married before and had the lion\u2019s share of the custody of his two children. He was a truck driver and constantly on the road, so Marcia had to look after the children. It wasn\u2019t an easy time. \u201cI thought it was going to be like the Brady Bunch,\u201d she says. \u201cI was fairly naive. And I soon came down to reality.\u201d </p> <p>Two years after they were married, they had a daughter. John knew it was tough on Marcia: \u201cShe was taking care of all that, bringing up the kids and the schooling and everything and it was new to her. So she did the best she could, and done a pretty good job of it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ecdf3482ad2619d1836c1dc2fbf241d76dd66cf0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ecdf3482ad2619d1836c1dc2fbf241d76dd66cf0/206_151_2535_1551/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marcia and John Church with daughter Tifffany on her 16th birthday in 1993\" width=\"1000\" height=\"612\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marcia and John with daughter Tifffany on her 16th birthday in 1993</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marcia and John Church</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the two retained a strong connection. \u201cOrdinarily he\u2019s the one who grounds me, and if I\u2019m too upset, he makes me laugh,\u201d says Marcia. John is rarely ruffled: \u201cNothing really worries me. I just take each day as it comes and whatever happens, happens.\u201d</p> <p>They\u2019re straightforward with each other and opposites in many ways, so they don\u2019t mind a hearty debate. \u201cHe does his thing, I do mine. But we yell a lot, because I\u2019m very vocal in my opinions to do with government and politics, and he\u2019s pretty vocal.\u201d It usually winds up with John walking away. Marcia doesn\u2019t always appreciate that, but things simmer down. \u201cI just storm around and play slamming doors and all this sort of stuff \u2019till I calm down. Then he\u2019ll walk back in two hours later and say, \u2018How you going, darl?\u2019.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/15/how-we-stay-together-you-cant-just-forge-down-your-own-path\">How we stay together: 'You can\u2019t just forge down your own path'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Their different skill sets came in handy when they ran the trucking company together. They built it into a thriving business with contracts with large freighting companies and employees in Sydney and Melbourne. They worked well together. \u201cI said to him, \u2018Well, I\u2019m pretty good at finances. You\u2019re pretty good at trucks and organising people, getting the maximum number of trucks and getting it up to the destination on time,\u2019\u201d says Marcia. \u201cSo you do your bit, I\u2019ll do my bit, and you just keep out of what I\u2019m doing and same. So that worked for about five minutes.\u201d</p> <p>They had a good cop, bad cop routine going, remembers John: \u201cI let people get away with overdue accounts and stuff like that, whereas Marcia wouldn\u2019t. She\u2019d put the foot down and say, \u2018Yeah, your 30 days is up.

Although there were lots of arguments, they didn\u2019t have time for any real disagreements, says John. \u201cIf a problem came up, it had to be solved straight away. So we talked about that and came to an agreement [about] what we would do about it.\u201d</p> <p>Neither are good at showing weakness or asking for help. Even when Marcia was very ill with her lung condition, John didn\u2019t take it too seriously \u2013 something she doesn\u2019t let him live down. But there\u2019s a sense that he would be lost if anything serious did happen. \u201cI dread the day if she does get really sick,\u201d he finally admits, before joking: \u201cI\u2019d drive you to the hospital. Let someone else look after you.\u201d</p> <p>She would also worry about him endlessly when he was driving trucks. \u201cInevitably, every single trip he\u2019s come home and tell me some sort of horror story ... that made it 50 times worse. So it was stressful.\u201d</p> <p>Eventually he decided to close up the business. It wasn\u2019t Marcia\u2019s decision but reluctantly she agreed. They sold their Sydney home and move to Tuncurry. These days they\u2019re settled in their own routines, together and doing their own thing. \u201cI enjoy my life [\u201cYou would,\u201d retorts Marcia] and enjoy the company I\u2019ve got ...

He remembers she had her waist-long hair tucked up into a blue cap. \u201cI\u2019m impressed he remembers,\u201d Marcia says drily. They saw each other again the following day, with Marcia introducing him to her family. But after that it was a long-distance relationship, with John based in Sydney and Marcia in Canberra. There were plenty of long phone calls and letters exchanged. So what was in the letters? \u201cThe normal rubbish that you carry on with trying to impress the girl,\u201d says John. They got engaged quickly and were married seven months after meeting. \u201cWe were over the long-distance thing and we knew we were going to be together,\u201d says John. \u201cSo better just to get married and move in together and be done with it.\u201d But it meant that Marcia had to give up her promising finance job in Canberra and move to Sydney. There was another complication: John had been married before and had the lion\u2019s share of the custody of his two children. He was a truck driver and constantly on the road, so Marcia had to look after the children. It wasn\u2019t an easy time. \u201cI thought it was going to be like the Brady Bunch,\u201d she says. \u201cI was fairly naive. And I soon came down to reality.\u201d Two years after they were married, they had a daughter. John knew it was tough on Marcia: \u201cShe was taking care of all that, bringing up the kids and the schooling and everything and it was new to her. So she did the best she could, and done a pretty good job of it.\u201d But the two retained a strong connection. \u201cOrdinarily he\u2019s the one who grounds me, and if I\u2019m too upset, he makes me laugh,\u201d says Marcia. John is rarely ruffled: \u201cNothing really worries me. I just take each day as it comes and whatever happens, happens.\u201d They\u2019re straightforward with each other and opposites in many ways, so they don\u2019t mind a hearty debate. \u201cHe does his thing, I do mine. But we yell a lot, because I\u2019m very vocal in my opinions to do with government and politics, and he\u2019s pretty vocal.\u201d It usually winds up with John walking away. Marcia doesn\u2019t always appreciate that, but things simmer down. \u201cI just storm around and play slamming doors and all this sort of stuff \u2019till I calm down. Then he\u2019ll walk back in two hours later and say, \u2018How you going, darl?\u2019.\u201d Their different skill sets came in handy when they ran the trucking company together. They built it into a thriving business with contracts with large freighting companies and employees in Sydney and Melbourne. They worked well together. \u201cI said to him, \u2018Well, I\u2019m pretty good at finances. You\u2019re pretty good at trucks and organising people, getting the maximum number of trucks and getting it up to the destination on time,\u2019\u201d says Marcia. \u201cSo you do your bit, I\u2019ll do my bit, and you just keep out of what I\u2019m doing and same. So that worked for about five minutes.\u201d They had a good cop, bad cop routine going, remembers John: \u201cI let people get away with overdue accounts and stuff like that, whereas Marcia wouldn\u2019t. She\u2019d put the foot down and say, \u2018Yeah, your 30 days is up. Pay your bill.\u2019\u201d Work inevitably spilled into their home life, with both of them working six days a week, all year round. There was plenty of the pressure on the relationship. \u201cWe were like ships that crossed in the night for a lot of years,\u201d says Marcia. Although there were lots of arguments, they didn\u2019t have time for any real disagreements, says John. \u201cIf a problem came up, it had to be solved straight away. So we talked about that and came to an agreement [about] what we would do about it.\u201d Neither are good at showing weakness or asking for help. Even when Marcia was very ill with her lung condition, John didn\u2019t take it too seriously \u2013 something she doesn\u2019t let him live down. But there\u2019s a sense that he would be lost if anything serious did happen. \u201cI dread the day if she does get really sick,\u201d he finally admits, before joking: \u201cI\u2019d drive you to the hospital. Let someone else look after you.\u201d She would also worry about him endlessly when he was driving trucks. \u201cInevitably, every single trip he\u2019s come home and tell me some sort of horror story ... that made it 50 times worse. So it was stressful.\u201d Eventually he decided to close up the business. It wasn\u2019t Marcia\u2019s decision but reluctantly she agreed. They sold their Sydney home and move to Tuncurry. These days they\u2019re settled in their own routines, together and doing their own thing. \u201cI enjoy my life [\u201cYou would,\u201d retorts Marcia] and enjoy the company I\u2019ve got ... I\u2019m very happy with what we\u2019ve had and hope there\u2019s a few more years left to go.\u201d They rarely discuss their relationship much: \u201cWe\u2019re too busy talking about aches and pains,\u201d says Marcia. John says: \u201cWe just take it for granted that we\u2019re together and we\u2019re stuck together, so [we] learn to live with it.\u201d They still tease each other mercilessly. \u201cWe always have a shot at each other about how you\u2019re doing this and you should be doing it a different way,\u201d says John. Not everyone would understand their jokes, particularly their colourful names for each other. \u201cIf anyone else walked in, they\u2019d look.\u201d And I\u2019d say, \u201cIt\u2019s all right, we\u2019re just mucking around.\u201d So they\u2019d still look. \u201cNo, no, seriously. That\u2019s how we talk to each other.\u201d \u201cI think laughter [is important],\u201d says Marcia. \u201cFinding someone that shares that weird sense of humour that you might have.\u201d John agrees: \u201cEveryone has their disagreements, but I would say: don\u2019t carry a grudge. I always say there\u2019s two sides to every story. No matter how bad the story is, there\u2019s still another side of it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s seriously so annoying. He\u2019s so Mr Nice Guy,\u201d Marcia jokes. But for a moment, she\u2019s serious, describing John as fair and trustworthy: \u201cHe\u2019s a very good guy. He\u2019s got some irritating faults, like I have, but on the whole, I wouldn\u2019t want to be with anyone else.\u201d We want to hear your stories about staying together.

      "body": "<p>Keir Starmer has vowed to work with Boris Johnson \u201cin the national interest\u201d to guide Britain through the mounting coronavirus outbreak, after the prime minister published a letter urging leaders of opposition parties to \u201cwork together\u201d with the government.</p> \n<p>In a phone call with the prime minister after being elected Labour leader, Starmer offered to work constructively with the prime minister and not provide \u201copposition for opposition\u2019s sake\u201d. However, with pandemic experts warning this weekend about the difficult route out of the lockdown, Starmer said he would \u201ccall out\u201d the government over failings in its strategy.</p> \n<p>Starmer has agreed to meet the prime minister this week. Johnson remained in self-isolation on Saturday with a temperature after he contracted the virus. The pledge between the party leaders came as:</p> \n<p>\u2022 Numbers of daily new cases of Covid-19 dropped from 4,450 on Friday to a total of 3,735, leading to hopes that the disease\u2019s spread could be levelling off. Total numbers of UK cases of the disease now stand at 41,903. An additional 708 people died.</p> \n<p>\u2022 It emerged that 212 patients in the Midlands have died after testing positive for coronavirus in the last 24 hours \u2013 more than London, which has been hit hardest so far, which had 127 deaths.</p> \n<p>\u2022 There were signs of a slight drop in public confidence in the government\u2019s handling of the pandemic. An Opinium poll for the <em>Observer</em> found that approval of the government\u2019s handling dropped from a net approval of +42% last week to +23% this week.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Michael Gove, the cabinet office minister, warned that there was evidence that the young were less compliant with social distancing orders, as he pleaded with the public to show \u201cself-restraint\u201d and follow the lockdown measures.</p> \n<p>\u2022 It was announced that the Queen will praise the nation for its \u201cself-discipline\u201d and \u201cresolve\u201d during the coronavirus pandemic in a rare televised address broadcast on Sunday.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The Cambridge University statistician, Sir David Speigelhalter, said the drop in the number of new cases gave grounds for optimism. \u201cI am relieved. We should be seeing a flattening of the upward curve of new cases and these figures are entirely compatible with such a trend. It looks like we are beginning to see a levelling off of the disease\u2019s spread,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>But as ministers plead with the public to stay home, there are concerns in Whitehall over maintaining the lockdown in the weeks ahead. One source said: \u201cIf numbers turn, front pages saying we\u2019re winning the war, that will be tough. Broadly at the moment, no one is going outside. If that changes, it could change quickly.\u201d</p> \n<p>There was also a warning from a leading pandemic expert that failings \u201cranging from lack of preparedness to complacency\u201d meant that there was now no alternative to building immunity in the population, either through gradual infection or vaccination \u2013 which could be more than a year away.</p> \n<p>Francois Balloux, professor of computational systems biology and the director of the University College London genetics institute, said: \u201cI personally, cannot see any viable alternative to ensuring immunity builds up in the population, through infection or vaccination.

      "bodyText": "Keir Starmer has vowed to work with Boris Johnson \u201cin the national interest\u201d to guide Britain through the mounting coronavirus outbreak, after the prime minister published a letter urging leaders of opposition parties to \u201cwork together\u201d with the government. In a phone call with the prime minister after being elected Labour leader, Starmer offered to work constructively with the prime minister and not provide \u201copposition for opposition\u2019s sake\u201d. However, with pandemic experts warning this weekend about the difficult route out of the lockdown, Starmer said he would \u201ccall out\u201d the government over failings in its strategy. Starmer has agreed to meet the prime minister this week. Johnson remained in self-isolation on Saturday with a temperature after he contracted the virus. The pledge between the party leaders came as: \u2022 Numbers of daily new cases of Covid-19 dropped from 4,450 on Friday to a total of 3,735, leading to hopes that the disease\u2019s spread could be levelling off. Total numbers of UK cases of the disease now stand at 41,903. An additional 708 people died. \u2022 It emerged that 212 patients in the Midlands have died after testing positive for coronavirus in the last 24 hours \u2013 more than London, which has been hit hardest so far, which had 127 deaths. \u2022 There were signs of a slight drop in public confidence in the government\u2019s handling of the pandemic. An Opinium poll for the Observer found that approval of the government\u2019s handling dropped from a net approval of +42% last week to +23% this week. \u2022 Michael Gove, the cabinet office minister, warned that there was evidence that the young were less compliant with social distancing orders, as he pleaded with the public to show \u201cself-restraint\u201d and follow the lockdown measures. \u2022 It was announced that the Queen will praise the nation for its \u201cself-discipline\u201d and \u201cresolve\u201d during the coronavirus pandemic in a rare televised address broadcast on Sunday. The Cambridge University statistician, Sir David Speigelhalter, said the drop in the number of new cases gave grounds for optimism. \u201cI am relieved. We should be seeing a flattening of the upward curve of new cases and these figures are entirely compatible with such a trend. It looks like we are beginning to see a levelling off of the disease\u2019s spread,\u201d he said. But as ministers plead with the public to stay home, there are concerns in Whitehall over maintaining the lockdown in the weeks ahead. One source said: \u201cIf numbers turn, front pages saying we\u2019re winning the war, that will be tough. Broadly at the moment, no one is going outside. If that changes, it could change quickly.\u201d There was also a warning from a leading pandemic expert that failings \u201cranging from lack of preparedness to complacency\u201d meant that there was now no alternative to building immunity in the population, either through gradual infection or vaccination \u2013 which could be more than a year away. Francois Balloux, professor of computational systems biology and the director of the University College London genetics institute, said: \u201cI personally, cannot see any viable alternative to ensuring immunity builds up in the population, through infection or vaccination. What is critical is to minimise hospital overload, to ensure mortality is kept as low as possible. There was a window of opportunity earlier in the Covid-19 pandemic, where it could have been controlled. We missed it, for various reasons, ranging from lack of preparedness to complacency. We should analyse our failings in the future, but now is not the time for blame.\u201d A No 10 spokesperson responded: \u201cAs set out by the prime minister, we are working to a scientifically-led, step-by-step action plan \u2013 taking the right measures at the right time.\u201d However, there is now an open debate in Whitehall and the scientific community about the best route out of the lockdown measures, which government advisers have suggested may need to be in place until the end of May. Professor Martin Hibberd, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, pointed to successful strategies employed in other countries. These have involved very large-scale testing and as much contact tracing as possible, to identify people with the virus. \u201cThis strategy was difficult to achieve at the beginning of the outbreak, because of logistic problems in testing at such a large scale and our lack of experience at large scale contact tracing,\u201d Hibberd added. \u201cHowever, we should now be able to overcome these problems.\u201d Mark Woolhouse at Edinburgh University highlighted three key strategies for dealing with the epidemic. \u201cOnce lockdown has driven down the virus to low enough levels in the community we can go back to chasing down individual cases.

The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said the three suspects were taken to Musgrave Street police station in central Belfast for questioning on Saturday evening. The PSNI also said that the murdered man was shot several times during the gun attack in the Ardoyne district around 11.50am on Saturday. A councillor whose constituency includes the Ardoyne district where the fatal shooting occurred said a number of children were playing nearby when the man was shot dead. The Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, said there was no excuse for this \u201cabhorrent and brutal crime\u201d, adding that it was \u201cparticularly thoughtless at a time when our emergency services are already working increasingly hard to keep us all safe dealing with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic\u201d. The victim was killed in the front garden of a house in Etna Drive in Ardoyne. Local sources said they did not believe the killing had a sectarian motive, and that the victim was not from the area. Paul McCusker, an SDLP councillor for north Belfast, said a number of people living in Etna Drive tried to save the victim after he was shot. \u201cOne man from Etna Drive tried to use CPR to revive him but to no avail while other neighbours in the street comforted him until the emergency services came,\u201d he said. McCusker said it was deeply disturbing that young children playing in their front gardens while locked down at home due to the coronavirus crisis may have witnessed the shooting. \u201cThis brutal crime has caused immense shock in Ardoyne. My thoughts are with this man\u2019s family at an incredibly difficult time. \u201cI also think that this will compound the already massive pressure on people living here who are having problems coping with self-isolation and lockdown,\u201d he said. Investigating officers had locked down large parts of the area surrounding the location of the shooting, he added, urging the public to cooperate with the police. A car believed to have been used in the killing was found on fire a short distance away in Ardoyne on Jamaica Street. Gerry Kelly, the Sinn F\u00e9in member of the legislative assembly for North Belfast, also condemned the shooting. \u201cI would appeal for calm at this time in the area and stress that anybody with any information about this horrific incident should bring it immediately to the PSNI,\u201d he said. \u201cActions like this have no place in our society and I repeat my condemnation of those involved. \u201cAt a time when all frontline statutory agencies and indeed communities are doing what they can to fight against Covid-19 this just adds to the suffering unfortunately being experienced by local people at this time.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Hello, Helen Sullivan with you now. We\u2019ve launched a new coronavirus pandemic live blog at the link below, where I\u2019ll be bringing you the latest news and a bit of joy, too, for the next few hours. I\u2019ll be handing over to my colleagues in Australia shortly, but here\u2019s a closing summary of the key coronavirus developments from the last few hours before I go. Dubai has entered a two week lockdown which will see just one resident per household allowed to leave... Trump has warned that the next two weeks will be the \u201ctoughest\u201d in the US\u2019s efforts to tackle coronavirus, and said he would be deploying thousands of military personnel to states to support them. New York\u2019s death toll has exceeded 3,000, almost a quarter of the US total. Two prison officers in London have become the first prison staff to die from coronavirus in the UK. Malawi\u2019s president and ministers will take a 10% salary cut and redirect funds to support the country in fighting coronavirus. A senior health official in Iran has warned that the Iranian capital could see a resurgence of coronavirus cases, after residents in Tehran flouted restrictions. Tunisia\u2019s parliament have given the government new powers to tackle coronavirus, including the ability to make decrees and seek finance without the approval of the parliament. Thank you all for your information, fact checks and many kind words over the past few hours - all are very much appreciated. Thanks for joining me, stay safe. The Municipality of Livorno in Italy has begun printing stamped and numbered food vouchers which can be obtained by submitting a self-certification. The scheme, which began on Saturday, enables those in need to claim 200-400 euros in vouchers for their shopping. Bermuda has entered two weeks of lockdown, which will see people given slots to shop according to their surnames, Bermuda\u2019s daily newspaper the Royal Gazette is reporting. Visits to grocery shops and gas stations will be organised alphabetically, with people with surnames from A to K shopping on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and those with names from L to Z on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. Sundays will be reserved for elderly people. Shoppers will need identification to prove they are attending the correct slot, and police may enforce the rules. The shopping rules will come into play on Monday, but the lockdown began on Saturday. It is now illegal in the country to enter a home which is not your own, or allow someone else into yours. A further 53 people have tested positive in North Macedonia in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of confirmed coronavirus cases to 483, media outlet MIA is reporting, citing a government press release. The current death toll is 17. Here\u2019s a wonderful photograph of neighbours in the UK social distance dancing together to keep fit during the pandemic. Queen Elizabeth is set to call on Britons to show the same resolve as their forebears and approach the challenge of the coronavirus pandemic with good humour, in a rare address to the nation on Sunday. She will thank frontline healthcare workers and recognise the pain suffered by families. The address will be her fifth in 68 years on the throne. \u201cI hope in the years to come everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge. And those who come after us will say that the Britons of this generation were as strong as any,\u201d the 93-year-old monarch will say, according to extracts released by Buckingham Palace. \u201cThat the attributes of self-discipline, of quiet good-humoured resolve and of fellow-feeling still characterise this country.\u201d Read more here: Ecuador has begun storing the bodies of those who have died from coronavirus in giant refrigerated containers, after hundreds of deaths in the city of Guayaquil, the epicentre of the country\u2019s outbreaks, have filled up morgues and hospitals. The government has installed three containers, the largest about 12 meters (40 ft) long, at public hospitals to preserve bodies until graves were prepared, according to Guayaquil\u2019s mayor, Cynthia Viteri. Ecuador\u2019s death toll is currently at 318, one of the highest tolls in Latin America. President Lenin Moreno warned this week that the real figure was higher, as authorities were collecting more than 100 bodies a day, many from relatives\u2019 homes, as a strict quarantine prevented them from being buried. Here is a brief summary of what Donald Trump said at his press briefing: He has spoken to New York governor Andrew Cuomo and is working to get additional resources to the state to help with the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cWe have given the governor of New York more than anyone has been given in a long time\u201d, and said Cuomo hasn\u2019t been \u201cgracious\u201d. \u201cI know he\u2019s grateful he just can\u2019t find the words to say it,\u201d Trump added. The next two weeks will be the toughest and Americans must expect \u201ca lot of death\u201d. Thousands of soldiers and military personnel will be sent to support states. We\u2019re going to be adding a tremendous amount of military to help,\u201d Trump said in a daily briefing with reporters.He added that 1,000 military personnel are being sent to New York City, including military doctors and nurses. He\u2019s reiterated a familiar line about his intention to open up the US as soon as possible, saying that the \u201ccure must not be worse than the problem. 29 million doses of anti-malarial drugs will be put into a strategic national stockpile for coronavirus patients. Donald Trump is currently giving a press briefing on coronavirus. You can watch it live here, and I\u2019ll post a summary afterwards. The two prisoner officers from Pentonville prison in London who have passed away after suffering from coronavirus symptoms (see 21.13) are the first prison officers to die from the virus in the UK, the Prison Officers\u2019 Association has told the Guardian. Mark Fairhurst, National Chair of the POA, told the Guardian that 7,900 prison staff, including officers, support grade staff and governors, were self isolating, and a further 15 had confirmed cases of coronavirus. He also said that 90 prisoners had been confirmed as suffering from Covid-19, with another 1,200 prisoners self-isolating. Officials from around the world have warned that they expect restrictive lockdown conditions to continue for weeks longer. You can read more from my colleague Ashifa Kassam here: Two staff members at a prison in London have died after suffering from symptoms of coronavirus, the Prison Officer\u2019s Association has said. Bovil Peter and Patrick Beckford, believed to be in their 60s, were both support staff workers at the jail. POA national chairman Mark Fairhurst said: \u201cMy thoughts and prayers are with everybody involved with these tragic deaths - two at the same prison is very concerning.\u201d Mr Fairhurst said he did not know if either of the men had any underlying health conditions. He described Mr Peter as \u201can experienced member of staff\u201d who was working at operational support grade at the prison, and \u201che died earlier this week due to Covid-19 symptoms\u201d. Mr Fairhurst added of Mr Peter\u2019s death: \u201cI just want to highlight the fact that this (Covid-19) puts us all at risk. \u201cWe are on the front line doing a commendable job on behalf of society and he will be sadly missed by all his colleagues. We wish the best for his family and friends.\u201d Albania reported 29 new cases on Saturday, their highest increase in a single day so far, bringing the total to 333. The increase comes as Albania enters its third 40-hour lockdown, intended to halt the spread of coronavirus. So far, there have been 18 deaths related to Covid-19. In Peru, the government have ordered men and women to go out separately on alternate days, as part of their efforts to combat the spread of coronavirus. On Saturday, women were allowed out. Here are some photographs from Lima. The conspiracy theory that links 5G technology to the spread of coronavirus is \u201cdangerous nonsense\u201d, a British minister said at the government\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing. The bizarre theory has led to phone masts around the UK being attacked. You can see Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove and medical director of the NHS, Stephen Powis, debunk the theory here: Algeria will extend its curfew to limit the spread of coronavirus. The curfew will last from 3pm to 7am in the capital of Algiers and eight other provinces, and from 7pm to 7am in the majority of others. The two provinces furthest south in the country currently have no confirmed cases of the virus, so will not be subject to the curfew. Algeria has recorded 1,251 cases of coronavirus. The president and ministers of Malawi will take a 10% salary cut and redirect the money towards combatting the spread of coronavirus, President Peter Mutharika has said. The announcement came in a national address on state television, which also unveiled a number of measures to protect businesses, including tax breaks, reduction in fuel allowances and an increase in the risk allowances for health workers. Donald Trump\u2019s pick for a new watchdog to oversee the $2 trillion support package, issued to combat the economic fallout of coronavirus, is not independent enough, congressional Democrats have said. Late on Friday, the White House announced that Trump would nominate Brian Miller, a special assistant to the president and senior associate counsel in the Office of White House Counsel, to the role of special inspector general for pandemic recovery. However, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement that the role must be \u201cindependent from politics\u201d and that Miller\u2019s appointment \u201cclearly fails that\u201d. Pelosi has also said she would form a bipartisan select committee on the coronavirus crisis to oversee the use of the $2 trillion approved by Congress to respond to the pandemic. Senate Democrats, including Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and the top Democratic senator on the Senate Finance Committee, also criticised the move. Democratic senator Richard Blumenthal said in a post on Twitter that the appointment was akin to putting a \u201cfox in charge of the henhouse.\u201d The new watchdog position, which comes with a $25m budget, was created to \u201cconduct, supervise, and coordinate audits and investigations of the making, purchase, management, and sale of loans, loan guarantees, and other investments\u201d by Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin. After the news broke earlier that New York is to receive 1,000 ventilators from China, my colleague Jessica Glenza in the US takes a deeper look at the donation and the situation in the state: New York City authorities must better protect corrections officers at Rikers Island jail, a judge has ruled. The ruling stated that officers must be provided with protective masks and have their temperatures monitored for signs of coronavirus. It also said there should be an increase in the sanitation of their work spaces. It comes after dozens of infections have been reported at the facility. The city has appealed the ruling - which stays the order until the appeal is heard. Nicholas Paolucci, a spokesman for the New York City Law Department, said the city is deeply concerned about the health and safety of its employees and that \u201cwe are confident that the court will recognize the steps we have taken to ensure our correctional facilities are safe.\u201d The head of the union, Elias Husamudeen, said that the union was \u201coutrageous that we even have to be in court to ensure our employer protects the lives of our members.\u201d Thanks to all those getting in touch. Just a reminder that if you spot something I miss (or get wrong!) please feel free to drop me a message on Twitter @mollyblackall. Your input is always appreciated! Confirmed cases of coronavirus in Turkey have reached 23,934, an increase of more than 3,000 since yesterday. Coronavirus-related deaths rose by 71 to 501 people, health minister Fahrettin Koca said on Twitter. In the last 24 hours, 19,664 tests were conducted bringing the total performed in Turkey so far to 161,380, Koca, said. Here are the latest figures from France, from our Paris correspondent Kim Willsher. The coronavirus death toll in France has reached 7,560 since 1 March, the health ministry has said. This figure includes hospitals and nursing homes. Of these 5,532 occurred in hospital, up from 5,091 on Friday. This is a lower increase than in previous days. The number of deaths in care homes was 2,028, up 612 from yesterday. There are now 68,606 confirmed cases in France, and 28,143 in hospital. Of these 6,838 are in intensive care units up from 6,662 the previous day. Of those in intensive care, 35% are under 60 years old, 60% are between 60 -80, 105 patients are under 30 years old). 15,438 patients have been cured. Asked if France was seeing some light at the end of the tunnel, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Salomon, head of the French health authority, said: \u201cIt is not a drop in admissions to intensive care it is a drop in the increase. \u201cThe number of people in intensive care is increasing every day, but it is a smaller increase. We are waiting for a drop in the numbers,\u201d Salomon said. \u201cWe are at the beginning of the period when we can examine the impact of the lockdown.\u201d We were told earlier that the 68,606 figure referred to confirmed cases in hospital, but my colleague Kim Willsher in France has amended this, confirming that it refers to the total confirmed cases. Apologies for any confusion - there are many different sources of information and this can make reporting difficult! More than 25 organisations helping domestic violence victims in the UK have reported an increase in their caseload since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, my colleague Mark Townsend reports. The rise in domestic abuse as a result of coronavirus is a trend sadly replicated around the world. You can read more on the situation in the UK here: The number of coronavirus related deaths in New York has passed 3,000, governor Andrew Cuomo has announced. In the last day, 630 people have died of coronavirus in the state - the highest increase so far. This takes the total death toll to 3,565. Long Island, east of New York City, is the worst hit area, Cuomo said, describing the virus there as \u201clike a fire spreading\u201d. Cuomo said that projections suggested the state was around a week away from the peak of the spread, despite only recording its first case 30 days ago. New York City alone accounted for more than a quarter of the over 7,000 U.S. coronavirus deaths tallied by Johns Hopkins University. A senior Iranian health official has said that there may be a resurgence of coronavirus in the area in and around the capital of Tehran, as residents flout restrictions. The warning came after many residents ignored advice to stay at home, with crowding and traffic jams on the city\u2019s streets as the country\u2019s New Year holidays ended on Saturday. Iran is the worst-hit country by coronavirus in the Middle East. On Saturday, the country announced 158 more coronavirus patients had died in the past 24 hours, bringing the total death toll to 3,452. The total number of cases currently stands at 55,743. \u201cWe are still concerned about the virus, for example with the level of traffic in Tehran today and queues of cars stuck on freeways, because these people can take the virus to their homes or workplaces,\u201d Deputy Health Minister Iraj Harirchi said on state TV. \u201cEven a medium level of virus here can spread to nearby cities with the high level of job-related traffic between nearby cities and Tehran,\u201d said Harirchi, who has himself had the virus. \u201cDr Harirchi cautioned about a probable return of coronavirus in case of negligence and said social distancing measures were absolutely necessary,\u201d said the TV. The television showed stores that had re-opened despite a closure order on non-essential services and businesses. Tunisia\u2019s parliament has given the government new powers to combat the spread of coronavirus and expected economic fallout. This will allow the government to issue decrees, make purchasing agreements and seek finance without consulting parliament. The decision was backed by all political parties. Tunisia has 495 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, including 18 deaths, and has imposed a national lockdown until April 19. Italy plans to extend special powers to protect key industries from unwelcome foreign interest, a government official has said. There is allegedly concern in the Italian government that foreign investors might try to take advantage of the collapse of share prices caused by the coronavirus pandemic to buy assets in Italian industries. Cabinet undersecretary Riccardo Fraccaro said on Saturday that Rome would expand its vetting powers to the whole banking and insurance sector, alongside the health and food industry. The scheme would allow the government to oppose any move by non-EU and EU players to buy a stake in companies considered to be strategically important. A draft will soon be proposed to Italy\u2019s cabinet, and measures would also apply to transactions within the EU, Fraccaro said. Since Italy imposed the first set of restrictive measures on 23 February, Milan\u2019s all-share stock index has fallen by close to 35%. Dubai has entered a two-week lockdown to limit the spread of coronavirus beginning tonight, according to state news agency WAM. Mobility will be restricted, and legal action will be taken against those who do not comply, the government has said. Supermarkets, pharmacies, alongside food and drug delivery services will continue to work as normal. Carrie Symonds, the pregnant partner of Boris Johnson, had coronavirus symptoms but is now getting better, she has revealed. The UK prime minister said on Friday he was remaining in isolation with mild symptoms of coronavirus, including a raised temperature, seven days after he first tested positive. A thousand ventilators will arrive in New York\u2019s JFK airport from China on Saturday, governor Andrew Cuomo has said. For more information, we\u2019ve compiled a video from a press conference with Cuomo: The UK government is risking losing out on an offer of 400,000 coronavirus test kits from South Korea to a rival country because they have not yet been tested by Public Health England, it has been claimed. A shareholder in the South Korean LG conglomerate has sourced the kits from five companies in the country and has offered them to the UK through a contact who was a former deputy leader of the Conservative party. Nick Markham says has has been in touch with the government but they are dragging their heels insisting they won\u2019t make a decision until the kits are tested. More coming soon ... The number of deaths from coronavirus in Italy has passed 15,000. On Saturday, the country registered 681 deaths from Covid-19 \u2013 86 less than Friday, bringing the total to 15,362. Currently, 88,274 are infected, with an increase of 2,886 new cases, 547 more than Friday. At this point 1,238 have recovered, bringing the total number to 20,996. The civil protection announced that more than 70 people had been discharged from intensive care in the last 24 hours, a daily record since the beginning of the outbreak. In total, 124,632 people have tested positive with coronavirus in Italy, including people who have died, recovered and the ones who are currently infected. On Friday, Giuseppe Conte, the Italian prime minister, wrote to Ursula von der Leyen, the European commission president, calling on the EU to be bolder as it faces up to the coronavirus emergency. \u201cEuropean solidarity has not been felt and there is no more time to waste,\u201d reads the letter, published by Italian daily La Repubblica. \u201cIt is time to show more ambition, more unity and more courage.\u201d Lockdown in the country could be extended until 1 May and \u201cphase two\u201d of living with the virus can begin in mid-May, emergency commissioner Angelo Borrelli said on Friday. The government has officially extended the coronavirus lockdown until mid-April, but Borrelli stressed the importance of keeping to \u201cthe most rigorous conduct in observing lockdown rules\u201d. The number of coronavirus cases in Canada has risen to 12,924, up from 11,747 yesterday. There have been 214 recorded deaths. On 3 April, there were 152. These figures are coming from Reuters, using the Canadian Public Health Agency\u2019s data. Twenty doctors from Ukraine flew to Italy on Saturday to support medical efforts against coronavirus, and to learn from frontline workers to prepare for the outbreak in Ukraine. A team including surgeons, neurosurgeons, anaesthesiologists and nurses will be deployed to Marche in central Italy for two weeks. At Kiev airport, before the medical mission\u2019s departure, Davide La Cecilia, Italian ambassador to Ukraine, said: \u201cThe national health service in our country is very stressed. So we badly need medical personnel and are very happy that Ukraine is sending this humanitarian aid.\u201d Thirteen people have died in a care home in Scotland of suspected coronavirus. The deaths at Burlington Care Home in Glasgow are not recorded in the official death toll, as that figure includes only hospital deaths. The Scottish government is going to be including deaths in the community from Monday. Cats have been infected with coronavirus in Wuhan, and can get the virus from close contact with humans, Chinese state media is reporting. According to a new report, 15 of the serum samples of 102 cats collected in Wuhan, where the virus originated, tested positive for coronavirus. In 11 of the 15 positive tests, neutralising antibodies for coronavirus were found. Three of the samples from cats whose owners had coronavirus had a higher number of neutralising antibodies, which indicates the cats may have been infected from close contact with their owners, the report suggests. The report was published by researchers at the Huazhong Agricultural University and the Wuhan Institute of Virology, and the findings have been reported in China\u2019s Global Times. Here\u2019s a summary of the key points from Michael Gove in the UK\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing. I\u2019ll be updating this as the briefing goes on, so do refresh your screens. Ventilators British manufacturers are working with the government to produce ventilators. A team from University College London, working with Mercedes-Benz have produced a new device that has been clinically approved. Gove said 200 were produced yesterday, with a further 200 to be produced today and tomorrow. This will increase to 1,000 a day next week. Three-hundred have arrived today from China. There are 8,000 ventilators in the NHS at the moment. Frontline staff Seven healthcare professionals in the UK have now died from coronavirus. Yesterday, 10,984 tests were administered to NHS staff. Hospital admissions In London, hospital admissions fell slightly between 1 and 2 April, but have gone up in other areas. Admissions are steady in Wales. Hospital admissions have gone up 35% in Yorkshire and the north-east. In the Midlands, they have gone up by 47%. Death toll 708 people have been recorded as dying from coronavirus since yesterday, the highest daily total so far. This is an increase of 20%. 637 of these were in England. In England, the youngest of the daily rise was aged five years old, and the eldest 104. Of these, 40 had no known underlying health conditions, and this group were aged between 48 and 93. Wales has recorded 154 deaths and Scotland, 218 and Northern Ireland, 56. This brings the national death toll to 4,313 - important to remember that this is only the number of deaths in hospitals. Coronavirus deaths in English hospitals made up 3,939 of the UK\u2019s total. Schools School attendance is at just 2% in the UK at the moment. Gove said that the government would be doing more to help children eligible for free school meals and those in need during the Easter holiday and beyond. In the UK, Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, is leading the UK\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing. You can follow live updates on our UK blog, where my colleague Lucy Campbell is monitoring the briefing. I\u2019ll be adding a summary of the briefing here, when it\u2019s finished. Hi everyone, I\u2019m Molly Blackall, taking over the liveblog from Sarah Marsh. I\u2019ll be bringing you all the key developments in the coronavirus pandemic from around the world for the next few hours. If you spot anything I miss, feel free to drop me a message on Twitter, @mollyblackall. I won\u2019t be able to respond to everything, but I\u2019ll certainly try to read it all. Thanks in advance! I am going to be handing over the blog now to my colleague Molly Blackall who will be running it for the next few hours. Thanks for all your contributions today, it always makes the job a bit easier. Egypt\u2019s main cancer treatment facility has 17 cases of the novel coronavirus among its medical staff, an educational institute said, sparking fears of exposure among vulnerable patients. Cairo University, with which the National Cancer Institute is affiliated, said in a statement on Saturday that \u201c17 doctors and nurses\u201d at the NCI had contracted Covid-19. The university said it would open an investigation \u201cto determine whether there was any negligence\u201d at the institute. Earlier in the day, the NCI director, Hatem Abulkassem, had told a private TV channel that three doctors and 12 nurses were infected. Abulkassem said the facility would be sterilised and patients who were in contact with the medics would be tested, along with all staff members. He said patient visits had been suspended in recent weeks. In the UK, number of councils are banning funeral ceremonies because of the coronavirus crisis. Bradford, Leeds and Kirklees councils have said families will no longer be able to attend services at crematoria. Instead the councils will offer \u201cdirect cremations\u201d, in which there is no ceremony and mourners are not present; and burial services at gravesides, with a maximum of 10 mourners observing physical distancing guidelines. The new rules will take effect from Monday in Kirklees and Bradford. Leeds has been offering direct cremations only for the past two week. Read the full article here. Hello everyone. I will be on the live blog for the next hour, so please do get in touch if you want to share any news tips with me, or information about what\u2019s happening where you are. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Iran\u2019s new cases of coronavirus have dropped for the fourth consecutive day, official figures released today show, as a two-week holiday in the Islamic republic came to an end. Iran registered 2,560 new infections of Covid-19 in the previous 24 hours, the health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour told a televised news conference. It is the fourth consecutive drop in new cases since Tehran declared a daily total of 3,111 on 31 March. Jahanpour said there were 158 new fatalities from the virus, bringing the country\u2019s official death toll to 3,452. Iran is one of the countries hardest hit by the pandemic, with 55,743 officially declared cases, though there has been speculation abroad that the real number could be higher. Saturday should have marked a return to regular activity in Iran after a two-week holiday for the Persian New Year. But in the capital, Tehran, many shops were still closed, Agence France-Presse reporters said. Iraj Harirchi, a deputy health minister who tested positive for the virus in late February and has returned to public life, told state television on Saturday that \u201cthe increase in traffic in Tehran is worrying\u201d. President Hassan Rouhani on Thursday warned that the country might still battle the pandemic for another year. The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, has said he had a telephone conversation with the US president, Donald Trump, about using the two countries\u2019 partnership to tackle the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cWe had a good discussion, and agreed to deploy the full strength of the India-US partnership to fight Covid-19,\u201d Modi said in a tweet. I am back from lunch and with some nice news. The National Orchestra of France has been posting its performances to YouTube while players are confined to their homes under lockdown measures to stop the spread of coronavirus. Using video and audio technology, the musicians recorded themselves playing Bolero alone at home but together online. Confirmed coronavirus cases in Portugal pushed past the 10,000 mark on Saturday, Reuters reports, as the country\u2019s health minister said there was still \u201cno light at the end of the tunnel\u201d. Marta Temido told a news conference: This fight is not a 100 metre race, it is a long marathon. This is the time to balance fear and courage, courage to stay home, to continue helping others, to ask for help when we need it. Portugal has confirmed 10,524 coronavirus cases and 266 deaths, with health authorities expecting the outbreak to plateau at the end of May. Portugal extended its state of emergency by another 15 days on Thursday, and tightened measures to restrict movements, especially during the normally busy Easter holiday period. Sky News is reporting that the British retailer Cath Kidston \u2013 famous for its vintage floral designs \u2013 has filed a notice of intention to appoint administrators as part of its attempt to find a buyer. The move does not mean it will automatically fall into administration, but it gives the company breathing space as it tries to secure a sale. Many retailers are battling for survival in the UK after the coronavirus pandemic forced the closure of most stores. Guardian reporters have looked at how the Indian prime minister\u2019s handling of the pandemic has heaped more misery on the country\u2019s poorest citizens. For more than a decade, Begum Jan had managed to survive on the streets of Kolkata. A longtime wheelchair-user, she had a specific spot on a busy street. Rickshaw drivers and passers-by always made sure she had something to eat. But last week, for the first time since she became homeless after falling ill with tuberculosis and losing her job as a housemaid, the 62-year-old was in danger of starving. \u201cFor the past week, none of these people who usually help me have come in sight,\u201d she said, her voice cracking with sadness. \u201cThey are all at home because of the lockdown; they don\u2019t have any job and so they cannot help me any more.\u201d The Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, will ask parliament to extend lockdown measures by 15 more days until 26 April as the number of daily coronavirus infections and deaths slowed again on Saturday in one of the world\u2019s most hard-hit countries. After speaking to Sanchez by telephone, the opposition leader Pablo Casado tweeted that the premier had informed him \u201cthat he will request Congress to extend the state of emergency\u201d for the second time. It was last extended through to 11 April. A government spokeswoman said Sanchez would announce the extension of the state of emergency, which has confined most Spaniards to their homes for three weeks already, at a news conference on Saturday afternoon. Spain\u2019s death toll rose to 11,744 on Saturday \u2013 the world\u2019s second highest after Italy \u2013 but the 809 people who died from the disease over the past 24 hours was below Friday\u2019s 932 and down from Thursday\u2019s record of 950, the health ministry said. That represented a 7% increase in total deaths, about a third of the near 20% increase registered a week ago. In the 24 hours to 5pm UK time on Friday, the UK recorded 708 hospital coronavirus deaths, a rise of 20% to 4,313, the health ministry said. As of 9am on Saturday, a total of 183,190 people have been tested, of which 41,903 tested positive, the ministry said. I am going to be taking a lunch break and will return shortly. A colleague will take over in the meantime. The United Arab Emirates has requested to postpone the start of the Expo 2020 Dubai until October next year because of the coronavirus pandemic, the body that oversees the world fair said. Dubai, the UAE city-state, had hoped to attract 25 million visitors to the multibillion-dollar, six-month event, which was due to launch on 20 October 2020. \u201cThe government of the United Arab Emirates has formally requested the postponement of World Expo 2020 Dubai,\u201d the Paris-based Bureau International des Expositions said in a statement. \u201cFollowing consultations with the BIE, participating countries and key stakeholders, the UAE has proposed 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2022 as the new opening dates of Expo 2020 Dubai.\u201d The UAE government also requested approval to continue using Expo 2020 Dubai as the event\u2019s official name. Saudi authorities announced a lockdown and a partial curfew in seven neighbourhoods of the Red Sea city of Jeddah, starting on Saturday, as part of measures to contain the new coronavirus outbreak, the interior ministry said in a statement. The ministry said residents in those neighbourhoods could only go out for grocery shopping and medical care, between 6 a.m (0300 GMT) and 3pm. Entering and exiting the neighbourhoods will be restricted, it added. In the UK, Newcastle defender Danny Rose says footballers feel their \u201cbacks are against the wall\u201d over talks about wage cuts, with Premier League clubs due to speak with players\u2019 representatives on Saturday. Top-flight players, currently out of action because of the coronavirus pandemic, have come under fire after a number of clubs furloughed non-playing staff but left players\u2019 wages untouched. The Premier League said on Friday that clubs would consult players over a combination of pay cuts and deferrals amounting to 30% of their annual salary. They also agreed to provide a \u00a3125m ($153m) fund for the English Football League and National League and pledged \u00a320m in charitable support for the NHS and other groups.

Apologies if I cannot respond to you all but some of your emails are very heartening, so keep them coming. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Germany\u2019s confirmed coronavirus cases have risen by 6,082 in the past 24 hours, a slight decrease from the day before, according to data from the government\u2019s Robert Koch Institute (RKI). The reported reduction, which were down from 6,174 new cases a day earlier, could be a sign that the rate of infection is beginning to level off. However, the government cautioned it was far too early to identify a trend. Germany now has 85,778 cases, up from 79,696 infections on Friday, with the highest level of infections in Bavaria, according to the RKI statistics. Deaths have increased to 1,158, the RKI said, from 1,017 deaths as of Friday. Lothar Wieler, president of the RKI, said late on Friday that the rate of new infections had been brought under control thanks to more comprehensive measures to stop people from congregating in public or at work. Chancellor Angela Merkel said the national lockdown could nonetheless stretch beyond Easter, but that the new figures gave cause for \u201cvery cautious hope\u201d. \u201cThe rise in confirmed new cases is going a bit slower than a few days ago,\u201d she added. \u201cBut it is definitively way too early to identify a trend and therefore it is also too early to ease some of the strict rules we have set for ourselves.\u201d Pedro Sanchez, the prime minister of Spain, will extend the state of emergency in the country with Europe\u2019s highest number of coronavirus infections by another two weeks until 26 April, El Pa\u00eds newspaper has reported. Indonesia said coronavirus cases in the country had topped 2,000 and deaths risen to 191, but doubts have been raised over official figures by data showing a big jump in funerals last month in the capital, Jakarta. Achmad Yurianto, health ministry official, said there had been 106 new confirmed infections, taking the total number of cases in the south-east Asian country to 2,092, with 10 new deaths. \u201cWe are still on high alert over infections that are taking place in the community that are caused by positive cases among people who are not showing symptoms,\u201d he said. Indonesia is relying mainly on social distancing policies to combat the virus since President Joko Widodo has opposed the harsh lockdown measures adopted in many neighbouring countries. The country reported its first case of the virus a month ago, but epidemiologists say a relatively low level of testing means the number of cases may be vastly under-reported. Jakarta has been at the centre of Covid-19 infections in Indonesia, accounting for 1,028 cases and about 90 deaths, according to central government data, or roughly half the country\u2019s total for both. Jakarta\u2019s governor, Anies Baswedan, and some public health experts suspect the number of infections and deaths in the city has been significantly under-reported. \u201cIt is extremely disturbing,\u201d Baswedan told Reuters on Friday, referring to the funeral statistics. \u201cI\u2019m struggling to find another reason than unreported Covid-19 deaths.\u201d In a complex of holiday bungalows to the east of Madrid, Venezuelan refugees and homeless people have replaced the tourists, business meetings and wedding parties that usually fill the premises. The owner of the La Ciguena resort has turned the facility over to some of Madrid\u2019s most vulnerable families, after he had to close the hotel because of the coronavirus outbreak sweeping through Spain. \u201cSince we\u2019ve arrived, they\u2019ve attended to our every need,\u201d said Stephanie Paez, an eight-month pregnant Venezuelan refugee accompanied by her partner and mother. She said her aim was to find a job, an apartment and get her residency papers once the coronavirus crisis was over. Spain is in strict lockdown as it battles one of the world\u2019s worst coronavirus outbreaks. The country\u2019s death toll has surpassed 11,000, second only to Italy. Bars, restaurants and shops selling non-essential items are closed. I am running the Guardian\u2019s live feed, updating you on global stories. If you feel you have something useful to share with me then please get in touch. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com The daily pace of new coronavirus infections and deaths in Spain slowed again on Saturday as prime minister Pedro Sanchez was expected to announce a new extension to lockdown measures that have confined most people to their homes for three weeks. The total death toll rose to 11,744 \u2013 the world\u2019s second highest \u2013 on Saturday, from 10,935 the day before, the health ministry said, representing a 7% increase in total deaths after a 9% rise on Friday. That is less than half the pace of the about 20% increase registered a week ago. A total of 809 people died from the disease in the past 24 hours, down from Friday\u2019s 932 and Thursday\u2019s daily record of 950, the figures showed. Meanwhile, the total number of registered infections rose to 124,736 on Saturday from 117,710 on Friday, when Spain overtook Italy in the total number of infections for the first time. In a press conference on Friday, Salvador Illa, the health minister, said Sanchez would call opposition leaders after a meeting of his coronavirus task force on Saturday to let them know his decision on extending the lockdown from the current end date of 13 April. Health officials say the slowdown in new infections proves the effectiveness of the lockdown in place. China\u2019s south-western Guangxi region, which has borders with Vietnam, has suspended cross-border passenger transportation and restricted exit of citizens from the country amid concerns of an increase in imported coronavirus cases. It has closed most ports except for a few being used for freight transportation, the Guangxi health commission said in a statement late on Friday. Kuwait recorded its first death from the coronavirus outbreak, state news agency KUNA reported, citing a health ministry spokesman. The total number of people diagnosed with the disease increased by 62 in the past 24 hours to 479 cases, he said, according to KUNA. Iran\u2019s death toll from the coronavirus outbreak climbed to 3,452 on Saturday, with 158 more fatalities recorded over the past 24 hours, health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpur said. The total number of cases diagnosed with the disease reached 55,743, of whom 4,103 are in critical condition, he said on state TV. Iran is the country worst affected by the pandemic in the Middle East. In the UK, Cheltenham festival organisers have defended their decision to go ahead with the horse racing event last month after fears were raised that the mass gathering helped spread coronavirus. More than 250,000 racegoers attended the four-day National Hunt event even though other large sporting events were cancelled shortly afterwards. A number of people reported on social media that they attended the festival only to go on and develop symptoms of Covid-19. However, organisers said they had complied with the government guidance at the time. A spokesman for Cheltenham Racecourse said: \u201cThe festival concluded three weeks ago and went ahead under the government\u2019s ongoing guidance throughout, like other popular sports events at Twickenham, Murrayfield, 10 Premier League matches and the Uefa Champions League at Anfield that same week.\u201d Hope everyone is doing ok today.

Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Donald Trump has said he will probably not wear a protective face mask despite his administration encouraging people in the US to do so in public to prevent spreading the coronavirus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued new guidance for people to wear bandanas, T-shirts and other cloth-based coverings in crowded areas, particularly in hotspots. Spain\u2019s death toll from the coronavirus rose to 11,744 on Saturday from 10,935 the previous day, the health ministry said. However, it marks the second straight day in which the number of new deaths has fallen. A total of 809 people died from the disease over the past 24 hours, down from 932 in the previous period, the figures showed. The total number of registered infections rose to 124,736 on Saturday from 117,710 on Friday, the ministry said. An interesting article today from Tom Phillips on the connection between Covid-19 and Brazil\u2019s globe-trotting elite, highlighting the gulf between rich and poor in one of world\u2019s most unequal societies. Spain\u2019s coronavirus cases have risen to 124,736, up from 117,710 on Friday, the health ministry said. Elsewhere, in Iran the death toll from coronavirus reached 3,452, officials have said. China came to a standstill on Saturday to mourn patients and medical staff killed by the coronavirus, as the world\u2019s most populous country observed a three-minute silence. Indonesia reported 106 new confirmed infections on Saturday, taking the total number of cases in the south-east Asian country to 2,092. Health ministry official Achmad Yurianto also said there were 10 new deaths, taking the death toll to 191. Elsewhere, Malaysia has reported 150 new coronavirus cases, with 3,483 in total and four new deaths. Britain will not be able to relax its stringent lockdown rules until the end of May, a leading government adviser has said, warning that first the spread of coronavirus must slow and intense testing must be introduced. The Philippines health ministry on Saturday reported 76 additional coronavirus infections and eight new deaths. At least 15 medics in Egypt\u2019s main cancer hospital have been quarantined after testing positive for the coronavirus, officials have said. A 79-year-old woman who tested positive for the coronavirus died in Georgia on Saturday, the presiding doctor at the clinic where she was treated said, reporting the country\u2019s first death related to the pandemic. The patient had other illnesses and underlying conditions. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, has invited the leaders of the opposition parties to work with him to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, saying he wants to hear their views and update them on the measures taken so far. Johnson said he would invite all opposition leaders to a briefing next week with the UK government\u2019s chief medical officer and chief scientific adviser. In the UK, doctors have expressed concern about cancer patients missing out on vital treatment due to the coronavirus outbreak. Indonesia reported 106 new confirmed coronavirus infections on Saturday, taking the total number of cases in the south-east Asian country to 2,092. Health ministry official Achmad Yurianto also said there were 10 new deaths, taking the death toll to 191. Elsewhere, Malaysia has reported 150 new coronavirus cases, with 3,483 in total and four new deaths. In France, amid lockdown, charity workers are preparing more than a thousand meals a day for migrants and homeless people on the half-abandoned grounds of a former Paris hospital whose patron saint was devoted to the poor. The Frances Aurore Association, a charity dating back to the 19th century, has been serving meals at the former St Vincent de Paul hospital since 24 March, a week into the nationwide confinement to stem the spread of the virus. Florie Gaillard, who works for the association, said everyone who lives in the transitional housing is under confinement there, the offices are closed, and the usual crowd at the day centre is in shelters. But the need is still there. There was an entire informal economy that existed before that is no longer there, said Gaillard. People who begged, or who knew which restaurant would give them a meal at the end of the evening, were in need. Anyone in need of a boost? As the world battles the coronavirus pandemic, communities are coming together to support each other through difficult times. From dressing up as Spider-Man to leaving out food for strangers, here are some of the small things people are doing to keep each other\u2019s spirits up. Scarce supplies of medical equipment are leading to growing competition within the US and among nations, in what one French politician called a worldwide treasure hunt. The governor of New York state, thecentre of the US outbreak, vowed to seize unused ventilators from private hospitals and companies, while President Donald Trump said he was preventing the export of N95 respirator masks and surgical gloves, a move he said was necessary to ensure medical supplies are available in the US. The number of people infected in the US exceeded 250,000, and the death toll climbed past 7,000, with New York state alone accounting for more than 2,900 dead, an increase of more than 560 in just one day. Most of the dead are in New York City, where hospitals are swamped with patients. Sharing a beautiful article written by my colleague and friend Haroon Siddique, one of our senior reporters. He wrote about his dad, who died last week after being admitted to hospital with coronavirus symptoms. Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s global live feed, bringing you all the latest updates of the day on coronavirus from around the world. Please do share your thoughts, news tips or relevant insight and information from where you are with me. I will try to respond to as many of you as I can. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com South Korea has expanded a social distancing campaign by another two weeks to April 19 to stop the spread of the coronavirus. More than 10,000 cases have been reported in South Korea. At one point, it had the second-worst outbreak of Covid-19 after mainland China, but it has brought it largely under control. Still, the government has said it needs to maintain social distancing measures to avoid another spike in infections. \u201cWe have no choice but to continue an intense social distancing campaign for some time,\u201d the prime minister, Chung Sye-kyun, said. Britain will not be able to relax its stringent lockdown rules until the end of May, a leading government adviser has said, warning that first the spread of coronavirus must slow and intense testing must be introduced. Neil Ferguson, a leading professor of mathematical biology at Imperial College London, said work was under way to establish how the rules could eventually be relaxed. Speaking to BBC Radio, he said. We want to move to a situation where at least by the end of May we\u2019re able to substitute some less intensive measures, more based on technology and testing, for the complete lockdown we have now. There is a great deal of work under way to look at how we can substitute some of the very intense social distancing currently in place with a regime more based on intensive testing, very rapid access to testing, tracing of contacts. But in order to substitute that regime for what we\u2019re doing now, we need to get case numbers down. The government has put Britain into a widespread lockdown, closing pubs, restaurants and nearly all shops, while banning social gatherings and ordering people to stay at home unless it is absolutely essential to venture out. By Friday, Britain\u2019s death toll from the global pandemic had risen to 3,605, among 38,168 people who have tested positive for the highly infectious respiratory illness known as Covid-19. The Philippines health ministry on Saturday reported 76 additional coronavirus infections and eight new deaths. In a bulletin, the health ministry said a total of 144 people have died in the Philippines while 3,094 have been infected, the majority of whom were reported in the past four weeks. Australia reported a sustained fall in new coronavirus infections and conducted the biggest peacetime maritime operation on Sydney Harbour on Saturday, refuelling foreign cruise ships before expelling them from local waters. Confirmed cases rose by 198 over the 24-hour period to Saturday afternoon, bringing the national total to 5,548, health ministry data showed. The death toll from Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus, rose to 30. That kept the country\u2019s daily new infection rate at about 5%, significantly below the 25%-30% increases recorded around two weeks ago, but officials stressed it was still too early to claim victory. \u201cWhat I really would caution against is thinking we have got through this completely, because we definitely have not,\u201d the deputy chief health officer, Paul Kelly, said in a televised briefing. \u201cWe really have to be hyper-vigilant now.\u201d China came to a standstill on Saturday to mourn patients and medical staff killed by the coronavirus, as the world\u2019s most populous country observed a nationwide three-minute silence. At 10am Beijing time, citizens paused; cars, trains and ships sounded their horns; and air-raid sirens rang out in memory of the more than 3,000 lives claimed by the virus in China. In Wuhan \u2013 the city where the virus first emerged late last year \u2013 sirens and horns sounded as people fell silent in the streets. Staff at the Tongji hospital stood outside with heads bowed towards the main building, some in the protective hazmat suits that have become a symbol of the crisis worldwide. \u201cI feel a lot of sorrow about our colleagues and patients who died,\u201d Xu, a nurse at Tongji who worked on the frontlines treating coronavirus patients, told Agence France-Presse, holding back tears. \u201cI hope they can rest well in heaven.\u201d Britain may be able to relax some physical distancing measures by the end of May if the spread of the coronavirus eases and testing increases, a leading professor of mathematical biology at Imperial College London said on Saturday. In England, cancer treatment has become a postcode lottery, with many patients not receiving vital care as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, according to leading doctors. It comes as the NHS said non-urgent operations would have to be put on hold so hospitals could focus on battling the Covid-19 pandemic, and NHS England guidance states that cancer services should continue to deliver care. However, it also calls for \u201clocal solutions to continue the proper managements\u201d. Prof Karol Sikora, the chief medical officer at Rutherford Health, which runs oncology centres, said the advice provided by NHS England around cancer was sensible but was being \u201cimplemented inconsistently\u201d around the country. \u201cThat is always the trouble \u2013 it becomes inconsistent, so people getting chemotherapy have now had it stopped even though they are category one and two patients, the highest priority. Also, some hospitals have put blanket bans on cancer treatment for two to three weeks ... Not everyone needs to rush ahead with cancer treatment but others need to continue despite this to get the best long-term cure,\u201d he said. Angus George Dalgleish, a professor of oncology at St George\u2019s, University of London, said: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult. Coronavirus is having a devastating impact on how we deliver ordinary care \u2013 everything is out on hold or delayed.\u201d Asked whether this could mean more indirect deaths because of patients not getting care, Dalgleish said: \u201cWe won\u2019t know until it is all over. But we are already seeing the effects of patients who are not going to get treatment. \u201cI heard today St George\u2019s is going to have nine wards full of coronavirus patients. They cannot do that without seriously impacting care of everyone else.\u201d Read more here. At least 15 medics in Egypt\u2019s main cancer hospital have been quarantined after testing positive for the coronavirus, officials have said. The news raises fears the pandemic could prey on health facilities in the Arab world\u2019s most populous country. Egypt has reported around 1,000 confirmed cases and 66 fatalities from the global pandemic. Authorities have closed schools and mosques, banned public gatherings and imposed a night-time curfew to prevent the virus from spreading among the population of 100 million, a fifth of whom live in the densely populated capital, Cairo. Dr Hatem Abu el-Kassem, the director of the National Cancer Institute, said three doctors and 12 nurses had tested positive for the virus. He said all other health workers at the facility, which treats hundreds of cancer patients every day, would be tested. The institute will be partly closed for three days to be sterilised, with only the emergency ward remaining open. Hello everyone. I am taking over the Guardian\u2019s global live feed and, as ever, getting your help to cover the latest information is key. So if you have any news tips or insight from where you are then please do get in touch via any of the channels below. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Here\u2019s a summary of the latest events: People across China paused for three-minutes at 10am Beijing time to remember the more than 3,000 patients and medical workers who have died during the country\u2019s coronavirus outbreak. Citizens stood still, cars, trains and ships sounded their horns, and air-raid sirens rung out. Saturday has been declared a day of mourning. The country reported 19 new cases on Friday, most of which were linked to foreign travel. The World Bank Group president, David Malpass, said the rapidly spreading pandemic was expected to cause a \u201cmajor global recession\u201d that would be likely to hit the poorest and most vulnerable countries the hardest. Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan, has said he faces a stark choice between a lockdown to stop or slow an outbreak, and the need to protect the economy to ensure \u201cpeople don\u2019t die of hunger\u201d. Health officials in the US advised Americans to cover their faces when outside. But the president, Donald Trump, has undermined the guidance, saying: \u201cI\u2019m choosing not to do it.\u201d Melania Trump later urged people to take the official advice seriously. South Korea said it will extend a ban on sports, religious and other gatherings until daily cases drop down to 50 or fewer, a number that officials believe the health system will be able to manage. You can also read a full summary of recent developments here. I\u2019m now handing over to my colleague Sarah Marsh. Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan, has said that while educational institutions and shopping malls will remain closed to prevent the spread of coronavirus, the construction sector will open again. Khan said he faced a stark choice between a lockdown to stop or slow an outbreak, and protecting the economy to ensure \u201cpeople don\u2019t die of hunger\u201d. Many celebrities and news outlets in China have toned down the colours on their social media profiles, as the country holds a day of mourning to remember those who have died in the coronavirus outbreak. Today also marks the start of the annual Qingming tomb-sweeping festival, when millions of Chinese families often travel to pay their respects to their ancestors. But in Wuhan, the city where the outbreak began, all tomb-sweeping activities have been banned until at least the end of the month, and many are still in lockdown. Instead authorities have encouraged people to watch cemetery staff carrying out the task through online streaming services. On pavements and in housing compounds, some residents burned joss paper, a tradition believed to send money and wealth to deceased relatives, Reuters reported. Earlier today, people across China stopped for three minutes to pay tribute to those who have died in the country\u2019s coronavirus outbreak. Citizens stood still, while cars sounded their horns, and air-raid sirens rang out. Here is some footage of the moment people paused to remember the more than 3,000 lives lost. Thailand has said that it will temporarily ban all incoming passenger flights, and that anyone whose flight took off before the ban is imposed will need to be quarantined for 14 days upon arrival. The suspension of flights - which will come into effect from Saturday morning, and be lifted late on Monday - will cause further misery for Thais stuck abroad. It is also likely to create more complications for stranded tourists who are attempting to leave Thailand. Thailand, which has reported 1,978 cases of the coronavirus and 19 deaths, is attempting to reduce the risk of imported cases. Here\u2019s a bit more detail on South Korea, which announced earlier that it would be extending its social distancing rules. High-risk facilities have been closed and religious, sports and entertainment gatherings banned for the past 15 days. The health minister said this morning that these measures will remain in place until daily cases drop down to 50 or lower - a number that officials believe the health system will be able to manage. Health Minister Park Neung-hoo told reporters: Our goal is to be able to control infections in a way that our health and medical system, including personnel and sickbeds, can handle them at usual level. If the number goes down to 50 or lower, stable treatment of the patients including the critically ill will be possible without much pressure on the system.\u201d The country has largely managed to bring under control what records suggest is Asia\u2019s largest epidemic outside China, and has been praised for its use of mass testing. The country now records around 100 or fewer new daily cases. Smaller outbreaks in churches, hospitals and nursing homes, as well as infections among travellers, continue to emerge. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported 94 new cases on Saturday, taking the national tally to 10,156. The death toll rose by three to 177, while more than 300 recovered from the virus for a total of 6,325. The singer Pink said that she has recently recovered from Covid-19, and announced that she is donating $500,000 each to two emergency funds helping tackle the outbreak. In a statement posted on Twitter, she said that she had accessed a test through her family\u2019s primary healthcare physician two weeks ago. \u201cIt is an absolute travesty and failure of our government to not make testing more widely accessible. This illness is serious and real,\u201d she wrote. She thanked health care workers and everyone around the world who is working hard to protect loved ones. She added that she will donate $500,000 each to the Temple University Hospital Fund in Philadelphia and the COVID-19 response fund run by the Mayor\u2019s Fund for Los Angeles Here\u2019s a summary of the latest events: People across China people paused for three-minutes at 10am Beijing time to remember the more than 3,000 patients and medical workers who have died during the country\u2019s coronavirus outbreak. Citizens stood still, cars, trains and ships sounded their horns, and air-raid sirens rung out. Saturday has been declared a day of mourning in the country. The country reported 19 new cases on Friday, most of which were linked to foreign travel. World Bank Group president David Malpass said the rapidly spreading pandemic was expected to cause a \u201cmajor global recession\u201d that would likely hit the poorest and most vulnerable countries the hardest. Health officials in the US advised Americans to cover their faces when outside. But the US president Donald Trump has undermined the guidance, saying: \u201cI\u2019m choosing not to do it.\u201d Melania Trump later urged people to take the official advice seriously. South Korea, which has been successful in containing a major outbreak, has said it will extend a ban on sports, religious and other gatherings. Prime minister Chung Sye-kyun cited concerns over imported cases and new outbreaks that continue to occur in small clusters. US attorney general William Barr has ordered release of more federal inmates due to coronavirus pandemic, warning that the federal Bureau of Prisons is facing emergency conditions. Thousands of people have been detained across Central America for violating rules put in place by their governments to curb the coronavirus transmission. Mexico\u2019s health ministry said 10 more people have died after becoming infected. The European Union\u2019s top diplomat has said sanctions should not stop the delivery of medical supplies to countries battling outbreaks. US attorney general William Barr has ordered release of more federal inmates due to coronavirus pandemic, warning that the federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) is facing emergency conditions. Barr said under his emergency order, priority for releasing vulnerable inmates into home confinement should be given first to those housed in federal prisons that have been hardest hit by COVID-19, including facilities such as Oakdale in Louisiana, Elkton in Ohio and Danbury in Connecticut. Barr\u2019s order comes after five inmates at FCI Oakdale 1 and two at FCI Elkton 1 died from COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus. The BOP said Friday that 91 inmates and 50 of its staff throughout its 122 institutions have fallen ill with COVID-19, though reports suggest the numbers affected is much higher. Thousands of people have been detained across Central America for violating rules put in place by their governments to curb the coronavirus transmission, Reuters has reported. Central America is home to a large, poor population with no options to work from home, take paid sick leave or observe social distancing rules because they work in the informal economy and live in crowded conditions. Honduran authorities said about 2,250 people have been arrested for violating the curfew imposed since mid-March while Guatemalan authorities said 5,705 people had been detained for leaving their homes without justification. In Panama, more than 5,000 people have been detained in recent weeks for violating curfew rules; another 424 people have been detained for not complying with recent rules that limit men and women leaving the house to alternate days. Meanwhile, in El Salvador, 712 people have been detained for failing to comply with the mandatory home quarantine decreed by President Nayib Bukele, and have been taken to containment centers. Here is some footage from China\u2019s state broadcaster CCTV, shared by Global Times, taken as the country observed a three-minute pause to remember the more than 3,000 lives lost during the coronavirus outbreak. It is now 10am in Beijing and across China people have paused for three-minutes to remember the patients and medical workers who died in the coronavirus outbreak. Citizens will stop still, cars, trains and ships will sound their horns, and air-raid sirens will ring out in memory of the more than 3,000 lives lost. In Wuhan, where the outbreak began, all traffic lights in urban areas will be turned red for three minutes. The city of 11 million was the hardest hit by the outbreak, recording 2,567 fatalities. This accounts for more than three quarters of China\u2019s coronavirus deaths. Across China people will soon observe a three-minute pause to mourn the patients and medical staff killed by the coronavirus. The country will pause at 10am Beijing time. Saturday has been declared a day of mourning across the country, where flags are flying at half-mast, and all public events and entertainment have been stopped. It coincides with the start of the annual Qingming tomb-sweeping festival, when millions of Chinese families pay respects to their ancestors. As of Friday, the total number of nationally confirmed cases stood at 81,639, including 19 new infections, the National Health Commission said. Eighteen of the new cases involved travellers arriving from abroad. South Korea has said it will extend its intensive social distancing campaign, citing concerns over imported cases and new outbreaks that continue to occur in small clusters, Reuters has reported. The country has largely managed to bring under control Asia\u2019s largest epidemic outside China with around 100 or fewer new daily cases. But smaller outbreaks in churches, hospitals and nursing homes, as well as infections among travellers, continue to emerge. This week, the government has been gauging whether it should extend a 15-day intensive social distancing policy it implemented on March 21, under which high-risk facilities were urged to be closed and religious, sports and entertainment gatherings were banned. Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said the situation is still \u201cgrave\u201d, citing a recent spike in imported cases and clusters in the greater Seoul area which he said also prompted the government to cancel the re-opening of schools next week. We\u2019re in a situation where we have to maintain the intensive social distancing for some time,\u201d he said. Chung did not say how long the measures would be kept in place for. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 94 new cases on Saturday, taking the national tally to 10,156. The death toll rose by three to 177, while more than 300 recovered from the virus for a total of 6,325. Mexico\u2019s health ministry said on Friday that the number of people who have died of coronavirus in the country has risen to 60, up from 50 a day earlier. It registered a total of 1,688 coronavirus cases, up from 1,510. I\u2019ll bring you more on today\u2019s figures later. Tunisia\u2019s interior ministry has sent a police robot to patrol the streets of the capital and enforce a lockdown imposed last month as the country battles the spread of coronavirus, Agence France Presse reports. Known as PGuard, the \u201crobocop\u201d is remotely operated and equipped with infrared and thermal imaging cameras, in addition to a sound and light alarm system. In images and a soundtrack posted on the interior ministry\u2019s website, the robot calls out to suspected violators of the lockdown: \u201cWhat are you doing? Show me your ID. You don\u2019t know there\u2019s a lockdown?\u201d Tunisia has been under night-time curfew since 17 March and authorities imposed stricter lockdown orders from 22 March. Since 2 March, 14 people have died from coronavirus in the North African nation and 455 people have tested positive for the disease. You can read the full story here. China\u2019s official state broadcaster, CGTN, says 19 new Covid-19 patients have been confirmed across mainland China, including 18 who have been linked to foreign travel. A further 64 new asymptomatic patients have also been confirmed. In total, 1,030 asymptomatic patients are now under medical observation across mainland China. Sanctions should not stop the delivery of medical equipment and supplies to countries battling outbreaks of the coronavirus, the European Union\u2019s top diplomat has said. Josep Borrell, the EU\u2019s high representative for foreign affairs, made the call in a declaration on Friday backing the UN\u2019s call for an immediate global ceasefire to allow the world to focus on the pandemic. \u201cThe European Union also stresses that sanctions should not impede the delivery of essential equipment and supplies necessary to fight the coronavirus and limit its spread worldwide,\u201d Borrell said. The EU, he said, would apply humanitarian exceptions to ensure that sanctions currently in place would not hamper any efforts to fight the disease, adding that it \u201calso encourages other jurisdictions to provide the necessary clarifications to ensure that their respective sanctions are no obstacle to the global fight against the pandemic.\u201d Borrell\u2019s comments come after the US ignored calls to suspend its sanctions on Venezuela and Iran, and after Cuban officials said the six-decade US embargo of their country blocked a shipment of coronavirus aid from Asia\u2019s richest man, Jack Ma. Calling for international solidarity, Borrell said: Now is the time to devote all our energy and resources to fight the world\u2019s common challenge \u2013 the coronavirus. It is time to focus on global health. Only together can we protect the most vulnerable people in our societies, both medically and economically, from this virus and the human suffering that it brings.\u201d Hello this is Rebecca Ratcliffe at the helm of our global coronavirus liveblog. If you think we\u2019ve missed a story or want to draw our attention to something please do get in touch. My email is rebecca.ratcliffe@theguardian.com and I\u2019m @rebeccarat on Twitter. Here are the latest developments: World Bank Group president David Malpass said the rapidly spreading Covid-19 pandemic was expected to cause a \u201cmajor global recession\u201d that would likely hit the poorest and most vulnerable countries the hardest. Americans should cover their faces when outside, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is recommending. But the US president Donald Trump has undermined the guidance, saying: \u201cI\u2019m choosing not to do it.\u201d Melania Trump later urged people to take the official advice seriously. The UK has endured its deadliest day so far, with 684 more people dying in UK hospitals. This brings the total number of UK fatalities to 3,605. The country\u2019s Department of Health and Social Care says 173,784 people have been tested; of whom 38,168 were positive. Italy has recorded 766 more deaths, but the infection rate has continued to slow. Some 85,388 people are currently infected, with an increase of 2,339 new cases; 138 fewer than Thursday. The Falklands Islands has confirmed its first case. The patient has been hospitalised since 31 March and developed a range of Covid-19 symptoms, tested positive for the virus, and is now in a stable condition. A large-scale public inquiry into the UK response is now inevitable, a former head of the country\u2019s civil service has said. There are demands for better protection for the UK\u2019s healthcare workers following the deaths of two nurses in their 30s, while another frontline worker quit her job after being forbidden from wearing a face mask. The number of cases detected in Egypt jumped to 985, the country\u2019s health ministry said. Albania reported 27 new cases \u2013 its second biggest daily increase \u2013 and ordered a third 40-hour lockdown over the weekend.",

Those will not alleviate the state\u2019s concerns about a looming shortage in hospital bed space and ventilators, though officials announced Saturday that Louisiana would receive an additional 200 ventilators from the national stockpile.</p> <p>Keeping bed space in New Orleans area hospitals as ample as possible is where the makeshift hospital at the convention center comes in.</p> <p>The pop up facility \u2013 which is costing more than $90 million to build, equip and staff, largely through a contractor \u2013 is meant to treat COVID-19 patients who no longer need acute treatment at a hospital but still require care they can\u2019t get at home, said Dr. Meghan Maslanka, the site\u2019s medical operations manager.</p> <p>Such patients \u2013 who need a hospital referral to be admitted \u2013 will be treated and observed in tent rooms that are about the size of backyard sheds.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-04T22:44:27.018Z\">at 11.44pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e8905828f08c35a1d11a1cb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-04T22:09:16.021Z\">11.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In concluding the daily briefing, Trump says we are approaching a \u201chorrendous\u201d time in the outbreak across the United States.</p> <p>\u201cWe are getting to that time where the numbers are going to peak and it is not going to be a good-looking situation,\u201d the president says. \u201cI really believe we\u2019ve probably have never seen anything like these kind of numbers.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a summary of the latest events: Trump touts hydroxychloroquine as a cure for Covid-19 during his daily briefing. The anti-malaria drug could be \u2018one of the biggest game-changers in the history of medicine\u2019, Trump claimed, but there is no magic cure. The president accuses states of asking for unneeded supplies and media of spreading fake news. Trump used his briefing to further his assertions that media outlets were spreading false information about shortages of ventilators and protective equipment. Cruise ship docks in Florida with two dead and 12 testing positive for coronavirus. The Coral Princess pulls into Miami with 1,000 passengers and 878 crew, after being refused permission to dock in Fort Lauderdale. Adam Schiff said Trump was \u2018decapitating\u2019 intelligence leadership amid coronavirus crisis. The chair of the House intelligence committee made the comments to MSNBC after the president fired the inspector general of the US intelligence community late on Friday night. Andrew Cuomo thanks China for ventilators as New York prepares for coronavirus peak. The New York governor announced the state obtained 1,000 ventilators from billionaires Joseph and Clara Tsai and Alibaba founder Jack Ma. He also said Oregon would be lending 140 more. US has 278,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19. According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, there are have now been nearly 278,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the US, and more than 7,000 deaths. That toll will no doubt rise today. President Trump has approved Arizona governor Doug Ducey\u2019s request for a major disaster declaration. \u201cThis continued collaboration will be crucial as we utilize all tools to combat this virus,\u201d Ducey said. A release from Ducey\u2019s office said the declaration will ensure federal resources will be supplied to Arizona to help provide access to mental health care, unemployment assistance, legal services, hazard mitigation, nutritional aid and crisis counseling. As of Saturday morning, Arizona had reported 2,019 coronavirus cases and 52 deaths. Here\u2019s our colleague Oliver Milman\u2019s story on Trump\u2019s bold hydroxychloroquine claim during today\u2019s briefing: Faced with a global coronavirus pandemic that is increasingly centered upon the US, Donald Trump has touted several drugs that he claims can help tackle the outbreak. The US president last week used a press conference to promote the use of hydroxychloroquine, a common anti-malaria drug, to treat Covid-19, saying: \u201cI sure as hell think we ought to give it a try.\u201d He followed this with a tweet that claimed the use of the drug in combination with azithromycin, an antibiotic, could be \u201cone of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine\u201d. Trump was immediately contradicted by public health experts including his own top infectious diseases adviser, Dr Anthony Fauci, who warned that there was only \u201canecdotal evidence\u201d that the drugs could be helpful. Confronted with this disparity Trump, who has repeatedly made false and misleading assertions throughout the coronavirus crisis and indeed his entire presidency, responded by telling reporters that \u201cI\u2019m a smart guy\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ve been right a lot.\u201d The Fox News hosts Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity seem to be satisfied by this assurance and have been promoting hydroxychloroquine on their shows. But with some Americans turning to unconventional, and potentially deadly, treatments for coronavirus, medical experts have called for considered, accurate information to avoid exacerbating the pandemic. With New Orleans having emerged as one of the national hotspots in the coronavirus outbreak, Louisiana state medical officials are preparing for Monday\u2019s re-opening of the Ernest N Morial Convention Center as a makeshift, 1,000-bed medical support facility to ease the strain on local hospitals. Dr Joseph Kanter, the assistant state health officer, said the field hospital could double its capacity to 2,000 beds by the end of the month if necessary, saying: \u201cThis isn\u2019t even halfway over \u2013 it is not time to let up. Standing in a convention hall housing a football field\u2019s worth of white tents, nurses\u2019 stations and portable handwashing basins, Kanter cast a quick glance around and said, \u201cHow great would it be if we didn\u2019t need half this?\u201d The number of state residents stricken with Covid-19 jumped Saturday to 12,946, an increase of about 2,200 from the previous day. The New Orleans area continues to be the epicenter of the outbreak in Louisiana, with 3,966 known cases and 154 deaths reported out of Orleans Parish. Neighboring Jefferson Parish has another 3,008 known cases, 95 of them fatal. To what extent Saturday\u2019s hike resulted from an increased testing rate is unclear. A total of 4,853 new test results came in. That was higher than the average the state was registering earlier in the week, but exactly how many of those were older results wasn\u2019t clear. The number of new deaths reported Saturday was lower than on Friday \u2013 39 as opposed to 60 \u2013 but higher than Thursday\u2019s toll of 37. On the contrary, the number of Covid-19 patients in the hospital and on life-saving ventilator machines was higher than Friday: 1,726 and 571, respectively. Those will not alleviate the state\u2019s concerns about a looming shortage in hospital bed space and ventilators, though officials announced Saturday that Louisiana would receive an additional 200 ventilators from the national stockpile. Keeping bed space in New Orleans area hospitals as ample as possible is where the makeshift hospital at the convention center comes in. The pop up facility \u2013 which is costing more than $90 million to build, equip and staff, largely through a contractor \u2013 is meant to treat COVID-19 patients who no longer need acute treatment at a hospital but still require care they can\u2019t get at home, said Dr. Meghan Maslanka, the site\u2019s medical operations manager. Such patients \u2013 who need a hospital referral to be admitted \u2013 will be treated and observed in tent rooms that are about the size of backyard sheds. In concluding the daily briefing, Trump says we are approaching a \u201chorrendous\u201d time in the outbreak across the United States. \u201cWe are getting to that time where the numbers are going to peak and it is not going to be a good-looking situation,\u201d the president says. \u201cI really believe we\u2019ve probably have never seen anything like these kind of numbers. Maybe during the war, during a world war, a world war one or two or something. But this is a war, all into itself, and it\u2019s a terrible thing.\u201d Trump continues to lobby for hydroxychloroquine as a preventative for coronavirus. \u201cI just hope that hydroxychloroquine wins, coupled with perhaps the Z-Pak as we call it, depending totally on your doctors and the doctors there,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is a possibility \u2013 a possibility \u2013 and I say it: what do you have to lose? I\u2019ll say it again: what do you have to lose? Take it. I really think they should take it. But it\u2019s their choice and it\u2019s their doctor\u2019s choice, or the doctors in the hospital. But hydroxychloroquine. Try it, if you like.\u201d Birx says the counties in and around New York, Detroit and New Orleans are on the upsides of their curves and will all hit together in the next seven days. \u201cThey\u2019re all on the upside of their curve of mortality, so you know when you get to the peak you come down the other side,\u201d Birx says. \u201cBy the predictions that are in that healthdata.org, they\u2019re predicting those three hotspots all of them hitting together in the next six to seven days.\u201d Trump steps in as Fauci is underscoring the efficacy of social distancing, circling back on his central theme of the day: the need to reopen the country as soon as possible. \u201cMitigation does work but again, we\u2019re not going to destroy our country,\u201d the president says. \u201cAt a certain point you\u2019ll lose more people this way through all of the problems caused. We have a big decision to make at a certain point. OK?\u201d Trump says he considered moving to relax stay-at-home orders nationwide so parishioners could celebrate Easter Sunday next week. \u201cPalm Sunday, tomorrow,\u201d Trump says. \u201cThink of it. We\u2019re not going to churches on Palm Sunday. But think of next Sunday: Easter. And I brought it up before, I said, maybe we could allow a special for churches. Maybe we could talk about it. Maybe we could allow them with great separation outside on Easter Sunday. I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s something we should talk about. But somebody did say, \u2018Well, then you\u2019re sort of opening it up to ... do we want to take a chance on doing that when we\u2019ve been doing so well?\u2019 \u201cBut Easter Sunday! Palm Sunday, I\u2019m going to be watching tomorrow live from Riverside, California \u2013 great church \u2013 but I\u2019m going to be watching on a computer. On a laptop. I think on Easter maybe I\u2019ll be watching on a laptop. How sad is it that we have Easter, Palm and Easter Sunday and people are watching on laptops and computers? It\u2019s sad. But the job that this whole country has done is amazing.\u201d Trump, who says he\u2019s tested negative for Covid-19 on two occasions, says he may start to take hydroxychloroquine, adding that it may be a \u201cgame changer\u201d for treating the virus. \u201cIf it were me, in fact, I might do it anyway,\u201d Trump said about the drug, which has yet to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration. \u201cI may take it. OK? I may take it. And I\u2019ll have to ask my doctors about that but I may take it.\u201d Hydroxychloroquine has long been used to treat malaria, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Some very preliminary studies suggested it might help prevent coronavirus from entering cells, but experts have warned of its major potential side effects, especially for the heart. Trump points out yesterday\u2019s news that Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden\u2019s campaign supports the president\u2019s decision to ban foreign nationals who had been in China within the previous 14 days from entering the United States. \u201cBreaking news last night, you know that you saw that, where I think the probable presidential candidate for the Democrats will be Joe Biden, and he agreed that I was correct when I stopped people from China very early from coming into our country,\u201d Trump says. Shortly after, a reporter asks the president to comment on Biden\u2019s tweet from roughly an hour ago, where the former vice-president said Trump \u201cis not responsible for the coronavirus, but he is responsible for failing to prepare our nation to respond to it\u201d. Says Trump: \u201cHe didn\u2019t write that. That was done by a Democrat operative. He doesn\u2019t write. He\u2019s probably not even watching right now. And if he is, he doesn\u2019t understand what he\u2019s watching.\u201d He adds: \u201cThey released [the tweet] at a strange time. Sort of strange time to release something like that, but he admitted I was right.\u201d \u201cI thought he did a terrible job,\u201d Trump says of Michael Atkinson, the inspector general of the US intelligence community who was fired on Friday night. He says Atkinson was a \u201ctotal disgrace\u201d and should have looked at the transcript of his \u201cperfect call\u201d with the Ukrainian president before taking any action. Trump says he called the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, today: \u201cI said I\u2019d appreciate if they would release the amounts that we ordered\u201d of hydroxychloroquine, the malaria drug the president believes could be helpful as a therapeutic. Dr Stephen Hahn, the FDA commissioner, follows Trump\u2019s prepared remarks, saying \u201cwe are prioritizing this drug to come in for clinical trials and use if doctors think it\u2019s appropriate\u201d. Trump says his administration is using the Defense Production Act \u201cvery powerfully\u201d, saying Fema and HHS have ordered 180m N95 masks. \u201cWe need the masks,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t want other people getting them. That\u2019s why we\u2019re instuting a lot of Defense Production Act. You could call it retaliations because that\u2019s what it is, it\u2019s a retaliation. If people don\u2019t give us what we need for our people, we\u2019re going to be very tough.\u201d The president says 1,000 military personnel will deploy to New York City, which has continued to surge as a \u201chotspot\u201d for Covid-19 cases. Trump adds: \u201cWe will continue to use every power, every authority, every single resource we\u2019ve got to keep our people healthy, safe, secure and get this thing over with. We want to finish this war. We have to get back to work. We have to open our country again. We have to open our country again. We don\u2019t want to be doing this for months and months and months. We have to open our country again. This country wasn\u2019t meant for this. Few were, few were. But we have to open our country again.\u201d Trump then lists the sports commissioners that he spoke with earlier today, adding Nascar president Steve Phelps, who was omitted from the handout provided by a White House spokesperson earlier in the day. \u201cThese are all the great leaders of sport and they want to get back,\u201d Trump says. \u201cThe sports weren\u2019t designed for it. The whole concept of our nation wasn\u2019t designed for it.\u201d Trump opens today\u2019s coronavirus task force briefing, alongside vice president Mike Pence, virus task force coordinator Dr Deborah Birx and infection disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci, by noting his administration\u2019s efforts to work with state governments in New York, Texas and Louisiana to get temporary hospitals built and staffed, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s just an incredible situation. There\u2019s never been anything like this.\u201d He continues: \u201cThis will be probably the toughest week, between this week and next week, and there will be a lot of death, unfortunately. But a lot less death than if this wasn\u2019t done, but there will be death. We\u2019re looking for an obvious focus and the hardest-hit regions. Some of them are obvious and some are not so obvious. They spring up, they hit you like you got hit by a club. An area that wasn\u2019t at all bothered \u2013 you look at what\u2019s going on in New Jersey, the governor is doing an excellent job by the way \u2013 but how that sprang up. Every decision we\u2019re making is made to save lives. It\u2019s really our sole consideration. We want to save lives. We want as few lives lost as possible. The president then immediately pivots toward the media: \u201cIt\u2019s therefore critical that certain media outlets stop spreading false rumors and creating fear and even panic with the public,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just incredible. I could name them but it\u2019s the same ones. Always the same ones. I guess they looking for ratings. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re looking for. So bad for our country. The people understand it. Look at the levels and approval ratings, they\u2019re the lowest they\u2019ve ever been for media. So bad for our country, so bad for the world. Put it together for a little while. Get this over with and then go back to your fake news.\u201d Trump opens today\u2019s coronavirus task force briefing by noting his administration\u2019s efforts to work with state governments in New York, Texas and Louisiana to get temporary hospitals built and staffed, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s just an incredible situation. There\u2019s never been anything like this.\u201d Although President Trump has resisted instituting a national shelter-in-place recommendation to combat coronavirus \u2013 in contrast with top infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci\u2019s advice \u2013 87% of US residents said they\u2019re trying to stay home when possible, according to a new survey. A mere 7% of US residents said they are not making such an effort, while 6% reported being \u201cunsure\u201d. The Huffington Post/YouGov poll also indicated overwhelming support of stay-at-home mandates, with 79% of US residents saying their states were right in issuing such orders. The survey also found that approximately 61% of US residents would keep staying home this month when possible even if their states started lifting restrictions. About 19% said they would return to living \u201cas normally as possible if restrictions were lifted\u201d, per the research. The New York Post appears to have first outlet other than Huffington Post reporting on this study, which was based on 1,000 completed interviews conducted from 27 to 31 March. \u201cThose findings shouldn\u2019t be taken as absolute or immovable. People aren\u2019t necessarily great at predicting their own actions in a future hypothetical situation. That\u2019s especially true now, with the outbreak continuing to rapidly unfold and statements from the White House varying greatly in tone and content,\u201d the study noted. \u201cThe results, however, do suggest the majority of the public is hunkering down not merely out of duress, but also out of their own genuine concerns \u2013 and that they\u2019re prepared to continue doing so for at least some time.\u201d Just about 25% of US residents said they thought things would soon return to normal, as 62% expected \u201clasting effects on the nation\u201d. \u201cThe rest are unsure what will happen.\u201d The survey, released Thursday, comes as several states have remained slow to enact efforts in the fight against Covid-19. Alabama\u2019s stay-at-home order is only just going into effect Saturday at 5pm,. Arkansas has not implemented this kind of mandate. Iowa, Nebraska, as well as North and South Dakota also have not, per reports. The White House announces the president has issued disaster declarations for the states of Wisconsin and Nebraska, bringing the overall count to 36 states, the District of Columbia and four US territories. The declarations are issued as Trump is set to speak at the White House coronavirus task force press briefing, which is due to begin shortly. ESPN reports that Donald Trump hopes to have fans back in stadiums and arenas by August and wants the NFL, America\u2019s most popular sports league, to start as scheduled in September. The president held a conference call with commissioners and leaders from a variety of US sports leagues on Saturday. Professional sports have shut down in the last few weeks as the Covid-19 pandemic has taken hold across America. The NBA was the first league to shut on 11 March, and it was soon followed by MLS and NHL. The start of the baseball season has also been postponed. Health officials have not made it clear whether they find Trump\u2019s timetable realistic, but this summer\u2019s Olympics, which had been due to take place in late July and end in early August have been postponed until 2021. The NFL has previously said it expects to start as scheduled in September in front of fans. California governor Gavin Newsom was asked about Trump\u2019s reported target for NFL season during his daily press briefing in Sacramento, saying: \u201cI\u2019m not anticipating that happening in this state.\u201d \u201cOur decision on that basis at least here in the state of California will be determined by the facts, will be determined by the health experts, will be determined by our capacity to meet this moment, bend the curve and have the appropriate community surveillance and testing to competently determine whether or not that\u2019s appropriate,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cRight now I\u2019m just focused on the immediate, but that\u2019s not something I anticipate happening in the next few months.\u201d California governor Gavin Newsom said the state\u2019s coronavirus test backlog has been reduced to 13,000 tests pending, down from 60,000 on Friday, during his daily briefing from Sacramento. A total of 126,700 Californians have been tested for the virus, according to the governor. Newsom pointed to the recent peak of 59,500 individuals with results pending in California, admitting: \u201cThe testing space has been a challenging one for us and I own that.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve substantially reduced that backlog,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cA lot of that has to do with the commercial labs stepping up.\u201d The governor also shared California\u2019s updated Covid-19 figures as of Saturday: 2,300 hospitalizations with 1,008 ICU patients (a 10.9% increase over Friday) and 12,026 known cases (a 12.4% increase). He also announced a newly launched website \u2013 covid19supplies.ca.gov \u2013 where citizens can donate or sell personal protective equipment like N95 masks to the state. He said the state has distributed more than 41m N95 masks in addition to other protective gear. \u201cWe are purchasing supplies at scale,\u201d he said. \u201cForty-one million N95 masks we\u2019ve already delivered. We are committed to hundreds of millions more. And that requires diligence, that requires a level of expertise and we can never let speed become the enemy of real results that ultimately deliver on our promise.\u201d Reuters has cited two sources that allege Donald Trump pressed federal officials to make anti-malarial drugs available to treat Covid-19, despite the fact that they were untested on the virus. Reuters reports that the government then took the unusual step of telling doctors they had the option of prescribing the drugs, despite the fact that dosages had not been peer reviewed. \u201cThe president is short-circuiting the process with his gut feelings,\u201d Jeffrey Flier, a former dean of Harvard Medical School, told Reuters. \u201cWe are in an emergency and we need to rely on our government to ensure that all these potential therapies are tested in the most effective and objective way.\u201d The White House told Reuters that Trump had not launched a \u201cpressure campaign\u201d over the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. \u201cThe President\u2019s top priority is the health and safety of the American people which is why he has brought together the federal government and private sector, including doctors, scientists, and medical researchers, for an unprecedented collaboration to expedite vaccine development,\u201d said the statement. Joe Rogan, host of the hugely popular podcast The Joe Rogan Experience, has said he would vote for Donald Trump over Joe Biden in the presidential election. Rogan gave his views during Friday\u2019s edition of his podcast, which regularly tops the iTunes chart for downloads. During a conversation with his guest Eric Weinstein, the managing director of Thiel Capital, talk turned to the upcoming presidential elections. Weinstein said he would not vote for either Trump or Biden, the probable Democratic candidate in November\u2019s election. Rogan said that the Democrats had made \u201cmorons\u201d out of voters by appearing to favour Biden as their candidate. \u201cI\u2019d rather vote for Trump than [Biden],\u201d said Rogan. \u201cI don\u2019t think he can handle anything. You\u2019re relying entirely on his cabinet. If you want to talk about an individual leader who can communicate, he can\u2019t do that. And we don\u2019t know what the fuck he\u2019ll be like after a year in office. \u201cThe pressure of being President of the United States is something that no one has ever prepared for. The only one who seems to be fine with it is Trump, oddly enough. He doesn\u2019t seem to be aging at all or in any sort of decline. Obama, almost immediately, started looking older. George W [Bush], almost immediately, started looking older.\u201d Biden turns 78 in November and Rogan described him as \u201cvery old\u201d and said the senator\u2019s famous verbal slip-ups were \u201cnot a normal way to communicate unless he\u2019s high.\u201d Rogan has previously endorsed Biden\u2019s rival for the Democratic nomination, Bernie Sanders, who is a year older than Biden. \u201cHe\u2019s been insanely consistent his entire life,\u201d said Rogan. \u201cHe\u2019s basically been saying the same thing, been for the same thing for his whole life. And that in and of itself is a very powerful structure to operate from.\u201d The president of the Human Rights Campaign said in January that Sanders should reconsider accepting Rogan\u2019s endorsement due to the fact that the podcaster has \u201cattacked transgender people, gay men, women, people of colour and countless marginalised groups at every opportunity\u201d. A few more details on our earlier post on jails in New York. The city\u2019s jails department said that as of Saturday morning, 305 staff members and 251 incarcerated persons have tested positive for the virus. With regard to the new parole lawsuit, which opposes the automatic jailing of people accused of violations before their alleged infractions can be weighed, the state prisons department, says it\u2019s reviewing the suit and can\u2019t comment on pending litigation. The department said that in response to the circumstances, it is changing longtime policies, and making new ones, to protect those in the prison system, while maintaining public safety. Donald Trump spoke with commissioners and leaders from major US sports leagues and tournaments today. Sports in the US \u2013 and around the world \u2013 have been halted during the pandemic with major consequences for the finances of teams and athletes. Among those present on the conference call with the president were commissioners from the NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, WNBA and MLS. UFC president Dana White, a long-time ally of Trump was also on the call as was Vince McMahon of WWE. \u201cToday, President Donald J Trump spoke by telephone with commissioners of major league sports to discuss the all-of-America response to Covid-19. The President recognized the good work being done by many teams and players to care for their communities, workforces, and fan bases across the Nation,\u201d said White House spokesman Judd Deere. \u201cThe commissioners thanked President Trump for his national leadership and for his interest in the sports industry. President Trump encouraged them to continue to support their fellow Americans during this challenging time.\u201d Trump has clashed with several figures from the world of sports during his presidency. He described NFL players who knelt in protest at police brutality as \u201csons of bitches\u201d, while the NBA\u2019s Golden State Warriors declined to attend the White House for the traditional visit after winning two championships. As coronavirus continues to tear through US jails and prisons, New York civil rights advocates filed a lawsuit Friday opposing the automatic jailing of people accused of parole violations before their alleged infractions can be weighed. Lawyers are demanding an opportunity for the release of more than 1,000 people held in New York City jails \u201cin light of the uncontrolled spread of the coronavirus and the dangerous public health conditions in these facilities.\u201d This Manhattan federal court civil complaint names governor Andrew Cuomo and the state\u2019s top parole official as defendants. New York Civil Liberties Union and The Legal Aid Society explain that the state\u2019s Department of Corrections and Community Supervision must hold a hearing within 90 days to determine an alleged parole violation \u2013 and whether parole should subsequently be revoked. Some of these \u201ctechnical\u201d violations might be something as minor as neglecting to report a new address, change in employment, or missing a parole officer appointment. Several other lawsuits have been filed this week demanding the release of detained parolees from city jails due to Covid-19. For approximately 20% of parole \u201cre-arrests\u201d, these revocation hearings happen after the 90-day period, \u201cand during the coronavirus pandemic these hearings have been suspended almost completely\u201d. \u201cBefore that hearing, there is no opportunity to determine if the person even needs to be in jail simply to wait for that hearing,\u201d advocates say. Because of this dramatic slowdown, people are languishing in jail \u201cindefinitely\u201d \u2013 all the while facing heightened danger from Covid-19. The lawsuit claims that as of Friday, 239 inmates in New York City\u2019s infamous Rikers Island jail have coronavirus. In excess of 2,000 people are now in quarantine units for potential exposure \u2013 approximately 50% of Rikers\u2019 population, advocates say. \u201cAt current rates of infection, the virus\u2019s \u2018attack rate\u2019 in New York jails \u2013 that is, the rate at which the population is being infected \u2013 is 64 times higher than the average in the United States of America and seven times higher than New York City,\u201d the lawsuit maintains. While Cuomo did recently announce that he intends to release up to 600 persons held on technical parole violations due to coronavirus, slightly over 100 have been released as of the lawsuit\u2019s filing, lawyers note. Neither the governor nor state corrections department immediately responded to a request for comment on the federal action. New Jersey governor Phil Murphy said the number of Covid-19 cases statewide rose to 34,124 on Saturday at his daily coronavirus briefing in the state capital of Trenton. A total of 846 have died, eclipsing the number of New Jersey lives lost in the 9/11 terror attacks. \u201cWe are today reporting that another 200 residents of passed due to Covid-19 related complications,\u201d he says. \u201cOur state total now sits at 846 precious lives lost. Let me put this in a proper, yet very sobering context. We have now lost nearly 100 more of our fellow New Jerseyans to Covid-19 that we did on the September 11th attacks. Please let that sink in for a moment. This pandemic is writing one of the greatest tragedies in our state\u2019s history and just as we have committed to never forget the lives lost on 9/11, we must commit to never forgetting those we are losing to this pandemic.\u201d He adds: \u201cLet\u2019s just all remember again: this is war. We are in a war. How do you win wars? You don\u2019t panic and you don\u2019t go business-as-usual. You win it by being smart, aggressive, proactive, shooting straight with each other, being honest about the toll that is both before us and will continue to grow. Let\u2019s not kid each other. You win wars by not turning on each other, but to the contrary, coming together. This extraordinary diverse state coming together as one family. \u201cYou win a war because your work harder than the next folks. You win it because you show courage as we\u2019re seeing every single day up and down this state, from our frontline healthcare workers, to every single one of the nine million of us, including folks right now at home by themselves doing exactly what we need. Every single one of us is a hero right now. Every single one of us must do our part if we are to flatten the curve of this virus, allow our healthcare system to be able to deal with it properly and then emerge on the other side. And unequivocally may I say, if we all do our part, there is no question in my mind we will win this war and we will emerge from it stronger as one New Jersey family, more together than ever before.\u201d Adam Schiff, chair of the House intelligence committee, said Donald Trump is \u201cdecapitating the leadership of the intelligence community in the middle of a national crisis\u201d and \u201csettling scores\u201d after the president fired Michael Atkinson, the inspector general of the US intelligence community, late on Friday night. \u201cIt\u2019s unconscionable,\u201d Schiff said during an interview on MSNBC on Saturday. \u201cAnd of course it sends a message throughout the federal government and in particular to other inspectors general that if they do their job as this professional did and Michael Atkinson was a complete professional, they too may be fired by a vindictive president.\u201d House speaker Nancy Pelosi echoed Schiff\u2019s alarm, calling the firing of the Trump appointee \u201ca brazen act against a patriotic public servant who has honorably performed his duty\u201d. Here\u2019s a bit more on New York\u2019s ventilator hunt from our health reporter: Chinese billionaires and the state of Oregon facilitated ventilator donations to New York to treat patients with Covid-19, as the pandemic accelerates toward a peak. New York governor Andrew Cuomo announced the state obtained 1,000 ventilators from billionaires Joseph and Clara Tsai and Alibaba founder Jack Ma, while President Trump again promoted an unproven malaria drug as treatment for Covid-19 on Twitter. \u201cWe\u2019re not yet at the apex,\u201d said Cuomo, who described that crescendo of cases as, \u201cthe number one point of engagement of the enemy.\u201d In addition to the 1,000 ventilators obtained from China, Cuomo said Oregon loaned New York 140 ventilators. Current projections put the peak of the pandemic anywhere between four and 14 days away. Officials hope physical distancing imposed across the state will slow the spread of the disease, and forestall the possibility of running out of ventilators and beds, even as Cuomo admitted he hoped to see the apex soon so the experience would end. The pandemic, \u201cstresses this country, this state, in a way nothing else has frankly in my lifetime,\u201d Cuomo said. The briefing was another contrast in leadership between Cuomo and Trump. Where Cuomo\u2019s briefings have alarming statistics, his frank descriptions of shortages and personal struggles have been praised across the country. On Saturday, Cuomo said the state had a signed contract for 17,000 ventilators, which he was later told could not be filled because many had already been purchased by China. Justin Trudeau, speaking at his daily Covid-19 briefing, says Canada won\u2019t bring retaliatory measures against the United States after the Trump administration announced it would prevent the export of N95 protective masks. The Associated Press reports: Trudeau says he will speak to President Trump in the coming days. He says his officials are having constructive conversations with American officials. Trudeau says he will tell Trump both countries are interlinked in ways that it would damage both if supply chains are cut. The prime minister says Canada ships gloves and testing kits to the U.S and notes materials from the N95 masks originate in Canada. Canadian nurses also cross the bridge in Windsor to work in the Detroit medical system everyday. Manufacturing giant 3M says there are significant humanitarian implications of ceasing N95 masks to health care workers in Canada and Latin America, where 3M is a critical supplier of respirators. Cuomo has finished his daily briefing from Albany, where he warned the hardest days lie ahead for the state that\u2019s become the central hotbed of the pandemic in the United States. \u201cIf there was anything I could do to accelerate getting it over, I would,\u201d he says. \u201cIn some ways I want to get to that apex. I want to get on the other side of that apex and let\u2019s just slide down that mountain. On the other hand we have to be ready for the fight and we have to handle that fight. And that\u2019s where we are. \u201cSo what do we do? You have to get to through it. There is no simple answer here. You\u2019re not going to wish this away. You have to get through it and you have to get through it intelligently, saving as many lives as you can. And that\u2019s hard work and that\u2019s perseverance and that\u2019s mutuality and that\u2019s community and that\u2019s finding your better self and that\u2019s finding your inner strength and dealing with a situation that is almost unmanageable on every level, because you are out of control. \u201cAnd this is a painful, disorienting experience. \u201cBut we find our best self, our strongest self [and] this day will end and we will get through it and we will get to the other side of the mountain and we will be the better for it. But we have to do what we have to do between now and then and that\u2019s just what we doing here.\u201d Cuomo says the number of hospitalizations on Long Island has grown exponentially in the last few days, saying he doesn\u2019t know whether it\u2019s because city residents are fleeing or seeking treatment there. \u201cWe\u2019ve been saying for the past few days, watch Long Island, because it\u2019s like a fire, spreading,\u201d he says. Cases in Long Island\u2019s Nassau County are at 13,346 (up 1,322 from yesterday), the second-highest in the state. Suffolk County cases are at 11,370 (up 1,216 from yesterday). While Andrew Cuomo is speaking in New York, Trump has continued to be busy on Twitter, mostly retweeting but adding comments of his own. To wit: The president\u2019s belief in the possibility that hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug, might be an effective treatment for Covid-19 is not shared with his leading public health experts on the White House task force. On Fox News on Friday, infectious diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci said: \u201cWe still need to do the definitive studies to determine whether any intervention, not just this one, is truly safe and effective. But when you don\u2019t have that information, it\u2019s understandable why people might want to take something anyway even with the slightest hint of being effective.\u201d All this, of course, does not stop Trump returning to the well on Twitter and at White House briefings. Here\u2019s Oliver Milman\u2019s look at the issue: The president carries on: It often pays to check who Trump is retweeting. John Solomon, it should be noted, is a columnist whose work for The Hill was used in attempts to smear opponents of the president during the Ukraine affair which led to Trump\u2019s impeachment. Trump has obviously been scrolling down Solomon\u2019s profile page this morning: Late on Friday night, Trump made his latest move against a leader of the intelligence community, in this case one who played a key role in the impeachment process: Cuomo says that the Chinese government will facilitate a donation of 1,000 ventilators to arrive into JFK airport today, saying: \u201cThis is a big deal and it\u2019s going to make a significant difference for us.\u201d He\u2019s pressed on the impending reality that New York will not have enough ventilators for admissions, which will require two patients on the same ventilator. \u201cSplitting is not ideal,\u201d he says. \u201cYou go to war with what you have, not with what you need.\u201d The state of Oregon is sending 140 ventilators to New York, Cuomo says, calling it \u201castonishing\u201d and \u201cunexpected\u201d. \u201cI want this all to be over,\u201d the governor says. \u201cIt\u2019s only gone on for 30 days since our first case. It feels like an entire lifetime. I think we all feel the same. This stresses this country, this state in a way nothing else has frankly in my lifetime. It stresses us on every love. The economy is stressed, the social fabric is stressed, social systems are stressed, transportation is stressed. It\u2019s right across the board. But the most difficult level is the human level. It is for me, anyway. And it\u2019s every day and it\u2019s everywhere.\u201d He adds: \u201cYou can\u2019t even quantify the effect on society and the effect on individuals and the burden that we\u2019re dealing with.\u201d New York governor Andrew Cuomo opens Saturday\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing with the latest numbers: Covid-19 cases in New York City: 63,606 (up 6,147 from Friday) Covid-19 cases in New York state: 113,704 (up 10,841 from Friday) Total people tested (283,621) Total people hospitalized: 15,905 (up 1,095 from yesterday) Total ICU admissions: 4,126 (up 395 from yesterday) A woman is Florida is seeking to gain sole custody of her two-year-old son during the Covid-19 pandemic because the boy\u2019s father works in the emergency services. According to court papers, Tabatha Sams currently shares custody with her son\u2019s father, Stephen Thilmony, who is a firefighter and emergency medicine technician. Thilmony\u2019s fiancee, meanwhile, is an emergency room nurse. \u201cAs Covid-19 has spread throughout the United States, medical professionals and first responders have been subjected to coronavirus at a higher rate, due to their increased exposure to individuals testing positive for the virus,\u201d Sams said in the court papers. In the papers, Thilmony is quoted as saying he is not endangering his son. \u201cWe are taking proper measures to protect ourselves and him,\u201d Thilmony said. The Daily Show has put together clips of politicians and media figures giving their views on Covid-19 in the early stages of the pandemic. Let\u2019s just say some of the quotes have not aged well: There has been plenty of concern about the potential for mass casualties in US jails during the Covid-19 pandemic. A public health expert has also warned outbreaks that start in jails could pose risks for the wider community. \u201cThe prison population in and of itself has a fairly sizable, vulnerable population within that, have a lot of chronic conditions, other types of infections,\u201d Dr Barun Mathema, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Columbia University, told CNN. \u201cWe should also ensure that what happens in a prison, or a jail for that matter, does not pose an undue risk to the community. In this case, we know we have ample examples from many infectious diseases.\u201d As fatalities rise in the United States, the shortage of space to store bodies is becoming a concern. It\u2019s a problem that authorities had to confront in countries hit by the Covid-19 epidemic earlier than the US: for example, in Spain a Madrid ice rink was used to store bodies before burial. Med Alliance Group, a medical distributor in Illinois, has reported being inundated with requests for refrigerated trailers. \u201cThey\u2019re coming from all over: From hospitals, health systems, coroner\u2019s offices, VA facilities, county and state health departments, state emergency departments and funeral homes,\u201d Christie Penzol, a spokeswoman for Med Alliance, told the Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s heart-wrenching.\u201d Penzol added that the company has already rented out all its trailers and there is an 18-week wait for the materials needed to build new ones. Fox News host Sean Hannity hit back against intense criticism of the conservative network\u2019s coronavirus coverage, even claiming in a new interview that he was ahead of most media in taking Covid-19 seriously. Hannity\u2019s statements to Newsweek were in response to a 1 April open letter signed by 74 journalism professors that lambasted Fox News for allegedly spreading \u201cmisinformation\u201d about the outbreak. The professors\u2019 missive directly cited Hannity\u2019s statement that the Democrats and media overplayed coronavirus to \u201cbludgeon Trump with this new hoax.\u201d Their letter came several days before a report in The Daily Beast that Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan were bracing for lawsuits over Fox News\u2019s coronavirus coverage. Asked about his statement that Democrats and the media were using Covid-19 \u201cto bludgeon Trump,\u201d Hannity responded, \u201cMany of them did.\u201d \u201cWe are in the middle of the huge pandemic and where\u2019s the Democrat saying, \u2018You know, I didn\u2019t agree with the travel ban at the time, but it was the right decision.\u2019 Politics trumps truth in their world.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the same Democrats, media mob and liberal professors who are so lazy they won\u2019t even look at what I\u2019ve said about the virus. They just go with their narrative. I never called it a \u2018hoax,\u2019\u201d Hannity said when subsequently asked about his \u201choax\u201d comment. \u201cI said it was a hoax for them to be using it as a bludgeon on Trump. And they are. Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi are talking about an investigation. Now? In the middle of a pandemic?\u201d Hannity also said \u201cGo to my website and you\u2019ll see irrefutable evidence that I have taken this seriously way before most in the media did. I warned in January that it was dangerous because it was highly contagious, but some people were asymptomatic, so it would spread quickly.\u201d The letter, addressed to both Murdoch and his son, claimed \u201cviewers of Fox News, including the president of the United States, have been regularly subjected to misinformation relayed by the network \u2013 false statements downplaying the prevalence of Covid-19 and its harms\u2026\u201d The professors further claimed that Fox News offered \u201cmisleading recommendations of activities that people should undertake to protect themselves and others, including casual recommendations of untested drugs; false assessments of the value of measures urged upon the public by their elected political leadership and public health authorities.\u201d Mediaite pointed out that while Fox News has taken some actions that seemingly view coronavirus more seriously \u2013 with Hannity and other talking heads such as Tucker Carlson appearing in a PSA, for example \u2013 there have still been questionable moments. On Friday night, Carlson criticized infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci\u2019s call for a national stay-at-home mandate. \u201cMore than 10 million Americans have already lost their jobs. Imagine another year of this. That would be national suicide, and yet, that is what Anthony Fauci is suggesting, at least,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cNow, we\u2019re not suggesting that Fauci wants to hurt America. We don\u2019t think he does, he seems like a very decent man. But Fauci is not an economist or for that matter someone who fears being unemployed himself. Like most of the people around him.\u201d Probable Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has issued a statement calling for Donald Trump to appoint a \u201csupply commander\u201d to \u201cco-ordinate critical materials for all 50 states and US territories\u201d. Biden has been seeking a call with Trump to discuss the coronavirus response. No word that it\u2019s happened yet. Marc Caputo of Politico, meanwhile, makes a wry point: MSNBC host Rachel Maddow called for essentially the same thing last night. Here\u2019s some further reading: Washington bureau chief David Smith again \u2013 busy lad \u2013 with a look at where the 2020 election stands with the nation in the grip of Covid-19: Biden finds himself holed up in his basement in Wilmington, Delaware, struggling to break into the national conversation through TV interviews and virtual campaign events. Trump has been denied the lifeblood of rallies but switched to his other favourite medium \u2013 television \u2013 with daily coronavirus taskforce briefings from the White House. Polls suggest he is benefiting moderately from a \u201crally around the flag effect\u201d Still no sign of the president, whose thumbs would often have twitched towards his iPhone by this time of a Saturday. Over at the Washington Post, meanwhile, media columnist Margaret Sullivan has an interesting take this morning on Andrew and Chris Cuomo\u2019s developing coronavirus double act, in which the New York governor and his CNN anchor (and Covid-19 patient) brother regularly conduct interviews full of endearing brotherly bickering. \u201cNot everyone approves of the Cuomo Brothers show,\u201d Sullivan writes. This is something I cannot wrap my head around,\u201d Fabian Reinbold, Washington bureau chief for a large German news organization, told me in an email this week. \u201cIt would be considered highly inappropriate and corrupt back home.\u201d He was particularly taken aback by Chris Cuomo\u2019s choice to actually participate in Thursday\u2019s [New York governor\u2019s] news conference, piped in via videoconference to hold forth to the gathered press corps. He wore a baseball cap emblazoned with the name of his CNN show, \u201cCuomo Primetime,\u201d further blurring the roles of brother and anchor. That moment may have proved too much for competitors Fox News and MSNBC, who cut away from the New York governor\u2019s briefing soon after. Others have questioned the journalistic propriety of repeatedly interviewing one\u2019s brother on prime-time TV, as Chris Cuomo has been doing for weeks. Jon Allsop at Columbia Journalism Review, for one, disapproves. He reasonably suggests a less fraught approach: \u201cThere are plenty of ways Chris Cuomo could communicate about his health with CNN viewers while also taking time to recuperate. While he\u2019s out, a colleague could talk with his brother.\u201d All that said, Sullivan also points out that in a nation grown used to the open nepotism of the Trump administration, where the president\u2019s daughter and son-in-law double as his chief advisers, perhaps the Cuomo Show is relatively small beer. It also seems necessary to say, again, that it really is quite endearing: Good morning and welcome to another day of US coronavirus coverage. According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, there are have now been nearly 278,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the US, and more than 7,000 deaths. That toll will no doubt rise today. We\u2019ll expect to hear from New York governor Andrew Cuomo, about conditions in the state worst hit by far. Those Johns Hopkins figures put confirmed cases in New York at around 103,000 and deaths at nearly 3,000. Here\u2019s Daniel Strauss\u2019s look at how Cuomo has navigated the crisis, relations with Donald Trump and a national spotlight which has also landed on his younger brother Chris Cuomo, a CNN anchor who was this week found to have contracted Covid-19. There is also a White House briefing due at the earlier-than-usual time of 3.30pm ET, which is 8.30pm UK. On Friday, Donald Trump made his usual round of headlines at the briefing room podium, not least by announcing new federal guidelines that say people should wear face masks in public, which his wife Melania tweeted out as he spoke, but then saying he was not going to do so. The president also attacked reporters, criticised Cuomo over his appeals for ventilators to fight an expected surge in New York cases, and defended his son-in-law Jared Kushner for comments about the federal healthcare equipment stockpile at the briefing the day before. Ed Pilkington, our chief reporter, has another in-depth read about Trump\u2019s struggle to respond to the coronavirus outbreak. It\u2019s here: There\u2019s been no word from Trump on Twitter yet this morning but there\u2019s always time for that to change. For some further reading as this Saturday begins, here\u2019s a key quote from Washington bureau chief David Smith\u2019s fascinating interview with Jon Karl, ABC News\u2019 chief White House correspondent and a long-term Trump foil whose new book, obviously written before the pandemic, is called Front Row at the Trump Show: We\u2019re at a point where nearly half the country doesn\u2019t believe what this president and White House says and we have nearly half the rest of the country that\u2019s been told not to believe what they see in a newspaper or see in television news or any other form of mainstream news. \u201cThat\u2019s a deeply troubling, deeply dangerous place to be where there isn\u2019t a shared agreement and sense of some basic facts, especially now where reliable information, and believing you have reliable information, can literally be a matter of life and death.\u201d More, as they say, follows. Here\u2019s David\u2019s piece in full:",

      "bodyText": "A coronavirus-stricken cruise ship docked in Florida on Saturday, carrying two dead passengers and at least 12 people who have tested positive for Covid-19. The Coral Princess pulled into Miami with 1,000 passengers and 878 crew aboard, after being refused permission to dock in Fort Lauderdale on Friday. At least one person was rushed off the boat, put in an ambulance and taken to a nearby hospital. The ship had been outside US waters, waiting for permission to pull into port, since two other ships overcame political objections and got permission to dock at Fort Lauderdale with four dead and many ill. The Coral Princess, owned by Carnival, which also owns the two other ships, spent Friday floating near Puerto Rico. US coast guard officials in south Florida denied the ship the right to pull into Fort Lauderdale. \u201cBased on the hazardous conditions on board your vessel,\u201d the south Florida coast guard said in an order to the company obtained by the Miami Herald, \u201cI have determined your vessel poses an unacceptable risk of medical emergency due to the inherent and high probability of transmission of Covid-19 aboard, which presents a risk to the safety of the personnel aboard your vessel, first responders and ports within the seventh district.\u201d Southern California resident Lori Bessler, who has been trying frantically to get her mother and stepfather off the ship for weeks, told the Guardian at least one of the deaths onboard, of a woman from South Carolina, came as the coast guard was denying the right to dock. The other woman who died was from Florida, she said. \u201cThe family members are devastated and filled with disbelief,\u201d said Bessler, who said she had been discussing the situation with other families of passengers in a private Facebook group. \u201cHow could the coast [guard] deny these people access to their own country, when they are out there dying?\u201d Holland America\u2019s Zandaam and Rotterdam were able to unload passengers on Friday after days of tense negotiations with politicians, including Florida governor Ron DeSantis, who said he didn\u2019t want sick passengers \u201cdumped\u201d in his state. All the ships started their cruises in South America in early March. The Coral Princess was supposed to dock in Buenos Aires on 19 March but only passengers from South America were allowed to leave the ship then. It steamed north, without a port, for nearly two weeks. \u201cAll of us at Princess Cruises are deeply saddened to report that two guests passed away on Coral Princess,\u201d said the Princess Cruise line in a release. \u201cOur hearts go out to their family, friends, and all who are impacted by this loss.\u201d The company said it would take several days to unload all the passengers, most of whom will be put on planes to fly home.

On Saturday, Trump tried to claim credit for the 1,000 ventilators sent to New York by China and said, \u201ctwo very good friends of mine brought him those ventilators\u201d.</p> \n<p>In his morning press conference, Cuomo said New York had 113,704 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and a death toll of 3,565. Most deaths were in New York City, with nearly 1,000 in other parts of the state.</p> \n<p>Current projections put the peak of the pandemic in New York between four and 14 days away. Officials hope physical distancing will slow the spread of the disease and forestall the possibility of running out of ventilators and hospital beds.</p> \n<p>Cuomo admitted he hoped to see the apex soon, so the experience would soon end. The pandemic, \u201cstresses this country, this state, in a way nothing else has frankly in my lifetime\u201d, he said.</p> \n<p>Cuomo\u2019s briefing from the New York state capital, Albany, offered another contrast in leadership with the president in Washington. While Cuomo\u2019s briefings convey alarming statistics, his frank descriptions of shortages and personal struggles have been praised.</p> \n<p>On Saturday, Cuomo said the state had a signed contract for 17,000 ventilators, a deal he was later told could not be done because many had already been bought by China.</p> \n<p>As Cuomo spoke, Trump retweeted articles about hydroxychloroquine, from rightwing sources.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/04/andrew-cuomo-profile-coronavirus-new-york\">Unloved by progressives, New York's Andrew Cuomo has the spotlight now</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The US federal government\u2019s response to the outbreak has been defined by bungled testing, poor coordination, low stockpiles and planning failures.

Trump\u2019s urging came moments after another senior health adviser, Dr Deborah Birx, told Americans the coming weeks would be \u201cthe moment to do everything you can to keep your families and friends safe\u201d by following federal physical distancing guidelines. The White House\u2019s own projections show 100,000 Americans could be killed by the virus. On Saturday, Trump said: \u201cThere will be a lot of death\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s therefore critical certain media outlets stop spreading false information,\u201d he said. \u201cI could name them, but it\u2019s the same ones, always the same ones.\u201d Earlier, the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, announced his state had looked to China for ventilator supplies. \u201cWe\u2019re not yet at the apex,\u201d said Cuomo, who described the crescendo of cases to come as \u201cthe number one point of engagement of the enemy\u201d. Cuomo said he had obtained 1,000 ventilators from the Chinese government with the help of billionaires Joseph and Clara Tsai and the Alibaba founder Jack Ma. Oregon had loaned New York another 140, he said. The Trump administration has sought to redefine the national strategic stockpile as a \u201cback up\u201d for states, and avoid coordinating a response to the pandemic. On Saturday, Trump tried to claim credit for the 1,000 ventilators sent to New York by China and said, \u201ctwo very good friends of mine brought him those ventilators\u201d. In his morning press conference, Cuomo said New York had 113,704 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and a death toll of 3,565. Most deaths were in New York City, with nearly 1,000 in other parts of the state. Current projections put the peak of the pandemic in New York between four and 14 days away. Officials hope physical distancing will slow the spread of the disease and forestall the possibility of running out of ventilators and hospital beds. Cuomo admitted he hoped to see the apex soon, so the experience would soon end. The pandemic, \u201cstresses this country, this state, in a way nothing else has frankly in my lifetime\u201d, he said. Cuomo\u2019s briefing from the New York state capital, Albany, offered another contrast in leadership with the president in Washington. While Cuomo\u2019s briefings convey alarming statistics, his frank descriptions of shortages and personal struggles have been praised. On Saturday, Cuomo said the state had a signed contract for 17,000 ventilators, a deal he was later told could not be done because many had already been bought by China. As Cuomo spoke, Trump retweeted articles about hydroxychloroquine, from rightwing sources. The US federal government\u2019s response to the outbreak has been defined by bungled testing, poor coordination, low stockpiles and planning failures. Federal failure to intervene in supply chains has led to bidding wars for masks and other personal protective equipment, governors have said. The White House has repeatedly claimed it has 10,000 ventilators in the national stockpile. However, states have reported some of those ventilators are unusable, after the administration failed to ensure the stockpile was properly maintained. Trump has repeatedly caused confusion, often during hours-long press conferences. On Saturday, he also attacked his probable challenger in November, Joe Biden, and the intelligence official he fired on Friday night; insisted the US economy would soon have to \u201creopen\u201d despite expert predictions of a lengthy shutdown to deal with the virus; and defended Republican governors who have not ordered social distancing measures. Such states, he said, had \u201cbig land, few people and they\u2019re in very good shape\u201d. Trump\u2019s performance came less than 24 hours after he announced new advice from his own health department, that Americans should wear masks in public, then, even as his wife Melania tweeted out the news, said: \u201cThis is voluntary. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be doing it.\u201d",
