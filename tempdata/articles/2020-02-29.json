Many considered Suleimani to have been the second most powerful person in Iran, behind supreme leader of Iran Ali Khamenei, but arguably ahead of President Hassan Rouhani. He was commander of the Quds Force, the elite, external wing of the Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the Trump administration designated as a terror organisation in April last year.&nbsp;</p>\n      <p>He was born in Rabor, a city in eastern Iran, and forced to travel to a neighbouring city at age 13 and work to pay his father\u2019s debts to the government of the Shah. By the time the monarch fell in 1979, Suleimani was committed to the clerical rule of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and joined the Revolutionary Guards, the paramilitary force established to prevent a coup against the newly declared Islamic Republic.</p>\n      <p>Within two years, he was sent to the front to fight in the war against the invading Iraqi army. He quickly distinguished himself, especially for daring reconnaissance missions behind Iraqi lines, and the war also gave him his first contact with foreign militias of the kind he would wield to devastating effect in the decades to come.</p>\n      <p>By the the time the Iraq government fell in 2003, Suleimani was the head of the Quds force and blamed for sponsoring the Shia militias who killed thousands of civilian Iraqis and coalition troops. As fighting raged on Iraq\u2019s streets, Suleimani fought a shadow war with the US for leverage over the new Iraqi leadership.</p>\n      <p>Once described by American commander David Petraeus as \u2018a truly evil figure\u2019, Suleimani was instrumental in crushing street protests in Iran in 2009. In recent months outbreaks of popular dissent in Lebanon, Iraq and Iran were again putting pressure on the crescent of influence he had spent the past two decades building. Violent crackdowns on the protests in Baghdad were blamed on militias under his influence.<br></p>\n      <p>Eighteen months before his death, Suleimani had issued Donald Trump a public warning, wagging his finger and dressed in olive fatigues. \u201cYou will start the war but we will end it.\u201d</p>\n      <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-safi\"><b>Michael Safi</b></a></p>\n      <p></p>\n     </div>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Texan Republican Michael McCaul spoke to back the strikes.

But <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_Lies_the_Crown\">heavy lies the crown</a>\u2026 with his new status came the avalanche of attacks from opponents that Sanders sceptics have long-warned the self-proclaimed \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d would face if he ever began to lead the pack. His <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-cold-war-travels-bernie-sanders-found-much-to-admire-behind-enemy-lines-now-thats-a-problem-for-his-campaign/2020/02/24/fd02fb50-572a-11ea-8753-73d96000faae_story.html\">\u201choneymoon\u201d to Moscow</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnBerman/status/1232299147455234048\">unwise articles</a> he <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/bloomberg-campaign-adviser-shocks-cnn-host-claiming-bernie-sanders-believes-women-get-cancer-1488978\">wrote</a> for an underground zine in the 60s and 70s about cancer, orgasms and <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2015/05/28/politics/bernie-sanders-rape-essay-1972/index.html\">rape fantasies</a>\u2026 Indeed, Sanders fanned the flames himself this week with typically unapologetic comments about Fidel Castro, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bernie-sanders-democratic-presidential-front-runner-anderson-cooper-60-minutes/\">telling CBS News</a> he was \u201copposed to the authoritarian nature of Cuba\u201d but adding: \u201cHe had a massive literacy program.

Even though Fidel Castro did it?\u201d There will be much more of this if Sanders\u2019 success continues with a strong showing in <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/sc/south_carolina_democratic_presidential_primary-6824.html\">South Carolina</a> tomorrow and victory on Super Tuesday, 3 March.</p> \n  <h2>Good week: Joe Biden</h2> \n  <p>Whisper it, but is Biden back? Democratic centrists will eventually have to coalesce around someone to take on Sanders, and after flirting with Pete Buttigieg, Mike Bloomberg and Amy Klobuchar, they may end up concluding that the former vice-president \u2013 for all his faults \u2013 looks the strongest. He was more focused and aggressive at the debate in South Carolina on Tuesday night, and employed some amusing self-deprecation at one point when he gave way to the moderator: \u201cWhy am I stopping? No one else stops. It\u2019s my Catholic school training.\u201d Relying on his firewall of African-American support, Biden has <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/sc/south_carolina_democratic_presidential_primary-6824.html\">solidified his lead in South Carolina</a> and can reasonably hope for a strong victory there on Saturday that might reboot his campaign. He can expect to scoop up a fair number of delegates on Super Tuesday too, particularly in Texas and North Carolina, although Sanders is increasingly leaving him for dust in <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/ca/california_democratic_primary-6879.html\">California</a>. Can he stage a comeback? Cutting out the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/us/politics/biden-south-africa-arrest-mandela.html\">questionable stories</a> about being arrested in South Africa might help.</p> \n  <h2>Not a great week: Mike Bloomberg</h2> \n  <p>Bloomberg had a better debate this week, but his social-media tactics came under fire after his team posted a controversial set of satirical tweets <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/25/mike-bloomberg-bernie-sanders-dictator-tweets-twitter\">featuring false comments</a> supposedly made by Sanders about various dictators. It wasn\u2019t his first offence \u2013 many objected to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/20/mike-bloomberg-debate-video-facebook-twitter-instagram\">misleadingly-edited video</a> his team had put out after the debate in Nevada \u2013 and the Bernie tweets were deleted. \u201cIt\u2019s the embracing of a cynical outlook: \u2018lol nothing matters\u2019,\u201d Whitney Phillips of Syracuse University <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/26/mike-bloomberg-social-media-strategy\">told the Guardian</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s leaning into nihilism.\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s national poll ratings have <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html\">flatlined</a> since his disastrous first debate performance \u2013 he remains in third place behind Biden and Sanders \u2013 and he has dipped back below Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg too in the crucial Super Tuesday state of California, when he enters the race proper.</p> \n  <h2>Bad week: Donald Trump</h2> \n  <p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned this week that the coronavirus Covid-19 could could cause \u201csevere disruption\u201d to the lives of ordinary Americans, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/25/coronavirus-outbreak-severe-disruption-america-cdc-united-states\">adding</a>: \u201cIt\u2019s not so much a question of if this will happen any more, but rather more exactly when this will happen, and how many people in this country will have severe illness.\u201d Donald Trump didn\u2019t like that. On a trip to India earlier that day he had already told reporters that the coronavirus was \u201cvery well under control in our country\u201d and \u201cis going to go away\u201d. He later hit out at the media for \u201cdoing everything possible to make the Caronavirus [sic] look as bad as possible, including panicking markets, if possible\u201d. That last element seemed key \u2013 an economic slowdown caused by the virus could seriously damage Trump\u2019s chances of re-election, and the stock market is his favourite measure of his own success. The day after a less-than-reassuring press conference in which Trump put vice-president Mike Pence in charge of the anti-virus effort, the Dow had its <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-markets/dow-suffers-record-decline-in-points-as-wall-street-leads-global-stocks-lower-idUSKCN20L05A?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosam&amp;stream=top\">worst-ever daily drop</a> and the S&amp;P 500 posted its largest fall since August 2011<strong>.</strong></p> \n  <h2>Worst week: Mike Pence.</h2> \n  <p>Well, would you want to head up the coronavirus response? Such a poisoned chalice is the VP\u2019s new job that there was even <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SethAbramson/status/1233017450318434306\">speculation</a> Trump could eventually use it as a pretext for dropping Pence from the 2020 ticket \u2013 perhaps replacing him with a telegenic woman such as former UN ambassador Nikki Haley. Not to worry, though, Pence is \u201creally very expert at the field\u201d of healthcare, as Trump told his press conference on Wednesday. So expert that he notoriously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/27/mike-pence-coronavirus-response-experts\">wrote on his website</a> in 2000: \u201cDespite the hysteria from the political class and the media, smoking doesn\u2019t kill.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e58f0898f08e1332474be4f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-28T12:21:20.903Z\">12.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Yes, it is a crucial primary on Saturday for Joe Biden.

Here\u2019s a rundown of the top stories: A federal court blocked Trump\u2019s Remain in Mexico policy, which barred asylum seekers from the country while their claims were under consideration in immigration court. Here\u2019s a full report. The House judiciary committee launched an investigation of attorney general William Barr and DOJ, over concerns that Barr has politicized prosecutions. Donald Trump nominated Congressman John Ratcliffe to be the director of national intelligence \u2013 for the second time. Ratcliffe was nominated last summer but was quickly withdrawn from consideration when questions were raised about his qualifications. Joe Biden admitted that he was not arrested in South Africa. Donald Trump is holding a rally in South Carolina. A Wisconsin court of appeals overturned an order to purge 200,000 voters from the state\u2019s rolls. A federal appeals court said that it would not get involved in Congress\u2019s efforts to force former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify, effectively letting him off the hook from a congressional subpoena. And finally, Democratic presidential rivals are holding last minute get-out-the-vote rallies ahead of tomorrow\u2019s South Carolina primary. We have a full day of coverage planned for you, and you can keep on top of the latest news on the coronavirus in our ongoing liveblog here. Trump is ad-libbing on the coronavirus at his rally in South Carolina, Oliver Laughland reports. The president is using the epidemic to justify his anti-immigration policy \u2013 and attack Democrats: We are doing everything in our power to keep the infection and those carrying the infection from entering the country. We have no choice. Whether it\u2019s the virus that we\u2019re talking about, or the many other public health threats, the Democrat policy of open borders is a direct threat to the health and wellbeing of all Americans. Now you see it with the coronavirus\u2026 when you have this virus, or any other virus, or any other problem coming in, it\u2019s not the only thing that comes in through the border\u2026 and we\u2019re setting records at the border, we\u2019re setting records, and now, just using this, important, so important. For factual information about the coronavirus, please see our rolling coverage here. Another assault on reproductive rights (and the US constitution) just passed the state senate in Utah. The proposed law, Senate Bill 174, is unconstitutional. It would outlaw all elective abortions, with exceptions only for cases of rape, incest and danger to the mother\u2019s health. Abortion is legal under current Supreme Court precedent. Many states have passed similarly unconstitutional laws in recent years. If enacted, the laws are generally struck down quickly by federal courts. Adam Schiff, the chair of the House Intelligence committee, also has harsh criticism for Trump\u2019s re-nomination of John Ratcliffe as DNI. Guardian US reporters are out and about in South Carolina on the eve of the \u201cfirst in the south\u201d primary. Joan Greve is in Columbia, where voters are line-dancing ahead of a Tom Steyer rally. Meanwhile, Oliver Laughland and Daniel Strauss are keeping an eye on the 22nd Amendment of the US constitution at the Trump rally in North Charleston. Lest you thought Senate Democrats would forget that they did not want John Ratcliffe appointed director of national intelligence, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer just came out with a strong statement opposing the nomination: Former White House counsel Don McGahn can ignore a subpoena from Congress, a federal appeals court ruled Friday. The decision is a blow to Congressional Democrats, who had sought judicial intervention after Donald Trump barred his top advisers from testifying. The decision, by a three-judge panel of the DC circuit court of appeals, reverses a lower court ruling that would have forced McGahn to testify, the AP reports. Per the AP: \u201cThe walk from the Capitol to our courthouse is a short one, and if we resolve this case today, we can expect Congress\u2019s lawyers to make the trip often,\u201d wrote Judge Thomas Griffith, an appointee of former President George W. Bush. He was joined in the 2-1 ruling by Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson, an appointee of President George H.W. Bush. Judge Judith Rogers, an appointee of President Bill Clinton, dissented. She said her colleagues\u2019 opinion \u201call but assures future Presidential stonewalling of Congress, and further impairs the House\u2019s ability to perform its constitutional duties.\u201d Congress can still ask the full appeals court to review the case. It can also appeal to the Supreme court. Speaking of intelligence chiefs ... Leon Panetta, whose long career in government includes stints as CIA director and secretary of defense during the Obama administration, just endorsed Joe Biden in the Democratic presidential primary. If the announcement of John Ratcliffe as Trump\u2019s nominee for director of national intelligence gives you a feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, it\u2019s because we were here \u2013 literally \u2013 just seven months ago. My colleague Julian Borger wrote about some of the concerns over Ratcliffe\u2019s \u2013 \u201can inexperienced but loyal partisan\u201d \u2013 at the time. \u201cTrump is consolidating his personal control over the intelligence community,\u201d said Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, a former CIA intelligence officer. He said the current directors of the CIA and FBI have found their hands tied increasingly when it comes to accurate intelligence assessment, by risk of being fired for something at odds with Trump\u2019s views. \u201cI fear that there is a slow takeover of the norms and procedures of governance by this president, amassing unprecedented executive power,\u201d Mowatt-Larssen, now at Harvard University\u2019s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, added. \u201cTo do that he needs to neutralise or at least silence the intelligence community. He has been doing that for three years, but this takes it to the new level.\u201d You can read Julian\u2019s full report here. Donald Trump just announced the nomination of John Ratcliffe, a Republican congressman from Texas, as director of national intelligence (DNI). The position is the highest ranking intelligence officer and oversees coordination among the US\u2019s 17 intelligence agencies. This is the second time that Trump attempted to name Ratcliffe to the position. In late July 2019, Trump announced the Texan as his intended choice for the position, only to withdraw the name following critical press reports of Ratcliffe\u2019s record and experience. The announcement comes just over a week after the president named Richard Grenell, a Trump loyalist who was serving as the US ambassador to Germany, as the acting DNI. Grenell\u2019s nomination, which was not subject to senate confirmation, sparked immediate controversy. Grenell has no experience in intelligence or the military, and was best known as a fierce partisan for Trump. It\u2019s been a lively afternoon and the evening will be no less action-packed, as Donald Trump prepares for his rally in South Carolina on the eve of that state\u2019s crucially-important Democratic primary voting. My colleague in Oakland, California, Julia Carrie Wong, is taking the reins of this blog now and will keep you posted on events in the coming hours. As a reminder, we have a separate, dedicated, live blog covering global news developments related to the coronavirus outbreak. You can follow that here. The issue gets an occasional mention in this blog, depending on what the Trump administration is up to moment to moment. Here are the main US politics news events that have happened this afternoon: Trump wants the US Federal Reserve to \u201cget involved\u201d to support the economy as coronavirus concerns hit the financial markets. An appeals court in Wisconsin has overturned a ruling that would have allowed a mass purge of voter rolls, which would have disproportionately affected Democrats. The president is on his way to an eve-of-primary rally in North Charleston, South Carolina. It starts at 7pm ET. A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration\u2019s controversial \u201cWait in Mexico\u201d US-Mexico border policy, with many prominent Democrats tweeting heartfelt reaction, praising the ruling. The president is on his way to a rally in South Carolina and has been making remarks on his way to Air Force One. Here\u2019s one: He\u2019s referring to anticipation that the Fed might lower interest rates to offset economic jitters caused by the spreading coronavirus. Farage barrage Nigel Farage, dubbed \u201cthe Godfather of Brexit\u201d in the official CPAC programme, urged attendees of the conservative event to help Bernie Sanders win the Democratic nomination \u2013 and thus, in his view, guarantee a landslide victory for his \u201cfriend\u201d Donald Trump in the November 2020 election. Farage, always a popular turn at CPAC, said of the recent British general election: \u201cOne of the things that made it easier for Boris [Johnson] was a man called Jeremy Corbyn. The British Labour party had been hijacked by hard left, unpatriotic socialism.\u201d US Democrats will suffer the same fate under democratic socialist Sanders, he suggested. \u201cYou should be backing Bernie Sanders. You should be campaigning for Bernie Sanders. You should be donating money to Bernie Sanders.\u201d Farage, who waved a small Union flag on stage, added: \u201cI think with Bernie, you won\u2019t just get Trump. I think with Bernie, you can retake the House too.\u201d The crowd at this year\u2019s CPAC event, in Oxon Hill, Maryland, burst into chants of \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d Environmental gaslighting Donald Trump\u2019s environment chief, in a panel discussion at the high-profile Conservative Political Action Committee event near Washington, earlier today claimed that \u201cour environment is cleaner today than it has ever been,\u201d my colleague Emily Holden writes, from the CPAC event. Andrew Wheeler, a former fossil fuel lobbyist, has led the administration\u2019s rollbacks of dozens of environmental protections. Wheeler said the media doesn\u2019t tell the story of a cleaner environment. \u201cYou don\u2019t hear that in most news organizations or the newspapers,\u201d he said. Wheeler frequently cites the statistic that air pollution has declined 74% since 1970. But recent data has shown that after years of improvement, the air has gotten dirtier since 2016. The Environmental Protection Agency administrator also defended his policy of considering only studies that have publicly-available data, which scientists have said will prevent the government from incorporating the findings of research that involves private health data. Clean water A Wisconsin court of appeals has overturned an order to purge more than 200,000 voters from rolls in this important swing state. The court had previously put on hold an order to immediately remove up to 209,000 names from the state\u2019s voter registration rolls, handing Democrats who had fought the move a victory in the battleground state, my colleague Sam Levine wrote last month. The appeals court had sided with the bipartisan state elections commission in putting the brakes on removing any voters while the court fight continues. It also put on hold a ruling from Monday in which a judge found the commission and its three Democratic members in contempt for not proceeding with removing the voters The orders came as the commission was meeting in a closed session with attorneys from the state justice department to discuss the case. A conservative law firm that brought the case, the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, had wanted the purge to happen immediately, even though the elections commission raised concerns about the accuracy of data used to identify voters who would have their registrations deactivated. On Friday, the Hill writes, the order was overturned and would be: A boost to Democrats in a state that\u2019s poised to play a decisive role the 2020 presidential race. Trump won Wisconsin by fewer than 23,000 votes in 2016. The Wisconsin Institute for Law &amp; Liberty, said it plans to appeal the ruling to the state Supreme Court. A lower court judge in January ordered the purging of more than 200,000 people from voter rolls because they may have moved. On Friday, the appeals court also overturned an order by the same judge that had found the state elections commission in contempt for not moving forward with the voter roll purge. The plaintiffs in the original case argued that the state elections commission should have immediately deactivated registered voters who didn\u2019t respond within 30 days to a mailing sent in October, an indication that the person may have moved. \u201cViolated due process\u201d Judiciary committee chairman and New York Democrat Jerry Nadler (who this morning wrote to attorney general Bill Barr requesting congressional interview with key officials amid concerns over presidential interference in the justice system), has also responded on Twitter to the court ruling blocking Trump\u2019s \u201cWait in Mexico\u201d border policy. \u201cFrom day one, @HouseJudiciary has said the \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy was illegal and violated due process, which is why we launched a comprehensive investigation into its origins. Proud to see the 9th Circuit put a halt to this fatally flawed program,\u201d he said. Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal said: \u201cThe courts agree the Trump admin\u2019s remain in Mexico policy is cruel &amp; inhumane. As a country we should not banish people fleeing persecution to continue to wait in unsafe uncertainty. A clear violation of the law.\u201d And Texas congressman Filemon Vela said: \u201cThough the 9th Circuit\u2019s decision almost certainly will be appealed, for now it stops the policy nationwide. The Trump admin. had been declaring near-victory in stemming immigration just weeks ago, in part because of MPP\u2019s success. We must #EndMPP for good.\u201d \u201cPuts asylum seekers in danger\u201d Current presidential contender Elizabeth Warren has also weighed in on the hammering of Trump\u2019s \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d border policy. She tweeted that the news of this morning\u2019s court ruling was excellent. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s cruel \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy put asylum seekers in danger. As president, I will reverse the Trump administration\u2019s cruel immigration policies and ensure that asylum seekers are welcomed at our borders,\u201d she said. New Mexico Senator Tom Udall tweeted that the policy news was a relief. \u201cWe cannot allow the Trump administration to continue punishing asylum seekers with its hateful and dangerous policies. Offering a place for those who need refuge is a bedrock part of what America is all about,\u201d he said. House foreign affairs committee chairman, Eliot Engel, called the policy heartless, in a tweet. \u201cI applaud the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling. Trump\u2019s \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy is heartless for those seeking asylum in our country. The Administration continues to demonize people coming to our country, but they are on the wrong side of history,\u201d he said. One of the impeachment managers in Trump\u2019s recent Senate impeachment trial, congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, called the policy \u201cinhumane\u201d in her tweet, saying: \u201c\u2018Remain in Mexico\u2019 is inconsistent w/@DHSgov\u2019s authority &amp; inhumanely forces thousands to wait in dangerous conditions before their asylum claims are heard. It\u2019s a harmful policy &amp; I\u2019m glad the court rejected it.\u201d \u201cHeartless and unlawful\u201d Reaction is still coming in to the news that a federal appeals judge in California has blocked the harsh Trump administration policy of forcing asylum seekers who cross the US-Mexico border to wait in Mexico for the duration of their immigration court cases. New Jersey Senator and former 2020 presidential candidate Cory Booker just tweeted that: \u201cTrump\u2019s war on immigrants is an affront to our values and ideals. I\u2019m glad that this heartless and unlawful policy is suspended. We must treat all people with dignity and respect. Period.\u201d Biden still working for votes in SC My Washington colleague Joanie Greve reports from Columbia, South Carolina, that Biden is on the move: Joan will be back in her usual spot helming this blog tomorrow evening as we await the results of this nail-biting primary, but on location! About an hour from now, Donald Trump will emerge from the White House en route for North Charleston, South Carolina, where he will hold a rally tonight, in what has become a classic Trumpian move to troll his Democratic opponents just before the latest caucus or primary. My colleague, Oliver Laughland, is in the state ahead of tomorrow\u2019s primary and will be reporting from the rally tonight. He\u2019s mentioned that voters in Trump\u2019s base have been camping out all night to attend the rally. More: Gosh, meanwhile, another witness reported this: Meanwhile, earlier today, as Olly reports, he spent some time with the family of Walter Scott, ahead of this very important primary. Olly writes: Walter Scott\u2019s fatal encounter with a white North Charleston police officer gripped the national and international news agenda in 2015 as the most powerful example of the fatal consequences of racially biased policing. The incident was captured on video by a witness, which showed Scott running away as he was shot five times in the back by officer Michael Slager, who is now serving a 20 year federal prison sentence following a rare conviction against a police officer caught using excessive force. The case also propelled Scott\u2019s family into the national conversation about race and policing, which dominated the final years of the Obama administration before mostly shrinking away from mainstream discourse as Donald Trump entered office in 2016. But as the fifth anniversary of the shooting approaches in April, Anthony and others associated with the case hope the South Carolina primary on Saturday will serve as a reminder of the truths it unveiled, and thrust police and criminal justice reform into the spotlight again on the 2020 ballot. Here\u2019s the full report. Trump statement on Afghanistan: Here\u2019s the full statement: Nearly 19 years ago, American service members went to Afghanistan to root out the terrorists responsible for the 9/11 attacks. In that time, we have made great progress in Afghanistan, but at great cost to our brave service members, to the American taxpayers, and to the people of Afghanistan. When I ran for office, I promised the American people I would begin to bring our troops home, and seek to end this war. We are making substantial progress on that promise. Soon, at my direction, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will witness the signing of an agreement with representatives of the Taliban, while Secretary of Defense Mark Esper will issue a joint declaration with the government of Afghanistan. If the Taliban and the government of Afghanistan live up to these commitments, we will have a powerful path forward to end the war in Afghanistan and bring our troops home. These commitments represent an important step to a lasting peace in a new Afghanistan, free from Al Qaeda, ISIS, and any other terrorist group that would seek to bring us harm. Ultimately it will be up to the people of Afghanistan to work out their future. We, therefore, urge the Afghan people to seize this opportunity for peace and a new future for their country. I thank the hundreds of thousands of American warriors who have proudly served in Afghanistan. We have killed or captured many ISIS and Al Qaeda terrorists. We honor your service and the sacrifices you and your families have made for the American people. These agreements are a result of the strenuous efforts of those who fought so hard in Afghanistan for the United States of America. With some more detail, here the Associated Press: Trump said he\u2019s dispatching the nation\u2019s top diplomat to sign an agreement with the Afghan Taliban aimed at beginning a draw down of thousands of US troops and ending America\u2019s 18-year involvement in the war. Trump said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would soon, at his direction, witness the signing of an agreement with the Taliban, an event that will see him stand with leaders of militants, who harbored al-Qaida before the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the US and are responsible for the deaths of thousands of American servicemen and women. He said defense secretary Mark Esper also will issue a joint declaration with the government of Afghanistan. Trump did not say where the deal would be signed, but it\u2019s been previously reported that it would occur on Saturday in Doha, Qatar. Signing the deal comes after a week in which both US-led forces and the Taliban committed to a reduction in violence. Under the plan being signed, the US is to reduce the number of troops in Afghanistan to 8,600 from about 13,000. Donald Trump has just issued a statement from the White House. The key paragraph says this: Soon, at my direction, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will witness the signing of an agreement with representatives of the Taliban, while Secretary of Defense Mark Esper will issue a joint declaration with the government of Afghanistan. If the Taliban and the government of Afghanistan live up to these commitments, we will have a powerful path forward to end the war in Afghanistan and bring our troops home..... Ultimately it will be up to the people of Afghanistan to work out their future. We, therefore, urge the Afghan people to seize this opportunity for peace and a new future for their country.\u201d Schumer slams Mulvaney over coronavirus rubbish Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, has fired back at acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney over remarks the Republican made this morning about the coronavirus outbreak, where he blamed concerns as nothing more than a \u201choax\u201d by Dems to sway the election and accused the media of stoking fears. This bearing in mind other countries are closing schools, canceling public events and the US government\u2019s own health advisers have warned of impending disruption to American life as the illness inevitably spreads. You can follow our coronavirus global live blog here. \u201cFor Mick Mulvaney to suggest that Americans turn off their TVs and bury their heads in the sand when they\u2019re worried about a global health pandemic is Orwellian, counterproductive, dangerous, and would be repeating China\u2019s mistake,\u201d Schumer just tweeted. Oh and the Fed said it might drop interest rates to calm market jitters. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has told the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) today that Donald Trump\u2019s administration has been forced to \u201ccorrect\u201d the wishful thinking mistakes of its predecessors. \u201cNo policy built on fantasy has worked,\u201d he told attendees. \u201cIt\u2019s what we\u2019ve had to correct in our time.\u201d Past administrations were proud of past agreements, such as the Iran nuclear deal or Paris climate accords, he said, and enjoyed attending signing ceremonies. \u201cThe point is changing behaviour, not signing documents,\u201d Pompeo continued. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s a smart business leader. We changed course. We got better deals for each and every one of you.\u201d The secretary sent a defiant message to critics who said US-Mexico border security could never be strengthened or trade deals could never be renegotiated. Both have been achieved, he claimed. \u201cThey said taking out Qassem Suleimani would lead to world war three and it\u2019s actually made our world far safer,\u201d Pompeo added. \u201cThey said moving our embassy to Jerusalem would set the Middle East alight and that didn\u2019t happen. Our plan represents the best chance for peace in decades.\u201d It\u2019s been a busy morning in US politics and there is plenty more drama to come. Reaction is still emerging to the latest breaking news story that a court has blocked Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d border policy. Later this afternoon, the president is due to leave the White House just after 4pm ET to head for the chopper and then Air Force One to fly to a rally in...Charlesteon, South Carolina, tonight - a classic Trump catfish move the night before the Democratic primary there. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happened so far today: A federal appeals judge in California late this morning blocked the Trump policy of forcing asylum seekers crossing the border from Mexico into the US to go back to Mexico and stay there for the duration of their immigration court cases in America (which can take an eternity to process). Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney called concerns about the coronavirus outbreak a hoax engineered by Democrats and stoked by the media. He was speaking at the CPAC event. Our dedicated coronavirus live blog is here). Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine endorsed Joe Biden this morning, a valuable boost for the struggling presidential candidate ahead of Super Tuesday next week. Meanwhile, Biden admitted he was never arrested in South Africa while trying to visit Nelson Mandela in prison. And the biggest news of the morning was that Congress wrote to attorney general Bill Barr and wants to question Department of Justice officials, including the prosecutors from the Roger Stone case, over concerns of presidential political interference in the justice process. \u201cThis policy is flatly illegal\u201d Harvard law professor Larry Tribe has this reaction to the news that a court has blocked Trump\u2019s \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy that sends asylum seekers crossing into the US back across the border to Mexico, where they find themselves waiting for months and months in often squalid and dangerous conditions for their court hearings in America. Responding to the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\u2019s ruling, upholding the preliminary injunction halting the Trump administration\u2019s so-called \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy, under which the U government forcibly returns asylum-seekers to Mexico indefinitely while they ask for asylum in the US, Amnesty International USA\u2019s advocacy director for the Americas, Charanya Krishnaswami, said: \u201cThis policy was never designed to work; it was designed solely to deter people from exercising their right to seek asylum. \u201cNow that the Ninth Circuit has halted this unconscionable policy, the tens of thousands of asylum-seekers already subjected to it must immediately be given the chance to make their asylum claims from within the United States - a chance they should have all along. \u201cRather than appealing this decision, the U.S. government should instead seek to reverse the harm this policy has wrought upon people seeking safety and restore its commitment to the right to seek asylum at the US border.\u201d Reaction is coming in to the news that a federal appeals court has immediately blocked the Trump administration\u2019s policy that forces asylum seeking migrants crossing the US-Mexico border to return to Mexico and remain there indefinitely while their asylum applications are processed in the United States, which can drag on indefinitely. The American Civil Liberties Union, the Center for Gender &amp; Refugee Studies, and Southern Poverty Law Center are challenging the policy and presented arguments in October 2019 to the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The groups won a preliminary injunction in April, and in May the Ninth Circuit temporarily allowed the policy to take effect as the government appealed the injunction. ACLU attorney Judy Rabinovitz, who argued the appeal, said this afternoon: \u201cThe court forcefully rejected the Trump administration\u2019s assertion that it could strand asylum seekers in Mexico and subject them to grave danger. It\u2019s time for the administration to follow the law and stop putting asylum seekers in harm\u2019s way.\u201d The case, Innovation Law Lab v. Wolf, was brought on behalf of 11 individual asylum seekers who were forced to return to Mexico to wait, and organizational plaintiffs Innovation Law Lab, the Central American Resource Center of Northern California, Centro Legal de la Raza, the University of San Francisco School of Law Immigration and Deportation Defense Clinic, Al Otro Lado, and the Tahirih Justice Center. Major development in the story of the one of the many cruel strands of the Trump administration\u2019s US-Mexico border policy. A federal court on Friday upended a central pillar of the Trump administration\u2019s immigration agenda, ruling that asylum seekers must be allowed into the United States while their often lengthy cases meander through American immigration courts. A three-judge panel in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco blocked a policy that has required people applying for asylum at the border to wait in Mexico while their claims for protection are reviewed, a process that often takes months or years, the New York Times\u2019s Caitlin Dickerson reports. A panel of the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled today in a 2-1 vote to put on hold the policy that furthered Donald Trump\u2019s asylum crackdown, the AP adds. The \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy - known officially as \u201cMigrant Protection Protocols\u201d - took effect in January 2019 in San Diego and has spread along the border. Nearly 60,000 people have been sent back since the policy began. The question before the judges was whether to let the policy take effect during legal challenges. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney has said concerns in the US over the coronavirus outbreak is A. a Democratic party hoax and B. is all about the media stoking fear as a plot to take down Donald Trump. Just a note that our main coverage of the coronavirus outbreak is on the website and in our dedicated live blog. But this latest news dev should be mentioned here, too. And this: Mulvaney was talking at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) Republican love-in at the National Harbor near Washington, from where my colleague David Smith sent a report published earlier today. Bill \u201clet me do my job\u201d Barr Attorney general William Barr has made efforts in recent days to beat back critics\u2019 concerns that he was doing the president\u2019s political bidding, by urging Donald Trump to stop tweeting about criminal cases - after Trump intervened in the Roger Stone case ahead of sentencing - because his comments were undercutting his ability to do his job. Trump had intervened in the form of a tweet calling prosecutors\u2019 sentencing recommendation \u201ca horrible and very unfair situation\u201d. Barr then caused the recommendation to be changed, prompting a call for the attorney general\u2019s resignation from more than 2,600 former justice department officials, my colleague Tom McCarthy wrote last week. Barr\u2019s public plea for Trump to back off was characterized by former US attorney and Trump foil Preet Bharara thusly in a tweet: \u201cI think Bill Barr is shrewd, deliberate, smart, calculating, careful, and full of it,\u201d tweeted the former US attorney Preet Bharara. Amid this scandal, Trump also abruptly withdrew the nomination of Jessie Liu, the former US attorney for the District of Columbia, who oversaw the Roger Stone case, for a new top post at the Treasury Department overseeing economic sanctions, the AP writes today. Judiciary committee chairman Jerry Nadler, in his letter to Barr this morning, said he also wants to interview Liu, as well as Tim Shea, the current interim US attorney for the District of Columbia whom Barr appointed to replace Liu. Despite Barr\u2019s pleas, Trump has nevertheless continued tweeting and has attacked the judge, jurors and prosecutors involved in the Stone case. At Stone\u2019s sentencing last week, US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said Trump\u2019s tweets were inappropriate and would have no bearing on her decision-making. A Justice Department spokeswoman could not be immediately reached for comment on the committee\u2019s request. Trump aggrieved over Fox poll Yes indeed. Here\u2019s the tweet (bearing in mind America\u2019s federal disease prevention agency is warning of impending disruption in the US caused by the coronavirus, while Trump is tweeting only about himself this morning): And here\u2019s a story on the new Fox News poll from last night. It shows the six leading Democratic candidates, from Amy Klobuchar up to Joe Biden, beating Trump in a match-up in November\u2019s election. Biden and Mike Bloomberg would beat Trump by eight points, according to the poll, Sanders by seven points, Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg by three and Klobuchar by one point. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has voiced skepticism that the president can be trusted to steer America through the coronavirus outbreak. As just mentioned, all the main global and US news on the illness is being covered separately, especially in our dedicated coronavirus liveblog, but there is the odd moment of crossover with our general politics live blog and this is one such. Biden spoke about the apparent sidelining of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the US\u2019s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and a primary figure in the frontline of America\u2019s response to the outbreak and spread of the virus. And about, as just mentioned, the qualification or otherwise of vice president Mike Pence to helm US action on this. \u201cI can understand a vice president coordinating it, I have coordinated a number of things,\u201d said Biden, the former vice president in Barack Obama\u2019s administration. He went on in a TV interview: \u201cNo-one takes the president\u2019s word for these things...he stands there and says everything is fine - who\u2019s going to believe him?\u201d And he said: \u201cDr Fauci is not allowed to speak publicly. What is all this about?\u201d A quick reminder that while this blog is focusing on general US politics news today the Guardian also has a terrific live blog dedicated to covering the coronavirus outbreak as well as our regular business live blog that\u2019s keeping an eye on related plunges in the markets, as the Dow nosedives again today. And there are separate extrapolations of all the most important angles in articles on our website, too, of course, such as whether vice president Mike Pence is suitably qualified to helm the Trump administration\u2019s response to the outbreak. And this is worth noting: Allegations of political interference in the DoJ by Donald Trump In his letter to attorney general Bill Barr this morning, House judiciary committee chairman Jerry Nadler expresses the need to interview many Department of Justice officials who have worked on cases involving Trump close associates, such as disgraced national security adviser Michael Flynn (who has yet to be sentenced despite pleading guilty more than two years ago to lying to the FBI about his Russian contacts). The judiciary committee also wants to interview officials \u201cwho were tapped by Barr to review cases Trump has openly criticized\u201d, according to this Politico piece, which continues: Among the officials Nadler is seeking to interview are John Durham, the US attorney from Connecticut who was picked by Barr to review the origins of the FBI\u2019s probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election; Jeff Jensen, the US attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri, whom Barr selected to review the case of Flynn; Robert Khuzami, the former New York-based prosecutor who oversaw the case against Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen; and Richard Donoghue, the US attorney for the Eastern District of New York, whom Barr picked to review all matters related to the Ukraine scandal that led to Trump\u2019s impeachment in the House last year. But the most head-turning in the breakneck speed world of Trump scandals is the request to interview the prosecutors in the Roger Stone case. Mixed poll news for Biden It\u2019s a nail-biting, see-sawing kind of day for Joe Biden as he launches into the absolutely crucial five days for his presidential campaign that span the South Carolina primary tomorrow and Super Tuesday voting in more than a dozen states on March 3. Just hours before he received Senator Tim Kaine\u2019s endorsement, a new ABC-Ipsos poll out this morning asked Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, based on the most recent candidate debates (in Las Vegas and Charleston), who has the best chance of beating Donald Trump in November. A booming 34% said Bernie Sanders, while only 25% said Biden. In more worries for Elizabeth Warren, she was behind Mike Bloomberg, at 11% support in the \u201celectability\u201d poll in contrast to his 15%. It looks even more bleak for Amy Klobuchar at 3%, behind Pete Buttigieg at 8%. But a poll in South Carolina yesterday still had Biden narrowly ahead of Sanders in his chances of winning the primary there. Virginia Democratic Senator and Hillary Clinton\u2019s choice for the vice presidential place on her 2016 ticket, Tim Kaine, has just endorsed Joe Biden in a welcome boost for Biden the day before the crucial South Carolina primary tomorrow and just four days before Super Tuesday, when Virginia voters go to the polls to choose their candidate for the Democratic nomination to challenge Donald Trump in the November election. Virginia is a key swing state and it will be interesting to see if and where Kaine hits the campaign trail for Biden this weekend. It is unclear whether the department of justice will cooperate with any part of the new House committee probe that was just revealed. Donald Trump has previously vowed to block \u201call\u201d of the subpoenas from Democrats and refused to cooperate with their impeachment inquiry last year. Still, despite his declarations, many administration officials came forward during the impeachment probe once they were faced with subpoenas, the AP further reports. Barr has already agreed to testify before the committee on March 31. It will be the first time he has appeared before the panel since he became attorney general a year ago, and the meeting is sure to be contentious. Since Barr was sworn in, House Democrats have questioned whether he was too close to Trump, criticized his handling of former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s 2019 report resulting from the Trump-Russia investigation, and then impeached Trump for his pressure on Ukraine to investigate Democrats, principally his election rival Joe Biden. The Senate acquitted Trump earlier this month after the historic impeachment trial. In the letter this morning, Nadler asked for a broad swath of documents related to the committee\u2019s concerns, including communications between Trump and the Justice Department. The committee is unlikely to get any of those documents, as a president\u2019s personal conversations are generally considered privileged by the courts. Just after the Senate voted to acquit Trump, Barr faced blowback over his decision to overrule the prosecutors in the Stone case. Trump congratulated Barr shortly afterward. Stone was convicted of lying to Congress, witness tampering and obstructing the House investigation into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia to tip the 2016 election. He was sentenced last week to more than three years in prison. When Stone was convicted last November, the Guardian detailed how he had been accused of having connections to Wikileaks and being involved in the leaking of US Democratic party emails stolen by the Russians during the 2016 election. The House Judiciary Committee is launching a wide-ranging probe of attorney general William Barr and the US Justice Department, demanding briefings, documents and interviews with 15 officials - including the prosecutors who quit the Roger Stone case - as it tries to determine whether there has been improper political interference in federal law enforcement. Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler, the Democratic congressman of New York, this morning sent Barr a letter listing a series of matters that the committee finds \u201cdeeply troubling,\u201d the AP reports. This includes Barr\u2019s involvement in the case of Donald Trump\u2019s longtime confidant Roger Stone, in which the president also intervened prior to Stone\u2019s sentencing last week. Stone was convicted in November of lying to Congress and other charges. Barr overruled prosecutors who had recommended that Stone be sentenced to seven to nine years in prison, leading the four top prosecutors on the case to step down from it. Nadler also is questioning Barr about his involvement in other cases related to friends and associates of Trump and about internal investigations into department employees who investigated Trump after the 2016 election. \u201cAlthough you serve at the President\u2019s pleasure, you are also charged with the impartial administration of our laws,\u201d Nadler wrote to Barr. \u201cIn turn, the House Judiciary Committee is charged with holding you to that responsibility.\u201d The committee is asking for briefings on the issues listed and interviews with 15 Justice Department officials involved in those matters, including the four prosecutors who resigned from the Stone case. Breaking news: The House is asking the Department of Justice to present as witnesses the four career prosecutors who quit the legal case of Roger Stone after Donald Trump intervened to defend his convicted friend before his sentencing. Stone was sentenced to a lengthy prison term last week in federal court in Washington, DC. US secretary of state Mike Pompeo and progressive firebrand congresswoman Ilhan Omar just had a spirited exchange at the foreign affairs committee hearing that is still underway on Iran and Iraq. You can watch the livestream here. Pompeo argued that the assassination by the US of Iran\u2019s military top dog, Qassem Suleimani, in Iraq at the beginning of January has made things \u201cfar safer\u201d for the American people. But committee member Omar asked how that could be when, in prior Iranian-backed, storming protests at the US embassy in Baghdad, \u201cthe people who were at the US embassy said they were not warned\u201d and yet in the fall-out from the killing of Suleimani, US diplomats, such as Iran specialist Brian Hook, have needed a special \u201ccounter assault team\u201d when at public eventsw. Omar cited special protection measures taken when Hook, special representative for Iran and senior policy adviser to Pompeo, attended an event in Los Angeles where he defended the US strike on Suleimani. Uncle Sam\u2019s nightmare? Here\u2019s what the conservative-leaning Economist magazine thinks of the prospect of a Donald Trump vs Bernie Sanders match-up in the 2020 election. It\u2019s more really terrible timing for Joe Biden. On the eve of the South Carolina primary, where strong support from black voters is crucial to his floundering campaign, he\u2019s just been obliged to clarify a story that\u2019s been dogging him and admit that he was NOT once arrested in South Africa while trying to visit that greatest civil rights icon, Nelson Mandela, in prison. His campaign had been struggling to deal with reports for days that this \u201carrest\u201d he has boasted of never happened and a recent, incomplete, explanation was that Biden was forcibly separated from a group of African campaigners, in a process of being coerced to go through segregated doors in apartheid South Africa during a congressional human rights trip in the 1970s. Appearing on CNN this morning, Biden was finally obliged to tell the truth of it, after yet another series of unforced errors in his campaign that has been nosediving since a poor showing in the Iowa caucuses in early February. Biden, however, is still just ahead of Bernie Sanders is South Carolina polling. He also told CNN that Democrats \u201ccannot shoot and miss\u201d in their efforts to oust Donald Trump from the White House in November. Hello, everyone, the US politics live blog helm now switches from London to (today) New York and we\u2019ll take you through the rest of another action packed day before handing over to our colleagues in Oakland, California for the evening. Just a reminder that although we may touch here and there on the US political angle of the coronavirus outbreak in this blog, all the main US and global news on this vital story is being covered in our separate, dedicated live blog, here, and in other US-related coronavirus articles. Although, here\u2019s the next New Yorker cover: The session has now returned to the discussion of Qassem Suleimani, and the US strike to kill him. Pompeo said that \u201cHe was in the region actively plotting to kill Americans\u201d and that \u201cIt was my judgement that this reduced risks to America to take this strike.\u201d He said it would reduce risks short, medium and long-term. Texan Republican Michael McCaul spoke to back the strikes. He said \u201cAmericans in the region are certainly safer because of this decision. I was in some of these discussions and the president was very clear \u2018I do not want to go with war with Iran\u2019. They crossed a red line when they attacked our embassy.\u201d There have been some sharp words of criticism for Pompeo\u2019s unwillingness to appear at this session - with it being pointed out that it has taken him two months to appear. Brad Sherman asked if it would take two months from now before he would appear to answer questions about coronavirus. Pompeo has only agreed to appear for two hours, and this has been contrasted with the eleven hour session that Hillary Clinton endured when the same committee, with Pompeo as part of it, interrogated her about Benghazi. Although the theme of the House Foreign Affairs Committee session this morning was due to be Iran and Iraq, discussion has immediately and inevitably pivoted to discussing the coronavirus outbreak. Rhode Island Democrat David Cicilline attacked the administration, saying that after three years the American people weren\u2019t sure they could trust the government to handle the crisis Pompeo has criticised Iran for not sharing information about the outbreak in the country, and confirmed that the US had offered to help Iran. He was also a little testy about the change of topic. California Democrat Ami Bera has suggested that US policy of isolating Iran has hampered Iranian efforts to combat the virus outbreak. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo has just begun his appearance before the House committee on foreign affairs. The title of the session is \u201cEvaluating the Trump Administration\u2019s Policies on Iran, Iraq and the Use of Force\u201d. Pompeo has already deposited an opening witness statement, which you can read here. The session is being live-streamed here. Amy Klobuchar has just tweeted to highlight a negative comparison from Connecticut senator Chris Murphy between the way that president Barack Obama set about preparing for potential medical emergencies, and the de-funding of those plans that has been done by the Trump administration. \u201cLeadership is thinking ahead and thinking farther than the next tweet\u201d she says. Klobuchar is due to campaign today in Virginia and Tennessee. 29 February South Carolina votes \u2013 with Biden hoping to hoist himself back into contention with a strong win 3 March Super Tuesday: more than a dozen states including California and Texas vote, with one-third of Democratic delegates up for grabs on this day alone. Bernie Sanders is expected to lead, with Biden, Bloomberg, Warren and Buttigieg all hoping to emerge as his clear opponent. 17 March Another big day, with votes in key states of Florida and Illinois. 28 April The north-east has its say, with votes in New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland and their neighbours. 13 July Democratic convention begins 24 August Republican convention begins 3 November Election day Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney is currently talking at CPAC, being interviewed by Stephen Moore. You can watch a video stream of it live. He\u2019s been talking about Congress being \u201cbroken\u201d, and has just described his job as \u201cthe coolest job in the world\u201d. He has also revealed that Donald Trump did not sleep on his overnight flight back from India, and that the president texts, emails and calls him from 6am every morning until midnight. He is now talking about what Donald Trump will do in his second term - suggesting a 1% cut in corporation tax to 20% because the president thinks \u201cit is a better number\u201d. Whatever you think about Bernie Sanders as a potential president, it is wrong to dismiss his chances of winning the office. Not only does most of the available empirical evidence show Mr. Sanders defeating President Trump in the national popular vote and in the critical Midwestern states that tipped the Electoral College in 2016, but his specific electoral strengths align with changes in the composition of the country\u2019s population in ways that could actually make him a formidable foe for the president. So says Steve Phillips in the New York Times opinion section today. It\u2019s quite an in-depth look at how the people that Sanders particularly appeals to are sections of the electorate that could potentially hold huge sway in November - with little demographic nuggets like this: \u201cMr. Trump won Arizona, for example, by 91,000 votes, and 160,000 Latinos have turned 18 in that state since then.\u201d Read it here - New York Times: Bernie Sanders Can Beat Trump. Here\u2019s the Math. There\u2019s also been a couple of bits of positive polling news for Bernie Sanders today. First off, it looks like he could deprive Elizabeth Warren of victory in her own state of Massachusetts. As recently as October, [Warren] held a 20-percentage point lead over Sanders, according to a WBUR poll. In the latest version of the poll, released Friday, she trailed him by 8 points. Read it here - Politico: Warren at risk of losing her home state There\u2019s also data showing that Sanders\u2019 debate performances have enhanced his standing with engaged Democrat voters, who now think he stands the best chance among the contenders of taking on and beating Donald Trump for the White House. After seeing either of the ninth and tenth debates, 34% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said Sanders has the best chance of defeating the incumbent president. The next closest competitor is Biden, with 25%, followed by Mike Bloomberg, 15% Read it here - ABC News: Recent debates give emboldened Bernie Sanders electability edge Bernie Sanders steamrollered through the Nevada primary and Donald Trump played down the coronavirus threat. Who\u2019s up and who\u2019s down this week in US politics? Best week: Bernie Sanders The leftwing senator from Vermont\u2019s landslide victory in Nevada forced Democratic and media doubters to admit he was now the man to beat (even the day before the New York Times was still calling him the \u201cnominal\u201d frontrunner). But heavy lies the crown\u2026 with his new status came the avalanche of attacks from opponents that Sanders sceptics have long-warned the self-proclaimed \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d would face if he ever began to lead the pack. His \u201choneymoon\u201d to Moscow, unwise articles he wrote for an underground zine in the 60s and 70s about cancer, orgasms and rape fantasies\u2026 Indeed, Sanders fanned the flames himself this week with typically unapologetic comments about Fidel Castro, telling CBS News he was \u201copposed to the authoritarian nature of Cuba\u201d but adding: \u201cHe had a massive literacy program. Is that a bad thing? Even though Fidel Castro did it?\u201d There will be much more of this if Sanders\u2019 success continues with a strong showing in South Carolina tomorrow and victory on Super Tuesday, 3 March. Good week: Joe Biden Whisper it, but is Biden back? Democratic centrists will eventually have to coalesce around someone to take on Sanders, and after flirting with Pete Buttigieg, Mike Bloomberg and Amy Klobuchar, they may end up concluding that the former vice-president \u2013 for all his faults \u2013 looks the strongest. He was more focused and aggressive at the debate in South Carolina on Tuesday night, and employed some amusing self-deprecation at one point when he gave way to the moderator: \u201cWhy am I stopping? No one else stops. It\u2019s my Catholic school training.\u201d Relying on his firewall of African-American support, Biden has solidified his lead in South Carolina and can reasonably hope for a strong victory there on Saturday that might reboot his campaign. He can expect to scoop up a fair number of delegates on Super Tuesday too, particularly in Texas and North Carolina, although Sanders is increasingly leaving him for dust in California. Can he stage a comeback? Cutting out the questionable stories about being arrested in South Africa might help. Not a great week: Mike Bloomberg Bloomberg had a better debate this week, but his social-media tactics came under fire after his team posted a controversial set of satirical tweets featuring false comments supposedly made by Sanders about various dictators. It wasn\u2019t his first offence \u2013 many objected to the misleadingly-edited video his team had put out after the debate in Nevada \u2013 and the Bernie tweets were deleted. \u201cIt\u2019s the embracing of a cynical outlook: \u2018lol nothing matters\u2019,\u201d Whitney Phillips of Syracuse University told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s leaning into nihilism.\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s national poll ratings have flatlined since his disastrous first debate performance \u2013 he remains in third place behind Biden and Sanders \u2013 and he has dipped back below Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg too in the crucial Super Tuesday state of California, when he enters the race proper. Bad week: Donald Trump The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned this week that the coronavirus Covid-19 could could cause \u201csevere disruption\u201d to the lives of ordinary Americans, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s not so much a question of if this will happen any more, but rather more exactly when this will happen, and how many people in this country will have severe illness.\u201d Donald Trump didn\u2019t like that. On a trip to India earlier that day he had already told reporters that the coronavirus was \u201cvery well under control in our country\u201d and \u201cis going to go away\u201d. He later hit out at the media for \u201cdoing everything possible to make the Caronavirus [sic] look as bad as possible, including panicking markets, if possible\u201d. That last element seemed key \u2013 an economic slowdown caused by the virus could seriously damage Trump\u2019s chances of re-election, and the stock market is his favourite measure of his own success. The day after a less-than-reassuring press conference in which Trump put vice-president Mike Pence in charge of the anti-virus effort, the Dow had its worst-ever daily drop and the S&amp;P 500 posted its largest fall since August 2011. Worst week: Mike Pence. Well, would you want to head up the coronavirus response? Such a poisoned chalice is the VP\u2019s new job that there was even speculation Trump could eventually use it as a pretext for dropping Pence from the 2020 ticket \u2013 perhaps replacing him with a telegenic woman such as former UN ambassador Nikki Haley. Not to worry, though, Pence is \u201creally very expert at the field\u201d of healthcare, as Trump told his press conference on Wednesday. So expert that he notoriously wrote on his website in 2000: \u201cDespite the hysteria from the political class and the media, smoking doesn\u2019t kill.\u201d Yes, it is a crucial primary on Saturday for Joe Biden. But that equally applies to the other candidates vying to be the main rival to early front-runner Bernie Sanders. Surely someone will have to drop out of this crowded field after Super Tuesday, so that the more centrist candidates can unite around one \u201canti-Sanders\u201d option? Here\u2019s Moira Donegan with a look at what could happen next for Elizabeth Warren and how her campaign has become energised since that Nevada debate performance. Perhaps this is why Warren now feels free to be frankly angry: not just because playing nice has stopped working, but because her treatment has been deeply unfair. She is the most qualified, the most intelligent and she has run the best campaign, and yet she is being passed over in favor of candidates who are less honest, less prepared, less capable, less morally committed, or simply male. And here is Sam Levin in Los Angeles with a look at how Warren has found trans activists rallying behind her: \u201cElizabeth is teachable,\u201d said Blossom C Brown, an LA-based activist, who protested the exclusion of black trans women at a candidate forum last year. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect her to get it right 100% of the time. But she is the one willing to listen.\u201d One of the problems facing Joe Biden as he goes into the South Carolina primary is that he is attempting to defy history. Over on Bloomberg Paul Murray has put together a series of charts showing historical polling data for the primaries since 1980. He says of Biden: He\u2019s not the only perceived frontrunner to falter in recent elections. Biden joins five other candidates since 1988 who lost their national polling lead after the Iowa caucuses; none of the others were able to recover from their decline. To put it bluntly: \u201cno candidate has held a polling lead going into the first nominating contest, lost that lead and then come back to win the nomination.\u201d That\u2019s quite some challenge for Biden. You can see the data here. \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect time for businesses, health care systems, universities and schools to look at their pandemic preparedness plans, dust them off, and make sure that they\u2019re ready,\u201d Trump said Wednesday at his White House news conference on the coronavirus. Accordingly schools across the United States are canceling trips abroad, preparing online lessons and even rethinking their \u201cperfect attendance\u201d awards as they brace for the possibility that Covid-19 could begin spreading in their communities. There\u2019s also a big question mark about how the healthcare system could cope if there was a sharp increase in the number of cases in the US. And there\u2019s a specific factor that could make a difference to how the coronavirus might spread - the uninsured. Carl Gibson is one of those 27.5 million people - here are his thoughts on what the impact of the coronavirus could be. Here is Amanda Holpuch in New York, looking at how it is low-income Americans who are most likely to be at risk. There\u2019s also a potentially worrying development in terms of how America has been handling the virus. The Washington Post was reporting last night that a whistleblower has come forward to say that officials at the Department of Health and Human Services sent workers to receive the first Americans evacuated from Wuhan, China, without proper training for infection control or appropriate protective gear. They then wren\u2019t tested to see if they had contracted the new coronavirus themselves. The Democratic race is in full swing, with votes in South Carolina on Saturday and then in over a dozen states including California on Super Tuesday, 3 March. Who are the key contenders as the race enters its next phase? Bernie Sanders Who: Veteran socialist senator from Vermont and Democratic frontrunner who thinks his ship may finally have come in. Strengths: Huge army of passionate voters. Distinctive and consistent policy platform. Powerful momentum from success in first three contests of primary race. Weaknesses: Leftwing policies and \u201csocialist\u201d label may prove a bridge too far for many moderate Americans. Decades of outspoken affinity with leftwing causes is already being weaponised against him. Key quote: \u201cEvery other major country on Earth has achieved universal health care. This is the wealthiest nation in the world and there is no reason we cannot do the same.\u201d Key policies: Universal public healthcare system and abolition of health insurance. Paid parental leave. Free college tuition. Support for radical Green New Deal to tackle climate change and create jobs. Joe Biden Who: Personable former vice-president to Barack Obama whose shaky performance in the primary race has seen his lead disintegrate and his frontrunner status disappear. Strengths: Pundits thought his folksy manner, working-class roots and moderate policies would appeal to rust-belt voters won by Donald Trump in 2016. Weaknesses: Voters seemed less convinced after a series of muddled debates and gaffe-prone public appearances. Although many make the argument that \u201cyour uncle would vote for him\u201d, it\u2019s hard to find anyone actually excited about the prospect of President Biden. Key quote: \u201cI ain\u2019t a socialist, I ain\u2019t a plutocrat, I\u2019m a Democrat.\u201d Key policies: \u201cPublic option\u201d to compete with private health insurance. Green New Deal. Repealing capital punishment. Decriminalisation of cannabis. Michael Bloomberg Who: Billionaire businessman and former New York mayor distrusted by many liberals who has steadily climbed in the polls thanks to big spending. Strengths: Limitless spending power. Centrist policies that may win over some Republicans. Record of business success that contrasts favorably with Trump\u2019s. Weaknesses: Originally elected in New York as a Republican, Bloomberg is viewed by many liberals as a Democrat in name only and the kind of super-rich businessman they exist to rein in. Controversies over alleged sexist, racist and anti-trans remarks, a discriminatory policing policy known as \u201cstop and frisk\u201d, and the treatment of women at his business have not helped. Key quote: \u201cTwo billionaires [running]? Who\u2019s the second one?\u201d Key policies: Universal background checks for gun purchases, assault weapons ban and crackdown on gun trafficking. Net zero carbon emissions by 2050. \u201cPublic option\u201d for healthcare. Elizabeth Warren Who: Liberal Massachusetts senator and financial services expert who has been crowded out by Sanders and the moderates. Strengths: Less leftwing than Sanders, much less rightwing than Bloomberg, more experienced than Buttigieg, more convincing than Biden. Would be the first woman president. Weaknesses: Not as ideologically pure as Sanders, not as rich as Bloomberg, not as fresh as Buttigieg, less appeal in the heartland than Biden. Sexism is probably playing a role in dragging her down. Key quote: \u201cI\u2019d like to talk about who we\u2019re running against: a billionaire who calls women fat broads and horse-faced lesbians. No, I\u2019m not talking about Donald Trump. I\u2019m talking about Mayor Bloomberg.\u201d Key policies: Wealth tax on those worth more than $50m. Universal childcare. Relief of student loan debts. Supports the Green New Deal, public healthcare replacing health insurance and breaking up the big tech companies. Pete Buttigieg Who: Small-town Indiana mayor who would be first gay president and needs to build on strong early start in Iowa or risk fading away. Strengths: Millennial military veteran who presents himself as the young and upbeat voice of moderation, compromise and national unity. Weaknesses: His main political experience comprises eight years as mayor of South Bend, Indiana, a city of 100,000 people. As mayor he made enemies of many black voters \u2013 something that has hobbled him in the Democratic race. It remains to be seen how homophobia would affect his chances if he became the nominee. Key quote: \u201cWe need a president focused on the future and ready to leave the politics of the past in the past.\u201d Key policies: Backs a publicly run health insurance scheme, background checks for gun-buyers, a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, and a moderate climate change plan. Also running Businessman Tom Steyer has poured money into South Carolina and is hoping for a strong showing there. Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar has had her moments but it\u2019s hard to see where she goes from here. The quixotic Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard made the most impact when she sued Hillary Clinton for calling her a Russian asset. Ahead of his appearance at the House committee of foreign affairs this morning, Mike Pompeo has published his opening witness statement, and it is fair to say that he does not mince his words about the Trump administration\u2019s attitude to Iran. Among other things he says: Iran is the world\u2019s number one state sponsor of terrorism \u2013 and anti-Semitism. Its forces, and the militias it supports, prop up Syria\u2019s Bashar Assad, undermine democracy in Lebanon and Iraq, and steal humanitarian aid in Yemen. Iran is responsible for downing a civilian airliner in January. 176 people were killed. The regime lied about that tragedy, and still hasn\u2019t turned over the black box. The regime just rigged an election \u2013 yet again denying the Iranian people the free and fair elections they\u2019ve sought for 41 years. You can read the full statement here. Good morning - there\u2019s quite a bit on the agenda today. It is the final full day of campaigning before the South Carolina primary, and Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Tom Steyer are all in the state today. Joe Biden has been considered the frontrunner in the southernmost state to vote so far, but he needs a decisive victory over Sanders if he\u2019s to convince people that his campaign has a chance of eclipsing the leftwing senator and making a strong push for the nomination. Donald Trump will also be out campaigning in South Carolina. There\u2019s no Republican primary, but nevertheless he\u2019s attending a rally at 7pm EST in North Charleston. Amy Klobuchar, meanwhile, is visiting Virginia and Tennessee with an eye on Super Tuesday. We can expect a lot of focus on the coronavirus. Much of Trump\u2019s upbeat messaging about the outbreak was designed to keep the markets steady. That approach seems to have failed as Wall Street and markets around the world tanked yesterday on fears about the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have confirmed that two people in the US have the coronavirus from person-to-person transmission, rather than exposure to the disease overseas. There\u2019s a host of big names appearing at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Fort Washington, Maryland, just outside of Washington DC. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler, Donald Trump Jr, Candace Owens, Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump and the so-called \u201cAnti-Greta\u201d Naomi Seibt are all appearing today. There are sessions on what the map of Israel should look like, how to fight the left\u2019s \u201cvoter fraud machine\u201d, \u201chow the left justifies acts of violence\u201d and the culture war. It should be a lively day. You can see the full line-up here. And another big draw is that secretary of state Mike Pompeo will be appearing before the House committee on foreign affairs to be grilled on US policy on Iran and Iraq. You\u2019ll be able to watch the session here.",

This will prove invaluable and help us understand where this virus is and who is infected. This will be essential if we are to implement measures to slow its spread and allow our NHS to respond. We can also do our bit by making sure that we are vigilant with our own personal hygiene.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Dr Michael Head</strong>, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, has said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Given the increase in cases around Europe and outside of China, it\u2019s unsurprising to see a probable case of human-to-human transmission here in the UK. There will be significant efforts to look at how this patient came to be infected, who is the index case in the UK, and to see if any there are any other secondary cases. Though this is a notable development here in the UK, the overall risks to the public right now remain unchanged.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Dr Stephen Griffin</strong>, an associate professor at the University of Leeds\u2019 section of infection and immunity, has said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Whilst the first person-to-person transmission within the UK may come as a shock to many, it was really only a matter of time. It is increasingly clear that SARS-COV2 is capable of being spread by people showing very mild, or perhaps completely unnoticeable symptoms, which has allowed it to escape the lockdown in China, albeit within a relatively small number of individuals.</p> \n   <p>However, this has been sufficient to promote the seeding of small, sporadic community outbreaks in numerous countries, the majority of which have been successfully contained. Nevertheless, we have also seen the beginnings of much larger outbreaks in countries like South Korea and elsewhere, which are likely to have been seeded after a similar fashion. This highlights the challenge faced once the virus becomes established.</p> \n   <p>What now becomes critically important is our ability to identify, isolate and care for infected individuals, and to trace their recent contacts.</p> \n   <p>If localised outbreaks remain contained then it should be possible to limit the impact upon the UK. However, I suspect the frequency of small outbreaks might increase in coming weeks as the source countries of imported cases become more diverse.</p> \n   <p>If we experience a burgeoning epidemic as seen in South Korea, it will represent a significant challenge to our already stretched NHS and public health infrastructure. As directed by WHO, we should use this time window to invest and prepare for such a potential outbreak, whether it happens or not. In particular, we must ensure that our health care professionals are equipped with the appropriate environments and protective measures such that they can provide the necessary care to the public with minimal risk that they might themselves become infected.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e5994bf8f08e1332474c616\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-28T22:32:13.764Z\">10.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Downing Street will allow ministers to go on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme amid public concern over the spread of coronavirus, according to the Times:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Steven_Swinford/status/1233504197980688391\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Downing Street has agreed to end boycott of Today programme so ministers can go on air to discuss Coronavirus<br><br>Lee Cain, No 10's director of communications, told aides tonight he had agreed with BBC that there was a 'public interest' in having ministers on national broadcaster</p>\u2014 Steven Swinford (@Steven_Swinford) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Steven_Swinford/status/1233504197980688391?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 28, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e597c3c8f08e1332474c535\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-28T21:18:34.392Z\">9.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>El Salvador\u2019s migration authorities will be ordered to deny entry to travellers arriving from Iran, a health measure intended to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, the former nation\u2019s president <strong>Nayib Bukele </strong>has said.</p> \n  <p>Bukele said on Twitter that Salvadorans and diplomats arriving from the Middle Eastern country, which has one of the largest outbreaks outside China, will have to spend 30 days in quarantine.

      "bodyText": "We will close out this live blog now, and continue our live coverage in our new blog. This is where we stand so far this morning: China has reported the lowest number of new cases in Mainland China since it began public reporting last month, with 427 new cases confirmed, of which only four were outside of Hubei province. The death toll from the virus in China has reached 2,835, up 47 from the previous day. The total accumulated number of confirmed cases in mainland China since the outbreak began is 79,251. South Korea, which has the second-highest number of confirmed cases outside of mainland China, reported 594 new cases on Saturday \u2014 the biggest daily increase to date \u2014 with three new deaths. It brings its total accumulated number of cases to 2,931 The US has postponed an ASEAN summit planned for Las Vegas on 14 March over coronavirus fears. The US Centre for Disease Control has confirmed two new cases in California in people who have not travelled to affected areas, or had known contact with infected persons. Australia has reported two new coronavirus cases, bringing the total number of cases in Australia to 25. The number of confirmed cases in the UK reached 20 and a 70-year-old passenger on the Diamond Princess cruise ship is the first UK citizen to die of the virus. The death toll in Italy has reached 21, and and 820 people have been affected. The virus has now spread to 49 countries, and the World Health Organisation says the virus could reach most, if not all countries. Ferrari seeks travel assurance for Australian grand prix Ferrari will seek assurances from Australian authorities that its staff will be allowed to travel and not face quarantine restrictions before heading to Melbourne for the Australian Grand Prix, which opens the Formula One season on 15 March. The Italian giant suspended non-critical business travel and external access to its factory in Maranello, about 200km from the centre of the Italian outbreak in Codongo, on Wednesday. The Victorian sports minister Martin Pakula told The Guardian on Thursday that the event would go ahead, and the Australian Grand Prix corporation said it would comply with advice from the government and health authorities. But without Ferrari, the F1 would lose its biggest drawcard. Ferarri team principle Mattia Binotto raised the issue after his staff faced difficulties getting to the Bahrain F2 test this weekend. He said he would need confirmation from F1 and FIA officials that there would be \u201cno surprises\u201d before allowing staff to travel to Australia. He told Motorsport.com: What we will need is simply to have assurance before leaving. If there are any medical screenings, we need to know about them. You need to know exactly what\u2019s about. We need to understand what are the consequences in case of any problem? Obviously we need to protect our employees. We have got collective and individual responsibility towards them. And it\u2019s important, really, to make sure that before leaving, the picture, whatever is the scenario, is known and clear. Binotto said with Ferrari providing assistance to Haas and Alfa Sauber as well as their own AlphaTauri team, more than one team could be affected. What will be the situation that if eventually four teams cannot run and if the race will take place or not? That is not my decision. Meanwhile, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has warned party officials there would be \u201cserious consequences\u201d of failing to prevent an outbreak of coronavirus in that country. More from AFP: The impoverished nation, with a weak and ill-equipped healthcare system, has closed its borders to prevent the spread of the disease into its territory. Kim told a meeting of the ruling Workers\u2019 Party of Korea that the fight against the virus was a \u201ccrucial state affair for the defence of the people\u201d that required maximum discipline, according to the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). \u201cIn case the infectious disease spreading beyond control finds its way into our country, it will entail serious consequences,\u201d KCNA quoted Kim as saying. Two senior officials - party vice-chairmen Ri Man Gon and Pak Thae Dok - were sacked, and a party unit disbanded for corruption, the report said, indicating that they may have been involved in graft linked with the anti-epidemic measures. \u201cNo special cases must be allowed,\u201d he added, and ordered officials to \u201cseal off all the channels and space through which the infectious disease may find its way\u201d. Pyongyang has not reported a single case of COVID-19, which has killed more than 2,800 people and infected over 84,000 people in dozens of countries since it emerged in neighbouring China. North Korea has banned tourists, suspended international trains and flights and placed hundreds of foreigners in quarantine to prevent an outbreak. It has also reportedly postponed the new school term. With loudspeakers blaring hygiene messages, ambassadors locked in their compounds, and state media demanding \u201cabsolute obedience\u201d, North Korea\u2019s anti-coronavirus measures have been described as \u201cunprecedented\u201d by diplomats. South Korea, meanwhile, is battling a major outbreak of the virus with more than 2,300 cases - the highest number outside mainland China. Germany\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations has said the Security Council would adopt humanitarian exemptions to the sanctions imposed on Pyongyang over its weapons programmes, and allow the export of equipment to help North Korea fight the coronavirus. But \u201cthe problem is that right now the North Koreans closed the borders,\u201d Christoph Heusgen said Thursday after a closed-door Security Council meeting about the reclusive state. The members of the Security Council called on North Korea \u201cto allow this equipment in. So the population can be protected,\u201d he added, without elaborating on the type of equipment. The number of new cases reported in Mainland China is the lowest since the national health authority started compiling nationwide data last month, Reuters has reported. Excluding Hubei province, where the new coronavirus outbreak originated in the country, there were just four new cases of infection reported on Friday. In Hubei itself, 423 new cases were reported, of which 420 were in Wuhan. So a total of 427 in mainland China. South Korea reported 571 new cases on Friday, taking its total \u2014 the highest in the world outside China \u2014 to 2,337, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said. Post amended to add total figure in China and correct number in Wuhan. The US will postpone an ASEAN regional summit in Las Vegas to concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, Reuters has reported. US president Donald Trump invited members of the 10-member association to a meeting on 14 March after he did attend a summit in Bangkok in November. California has reported two cases of coronavirus in people who had not travelled internationally, or come into close contact with any other identified cases. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Friday that officials were \u201caware of a second possible instance of community spread of Covid-19 in California\u201d. The patient is an older woman with chronic health conditions in San Jose. She did not have a travel history or any known contact with an infected person. Ten of the 60 cases of the respiratory disease in the US are in California. Mainland China had 427 new confirmed cases of coronavirus infections on Friday, the country\u2019s National Health Commission said on Saturday, up from 327 cases a day earlier. There were also 248 new suspected cases. That brings the total accumulated number of confirmed cases in mainland China so far to 79,251. The death toll from the outbreak in mainland China had reached 2,835 as of the end of Friday, up by 47 from the previous day. The central province of Hubei, the epicentre of the outbreak, reported 45 new deaths, while in the provincial capital of Wuhan, 37 people died. We\u2019re expecting an update on that new coronavirus case in Queensland at 12.30pm local time. In the mean time, you can read Melissa Davey\u2019s explainer on whether Australians should be worried about coronavirus here. US \u2018totally ready\u2019 for coronavirus, says Trump US president Donald Trump has accused the democrats of politicising the coronavirus, and said the US are \u201cmagnificently organised\u201d and \u201ctotally ready\u201d for the virus. Addressing a rally in South Carolina, Trump also accused the media \u2014 specifically CNN \u2014 of \u201chysteria\u201d over the virus. This is from CNN reporter Daniel Dale. Trump then repeated his bit about South Korean film Parasite winning best picture at the Oscars (more on that here, if you\u2019re interested) before returning to coronavirus: The AHPPC said that with the increased spread of the disease, extending travel bans was \u201cnot likely to be feasible or effective.\u201d In the past few days, the numbers of cases of COVID-19 in South Korea, Italy, and Iran have been rapidly increasing. The AHPPC said the situation in Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore also remains a concern. Whilst case numbers in some of these countries are rising quickly, the prevalence of illness is currently orders of magnitude lower than in Hubei Province. An assessment of the risk of COVID-19 in those countries is based on many factors, including the identification of transmission chains, the number of reported deaths, recent trends in incidence, the incidence of exported cases and modelled estimates of expected numbers of cases based on travel patterns. The ability of countries to respond effectively to infectious disease outbreaks is also an important consideration, along with the feasibility of stringent mobility restrictions given the current phase of the epidemic globally. With this change in epidemiology, extending travel bans to restrict travel from multiple countries is not likely to be feasible or effective in the medium term. However, it may be appropriate to consider self-isolation or practise social distancing upon return from higher risk regions. On Friday the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) issued a statement about the effectiveness of quarantine measures. It said over the past two weeks, direct connections between cases in other countries and China had decreased. It said the effectiveness of these quarantine measures and whether they remain adequate would be reviewed again in one week. The travel restrictions and self-quarantine procedures for people coming from mainland China had been effective so far, with a more than 60% reduction in travellers, and no cases detected in more than 30,000 Australians returning from mainland China since 1 February. The AHPPC statement said: The only new COVID-19 detections in Australia in the last two weeks are eight cases in Australian passengers repatriated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. There remains no evidence of community transmission in Australia, with thousands of negative tests for COVID-19 in the last week alone. The risk to the Australian community from travellers from mainland China appears to have reduced significantly since the inception of travel restrictions. This could justify some further easing of travel restrictions. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, has reportedly sacked two top officials for \u201ccorruption\u201d in a meeting on coronavirus in Politburo. The Party daily Rodong Sinmun and Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported on Saturday that the leader sacked the two Workers Party of Korea (QPK) officials for \u201ccorrupt\u201d acts. Both men were central committee vice-chairmen. They were \u201charshly criticized\u201d by Kim Jong Un \u201cand their gravity and consequences were sharply analyzed,\u201d the Rodong reported on its front page. Good morning, it\u2019s Calla Wahlquist in Melbourne taking over from Kevin Rawlinson. Two more cases of coronavirus have been reported in Australia overnight, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 25. One of those women is a 63-year-old woman on the Gold Coast in Queensland, who is now in the Gold Coast hospital. The woman had recently returned from Iran, which has emerged as a hotspot of the disease with the second-highest number of deaths outside of China. The Iranian deputy health minister Iraj Harirchi tested positive a few days ago. Authorities in Queensland are now trying to trace back the woman\u2019s movements to identify who she may have come into contact with. We\u2019re expecting a press conference on this soon. It is the ninth case in Queensland. Three cases are passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, and five more were people who had travelled to the Gold Coast from Wuhan province on holiday. If you want to get in touch, you can follow me on twitter @callapilla and email me at calla.wahlquist@theguardian.com A man who was onboard the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship became the first British person to die from the coronavirus, the Japanese health ministry confirmed. The passengers had been taken off the vessel to Japan for treatment. The UK said it had detected its 20th coronavirus case and the first case in Wales was confirmed. The latest patient in England is the first to contract the illness while in the UK. Italy\u2019s death toll reached 21 and some 820 people have been infected, the civil protection chief said. But the number of those who have recovered from the virus is increasing. Coronavirus could reach most, if not all, countries, according to the World Health Organisation. The body said its analysis showed there was a very high global risk of both the spread and the impact of Covid-19. The virus has now spread to about 49 countries. New Zealand, Belarus, Lithuania, and Nigeria (the first case in sub-Saharan Africa) reported their first cases in the last day. Many are linked to travellers from Iran. Markets around the world have taken huge hits, and the Chinese economy has seen its worst slump in two decades. The Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the technology-focused Nasdaq all dropped by about 3%, while other markets also tumbled. The UN security council decided to lift some economic sanctions on North Korea to help it fend off the virus. Pyongyang still says it has no reported cases. Amazon suspends job interviews over coronavirus fears Amazon will be suspending in-person job interviews indefinitely, according to screenshots reported on by Gizmodo on Friday. The move comes as the tech industry scrambles to respond to the coronavirus, which has killed nearly 3,000 people. Amazon already stated it would cancel its appearances at a number of events and restrict global and domestic travel. The interview policy will affect more than 39,000 jobs open at the company, according to its own hiring site, and appears to be indefinite. With racially tinged coronavirus fears keeping visitors from San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown, Facebook is donating $25,000 to help the historic neighborhood\u2019s small businesses. Officials pledged today to donate $20,000 to the Chinese Newcomers Services Center, in addition to $5,000 in Facebook ad credits. They made the announcement alongside local lawmakers and San Francisco mayor London Breed, who declared a state of emergency in the city over the outbreak. There have been no confirmed cases of coronavirus in San Francisco. Whately said thoroughly washing hands and coughing or sneezing into a tissue before disposing of it remained the best way of limiting the spread of coronavirus. Asked about the increasing use of face masks, she told the BBC: The advice I have been given is that members of the public are not particularly recommended to use face masks. They may be used by clinicians but actually they are not something that is recommended for the general public. The important thing is the handwashing advice and the use of tissues. It is likely more people in the UK will contract coronavirus, a government minister has said. But Helen Whately, added that plans were in place should it become a pandemic. The Department of Health and Social Care minister told BBC Newsnight: I can\u2019t reiterate enough that we are well prepared but we do have to recognise that it is likely we will see more cases in the UK. We have plans in place and have carried out exercises so in the event of something like a flu pandemic, we are ready. And those plans have been continuously updated ever since the outbreak in China of the coronavirus. Asked whether that meant mass gatherings could be banned and schools closed, such as in parts of Italy, she said such measures were \u201cbeing considered\u201d. Clearly, how to deal with those sorts of things absolutely has been considered and is being considered. That is rightly all part of the planning. But Whatley said there was still \u201cvery clear guidance\u201d that \u201cschools should not be, in general, planning to close\u201d. The Reuters news agency is reporting that the United States will postpone a meeting with leaders of Southeast Asian countries it planned to host on 14 March. The US president, Donald Trump, had invited leaders of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian nations to meet in Las Vegas after he did not attend a summit with the group in Bangkok in November. Reuters cited two unnamed US officials it said were familiar with the matter. The Guardian has not independently confirmed the report and the US State Department did not immediately respond to Reuters\u2019 request for comment. BTS, the K-Pop band, have cancelled four concerts due to be held in Seoul in April as South Korea\u2019s coronavirus cases jumped by nearly 600 \u2013 a larger rise than the daily increase reported in China. The seven-piece boyband, one of the biggest acts in the world, had scheduled the gigs at the South Korean capital\u2019s Olympic Stadium to promote their new album \u201cMap of the Soul: 7\u201d. More than 200,000 fans were expected to attend, their agency Big Hit Entertainment said in a statement. A second coronavirus case in a northern Californian patient with no links to international travel has reportedly been identified. The Washington Post quoted Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins centre for health security, as saying: I think there\u2019s a strong possibility that there\u2019s local transmission going in California. In other words, the virus is spreading within California, and I think there\u2019s a possibility other states are in the same boat. They just haven\u2019t recognised it yet. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, has overseen military drills, state media KCNA say, in a rare public outing amid efforts to prevent an outbreak of the coronavirus in the isolated country. The Reuters news agency reports that North Korea has not confirmed any cases of the virus, but that state media said a month-long quarantine period had been imposed for people showing symptoms and \u201chigh-intensity\u201d measures were taken including reinforcing checks in border regions and at airports and sea ports. On 16 February, Kim made his first public appearance in 22 days to visit a mausoleum marking the anniversary of the birth of his father and late leader Kim Jong Il. The military drill was to \u201cjudge the mobility and the fire power strike ability\u201d on the frontline and eastern units and ended to a \u201cgreat satisfaction\u201d of Kim, according to KCNA. The network said: In a separate dispatch, KCNA said Kim has also convened a meeting of the ruling Workers\u2019 Party\u2019s powerful politburo where a stricter enforcement of \u201ctop-class anti-epidemic steps\u201d was discussed to prevent the spread of the virus. It quoted Kim as telling the meeting: In case the infectious disease spreading beyond control finds its way into our country, it will entail serious consequences. No special cases must be allowed within the state anti-epidemic system. He instructed the officials to \u201cseal off all the channels and space through which the infectious disease may find its way, and strengthen check-up, test and quarantine,\u201d KCNA added. The US state department has raised its alert level for travel to Italy due to the coronavirus outbreak, telling Americans to reconsider travel there. Tracing the origins of the latest case of coronavirus - the first to have been caught within the UK - will be \u201ccrucial\u201d in preventing more extensive spread, experts have said. Prof Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, has said: This case \u2013 a person testing positive for novel coronavirus with no known link to an affected area or known case \u2013 marks a new chapter for the UK, and it will be crucial to understand where the infection came from to try and prevent more extensive spread. This was always a concern \u2013 this is a virus that frequently causes symptoms very similar to mild flu or a common cold, and it\u2019s easily transmitted from person to person. This means it can easily go under the radar. This was always a real possibility and one of the reasons that the government introduced more extensive surveillance. This will prove invaluable and help us understand where this virus is and who is infected. This will be essential if we are to implement measures to slow its spread and allow our NHS to respond. We can also do our bit by making sure that we are vigilant with our own personal hygiene. Dr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, has said: Given the increase in cases around Europe and outside of China, it\u2019s unsurprising to see a probable case of human-to-human transmission here in the UK. There will be significant efforts to look at how this patient came to be infected, who is the index case in the UK, and to see if any there are any other secondary cases. Though this is a notable development here in the UK, the overall risks to the public right now remain unchanged. Dr Stephen Griffin, an associate professor at the University of Leeds\u2019 section of infection and immunity, has said: Whilst the first person-to-person transmission within the UK may come as a shock to many, it was really only a matter of time. It is increasingly clear that SARS-COV2 is capable of being spread by people showing very mild, or perhaps completely unnoticeable symptoms, which has allowed it to escape the lockdown in China, albeit within a relatively small number of individuals. However, this has been sufficient to promote the seeding of small, sporadic community outbreaks in numerous countries, the majority of which have been successfully contained. Nevertheless, we have also seen the beginnings of much larger outbreaks in countries like South Korea and elsewhere, which are likely to have been seeded after a similar fashion. This highlights the challenge faced once the virus becomes established. What now becomes critically important is our ability to identify, isolate and care for infected individuals, and to trace their recent contacts. If localised outbreaks remain contained then it should be possible to limit the impact upon the UK. However, I suspect the frequency of small outbreaks might increase in coming weeks as the source countries of imported cases become more diverse. If we experience a burgeoning epidemic as seen in South Korea, it will represent a significant challenge to our already stretched NHS and public health infrastructure. As directed by WHO, we should use this time window to invest and prepare for such a potential outbreak, whether it happens or not. In particular, we must ensure that our health care professionals are equipped with the appropriate environments and protective measures such that they can provide the necessary care to the public with minimal risk that they might themselves become infected. Downing Street will allow ministers to go on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme amid public concern over the spread of coronavirus, according to the Times: El Salvador\u2019s migration authorities will be ordered to deny entry to travellers arriving from Iran, a health measure intended to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, the former nation\u2019s president Nayib Bukele has said. Bukele said on Twitter that Salvadorans and diplomats arriving from the Middle Eastern country, which has one of the largest outbreaks outside China, will have to spend 30 days in quarantine. El Salvador has no reported cases of coronavirus. New measures to combat the coronavirus outbreak in Germany, including the widening of cross-border travel guidelines and the cancellation of major international events, have been enacted by Berlin\u2019s crisis committee. It expanded regulations for air and sea passengers, requiring passengers from South Korea, Japan, Italy and Iran to report their health status before entry. Previously, only passengers from China had been required to do so. Lebanon will close its schools from 29 February until 8 March as a precautionary measure against the spread of coronavirus, its education ministry statement has said. The country confirmed its fourth coronavirus case and has restricted flights from countries affected by the outbreak. During a live-streamed news conference with Florida\u2019s governor, Ron DeSantis, Pence has said: \u201cIn every case, people are being treated and by all accounts are doing well.\u201d Only one American with coronavirus remains in hospital, the US vice president Mike Pence has said. Google will cancel an upcoming summit and restrict staff travel after confirming that an employee has been diagnosed with coronavirus. The staff member diagnosed with the illness is in the company\u2019s Zurich, Switzerland office, a Google spokesman told CNBC on Friday. The office will remain open. We can confirm that one employee from our Zurich office has been diagnosed with the coronavirus. They were in the Zurich office for a limited time, before they had any symptoms. We have taken \u2014 and will continue to take \u2014 all necessary precautionary measures, following the advice of public health officials, as we prioritise everyone\u2019s health and safety. The diagnosis comes as tech companies scramble to respond to the virus, which has infected at least 84,000 people worldwide. Google cancelled its Google News Initiative summit, which was scheduled to take place in Sunnyvale, California in late April. Major companies, including IBM and Verizon, pulled out of annual cybersecurity conference RSA in San Francisco this week and Facebook cancelled its upcoming F8 developer conference in May. Meanwhile, Amazon has begun to restrict all nonessential employee travel in the U.S. and has restricted all travel to China \u201cuntil further notice.\u201d The British cruise ship turned away by the Dominican Republic is awaiting approval to dock on the Caribbean island of Sint Maarten, officials say. According to the Associated Press, Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines said it had reported a small number of influenza-like cases on board that did not appear linked to the new coronavirus \u2013 and that the patients had recovered. The ship sailed to the island and is awaiting approval to dock there, local port officials have said. Italy\u2019s coronavirus death toll has reached 21 and some 820 people have been infected, the civil protection chief has said, while number of those who have recovered from the virus is increasing. Authorities say all the victims were elderly people who had also been suffering from other health issues. Lombardy\u2019s governor, Attilio Fontana, says the situation intensified sharply in Lodi, near Milan, on Thursday; with a sudden spike in the number of people hospitalised. \u201cUnfortunately another emergency broke out in Lodi overnight,\u201d Fontana, who has put himself into self isolation after a regional government employee tested positive, told La7 television. \u201cThere was a rush of hospitalisations yesterday afternoon with 51 people in a serious condition, including 17 who were put in intensive care.\u201d Public Health England (PHE) has confirmed the latest case is a resident of Surrey and it that it\u2019s working with the county council to manage the situation. Dr Alison Barnett, the centre director for PHE South East, said: Public Health England is contacting people who had close contact with a confirmed case of Covid-19. One of the latest cases is a resident of Surrey and we\u2019re working closely with NHS colleagues in that area as well as Surrey county council to manage the situation and help reduce the risk of further cases. Close contacts will be given health advice about symptoms and emergency contact details to use if they become unwell in the 14 days after contact with the confirmed case. This tried and tested method will ensure we are able to minimise any risk to them and the wider public. Surrey county council\u2019s interim director of public health, Ruth Hutchinson, added: Surrey county council is working with health colleagues to do everything we can to stop the virus spreading and ensure the people of Surrey are protected. Good hygiene is the best prevention and there are some simple steps you can take to protect you and your family by washing your hands regularly and thoroughly, and if you cough, cover your mouth and nose with a tissue. The Department of Health and Social Care has said the virus was passed on in the UK but the original source of the virus was \u201cunclear\u201d. It added that there was no \u201cimmediately identifiable link\u201d to overseas travel. The virus was passed on in the UK but the original source of the virus is unclear at this stage. We do not currently have complete understanding of the chain of transmission in this case, but there is no immediately identifiable link to overseas travel. Given the recent increases in international case numbers, especially Europe, it is highly likely that we will soon see some instances of community transmission in the UK. Whitty has said: One further patient in England has tested positive for Covid-19. The virus was passed on in the UK. It is not yet clear whether they contracted it directly or indirectly from an individual who had recently returned from abroad. This is being investigated and contact tracing has begun. The patient has been transferred to a specialist NHS infection centre at Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019. The total number of cases in England is now 18. Following confirmed cases in Northern Ireland and Wales, the total number of UK cases is 20. A further patient in England has tested positive for coronavirus and the illness was passed on in the UK, chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said. Amazon tells employees to defer all non-essential travel Amazon has said all employees should defer non-essential travel, including within the US, in a significant escalation by the world\u2019s largest online retailer to guard against the spread of the coronavirus among its ranks. Dave Clark, the senior vice president of worldwide operations, notified employees of the change on Thursday, which Amazon confirmed to Reuters. The acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, has accused the media of stoking fear over the coronavirus as a plot to take down Donald Trump, Politico reports. Speaking at a conservative activist conference in Maryland, Mulvaney suggested the coronavirus was not as serious as other viral outbreaks. At any particular time, 20 million people in this country are going to have the flu. The flu kills people, it does. This is not Ebola, OK? And I\u2019ll tell you what that means in a sense. It\u2019s not Sars. It\u2019s not Mers. Why do we say that? When you look at the severity of diseases, one of the ways you can look at it is looking at the percentage of people who get it who die. I know that\u2019s sort of hard-hearted, but that\u2019s sort of how we look at it. But Mulvaney added that the US would \u201cprobably\u201d experience school closures as Covid-19 continued to spread around the world. Are you going to see some schools shut down? Probably. May you see impacts on public transportation? Sure. But we do this. We know how to handle this. So, that\u2019s one of the things \u2013 that\u2019s the kind of message you try to get out. There are professionals who know how to handle this.\u201d You can keep up with all our live US political coverage here: Boris Johnson has said that taking measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus is his government\u2019s top priority and that the public is right to be concerned, in his first television appearance to talk about the issue. The prime minister said: \u201cOn the issue of coronavirus, which obviously is a great concern to people, I just want to reassure everybody and say that the NHS is making every possible preparation. As you can imagine, the issue of coronavirus is something that is now the government\u2019s top priority. \u201cI have just had a meeting with the chief medical officer and secretary of state for health, talking about the preparations that we need to make.\u201d He added that he would be chairing a meeting of ministers and officials on the subject on Monday. Four more people have died in Italy from coronavirus, Reuters reports the country\u2019s civil protection agency as saying on Friday. The latest deaths bring the total in Italy to 21, while the number of those testing positive for the illness jumped to 821 from 650 the day before. The outbreak, which began last week in Italy\u2019s northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto, has made the country the hardest-hit in Europe and has led to draconian measures and a sharp reduction in economic activity. Lombardy will ask the government to maintain the containment measures implemented against the outbreak for at least another week, the regional government said on Friday. Antonia Wilson, a reporter on the Guardian\u2019s travel desk, has investigated which countries currently have travel restrictions related to the coronavirus outbreak. She writes: International travellers are facing tighter restrictions at airports as the number of countries denying entry to passengers who have recently visited China, Italy and other regions with reported cases of coronavirus increases. Cases of Covid-19 have now been confirmed in 58 countries. Restrictions are becoming more widespread, and major airports are putting preventive measures in place. A document featured on the International Air Transport Association (IATA) website, lists countries where restrictions are in place. Read more: The Vatican has dismissed speculation that Pope Francis is anything more than \u201cslightly unwell\u201d after he cancelled official audiences for a second day, Reuters is reporting. Francis, 83, appeared to have a cold and spoke with a slightly hoarse voice at his general audience on Wednesday. He coughed during an afternoon Ash Wednesday service in a Rome church, his last appearance outside the Vatican. Matteo Bruni, a Vatican spokesman, said on Friday morning that the pope had celebrated early morning mass as usual. \u201cBut he thought it was best to postpone today\u2019s official audiences. The meetings scheduled to take place in Santa Marta will take place regularly,\u201d Bruni said. Later, Bruni said: \u201cThere is no evidence that would lead to diagnosing anything but a mild indisposition. Even this afternoon, the Holy Father\u2019s meetings continued in Santa Marta.\u201d However, he conceded that the pope was still \u201cslightly unwell\u201d. A GP in Surrey is being taken to one of the UK\u2019s six specialist centres for infectious diseases amid fears he is the latest British case of coronavirus, Denis Campbell, the Guardian\u2019s health policy editor, reports. The development is understood to have triggered an urgent investigation to see if any of his patients have the coronavirus too. The case \u2013 which would be the 20th to emerge in the UK \u2013 has prompted particular concern among health officials trying to limit the spread of Covid-19. The GP would routinely have seen scores of patients over the course of the last week before he became ill in the last 24 hours. His diagnosis has yet to be publicly confirmed by Public Health England (PHE), NHS England or the Department of Health and Social Care. Public health chiefs are also worried by the unnamed doctor\u2019s diagnosis because his wife is also a GP. Read more: Iceland has confirmed its first case of Covid-19, local media reports. The man is in isolation at Landsp\u00edtali hospital after testing positive for the virus. The man is reportedly not seriously ill, but tested positive for coronavirus after recently returning from northern Italy \u2013 but outside the area considered especially high risk for catching the virus. Boris Johnson is under fire from opposition parties for waiting until next week to chair a Cobra meeting on the coronavirus outbreak. The meeting is scheduled to be held on Monday. Labour has accused Johnson of acting as a \u201cpart-time prime minister\u201d. The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said: \u201cOur part-time prime minister needs to get a grip of this escalating situation quickly. It shouldn\u2019t take another three days for this meeting to take place.\u201d The acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey, said: \u201cPeople across the country are anxious and concerned about coronavirus. They want to see leadership. \u201cThe Liberal Democrats called on Boris Johnson to chair a Cobra meeting weeks ago to ensure everything was being done to prepare for a potential coronavirus outbreak. With the NHS already so stretched, it\u2019s gobsmacking that the prime minister has delayed chairing Cobra for so long. \u201cJust like his failure to visit communities hit by flooding, on coronavirus Johnson seems like he\u2019d rather bury his head in the sand than hear for himself what the experts are saying and what his ministers are doing.\u201d Ofqual, the exam regulator for England, says it is considering how to manage the dangers of a coronavirus outbreak disrupting this summer\u2019s GCSE and A-level exams, Richard Adams, education editor, reports. Students are due to sit A-levels \u2013 crucial for university entry \u2013 in May and June, but a widespread outbreak of Covid-19 at that point could mean that, in worst-case scenarios, students and staff may be unable to take the exams due to illness or quarantine restrictions. In a statement Ofqual said: \u201cWe are working closely with awarding organisations and the Department for Education to consider how to manage any particular risks to the smooth running of exams and assessments should there be a widespread outbreak of coronavirus. \u201cWe will update our existing guidance to reflect any specific arrangements schools and colleges should put in place if required. In the meantime, students, schools and colleges should continue to prepare for the summer exams and assessments as usual.\u201d A-levels and GCSEs are taken from the second week of May until the middle of June, with exam results published in mid-August. Disrupted A-level results could complicate the process of university applications, which rely in most cases on students gaining specific exam results. But in a period of difficulty universities may use other methods to allot places, such as previous exam results. The Foreign Office has confirmed the death of a Briton who was onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship. A spokesman said: \u201cWe are supporting the family of a British man who has died in Japan and are in contact with local authorities. Our sympathies and thoughts are with his family at this difficult time.\u201d The WHO has said that the assessment of the risk of spread and risk of impact of Covid-19 is now \u201cvery high at global level\u201d. The director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, told reporters in Geneva that the continued increase in the number of coronavirus cases and in the number of affected countries over the last days was \u201cclearly of concern\u201d but there was still a chance it could be contained. China\u2019s 329 reported cases in the past 24 hours was the lowest figure there in more than a month, he added. There were more than 20 vaccines in development globally and several therapeutics were in clinical trials, Tedros said, and we could expect the first results in a few weeks time. Aer Lingus has confirmed that the person from Northern Ireland infected with Covid-19 travelled on the airline to Dublin airport. In a statement the airline said: \u201cAer Lingus can confirm that the patient in Northern Ireland who has been diagnosed with the Covid-19 virus travelled with the airline from northern Italy to Dublin. \u201cAer Lingus is co-operating fully with the HSE in relation to the Covid-19 developments and is liaising with the Department of Foreign Affairs, other government departments and the relevant authorities as required. \u201cAer Lingus will continue to assess the situation based on the guidance received.\u201d Stocks are falling sharply in New York, as the coronavirus market rout continues. The Dow dropped by 761 points at the start of trading. That\u2019s a drop of 2.96%, to 25,005 points. The S&amp;P 500 is down just over 3%, and the technology-focused Nasdaq dropped by 3.1%. You can follow our live business coverage here: Moscow authorities are deporting 88 foreign nationals who violated quarantine measures imposed on them as a precaution against coronavirus, the RIA news agency cited the city\u2019s deputy mayor as saying on Friday. Hundreds of people have been quarantined in Russia and Moscow authorities have carried out raids on potential carriers of the virus \u2013 individuals at their homes or hotels \u2013 and used facial recognition technology to enforce quarantine measures. My colleague Kim Willsher, our Paris correspondent, reports: A woman from Cannes has tested positive for the coronavirus, the first in the C\u00f4t\u00e9 d\u2019Azur region in the south of France. The 23-year-old was admitted to a special isolation unit in hospital in Nice after being found to be carrying the Covid-19 virus on Friday following a visit to Milan in Lombardy. The authorities are waiting for the results of tests on a second person from the area. David Lisnard, the mayor of Cannes, said the woman\u2019s condition was \u201csatisfactory\u201d. He said he had been in contact with the regional health agency and was reassured there was \u201cno particular cause for concern for the public health authorities\u201d. An investigation is under way to trace anyone with whom the patient was in contact. Christian Estrosi, the mayor of Nice, who is seeking re-election in municipal elections next month, said he would be reducing the time spent campaigning. Estrosi announced that the Nice carnival this weekend was cancelled as a \u201cpreventative measure\u201d. The nearby town of Menton has cancelled its annual F\u00eate du Citron (Lemon F\u00eate), a series of events due to be held over the weekend. The Cannes film festival committee said it was monitoring developments and said it was too early to say whether the event would go ahead. The 73rd annual festival is due to take place from 12-23 May. \u201cIn due course and depending on the occurrences, the Festival de Cannes will naturally take all the necessary measures to ensure the protection of all those attending and to preserve their health during the Cannes event,\u201d a spokesperson told Variety. Mexican authorities have confirmed the country\u2019s first two cases of coronavirus, among the few confirmed cases in Latin America, says Reuters. The two men had travelled recently to Italy, where they had been in direct contact with an Italian national who resides in Malaysia, the deputy health minister Hugo L\u00f3pez-Gatell Ram\u00edrez, told reporters. A 35-year-old man with a possible coronavirus infection went through a second test that turned up positive early on Friday, L\u00f3pez-Gatell said. The man is in isolation in Mexico City. At least five family contacts have also been placed in isolation. His case is connected to the second confirmed case in the northern state of Sinaloa, which is still pending the results of a second test. The coronavirus could reach most \u201cif not all countries\u201d, the World Health Organization said on Friday after Nigeria confirmed sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s first case, Reuters is reporting. \u201cThe outbreak is getting bigger,\u201d Christian Lindmeier, a WHO spokesman, told a Geneva news briefing. \u201cThe scenario of the coronavirus reaching multiple countries, if not all countries around the world, is something we have been looking at and warning against since quite a while.\u201d Five more countries have reported their first case of Covid-19 \u2013 Nigeria, Estonia, Denmark, the Netherlands and Lithuania. Estonia\u2019s social affairs minister Tanel Kiik said the affected individual in that country is an Iranian national resident in Estonia, who had not recently arrived in the country either by plane or by sea but by bus from Riga, Latvia. Lindmeier added that the WHO was looking very carefully into reports of some people getting re-infected. \u201cWe need to carefully look at how the tests were taken, how the person was examined, if it was maybe overlooked that the person still had the virus somewhere in the residue in the body, whether they got reinfected by different means or ways. We\u2019re not in a position to say it is possible or not to be coming back and being re-infected. \u201cIn general, we would expect that a person who had the coronavirus infection would be immune for at least a while afterwards. But again this is something we do not yet know.\u201d A British man who was onboard the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan has died from the coronavirus, the Japanese health ministry has confirmed. The first foreign passenger to die, his death brings the toll among passengers from the vessel to six. A spokeswoman for Princess Cruises, which operates the Diamond Princess, said: \u201cAll of us at Princess Cruises, including the crew of the Diamond Princess, offer our sincere condolences to family members and friends for their loss. Our dedicated care team are on hand to provide support.\u201d Our Pablo Guti\u00e9rrez has created this set of maps illustrating how Covid-19 is spreading across the world. Prof Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, has responded to media reports of a dog in Hong Kong being tested \u201cweak positive\u201d for coronavirus. \u201cThere is no evidence that the human novel coronavirus can infect dogs and it would be incredible for a virus to make so many species jumps in such a short space of time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to differentiate between real infection and just detecting the presence of a virus \u2013 these are very different \u2013 and the fact that the test result was weakly positive would suggest that this is environmental contamination or simply the presence of coronavirus shed from the human contact that has ended up in the dog\u2019s samples. \u201cIn truth this is incredibly irresponsible because the last thing we need to do is create mass hysteria about the possibility of dogs being infected, and therefore potentially transmitting this virus when there is absolutely no evidence for this whatsoever.\u201d Researchers at the Sacco hospital in Milan say they have isolated the Italian strain of the coronavirus, reports Lorenzo Tondo. The scientists say the discovery will help to develop a vaccine and new treatments to contain the virus. Early in February, Italian researchers from the Spallanzani hospital in Rome successfully isolated Covid-19, which allowed the country to immediately activate tests on patients. \u201cThe virus previously isolated by researchers at the Spallanzani hospital is precisely the Chinese one, originating in Wuhan, while the coronavirus that we have isolated prevents the viral strain spreading in Italy,\u201d Claudia Balotta, an immunologist at the Sacco hospital, told the Corriere della Sera. \u201cViruses reshuffle their genetic makeup to better bind to cells in the new host,\u201d Tullio Prestileo, a doctor of infectious diseases at the Benfratteli hospital in Palermo, told the Guardian. \u201cBy spreading from one country to another, the virus originating in Wuhan will obviously reshuffle its genetic patrimony and the virus strain in China will have some slight differences from the one in Italy or Germany.\u201d Thanks to the discovery, the Italian researchers believe they can now \u201ctrace the journey of the virus from China to Europe and detect the date of its first spread in the country\u201d. The GMB union is the latest body to issue a warning about the threat the coronavirus poses to workers in the gig economy. Mick Rix, the GMB national officer, said: The threat of Coronavirus is a huge problem for employers and workers across the UK. But workers in the so-called gig economy, or on zero-hours contracts, are left abandoned and penniless if they have to self-isolate. Once again the bogus self-employment model is screwing over the disadvantaged. GMB is calling on all employers \u2013 regardless of the contract \u2013 to do the right thing and pay their workers if they have to take time off due to the global health crisis. The union said that in one recent case a delivery driver was contacted by a customer who considered themselves high risk. The driver told the company, which instructed her not to come back into work. This meant she faced the prospect of not being able to earn any money until she was given the all-clear. Public Health England has issued new advice on the coronavirus in places of education. A revised poster issued this morning says: \u201cYou should wash hands with soap &amp; water or hand sanitiser \u2026 on arrival at any childcare or educational setting.\u201d. Nigeria\u2019s first confirmed coronovirus case entered the country on a Turkish Airlines flight that travelled via Istanbul, the Lagos state commissioner for health has told a news conference. In comments reported by Reuters, Akin Abayomi said the man, who travelled from Milan, Italy, and landed on the evening of 24 February, spent the night in a hotel near the airport, and continued to his place of work in neighbouring Ogun state. He was treated on the evening of 26 February at his company\u2019s medical facility before health practitioners there called government biosecurity officers, who transferred him to a containment facility in Yaba, Lagos, the following day. The man is the first confirmed case in sub-Saharan Africa. The Geneva motor show has been postponed by six months, following Switzerland\u2019s ban on large gatherings. Organisers said it had become increasingly difficult for delegates to arrange visas, or fix flights to the show, given the escalating crisis over Covid-19.

During his visit he spent time discussing preparations for dealing with the Covid-19 outbreak. The Guardian\u2019s science correspondent, Hannah Devlin, has this piece busting the most common coronavirus myths: The government is to hold an emergency Cobra meeting over the coronavirus outbreak on Monday. The Associated Press has this updated list of all the reported cases of coronavirus around the world: Mainland China: 2,788 deaths among 78,824 cases, mostly in the central province of Hubei. Hong Kong: 92 cases, 2 deaths. Macao: 10 cases. South Korea: 2,337 cases, 13 deaths. Japan: 927 cases, including 705 from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, 9 deaths. Italy: 650 cases, 15 deaths. Iran: 388 cases, 34 deaths. Singapore: 96. US: 60. Germany: 53. Kuwait: 45. Thailand: 41. France: 38 cases, 2 deaths. Bahrain: 36. Taiwan: 34 cases, 1 death. Malaysia: 25. Australia: 23. United Arab Emirates: 19. Spain: 17. Vietnam: 16. United Kingdom: 15. Canada: 14. Sweden: 7. Iraq: 6. Oman: 6. Russia: 5. Croatia: 5. Switzerland: 5. Greece: 4. Philippines: 3 cases, 1 death. India: 3. Israel: 3. Lebanon: 3. Pakistan: 2. Finland: 2. Austria: 2. Netherlands: 2. Egypt: 1. Algeria: 1. Afghanistan: 1. North Macedonia: 1. Georgia: 1. Estonia: 1. Lithuania: 1. Belgium: 1. Romania: 1. Belarus: 1. Nepal: 1. Sri Lanka: 1. Cambodia: 1. Norway: 1. Denmark: 1. Brazil: 1. New Zealand: 1. Nigeria: 1. Azerbaijan: 1. Health authorities in Ireland have said that people who sat within two rows of the person from Northern Ireland infected with Covid-19 on the plane from northern Italy to Dublin have been contacted. PA Media said the woman followed advice in reporting concerns to a GP, and \u201cself-isolated\u201d at home while awaiting the results of testing. The Irish health chief, Dr John Cuddihy, said: Each of the stages of this person\u2019s journey have been identified and all relevant contacts in all of those stages of transport have been contacted (and) traced. Ireland\u2019s chief medical officer, Dr Tony Holohan, and the head of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, Dr Cuddihy, held a news conference in Dublin to provide details of Ireland\u2019s preparedness. Dr Holohan said they were depending on an individual with symptoms travelling back from an affected area identifying themselves, contacting the local health authorities, and that was what had happened in this particular case. The former chancellor and Evening Standard editor, George Osborne, says its time for the government to go on a \u201cwar footing\u201d with the coronavirus: So coronavirus has finally arrived in sub-saharan Africa, with an Italian man who arrived in Nigeria three days ago becoming the country\u2019s first case of the disease. The case is in Lagos, a massive overcrowded city, which will raise fears that the virus might already have spread in Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous country, and possibly further afield. Nigeria is a major hub for air transport, commerce and culture. It has deep links with China, with continual and substantial traffic of people and goods. However, this first confirmed case appears to have originated in Italy. The WHO\u2019s regional director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, has warned that the \u201cwindow of opportunity the continent has had to prepare for coronavirus disease is closing\u201d. Egypt had the first case of Covid-19 in Africa, announced on 14 February. Algeria declared it had a case on Tuesday \u2013 another Italian adult who arrived in the country on 17 February. Earlier this month, officials at the WHO warned that porous borders, a continuing flow of travellers and poorly resourced healthcare systems meant the risk of an outbreak across Africa was \u201cvery, very high\u201d and raised significant concerns about the ability of \u201cfragile health systems\u201d to cope with the epidemic. But recent weeks have been used to reinforce testing regimes, isolation facilities and for public messaging too. \u201cNigeria has dramatically improved its ability to manage the outbreak of a major pandemic since the Ebola scare in west Africa in 2014. Many of the lessons from keeping the country free of Ebola have informed the steps taken since the news of the coronavirus epidemic first broke,\u201d wrote Folasade Ogunsola, professor of Clinical Microbiology, University of Lagos, on The Conversation website. A further two coronavirus cases have been confirmed in England, bringing the total to 19. Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, said: Two further patients in England have tested positive for Covid-19. The virus was passed on in Iran and the patients have been transferred to specialist NHS infection centres at the Royal Free Hospital. The total number of cases in England is now 17. Following confirmed cases in Northern Ireland and Wales, the total number of UK cases is 19. Wales\u2019s chief medical officer, Dr Frank Atherton, said in a statement: I can confirm that one patient in Wales has tested positive for coronavirus (Covid-19). All appropriate measures to provide care for the individual and to reduce the risk of transmission to others are being taken. I can also confirm that the patient had travelled back to Wales from northern Italy, where the virus was contracted. I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to assure the public that Wales and the whole of the UK is well prepared for these types of incidents. Working with our partners in Wales and the UK, we have implemented our planned response, with robust infection control measures in place to protect the health of the public. A coronavirus case has been confirmed in Wales, in a patient who had returned from Italy. This takes the total number of UK cases to 17. While the government has not put anybody forward to be interviewed about the coronavirus this morning, Jeremy Hunt, the chairman of the Commons health committee and former Tory health secretary, has been on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. He said we need to consider the \u201csocial and economic trade-offs\u201d we are willing to make to contain Covid-19. In Wuhan, it appears that it has peaked at less than 5% of the population getting it. And we are having to make contingency plans for 70% of the population getting it, and in terms of the number of lives lost, there is a massive difference, hundreds of thousands of lives difference, if you can contain it to less than 5%. And, so, the question we have to ask ourselves, and I think the government is right to start to spell this out \u2013 but I think they need to go further \u2013 is what are the social and economic trade-offs that we are prepared to make to keep the spread of the virus at that low level. We are starting to hear some of the things that the government is considering. We are a mature democracy and I think it is perfectly possible to count on the co-operation of the public to comply with guidelines and recommendations made by the government without the kind of authoritarian measures that we have seen on our TV screens. The trade union umbrella body, the TUC, is urging employers to give workers time off to seek medical advice if they feel they are developing symptoms of coronavirus. The organisation says many people are at risk of getting no financial support when sick because their pay is too low or they are on zero-hours contracts. The TUC warned that almost 2 million workers do not earn enough to qualify for statutory sick pay, including one in 10 working women. They said that people forced to self-isolate because of the virus, and those who become ill, should not lose out on pay. The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: Employers have a duty of care to support workers affected by coronavirus. No one should have to worry about making ends meet if they have to self-isolate or if they fall ill. They should be able to focus on getting better. The threat of coronavirus shows why sick pay should be a day one right for everybody. It\u2019s not right that millions of UK workers miss out on this protection. The government must ensure everyone gets statutory sick pay, however much they earn. Reuters is reporting that Kuwait has confirmed two more cases of coronavirus, bringing the total number of infections in the country to 45. A health ministry official said there had been no deaths and that those infected had either travelled to Iran or been contaminated by people who went there. European stock markets have, as we feared, tumbled at the start of trading. The FTSE 100 index of the biggest UK-listed companies has hit its lowest level since December 2018 (corrected). It\u2019s down a further 2.8%, or 188 points, at 6607. That means it\u2019s lost about 10% of its value this week. We\u2019ve not seen such a slump since since the eurozone crisis of 2011, and the financial crisis more than a decade ago. Two airlines have warned that their earnings are being hit by the crisis. IAG, which owns British Airways, said business travel has been hit by the cancellations of various trade fairs, and corporate travel restrictions. Budget airline easyJet reported it is cutting flights to Italy, and implementing \u201crecruitment, promotion and pay freezes\u201d across its network as it tries to cut costs. Germany\u2019s Dax is also suffering fresh losses, down another 3.6%, as investors fear the coronavirus outbreak will cause a global recession. As Neil Wilson of Markets.com puts it: Global stocks have entered correction territory and it\u2019s now that we can start to consider the market is entering the period of peak fear. Our business live blog has more details. Guardian US reporter Amanda Holpuch writes about the unique challenges the US might face in tackling the coronavirus: The US health agency overseeing coronavirus has told Americans that to curb the inevitable spread of the respiratory illness, they only need to take simple steps: wash your hands, stay home from work if you feel sick and speak to a doctor if you have symptoms of the disease. But in the US healthcare system, things are never as simple as they seem. From the cost of healthcare to the lack of guaranteed paid sick days in the US, experts say containing the coronavirus requires systemic change beyond more people washing their hands. \u201cFor many Americans who have insurance and have a good job with an understanding employer, and I\u2019m not an expert on the labor market, those recommendations are plausible,\u201d David Blumenthal, president of the global health thinktank the Commonwealth Fund, told the Guardian. \u201cThey are not necessarily workable for people who have no health insurance or poor health insurance \u2013 so that\u2019s about a fifth of the American population.\u201d Here\u2019s a reminder of the situation in the UK: As of 27 February, a total of 7,690 people have been tested in the UK, of which 7,675 were confirmed negative and 15 positive. (The Department of health updates the figures every day at 2pm.) The official advice to Brits returning from abroad is to call NHS 111, stay indoors and avoid contact with other people immediately if you\u2019ve travelled from: Hubei province in China in the last 14 days, even if you do not have symptoms. Iran, lockdown areas in northern Italy or special care zones in South Korea since 19 February, even if you do not have symptoms. Other parts of mainland China or South Korea, Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan or Thailand in the last 14 days and have a cough, high temperature or shortness of breath (even if your symptoms are mild). Other parts of northern Italy (anywhere north of Pisa, Florence and Rimini), Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar or Vietnam since 19 February and have a cough, high temperature or shortness of breath (even if your symptoms are mild). After President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s warning on Thursday that France was on the brink of a coronavirus epidemic, officials there have announced 20 new cases emerging in the past 24 hours. A dozen cases are centred in the Oise area of northern France, which has emerged as one of the most significant clusters, and concern has homed in on connections to the 110 military airbase in Creil. Although the health minister, Olivier V\u00e9ran, said France was not yet in an epidemic he said the country was prepared for one. Two other French citizens who had recently returned from a trip to Egypt were reported hospitalised in Dijon and Brest. Another individual, in Annecy, had recently returned from northern Italy. Good morning from London. One hundred and sixty-eight Britons remain confined to the H10 Costa Adeje Palace in Tenerife after at least four guests were diagnosed with coronavirus. Sources told the PA Media news agency that about 50 of them will be allowed to leave if they wish. The minister of health in Tenerife said about 130 guests from 11 different countries will be able to leave the hotel if they arrived on Monday, after infected guests had already left. Airline Jet2 has said it will not fly back any people who have been staying at the hotel until they have tested negative for the illness. We will not fly any customer who has stayed at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace during the quarantine, until this incubation period has passed or unless they have been explicitly tested for Covid-19 by a recognised authority and are confirmed as clear of the virus. I\u2019ll be handing over to my colleagues in London shortly, but here\u2019s a quick look at the latest developments. The virus has now spread to about 49 countries, with New Zealand, Belarus, Lithuania, and Nigeria (the first case in sub-Saharan Africa) reporting their first cases in the last day. Many are linked to travellers from Iran. Markets around the world have taken huge hits, and the Chinese economy has seen its worst slump in two decades. The UN security council has decided to lift some economic sanctions on North Korea to help it fend off the virus. Pyongyang still says it has no reported cases. All passengers and crew are now off the Diamond Princess cruise ship. The ability of the US vice-president, Mike Penc,e to lead the country\u2019s response has been questioned by experts. UK schools and offices could close for up to two months if the country is hit by a pandemic. Tokyo\u2019s Disneyland and DisneySea will be closed until mid March. Hyundai has suspended manufacturing at its factory in Ulsan. The bloodletting has ended \u2013 for now \u2013 in some key Asia Pacific markets. They\u2019re still going in China and getting ready for heavy losses in Europe and the US. The Nikkei has closed down 3.67% in Tokyo In Sydney the ASX200 finished off 3.2%. The Kospi ended 3.6% worse off. Hang Seng currently down 2.65% Shanghai down 2.95% The MSCI world index has fallen fell 0.6% and is down 9.4% this week. It\u2019s on course for its biggest weekly decline since November 2008. London and Wall Street both set for heavy losses at the opening The VIx volatility index has spiked to 39, its highest since 2011 Brent crude oil is down almost 3% and threatening to go below $50 a barrel Safe havens such as gold and the yen are up. US government 10-year bond yields are at record lows as investors seek security (yields are inverse to bond prices). Belarus has reported its first coronavirus case, an Iranian student who arrived in the country from Azerbaijan last week, AFP reports. The health ministry said the patient was in a \u201csatisfactory\u201d condition. People with whom the student had been in contact since their arrival on 22 February had been placed in quarantine in the hospital for infectious diseases in the capital, Minsk, it added in a statement. The ministry also said that there would now be health checks on anyone arriving in the country from Italy - the worst affected country in Europe - Iran and South Korea. Travellers from China were already subject to such controls. New Zealand heath and government authorities are detailing the country\u2019s responses, and the individual case which has been reported today. It\u2019s a New Zealand citizen who recently returned from Iran, and they are improving. Public health will be contacting people who were in the same row, and the two rows ahead and behind the person on their final leg - a flight from Bali on 26 February. They\u2019ll be required to self-isolate for 14 days, under regular communication with local public health. The chance of a community outbreak remains low. \u201cThe risk of this disease is being very well managed,\u201d said health minister David Clark, adding that all protocols have been put in place. When they arrived back in New Zealand they traveled home in a private car and then called health workers when they began to feel unwell. \u201cThey followed all of the steps you\u2019d hope would be followed,\u201d said Clark. They tested negative twice before testing positive. New Zealand is the 48th country to identify a case of the virus, Clark said, although a widespread outbreak was still thought to be unlikely. Director-general of health Dr Ashley Bloomfield added: \u201cWe have been preparing for this for some weeks, and we are ready.\u201d \u201cA range of cross government groups are working together\u201d and guided by the pandemic plan, said Clark. \u201cWe are well prepared because we\u2019ve had time to be prepared.\u201d Border restrictions have minimised the chance of further cases arriving. He said his main message to the community was for anyone concerned to ring the helpline number 0800 358 5453, use good handwashing hygiene and cough etiquette. We are expecting a press conference from New Zealand authorities shortly, on the case detected there. In the meantime we have a few more details from AFP. Health officials said the person, reportedly a woman aged in her 60s, was being treated in Auckland City Hospital, and they are \u201cin an improving condition in isolation\u201d. Officials said the person arrived in Auckland on Wednesday and family members went to the hospital after becoming concerned about the individual\u2019s condition. The officials urged any passengers on Wednesday\u2019s final leg of the Emirates airline journey, which goes from Bali to Auckland, to contact authorities if they were concerned. However, authorities downplayed the risk to the public saying the situation was being well managed. \u201cAlthough we have our first case of Covid-19, the chances of community outbreak remain low,\u201d the statement said. AFP has written about the measures being taken in Beijing to control the spread of the virus, amid fears there could be a resurgence. There was a fresh cluster of cases this week, and two deaths reported on Friday. This week, Beijing authorities announced new rules in a bid to disperse crowds in the city of over twenty million people, including many migrant workers from other regions. Supermarkets must allow an average of two square metres per customer - a mandate which not only forces shops to track how many patrons enter, but also means shoppers have to wait outside once stores hit maximum capacity. To prevent crowds from gathering, Beijing authorities have also tightened admission into its parks, especially as spring approaches. After a spike of activity over the weekend, reported official news agency Xinhua on Tuesday, the city\u2019s park authority has clamped down on the flow of visitors. Ten of the capital\u2019s top parks, including the historic Summer Palace, will cap the number of visitors at any given time to 30 percent of their maximum capacity, said Xinhua. The Sacramento Bee is reporting three students living in dormitories at UC Davis has been placed in isolation after one showed \u201cmild\u201d symptoms of the virus. The student has a runny nose and a cough after potentially being exposed to someone with coronavirus, officials said. The individual is in isolation at a home off campus. The two other individuals in isolation are the student\u2019s roommates and are not showing signs of the virus. Important info for New Zealanders who have traveled recently. Capital Economics says China\u2019s economy will shrink in the first quarter of this year despite the slowdown in the number of new virus cases. Activity is still subdued in the world\u2019s second-biggest economy, Capital says, and the impact on domestic demand and international supply chains will have a profound effect on the global outlook. The consultancy, which has a page monitoring economic activity in China which is open to the public, says: The extended disruption from efforts to contain COVID-19 means that China\u2019s economy is already in the midst of the deepest contraction in at least two decades. And the potential hit to foreign demand and supply chains from the global spread of the virus risks dampening the subsequent recovery. Lithuania has reported its first case of the virus, in a woman who returned this week from a visit to Italy\u2019s northern city of Verona. In a statement, the Lithuanian government said the woman had been isolated in hospital in the northern town of Siauliai following her return on Monday. She has been under observation since, and is showing only slight symptoms, with no elevated temperature at the moment, it added. There are also more details about the case in Nigeria, the first for sub-Saharan Africa, via Reuters. The country\u2019s health minister Osagie Ehanire, said in a statement the case was an Italian citizen who works in Nigeria and returned from Milan, Italy to Lagos on 25 February. His infection was confirmed by the Virology Laboratory of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, part of the Laboratory Network of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control. \u201cThe patient is clinically stable, with no serious symptoms,\u201d said the minister, adding that he was being treated at a hospital in the Lagos district of Yaba. \u201cWe have already started working to identify all the contacts of the patient, since he entered Nigeria,\u201d said Ehanire. New Zealand has confirmed the first case of the virus, according to RNZ. It\u2019s reporting the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has confirmed the diagnosis in a permanent resident of New Zealand who had recently been in Iran. Things are going from bad to worse on the financial markets with the selloff intensifying throughout the Asian trading session. The Nikkei is down 4.12% in Tokyo ASX200 in Sydney is down 3%. In Seoul, the Kospi index has lost 2.87% Hong Kong has shed 2.5% Shanghai is off by 3.37% after escaping the worst in the last few days. MSCI world index down 0.5% after 3.3% drop on Thursday. It is off 9.3% this week, on course for its biggest weekly decline since a 9.8% plunge in November 2008. The Vix volatility index \u2013 also known as the fear index \u2013 spiked to 39, its highest since the European debt crisis of 2011. Brent crude oil is down 2.2% at $51.01 per barrel Currencies seen as risky bets such as the Australia dollar, the Indonesian rupiah and the Indian rupee were sharply down. Safe havens such as gold, Japanese yen and US government bonds were up. AFP: Internet search giant Baidu has warned the deadly coronavirus outbreak could drive revenues down in the first quarter, as it reported steady annual revenue growth. The Beijing-based group has forecast a plunge of between five percent and 13 percent due to the economic uncertainty surrounding the new virus, which is rapidly spreading around the world. It is forecasting revenues between 21.0 billion yuan ($3.0 billion) and 22.9 billion yuan in the first three months of the year. \u201cThe coronavirus situation in China is evolving, and business visibility is very limited,\u201d the firm said in its statement, adding that the outlook was \u201csubject to substantial uncertainty\u201d. The operator of Tokyo\u2019s two Disney resorts, Disneyland and DisneySea, said Friday the parks would be closed for around two weeks on fears over the outbreak of the new coronavirus. \u201cTokyo Disneyland and Tokyo Disney Sea have decided to proceed with an extraordinary closure from Saturday February 29, 2020, through Sunday 15 March\u201d, after the government urged measures to limit the spread of the virus, the operator said in a statement. The operator Oriental Land said it currently hoped to resume operations from 16 March. \u201cCurrently, we plan to reopen on March 16. But we\u2019ll decide when to open by looking at the situation and developments. We\u2019ll also consult (official) agencies concerned,\u201d a spokesman told AFP. Hong Kong\u2019s Disneyland Resort remains closed \u201cas a precautionary measure in line with preventive efforts\u201d against the coronavirus. Coronavirus chaos is causing congestion as high trade volumes clog the systems of brokers. \u201cWe are seeing high volumes of trading today,\u201d onliner broker Commsec, which is owned by the Commonwealth Bank, says in a message to website customers. \u201cPlease be advised that our contact centres are busier than usual and you may experience longer than usual wait times.\u201d At about 2.45pm on Friday the benchmark ASX200 index was down 2.9%, with the falls led by the Harvey Norman retail empire controlled by Gerry Harvey. Harvey Norman shares have plummeted more than 11% so far today. While other retails have suffered from coronavirus contagion this week, until today, when it released a disappointing profit result, the Harvey Norman empire had largely escaped unscathed. Also smashed were gold miners Gold Road Resources - down 14% - and Silver Lake resources, which was down more than 10.5%. But every sector has been hammered today, with all but 13 stocks in the index recording a fall. Home affairs minister Peter Dutton says Australia has \u201cone of the toughest border protection system in the world, and probably the best health system in the world\u201d and is well prepared. He urged Australians to continue to go out and support communities and small businesses, and travel, especially to bushfire affected areas of NSW, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia. New Zealand said on Friday that it was placing temporary restrictions on incoming travellers from Iran as a precautionary measure to protect against the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cThis means people will not be able to travel from Iran to New Zealand and anyone who has been in Iran in the last 14 days will need to self-isolate,\u201d Health Minister David Clark said in a statement. The death toll in Iran from coronavirus had risen to 26, by far the highest number outside China. New Zealand also decided not to allow any exemptions for overseas students from China to enter the country. Clark added there would be an increased presence of health staff that would meet direct international flights landing at New Zealand airports from Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Thailand. Hyundai has suspended production at one of its South Korean factories, in the city of Ulsan, after a worker tested positive for the virus, a union source has told Reuters. A Hyundai spokesman said the company was checking the report. Shares of the automaker dropped more than 5% after the news, while the wider market was down 2.6%. Some developments in business and finance: Hyundai, the South Korean carmaker, has suspended production at a factory in Ulsan after one of its workers tested positive for the virus. Shares of the automaker dropped more than 5% after the news, while the wider Korean market was down 2.6%. Tokyo Disneyland says it will be closed until mid-March because of concerns about transmission in large crowds. Both Tokyo Disneyland and DisneySea will be closed starting Saturday, the theme parks\u2019 operators, Oriental Land, said on Friday. Japanese PM Shinzo Abe said on Friday that the government had reserve funding it could use to tackle the hit from the virus. \u201cI\u2019m aware of views that if the virus spreads, it could have a huge impact on the economy,\u201d Abe told parliament. \u201cWe\u2019re therefore watching developments carefully.\u201d Futures in Brent crude oil, the international benchmark, have fallen 1.7% to $50.83 a barrel, a 14-month low. Fears of a major economic slump also sent US crude futures to $46.28 per barrel. From AP: K-pop superstar group BTS has canceled a series of planned concerts in Seoul in April due to concerns about a soaring viral outbreak in South Korea. The band\u2019s management agency said Friday: \u201cWe regret to announce that the BTS MAP OF THE SOUL TOUR ... has been cancelled.\u201d A statement from Big Hit Entertainment says the band was supposed to perform on April 11-12 and April 18-19 at Seoul\u2019s Olympic Stadium. It said the Covid-19 \u201coutbreak has made it impossible at this time to predict the scale of the outbreak during the dates of the concert in April.\u201d Chris Froome and Mark Cavendish are among riders who will be tested for the coronavirus after the UAE Tour was cancelled on Thursday when two participants contracted Covid-19. The final two stages of the race were due to take place on Friday and Saturday but the race was abandoned when the Italian duo were taken ill. All riders and staff were confined to their rooms at the Crowne Royal Plaza Abu Dhabi Yas Island, with concerns that the potential outbreak could now extend to the UCI world track championships in Berlin after some riders who took part in the early stage of the UAE Tour already in Germany. From Reuters: Robert Redfield, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told the U.S. Congress on Thursday that his agency is aggressively evaluating how long coronavirus can survive and be infectious on surfaces. \u201cOn copper and steel its pretty typical, it\u2019s pretty much about 2 hours,\u201d Redfield said at a House of Representatives hearing on the government response to the fast-spreading virus. \u201cBut I will say on other surfaces - cardboard or plastic - it\u2019s longer, and so we are looking at this.\u201d He said infections contracted from surfaces rather than through the air could have contributed to the outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. There are few details yet, but Nigeria has reported one case of the virus detected. This is the first case in sub-Saharan Africa. The case was confirmed on 27 February, the health ministry said. Asia Pacific stocks are being hammered for the fifth day running as investors scramble to offload shares and other risky assets. The Nikkei is down 3.2% in Tokyo and the ASX200 in Sydney is down 2.4%. In Seoul, the market is down 2.3%, Hong Kong has shed 2% and Shanghai is off by 1.7%. It follows a record points loss on Wall Street on Thursday. Safe havens benefited in contrast. US 10-year bond yields hit another record low 1.241%. It last stood at 1.274%. The move indicates a strong likelihood of further rate cuts by the Federal Reserve this year. Tomoaki Shishido, senior economist at Nomura Securities in Tokyo, said the Fed would not even have to wait for data to make up its mind: We don\u2019t even need to wait for economic data to see how badly the economy is being hit. You can tell that the sales of airlines and hotels are already falling by a half or something like that. It is fair to say the impact of the coronavirus will be clearly much bigger than the US-China trade war. So the Fed does not have a reason to take a wait-and-see stance next month. The chief health officer, Brendan Murphy, says part of Australia\u2019s planning is setting up dedicated primary care clinics to try to get people who get infection to isolate at home and delay the spread. He said it\u2019s significant that children seem to be less affected by this virus on the evidence so far. One of the surprising features about this is how few children seem to have been identified as infected. That is very unusual compared to, say, influenza. We don\u2019t know whether children are getting the disease but also mild they are not being picked up as being sick or they are somehow less susceptible. That will be an important thing to find out. Whatever the reason, the fact that we\u2019re not seeing lots of children getting sick in China other parts of the world is a great thing. Hunt was also asked about the Olympics in Japan later this year: \u201cThe question of the Olympics will be determined in some months. Japan and the IOC will be making global decisions and Australia will be a part of those discussions,\u201d he says. The health minister, Greg Hunt, says the government has led an advanced primary care planning process, working with doctors and with specialists around the country, including in aged care facilities. But Hunt says the main message Australians is to \u201cgo about your ordinary business\u201d. Murphy says being flexible in responding to the virus is key: We don\u2019t quite know how this virus, if it comes to Australia, will behave. And if it will be a slow or a rapid spread. We just need to be prepared for all eventualities. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, is speaking now. He says more than 80% of people who get coronavirus have a mild disease, and reassures Australians that the situation is well prepared for. \u201cAt this stage we are still contained inAustralia. We do not have any evidence whatsoever of community transmission\u201d. \u201cOur concern of course is preparing for any patients who have the more severe delays who need hospital treatment and respiratory and other support. I do want to reiterate though that at this stage, we are still contained in Australia. \u201cNo one should go around wasting face masks,\u201d he says, adding it is \u201cvery likely we will get some more cases in Australia\u201d in the coming weeks. We\u2019re hearing from Australia\u2019s health minister, Greg Hunt. He says the federal government will lead an advanced primary planning process, including an aged care planning process as part of its emergency response to the coronavirus outbreak. Australia enacted its pandemic plan on Thursday. Peru has put specialists on round-the-clock shifts at its biggest airport, in preparation for the emergence of Covid-19, and begun setting up specialist mobile units. South Korea\u2019s centres for disease control and prevention reported 256 new coronavirus cases on Friday, bringing the total number of infected in the country to 2,022. 182 of the new cases were in the southeastern city of Daegu, the location of a church at the centre of South Korea\u2019s outbreak. The death toll is unchanged, at 13. Coronavirus fears are spreading to the Caribbean, where several countries are turning cruise ships away from their ports, Bloomberg reports. On Thursday local officials in the Dominican Republic refused to let passengers off the Braemer, with about 1,500 people on board. The company reportedly labeled this an \u201coverreaction\u201d, due to a \u201csmall number of influenza-like cases on board\u201d, while also saying no guests or crew had shown symptoms consistent with coronavirus. In Cozumel, Mexico, passengers on the MSC Meraviglia are waiting for test results after the ship was refused docking in Jamaica and GRand Cayman. From AFP: The UN Security Council on Thursday declared that it would adopt humanitarian exemptions to the heavy economic sanctions imposed on North Korea to help the impoverished country fight the novel coronavirus, Germany\u2019s ambassador to the UN said. \u201cThe coronavirus issue was discussed and the committee immediately had given permission to export the equipment\u201d used to fight the illness, said Christoph Heusgen, who heads the United Nations body that applies the sanctions imposed on Pyongyang in an effort to force it to give up its ballistic and nuclear programs. Ill-equipped North Korea has weak medical infrastructure and has cut itself off from the outside world, closing its borders as analysts say prevention is its only option. \u201cThe problem is that right now the North Koreans closed the borders,\u201d Heusgen said after a closed-door Council meeting about the reclusive state. The members of the Security Council called on North Korea \u201cto allow this equipment in. So the population can be protected,\u201d he said, without elaborating on the type of equipment. After three weeks in quarantine, all passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship have been evacuated, the Australian is reporting. \u201cPrincess Cruises can confirm that disembarkation of all guests aboard Diamond Princess is complete,\u201d the company said. \u201cSpecialists from the Princess Care Team and Family Assistance programs remain available to both guests and team members.\u201d It had been under strict quarantine since early February, when 10 people tested positive. Crew members will be allowed to return home if they test negative for the virus after two weeks in quarantine in Tokyo. The Diamond Princess has been a particular flashpoint for the virus, with more than 3,500 passengers on board. The vuris spread among the passengers and more than 700 developed Covid-19, and four died. A significant number of passengers were allowed to disembark and return to their home countries - many of which then put them in quarantine, suggesting unease with Japan\u2019s handling of the trip. Several of those returned later developed Covid-19. The National Health Authority has released its infection figures for Thursday. Of the 327 new confirmed cases of the virus, 318 were in the province of Hubei - the epicentre of the outbreak. Most of the deaths (41) were also in Hubei, as well as two in Beijing, and one in Xinjiang. Another 452 suspected cases have been added to China\u2019s reported figures. In more Donald Trump news, the president called the press pool for an unscheduled event, shortly after the Dow Jones index suffered its biggest points fall in history amid coronavirus fears. The president planned to discuss his \u201csuccess in empowering members of the African-American community\u201d, and included guests such as conservative commentator Candace Owens and media personalities Diamond and Silk. The event turned into an impromptu press conference, and Trump started to talk about coronavirus. A quick recap on the devastation in financial markets. Graeme Wearden reports financial markets have suffered fresh, heavy losses, as the coronavirus crisis escalates - threatening to cause major economic disruption. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 slumped by 3.5%, taking it down more than 10% from its recent peak. The index has lost 8%, or \u00a3152bn, this week alone. There were similar heavy losses across Europe, where stocks were hit by fresh cases of Covid-19 - including in Italy - and a warning from France\u2019s president that an epidemic could be close. Wall Street had another turbulent day too, with the Dow suffering its worst points fall ever - down 1,20 points. Further losses are expected on Friday. Traders are very concerned about the impact of more cases in the US, with California revealing it is tracking 8,400 people. Goldman Sachs\u2019s warned that US corporate profit growth could be wiped out is also casting a shadow.... while Bank of America cutting its growth forecasts to an 11-year low. There are also fears that the virus could even push the eurozone into recession. In Australia, Ben Butler reports: Coronavirus fears have driven the Australian market down for the fifth day running, with the benchmark ASX200 index dropping almost 3.2% shortly after the opening bell. Retailer Harvey Norman, which had experienced only very small falls this week, finally succumbed to selling pressure after releasing its half year results this morning. Within half an hour of the opening bell its shares tumbled 7.9%, the third biggest fall among ASX200 stocks. The company blamed \u201cwidespread bushfires and associated severe reductions in air quality that affected many communities\u201d that hit franchisees during the peak Christmas shopping season for a 4.1% fall in its profits for the six months to the end of December compared to the same time the previous year. Buy-now-pay-later company Afterpay, which has been something of a market darling, was the biggest loser in early trade, diving 9.4%. Also plunging were stocks with exposure to the Chinese market or international travel, both of which have been disrupted by the virus crisis. Online flight booking site Webjet and travel agency Flight Centre both fell more than 4%, national carrier Qantas dropped 3% and Air New Zealand, which is listed on the Australian exchange but is not part of the ASX200 index, was also down 3%. Also punished was Andrew \u201cTwiggy\u201d Forrest\u2019s Fortescue Metals, which exports iron ore to China. Its stock fell almost 5.8%. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. Catch up on our earlier coverage here. Before we begin, here\u2019s a summary of the top news lines so far: The Dow Jones index of leading US shares has suffered its biggest points fall in history amid the coronavirus crisis, closing down 1,190.95 in New York. The Australian market plummeted on opening. Northern Ireland and the Netherlands have reported their first cases of the virus. In the US Californian health officials are monitoring 8,400 people for symptoms after their arrival on domestic flights, but they have only an \u201cinadequate\u201d 200 test kits. The New York Times reported a US government whistleblower claiming health workers interacted with Americans quarantined for possible exposure to coronavirus without proper medical training or protective gear, then mingled with the general population. There are 38 confirmed cases of coronavirus in France, more than doubling the tally in 24 hours. 50 Brits were among 130 guests told they can leave a coronavirus-hit Tenerife hotel. The death toll in Italy has reached 17. Facebook Inc said it would cancel its annual developer conference, F8 2020, amid rising concerns of the coronavirus outbreak. MSF has accused Italian authorities of discriminatory action after one of their search and rescue vessels in the Mediterranean was put under quarantine following the disembarkation of 276 passengers who had been rescued at sea. Shortly we will be getting China\u2019s daily figures, in the mean time you can read our top stories below. Coronavirus fears trigger biggest one-day fall on US stock market Mike Pence \u2018not up to task\u2019 of leading US coronavirus response, say experts What are super-spreaders and how are they transmitting coronavirus?

At other moments during his speech, Trump digressed to rattle off insults at the Democratic candidates running for president. He mocked the former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg. \u201cHe wished he\u2019d never started. He wished he\u2019d never started. He said: \u2018Well, Trump can do it, I\u2019m going to do it too.\u2019 Was that the worst debate performance in history?\u201d Trump said. He attacked the billionaire Tom Steyer for spending millions on his own presidential campaign. \u201cBut this guy Steyer, he spends all this money. He spends all this money. He\u2019s not that wealthy,\u201d Trump said, urging the crowd to tell him which candidate would be easiest for him to beat. Between diatribes about his possible presidential opponents, Trump bragged about the unemployment rate in South Carolina and nationally, hailing a low jobless rate among African Americans. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign has made outreach to black voters a key pillar of its strategy. In his speech, Trump attacked Democrats\u2019 record on race, saying they had \u201cbetrayed African Americans\u201d: \u201cThey forced their children into failing schools. They shipped their jobs to foreign countries. They pushed their unfair sentencing policies, you know about that \u2026 and they favoured illegal aliens over their own constituents, you know that,\u201d Trump said. He claimed his own administration was reversing such \u201cfailed policies\u201d: \u201cWe\u2019re going to compete for every single vote in 2020 and we expect to win a historic share of the black vote come election day.\u201d",

He sensed something was wrong with me and urged me to go home immediately. That evening I took my body temperature which showed a mild fever. My mom said that if my temperature still didn\u2019t drop later that night, we would go to the hospital. At 11pm that night, the fever hadn\u2019t gone away, so I went to Tongji hospital.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/20/what-is-coronavirus-what-should-i-do-if-i-have-symptoms-how-does-it-spread-from-wuhan-china\">What is coronavirus and what should I do if I have symptoms?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On arrival I saw the hospital already overwhelmed with patients. Seeing doctors in their hazmat suits in real life for the first time, something I\u2019d only seen in documentaries about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/apr/26/sars.china\">Sars</a>, I realised something bad was happening.</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t that astonished or scared when I saw all the people, because it is one of the best hospitals in Wuhan and it is always very crowded. Because of the massive crowds, I decided to go to Wuhan pulmonary hospital instead, and that proved to be the right decision.</p> <p>There was not a single patient there at the time I arrived. There I had blood and liver function [tests] and a CT scan. The CT results came back showing patchy shadows on the lower sides of both of my lungs. I started to take some prescription medicine and Chinese medicine capsules prescribed by the hospital.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"156e34353dc035afb064c27b247eec0c63f95ce0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/156e34353dc035afb064c27b247eec0c63f95ce0/18_152_3653_2391/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Medical staff at the Wuhan Red Cross hospital\" width=\"1000\" height=\"655\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Medical staff at the Wuhan Red Cross hospital.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: STR/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Wuhan started to be locked down, that\u2019s when my dad had me quarantine myself at home. I also knew from watching movies and things that we should probably stock up on food at home, so we bought a bunch of instant noodles, which no one ended up eating. There was enough at the supermarket; the only thing we really couldn\u2019t find was disinfectants.</p> <p>My father is an office worker at a drug company and my mom went to school at a medical university, so they were good with helping analyse my situation. I started to self-isolate on 22 January. My room has its own tub and bathroom, so it is pretty convenient. My grandma did the cooking for me and when she brought food in, she would wear a mask and we\u2019d use disposable chopsticks and things like that, so after I was done that all got thrown out.</p> <h2>\u2018The worst time\u2019</h2> <p>On 25 January I had a checkup. I had begun to cough. It was a very dry cough with a little yellow phlegm. The results showed that my situation was worsening, with the infection spreading to my entire lungs. The doctor gave me an IV drip, while the oral medicine remained the same. At the time the doctor told me I was suspected of having the virus, but that only an expert committee could decide who would be able to use the testing kit.</p> <p>By 26 January getting up had become extremely difficult and I was shivering with cold. I felt I was having a high fever, and I was: 39C. Reports later said that the situation could develop extremely fast in the middle stage, but before I knew it, by that evening the fever was gone. It felt like having been to hell and back. That period from 21 January to the 26th was the worst time. I coughed so bad my stomach was hurting and my back ached. Those were some of the worst days in my life.</p> <p>It was then that I realised I needed some spiritual support or maybe I couldn\u2019t make it. So I watched my favourite anime show and seeing their normal, happy lives, I thought I may have to say goodbye to this life forever. But watching the show, the heroine had troubles in the first half, but she finally made it and succeeded in her career.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3fcb7dff1ebec56d3c4c51c83060191999105391\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3fcb7dff1ebec56d3c4c51c83060191999105391/0_0_2200_1650/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A doll of anime character Uzuki Shimamura, who is voiced by Tiger Ye\u2019s idol Ayaka Ohashi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A doll of anime character Uzuki Shimamura, who is voiced by Tiger Ye\u2019s idol, Ayaka Ohashi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied by Tiger Ye</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You see, I was going to fly to Japan in mid-February to go to a concert by Ayaka Ohashi, a Japanese voice actress and anime artist, but with the lockdown I thought everything might be cancelled. I had attended her solo performance last year, and after watching her I had decided I wanted to make a career out of managing voice actors. So watching the show, I thought: I must make it if I want to see her next concert alive. This really encouraged me and gave me some relief, along with the medicine. I dreamed twice that week that I met her. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/19/dissent-becomes-another-victim-of-coronavirus-as-china-cracks-down\">Dissent becomes the next victim of coronavirus as China cracks down</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I had another re-exam on 28 January, which showed both my lungs were getting better. After a medical consultation between the doctors, they decided I was qualified for being tested for the coronavirus.</p> <h2>The virus spreads</h2> <p>My elder brother began to have a fever and cough on the 29th. His exam results showed there were small patches of glass-like shadows in his lungs. He was considered a suspected case. On the same day, my grandma also had a fever.

      "bodyText": "On 17 January my muscles became sore all over. I may have had a slight fever, but it wasn\u2019t strong enough to notice. Looking back, it is a little scary, because my house and the language school where I study Japanese are within a 5km radius of the Wuhan seafood market (where the virus is believed to have originated). To treat my muscle soreness, I took some cold tablets because I thought it was a normal cold. Now that I think of it, I might have missed the best time for treatment, failing to contain the virus with antiviral drugs in its early stages. I have no idea how I got the virus. I always eat at the same Hong Kong-style restaurant below my school. I wasn\u2019t walking around much at the time because it was very cold, and since I was tired after classes I always went back home. Once the semester break started, I stayed with my parents and not at the dormitory. I started wearing a mask a few days later when I saw everyone else around me wearing masks. Sickness and self-isolation By 21 January my body was still aching all over, so I called my dad. He sensed something was wrong with me and urged me to go home immediately. That evening I took my body temperature which showed a mild fever. My mom said that if my temperature still didn\u2019t drop later that night, we would go to the hospital. At 11pm that night, the fever hadn\u2019t gone away, so I went to Tongji hospital. On arrival I saw the hospital already overwhelmed with patients. Seeing doctors in their hazmat suits in real life for the first time, something I\u2019d only seen in documentaries about Sars, I realised something bad was happening. I wasn\u2019t that astonished or scared when I saw all the people, because it is one of the best hospitals in Wuhan and it is always very crowded. Because of the massive crowds, I decided to go to Wuhan pulmonary hospital instead, and that proved to be the right decision. There was not a single patient there at the time I arrived. There I had blood and liver function [tests] and a CT scan. The CT results came back showing patchy shadows on the lower sides of both of my lungs. I started to take some prescription medicine and Chinese medicine capsules prescribed by the hospital. When Wuhan started to be locked down, that\u2019s when my dad had me quarantine myself at home. I also knew from watching movies and things that we should probably stock up on food at home, so we bought a bunch of instant noodles, which no one ended up eating. There was enough at the supermarket; the only thing we really couldn\u2019t find was disinfectants. My father is an office worker at a drug company and my mom went to school at a medical university, so they were good with helping analyse my situation. I started to self-isolate on 22 January. My room has its own tub and bathroom, so it is pretty convenient. My grandma did the cooking for me and when she brought food in, she would wear a mask and we\u2019d use disposable chopsticks and things like that, so after I was done that all got thrown out. \u2018The worst time\u2019 On 25 January I had a checkup. I had begun to cough. It was a very dry cough with a little yellow phlegm. The results showed that my situation was worsening, with the infection spreading to my entire lungs. The doctor gave me an IV drip, while the oral medicine remained the same. At the time the doctor told me I was suspected of having the virus, but that only an expert committee could decide who would be able to use the testing kit. By 26 January getting up had become extremely difficult and I was shivering with cold. I felt I was having a high fever, and I was: 39C. Reports later said that the situation could develop extremely fast in the middle stage, but before I knew it, by that evening the fever was gone. It felt like having been to hell and back. That period from 21 January to the 26th was the worst time. I coughed so bad my stomach was hurting and my back ached. Those were some of the worst days in my life. It was then that I realised I needed some spiritual support or maybe I couldn\u2019t make it. So I watched my favourite anime show and seeing their normal, happy lives, I thought I may have to say goodbye to this life forever. But watching the show, the heroine had troubles in the first half, but she finally made it and succeeded in her career. You see, I was going to fly to Japan in mid-February to go to a concert by Ayaka Ohashi, a Japanese voice actress and anime artist, but with the lockdown I thought everything might be cancelled. I had attended her solo performance last year, and after watching her I had decided I wanted to make a career out of managing voice actors. So watching the show, I thought: I must make it if I want to see her next concert alive. This really encouraged me and gave me some relief, along with the medicine. I dreamed twice that week that I met her. I had another re-exam on 28 January, which showed both my lungs were getting better. After a medical consultation between the doctors, they decided I was qualified for being tested for the coronavirus. The virus spreads My elder brother began to have a fever and cough on the 29th. His exam results showed there were small patches of glass-like shadows in his lungs. He was considered a suspected case. On the same day, my grandma also had a fever. As for me, my test results were positive and I was officially a confirmed case. The hospital gave me five days of an anti-HIV medicine for free, while my family were also starting to take prescribed medicine. Due to my improved situation and limited beds in the hospital, I was told to go home and isolate myself, and thus my IV therapy ended. My brother had a re-exam and he tested positive on 2 February. My grandmother had a fever for four days but then recovered. She was never tested, and neither was my mother, but they all took medicine. My brother also eventually recovered and is now negative for the virus. On 4 February, a CT scan showed continued improvements in my lungs, and my cough stopped. I was given another coronavirus test and prescribed more medicine. The next day test results showed I was negative for the virus, but according to instructions from the doctors, I needed to go back for another test. On 7 February results showed again that I was negative, and I was declared recovered. As told to Michael Standaert",

It has 14 manufacturing sites as well as several offices including a trendy set-up reserved for digital-focused staff where hot-deskers can work in a leafy central atrium or overlooking yachts bobbing in the harbour. Constantine has been an ethical retail crusader for decades and was part of the early success of The Body Shop. He met the late Anita Roddick, founder of The Body Shop, when he was in his early 20s and became an important supplier to her business, concocting popular products such as peppermint foot cream and cocoa butter body lotion. A tenth of Lush is now owned by staff. The company\u2019s founders \u2013 who include Constantine\u2019s wife, Mo \u2013 promise to sell shares to the trust with the ambition that employees will eventually own 35%. He is confident profits will recover but downhearted that the retailer\u2019s finances are strained at a time when Lush\u2019s business model is in tune with the zeitgeist. \u201cI feel very much like I\u2019ve been preparing for this moment all my life: where climate change becomes obvious, where excessive packaging is understood, where a sustainable supply is vital and regeneration is important,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut my God, it\u2019s chaos.\u201d With department stores in the frontline of the retail downturn, Constantine sees scope to commandeer empty stores and turn them into giant soap emporia where shoppers can stock up on shower gel and moisturiser before getting their hair done or having a facial. All 23 Beales outlets \u2013 including the prominent store in Poole \u2013 are closing after the department store chain went bust, adding to the growing number of empty stores around the country. Lush has invested in a 1,390 sq metre (15,000 sq ft) store in Liverpool that the businessman hopes will impress landlords. \u201cPerhaps they would like to pop round and have a look?\u201d he says. \u201cThey would have to help me though because I\u2019ve spent all me bleedin\u2019 money doing the big stuff.\u201d",

I regret I do not believe her,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has not made the efforts I would expect to disassociate herself against from the comments.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/29/priti-patel-how-bullying-allegations-unfolded\">Priti Patel: how the bullying allegations unfolded</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rutnam said he had tried to reconcile with Patel at the request of the cabinet secretary and Boris Johnson. \u201cBut despite my efforts to engage with her, Priti Patel has made no efforts to engage with me to discuss this,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He said this gave him very strong grounds to claim for constructive dismissal, which he would be pursuing in the courts. He said his treatment was \u201cpart of a wider pattern in government\u201d.</p> <p>The simmering tensions between Patel and her permanent secretary surfaced last weekend with various reports about a rift between the two. Rutnam made light of those reports when he appeared at a police summit in London on Thursday, saying: \u201cYou probably have already heard a great deal more about permanent secretaries in the last few days than you ever expected to.\u201d</p> <p>The reports of feuding at the top of the Home Office prompted Sedwill, to tell all civil servants that advice they provided for ministers and any debates around it should remain private.</p> <p>Various reports last weekend suggested Patel had clashed with senior officials, belittled colleagues and was distrusted by intelligence chiefs. One report suggested Patel had tried to move Rutnam from her department after the rows.</p> <p>The swirl of reports about turmoil in the Home Office prompted Downing Street to insist last Monday that the prime minister had full confidence in Patel.</p> <p>Patel expressed concern at the claims, which she described as false, while allies described her as a demanding boss but not a bully. The government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/23/mi5-rejects-claims-withhold-intelligence-priti-patel\">denied claims</a> that MI5 chiefs did not trust Patel and were limiting intelligence-sharing as a result.</p> <p>Starmer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Keir_Starmer/status/1233746577493237760\">said</a> that Rutnam\u2019s departure was the latest development in a body of \u201cgrowing evidence of a serious breakdown of government\u201d. He <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Keir_Starmer/status/1233746577493237760\">tweeted</a>: \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s handling of the flooding and coronavirus has been woeful, advisers in Number 10 are out of control, and attacks on the civil service are growing. I would therefore call on the liaison committee to hold an urgent inquiry into the culture and workings of government.\u201d</p> <p>Rutnam made clear his anger in his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/29/philip-rutnam-resignation-his-full-statement\">statement on Saturday</a>, which he read to the BBC outside an address in north London. He said he had received allegations that Patel\u2019s conduct had included belittling people and making unreasonable demands.</p> <p>He said: \u201cOne of my duties as permanent secretary was to protect the health, safety and wellbeing of our 35,000 people. This created tension with the home secretary and I have encouraged her to change her behaviours.</p> <p>\u201cI have received allegations that her conduct has included shouting and swearing, belittling people, making unreasonable and repeated demands \u2013 behaviour that created fear and that needed some bravery to call out.\u201d</p> <p>He claimed the Home Office offered him a financial settlement to avoid his public resignation, and he said he hoped his stand \u201cmay help in maintaining the quality of government in this country\u201d.</p> <p>A statement from Sedwill thanked Rutnam for his \u201clong and dedicated career of public service\u201d and announced that Shona Dunn, the second permanent secretary at the Home Office responsible for borders, immigration and citizenship, would become acting permanent secretary.</p> <p>Rutnam\u2019s resignation is likely to intensify criticism of the home secretary and put renewed focus on the drive by the PM\u2019s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, to shake up the civil service.</p> <p>Yvette Cooper, the chair of the home affairs select committee, said the allegations reflected \u201cextremely badly on the government\u201d.</p> <p>She said: \u201cTo end up with one of the most senior public servants in the country taking court action against one of the great offices of state shows a shocking level of breakdown in the normal functioning of government.</p> <p>\u201cFor the home secretary and prime minister to have allowed things to reach this point is appalling, especially at a time when the Home Office faces crucial challenges with rising violent crime, forthcoming counter-terror legislation, new immigration laws, and sensitive negotiations on post-Brexit security cooperation.\u201d</p> <p>Cooper said an employment tribunal could take months. \u201cWe cannot afford to have a dysfunctional and distracted Home Office while this tribunal is going on,\u201d she said. \u201cThe work of the Home Office and the home secretary is far too important for that. The prime minister and the cabinet secretary therefore have a duty to investigate these allegations to a much faster timetable so that the normal functioning of the Home Office can be restored.</p> <p>\u201cThe Home Office is too important a department to function with a poisoned relationship between the home secretary and her civil servants.\u201d</p> <p>Jon Trickett, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, said the PM \u201cmust come to the House of Commons to answer Sir Philip Rutnam\u2019s allegations without delay\u201d.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s Stephen Doughty, a member of the Commons home affairs committee during the last parliament, said Patel\u2019s position as home secretary \u201cmust now also be in question\u201d.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokeswoman, Christine Jardine, said serious questions needed to be asked about the culture that was being created at the Home Office. \u201cThe Tories are acting just like Donald Trump, putting ideology ahead of competence, and it\u2019s the British people who will pay the price,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA, the senior public servants\u2019 union, said the resignation \u201cdemonstrates once again the destructive consequences of anonymous briefings against public servants who are unable to publicly defend themselves\u201d.</p> <p>He said: \u201cThis cowardly practice is not only ruining lives and careers but at a time when the Home Office is being tasked with delivering a demanding government agenda on immigration, and preparing for a public health emergency, it has diverted energy and resource into responding to unfounded accusations from sources claiming to be allies of the home secretary.\u201d</p> <p>Penman said the Home Office now needed to find new leadership at a time when it needed stability. He said: \u201cThose who engage in anonymous briefings need to bear the responsibility for this destructive behaviour. Only the prime minister can put a stop to this behaviour and unless he does so, he will have to accept his own responsibility for the consequences.\u201d</p>",

Rutnam, the former permanent secretary, said he had been accused of briefing the media against Patel, an accusation he said was completely false. \u201cThe home secretary categorically denied any involvement in this campaign to the Cabinet Office. I regret I do not believe her,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has not made the efforts I would expect to disassociate herself against from the comments.\u201d Rutnam said he had tried to reconcile with Patel at the request of the cabinet secretary and Boris Johnson. \u201cBut despite my efforts to engage with her, Priti Patel has made no efforts to engage with me to discuss this,\u201d he said. He said this gave him very strong grounds to claim for constructive dismissal, which he would be pursuing in the courts. He said his treatment was \u201cpart of a wider pattern in government\u201d. The simmering tensions between Patel and her permanent secretary surfaced last weekend with various reports about a rift between the two. Rutnam made light of those reports when he appeared at a police summit in London on Thursday, saying: \u201cYou probably have already heard a great deal more about permanent secretaries in the last few days than you ever expected to.\u201d The reports of feuding at the top of the Home Office prompted Sedwill, to tell all civil servants that advice they provided for ministers and any debates around it should remain private. Various reports last weekend suggested Patel had clashed with senior officials, belittled colleagues and was distrusted by intelligence chiefs. One report suggested Patel had tried to move Rutnam from her department after the rows. The swirl of reports about turmoil in the Home Office prompted Downing Street to insist last Monday that the prime minister had full confidence in Patel. Patel expressed concern at the claims, which she described as false, while allies described her as a demanding boss but not a bully. The government denied claims that MI5 chiefs did not trust Patel and were limiting intelligence-sharing as a result. Starmer said that Rutnam\u2019s departure was the latest development in a body of \u201cgrowing evidence of a serious breakdown of government\u201d. He tweeted: \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s handling of the flooding and coronavirus has been woeful, advisers in Number 10 are out of control, and attacks on the civil service are growing. I would therefore call on the liaison committee to hold an urgent inquiry into the culture and workings of government.\u201d Rutnam made clear his anger in his statement on Saturday, which he read to the BBC outside an address in north London. He said he had received allegations that Patel\u2019s conduct had included belittling people and making unreasonable demands. He said: \u201cOne of my duties as permanent secretary was to protect the health, safety and wellbeing of our 35,000 people. This created tension with the home secretary and I have encouraged her to change her behaviours. \u201cI have received allegations that her conduct has included shouting and swearing, belittling people, making unreasonable and repeated demands \u2013 behaviour that created fear and that needed some bravery to call out.\u201d He claimed the Home Office offered him a financial settlement to avoid his public resignation, and he said he hoped his stand \u201cmay help in maintaining the quality of government in this country\u201d. A statement from Sedwill thanked Rutnam for his \u201clong and dedicated career of public service\u201d and announced that Shona Dunn, the second permanent secretary at the Home Office responsible for borders, immigration and citizenship, would become acting permanent secretary. Rutnam\u2019s resignation is likely to intensify criticism of the home secretary and put renewed focus on the drive by the PM\u2019s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, to shake up the civil service. Yvette Cooper, the chair of the home affairs select committee, said the allegations reflected \u201cextremely badly on the government\u201d. She said: \u201cTo end up with one of the most senior public servants in the country taking court action against one of the great offices of state shows a shocking level of breakdown in the normal functioning of government. \u201cFor the home secretary and prime minister to have allowed things to reach this point is appalling, especially at a time when the Home Office faces crucial challenges with rising violent crime, forthcoming counter-terror legislation, new immigration laws, and sensitive negotiations on post-Brexit security cooperation.\u201d Cooper said an employment tribunal could take months. \u201cWe cannot afford to have a dysfunctional and distracted Home Office while this tribunal is going on,\u201d she said. \u201cThe work of the Home Office and the home secretary is far too important for that. The prime minister and the cabinet secretary therefore have a duty to investigate these allegations to a much faster timetable so that the normal functioning of the Home Office can be restored. \u201cThe Home Office is too important a department to function with a poisoned relationship between the home secretary and her civil servants.\u201d Jon Trickett, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, said the PM \u201cmust come to the House of Commons to answer Sir Philip Rutnam\u2019s allegations without delay\u201d. Labour\u2019s Stephen Doughty, a member of the Commons home affairs committee during the last parliament, said Patel\u2019s position as home secretary \u201cmust now also be in question\u201d. The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokeswoman, Christine Jardine, said serious questions needed to be asked about the culture that was being created at the Home Office. \u201cThe Tories are acting just like Donald Trump, putting ideology ahead of competence, and it\u2019s the British people who will pay the price,\u201d she said. Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA, the senior public servants\u2019 union, said the resignation \u201cdemonstrates once again the destructive consequences of anonymous briefings against public servants who are unable to publicly defend themselves\u201d. He said: \u201cThis cowardly practice is not only ruining lives and careers but at a time when the Home Office is being tasked with delivering a demanding government agenda on immigration, and preparing for a public health emergency, it has diverted energy and resource into responding to unfounded accusations from sources claiming to be allies of the home secretary.\u201d Penman said the Home Office now needed to find new leadership at a time when it needed stability. He said: \u201cThose who engage in anonymous briefings need to bear the responsibility for this destructive behaviour. Only the prime minister can put a stop to this behaviour and unless he does so, he will have to accept his own responsibility for the consequences.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "NHS doctors have told the Guardian of their experiences of the government\u2019s handling of coronavirus, warning that they have concerns about how patients who may have been infected are being managed. James*, a GP in Derbyshire, where one of the latest British coronavirus cases is thought to have been located, described the Department of Health\u2019s response to the virus as \u201cridiculous\u201d and \u201cnegligent\u201d. He said none of his patients who had travelled back from at-risk countries had been given any information at airports or sea ports on what to do if they developed symptoms of coronavirus. James said his practice had seen patients arriving back from affected areas, some of whom had been on cruises around many regions experiencing coronavirus outbreaks, who had not been given any information on what to do if they developed symptoms. Other patients reported flying back from the affected countries and finding there was no information on arrival at Heathrow regarding public health advice. The lack of information has led to many booking appointments with their GP, which risks infecting other patients with weaker immune systems. \u201cIt\u2019s a no-brainer, the government need to tell those who are coming back what to do,\u201d James said. \u201cThey\u2019ve missed almost everyone at this stage of arrivals.\u201d Despite his surgery website and posters clearly instructing people who have travelled to affected regions in recent weeks not to enter the GP practice, James said some patients have \u201cbreezed past our bright yellow posters suggesting they stay at home\u201d. \u201cThere seems to be an attitude of: \u2018We don\u2019t care if we infect a whole GP surgery full of people,\u2019\u201d he said. While many patients had followed Public Health England\u2019s advice to stay at home and call the NHS helpline 111 after returning from affected areas, \u201csome had been told to go into the GP practice\u201d, James said. \u201cThe helpline later claimed this advice was given in error, saying that the patient must have selected the wrong telephone answering choice,\u201d he added. Online bookings were proving a further obstacle in the practice\u2019s attempts to prevent the spread of the virus. James\u2019s GP surgery is contractually obliged to offer online booking services, which means they cannot prevent those with symptoms from getting appointments at the practice. James and his colleagues contacted Derbyshire\u2019s clinical commissioning group to try to stop online bookings until after the outbreak had passed, but were told they could not do so until a coronavirus case had been confirmed in the region. It is unclear how Thursday\u2019s confirmed case will impact the practice. \u201cIt strikes me as closing the stable door a decade after the horse has bolted,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole approach is as leaky as a sieve.\u201d In south London, one GP practice criticised the government\u2019s response to the virus, after two parents \u2013 one of whom had travelled to a number of affected areas in Asia and become sick for a short time afterwards \u2013 called the practice after the infant developed symptoms of coronavirus. A GP at the practice called NHS 111 on the parents\u2019 behalf, but was told the family must call themselves to get help. When they called the helpline, the family were told to attend a GP hub centre, a service to which 111 regularly refers callers, which is not specific to coronavirus. \u201cThey could absolutely have infected other people there,\u201d said Sarah*, a GP who works at the practice where the family first arrived. On arrival, the family were turned away as no appointment had been booked. After calling the helpline again, they received the same advice, but were again turned away after arriving at the centre. The doctor they saw on their third attempt reportedly neglected to consider the family\u2019s travel history and diagnosed the infant with a different illness \u2013 without testing them for coronavirus. \u201cIt\u2019s a catch 22,\u201d said Sarah. \u201cThe government aren\u2019t doing one thing or the other.

Emma*, a doctor at a hospital in London, recently returned from a holiday near northern Italy, where the coronavirus has broken out. Her daughter, Alice*, developed symptoms of the virus, and she called the 111 helpline three times. They eventually told her to attend her GP surgery \u2013 advice that contradicts Public Health England\u2019s guidance to stay at home.

      "bodyText": "World stock markets are expected to fall further next week after the first surveys of China\u2019s economic health since the coronavirus outbreak showed factory output has plunged and the country\u2019s service sectors have contracted. Illustrating how the virus could wreck the economic forecasts of other affected countries, the world\u2019s second largest economy reported that manufacturing production levels dropped to record lows in February. Stock markets tumbled last week as the virus spread to four continents and UN health officials upgraded the level of threat from the virus to \u201cvery high\u201d. It is likely the fresh data, which measures the economic impact of Beijing\u2019s efforts to clamp down on the virus, will further spook investors who sent global markets tumbling 11% last week in the worst seven-day period for stocks since the 2008 financial crash. With factories forced to remain closed after the traditional lunar new year holiday shutdown, China\u2019s official Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI), a widely watched measure of economic activity, fell further in February than at any time in the last 12 years, China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics said. The bureau found a significant collapse in domestic and export orders and a contraction of the country\u2019s burgeoning service sector. Similar surveys expected next month covering Japan and South Korea, both seriously affected by the coronavirus outbreak, could prolong the rout on global stock markets, analysts said. The outbreak has already disrupted supplies to factories in Europe, where companies have struggled to access vital components sourced from east Asia. Investors expect to find out in the next few days whether the outbreak is accelerating in the US, the world\u2019s biggest economy, and how far central banks and governments are prepared to go to deal with an epidemic. \u201cRight now the market is saying that this is unbounded. We don\u2019t know what the limits are and we don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going to peak,\u201d said Graham Tanaka, the chief investment officer at New York-based Tanaka Capital. Stock markets globally lost about $5tn (\u00a33.9tn) of value last week, as measured by the MSCI all-country index. Last weekend China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, told local officials that low-risk areas should \u201cresume full production and normal life\u201d. The government reported that larger factories reached 85.6% of their capacity by the middle of last week. Analysts at ING said: \u201cThis isn\u2019t as positive as it sounds.

In a statement issued via the campaign, Zaghari-Ratcliffe said: \u201cI am not good. I feel very bad in fact. It is a strange cold. Not like usual.

Her husband Richard Ratcliffe had earlier raised concerns at Evin prison\u2019s \u201crefusal to test her\u201d for the virus, which has spread rapidly in Iran. The Foreign Office (FCO) has called on the Iranian government to \u201cimmediately allow\u201d health officials into the prison . The FCO said: \u201cWe are urgently seeking information from the Iranian authorities on reports that coronavirus is spreading in Evin prison, including to British-Iranian dual nationals. \u201cWe call on the Iranian government to immediately allow health professionals into Evin prison to assess the situation of British-Iranian dual nationals there.\u201d So far 43 people in Iran have died from coronavirus \u2013 the most in any country besides China.

Iran confirmed 205 new cases of the coronavirus over the past day, bringing the total number of confirmed infections to 593, The family of another imprisoned British-Iranian national, Anoosheh Ashoori, 65, warned this week of plans to transfer him to the prison\u2019s ward 4, where at least three people are suspected to have the virus. The Iranian judiciary spokesman, Gholam Hossein Ismaili, has responded to growing political pressure over the risk of contagion in prisons by putting prison staff on high alert for signs of the disease. He said he was activating a range of preventive measures including cutting the number of people being sent to jail and allowing some inmates out on temporary early release.

      "body": "<p>One of the seminal texts for anyone interested in technology and society is Melvin Kranzberg\u2019s <a href=\"https://thefrailestthing.com/2011/08/25/kranzbergs-six-laws-of-technology-a-metaphor-and-a-story/\" title=\"\">Six Laws of Technology</a>, the first of which says that \u201ctechnology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral\u201d. By this, Kranzberg meant that technology\u2019s interaction with society is such \u201cthat technical developments frequently have environmental, social and human consequences that go far beyond the immediate purposes of the technical devices and practices themselves, and the same technology can have quite different results when introduced into different contexts or under different circumstances\u201d.</p> <p>The saloon-bar version of this is that \u201ctechnology is both good and bad; it all depends on how it\u2019s used\u201d \u2013 a tactic that tech evangelists regularly deploy as a way of stopping the conversation. So a better way of using Kranzberg\u2019s law is to ask a simple Latin question: <em>Cui </em><em>bono?</em> \u2013 who benefits from any proposed or hyped technology? And, by implication, who loses?</p> <p>With any <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_purpose_technology\" title=\"\">general-purpose technology</a> \u2013 which is what the internet has become \u2013 the answer is going to be complicated: various groups, societies, sectors, maybe even continents \u2013 win and lose, so in the end the question comes down to: who benefits most? For the internet as a whole, it\u2019s too early to say. But when we focus on a particular digital technology, then things become a bit clearer.</p> <p>A case in point is the technology known as \u201cmachine learning\u201d, a manifestation of artificial intelligence that is the tech obsession <em>de nos jours</em>. It\u2019s really a combination of algorithms that are \u201ctrained\u201d on \u201cbig data\u201d, ie huge datasets. In principle, anyone with the computational skills to use freely available software tools such as <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/\" title=\"\">TensorFlow</a> could do machine learning. But in practice they can\u2019t because they don\u2019t have access to the massive data needed to train their algorithms.</p> <p>This means the outfits where most of the leading machine-learning research is being done are a small number of tech giants \u2013 especially Google, Facebook and Amazon \u2013 which have accumulated colossal silos of behavioural data over the last two decades. Since they have come to dominate the technology, the Kranzberg question \u2013 who benefits? \u2013 is easy to answer: they do. Machine learning now drives everything in those businesses \u2013 \u201cpersonalisation\u201d of services, recommendations, precisely targeted advertising, behavioural prediction\u2026 For them, AI (by which they mostly mean machine learning) is \u201c<a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3065420/at-sundar-pichais-google-ai-is-everything-and-everywhe\" title=\"\">everywhere</a>\u201d. And it is making them the most profitable enterprises in the history of capitalism.</p> <p>As a consequence, a powerful technology with great potential for good is at the moment deployed mainly for privatised gain. In the process, <a href=\"https://muse.jhu.edu/article/645268/pdf\" title=\"\">it has been characterised</a> by unregulated premature deployment, algorithmic bias, reinforcing inequality, undermining democratic processes and boosting covert surveillance to toxic levels. That it doesn\u2019t have to be like this was vividly demonstrated last week with a report <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867420301021?via%3Dihub\" title=\"\">in the leading biological journal <em>Cell</em></a> of an extraordinary project, which harnessed machine learning in the public (as compared to the private) interest. The researchers used the technology to tackle the problem of bacterial resistance to conventional antibiotics \u2013 a problem that is rising dramatically worldwide, with predictions that, without a solution, resistant infections could kill 10 million people a year by 2050.</p> <p>The team of MIT and Harvard researchers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/20/antibiotic-that-kills-drug-resistant-bacteria-discovered-through-ai\" title=\"\">built a neural network</a> (an algorithm inspired by the brain\u2019s architecture) and trained it to spot molecules that inhibit the growth of the <em>Escherichia coli</em> bacterium using <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30102-1\" title=\"\">a dataset of 2,335 molecules</a> for which the antibacterial activity was known \u2013 including a library of 300 existing approved antibiotics and 800 natural products from plant, animal and microbial sources. They then asked the network to predict which would be effective against <em>E coli</em> but looked different from conventional antibiotics. This produced a hundred candidates for physical testing and led to one (which they named \u201chalicin\u201d after the HAL 9000 computer from <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>) that was active against a wide spectrum of pathogens \u2013 notably including two that are <em>totally resistant</em> to current antibiotics and are therefore a looming nightmare for hospitals worldwide.</p> <p>There are a number of other examples of machine learning for public good rather than private gain. One thinks, for example, of the collaboration between <a href=\"https://www.moorfields.nhs.uk/content/excited-announce-new-medical-research-partnership-deepmind-health\" title=\"\">Google DeepMind and Moorfields eye hospital</a>. But this new example is the most spectacular to date because it goes beyond augmenting human screening capabilities to aiding the process of discovery. So while the main beneficiaries of machine learning for, say, a toxic technology like facial recognition are mostly authoritarian political regimes and a range of untrustworthy or unsavoury private companies, the beneficiaries of the technology as an aid to scientific discovery could be humanity as a species. The technology, in other words, is both good <em>and</em> bad. Kranzberg\u2019s first law rules OK. </p> <h2>What I\u2019m reading </h2> <p><strong>Every cloud\u2026 </strong><br>Zeynep Tufekci has written a <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/02/coronavirus-and-blindness-authoritarianism/606922/\" title=\"\">perceptive essay</a> for the <em>Atlantic</em> about \u201chow the coronavirus revealed authoritarianism\u2019s fatal flaw\u201d.</p> <p><strong>EU ideas explained </strong><br><em>Politico</em> writers Laura Kayali, Melissa Heikkil\u00e4 and Janosch Delcker have delivered a <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/europes-digital-vision-explained/\" title=\"\">shrewd analysis</a> of the underlying strategy behind recent policy documents from the EU dealing with the digital future.</p> <p><strong>On the nature of loss </strong><br>Jill Lepore has written a knockout <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/08/the-lingering-of-loss\" title=\"\">piece for the <em>New Yorker</em></a> under the heading \u201cThe lingering of loss\u201d, on friendship, grief and remembrance.

By this, Kranzberg meant that technology\u2019s interaction with society is such \u201cthat technical developments frequently have environmental, social and human consequences that go far beyond the immediate purposes of the technical devices and practices themselves, and the same technology can have quite different results when introduced into different contexts or under different circumstances\u201d. The saloon-bar version of this is that \u201ctechnology is both good and bad; it all depends on how it\u2019s used\u201d \u2013 a tactic that tech evangelists regularly deploy as a way of stopping the conversation. So a better way of using Kranzberg\u2019s law is to ask a simple Latin question: Cui bono? \u2013 who benefits from any proposed or hyped technology? And, by implication, who loses? With any general-purpose technology \u2013 which is what the internet has become \u2013 the answer is going to be complicated: various groups, societies, sectors, maybe even continents \u2013 win and lose, so in the end the question comes down to: who benefits most? For the internet as a whole, it\u2019s too early to say. But when we focus on a particular digital technology, then things become a bit clearer. A case in point is the technology known as \u201cmachine learning\u201d, a manifestation of artificial intelligence that is the tech obsession de nos jours. It\u2019s really a combination of algorithms that are \u201ctrained\u201d on \u201cbig data\u201d, ie huge datasets. In principle, anyone with the computational skills to use freely available software tools such as TensorFlow could do machine learning. But in practice they can\u2019t because they don\u2019t have access to the massive data needed to train their algorithms. This means the outfits where most of the leading machine-learning research is being done are a small number of tech giants \u2013 especially Google, Facebook and Amazon \u2013 which have accumulated colossal silos of behavioural data over the last two decades. Since they have come to dominate the technology, the Kranzberg question \u2013 who benefits? \u2013 is easy to answer: they do. Machine learning now drives everything in those businesses \u2013 \u201cpersonalisation\u201d of services, recommendations, precisely targeted advertising, behavioural prediction\u2026 For them, AI (by which they mostly mean machine learning) is \u201ceverywhere\u201d. And it is making them the most profitable enterprises in the history of capitalism. As a consequence, a powerful technology with great potential for good is at the moment deployed mainly for privatised gain. In the process, it has been characterised by unregulated premature deployment, algorithmic bias, reinforcing inequality, undermining democratic processes and boosting covert surveillance to toxic levels. That it doesn\u2019t have to be like this was vividly demonstrated last week with a report in the leading biological journal Cell of an extraordinary project, which harnessed machine learning in the public (as compared to the private) interest. The researchers used the technology to tackle the problem of bacterial resistance to conventional antibiotics \u2013 a problem that is rising dramatically worldwide, with predictions that, without a solution, resistant infections could kill 10 million people a year by 2050. The team of MIT and Harvard researchers built a neural network (an algorithm inspired by the brain\u2019s architecture) and trained it to spot molecules that inhibit the growth of the Escherichia coli bacterium using a dataset of 2,335 molecules for which the antibacterial activity was known \u2013 including a library of 300 existing approved antibiotics and 800 natural products from plant, animal and microbial sources. They then asked the network to predict which would be effective against E coli but looked different from conventional antibiotics. This produced a hundred candidates for physical testing and led to one (which they named \u201chalicin\u201d after the HAL 9000 computer from 2001: A Space Odyssey) that was active against a wide spectrum of pathogens \u2013 notably including two that are totally resistant to current antibiotics and are therefore a looming nightmare for hospitals worldwide. There are a number of other examples of machine learning for public good rather than private gain. One thinks, for example, of the collaboration between Google DeepMind and Moorfields eye hospital. But this new example is the most spectacular to date because it goes beyond augmenting human screening capabilities to aiding the process of discovery. So while the main beneficiaries of machine learning for, say, a toxic technology like facial recognition are mostly authoritarian political regimes and a range of untrustworthy or unsavoury private companies, the beneficiaries of the technology as an aid to scientific discovery could be humanity as a species. The technology, in other words, is both good and bad. Kranzberg\u2019s first law rules OK. What I\u2019m reading Every cloud\u2026 Zeynep Tufekci has written a perceptive essay for the Atlantic about \u201chow the coronavirus revealed authoritarianism\u2019s fatal flaw\u201d. EU ideas explained Politico writers Laura Kayali, Melissa Heikkil\u00e4 and Janosch Delcker have delivered a shrewd analysis of the underlying strategy behind recent policy documents from the EU dealing with the digital future. On the nature of loss Jill Lepore has written a knockout piece for the New Yorker under the heading \u201cThe lingering of loss\u201d, on friendship, grief and remembrance. One of the best things I\u2019ve read in years.",

He slips in Pablo Hernandez, who fires a low diagonal shot into the bottom left.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b88bb456e36b22067ca75c3ae3df1040c5d83e97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b88bb456e36b22067ca75c3ae3df1040c5d83e97/98_0_3297_1979/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leeds United\u2019s Pablo Hernandez fires in their second goal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leeds United\u2019s Pablo Hernandez fires in their second goal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Dodd/CameraSport via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-29T14:07:20.930Z\">at 2.07pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e5a66d78f086a28115b5064\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-29T13:33:47.482Z\">1.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Here we go, then. </strong>It\u2019ll be a little while before the 3pm teamsheets land, so in the meantime let\u2019s concentrate on the lunchtime kick-offs.

All set up for a great second half, with Leeds looking to close the gap on leaders West Brom, for a couple of hours at least, and Hull desperately looking for something that\u2019ll put a little more distance between themselves and the relegation places.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e5a34d98f08e1332474c89a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-29T12:06:31.884Z\">12.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Good afternoon!</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>There aren\u2019t too many Premier League fixtures being played this afternoon.</strong> Just the five.

      "bodyText": "And that, my Clockwatch cronies, is that. Thanks for staying with this goalfest, and by way of reward, here\u2019s some breaking news to end it all: the theme from Z-Cars has just blasted from the speakers at Vicarage Road, and that means Watford v Liverpool is minutes away from kick-off. Rob Smyth is all over it. Enjoy, enjoy! Brighton &amp; Hove Albion 0-1 Crystal Palace. In case you missed it earlier, Palace won the M23 derby. Ed Aarons was at the Amex, and these are his conclusions. Newcastle United 0-0 Burnley. In retrospect, poor Louise Taylor drew the short straw today. She was there to witness Newcastle struggle up front yet again. Here\u2019s her take on the action at St James\u2019. West Ham United 3-1 Southampton. It was a huge win for the Hammers at their beloved London Stadium. Jacob Steinberg was on point to file this verdict. Bayern Munich beat Hoffenheim 6-0, incidentally. Here\u2019s how football\u2019s latest fiasco literally unfurled. Bournemouth 2-2 Chelsea. It was an entertaining back-and-forth on the south coast. Ben Fisher was there to witness it, and here\u2019s his report. All the updated tables, to peruse at your leisure, perchance for your pleasure. It\u2019s been a great day for West Ham, Leeds, Fulham, Wigan and Huddersfield; not so great for Aston Villa, West Brom, Charlton, Stoke and Middlesbrough. Scottish League Two full-times. Albion Rovers 1-2 Elgin City Brechin 0-2 Sterling Albion Cowdenbeath 1-1 Edinburgh City Queen\u2019s Park 2-0 Annan Athletic Stenhousemuir 0-3 Cove Rangers Scottish League One full-times. Clyde 3-2 Falkirk Dumbarton 1-0 Raith Rovers Forfar 0-1 East Fife Montrose 1-0 Airdrieonians Scottish Championship full-times. Alloa Athletic 0-2 Ayr United Dunfermline Athletic 2-0 Dundee United Queen of the South 0-4 Greenock Morton The League Two full-times. Bradford City 2-1 Plymouth Argyle Cambridge United 1-2 Carlisle United Colchester United 0-2 Cheltenham Town Exeter City 1-1 Crawley Town Grimsby Town 0-3 Northampton Town Macclesfield Town 0-2 Salford City Morecambe 1-1 Crewe Alexandra Oldham Athletic 5-0 Newport County Port Vale 2-2 Scunthorpe United The League One full-times. Blackpool 2-1 Ipswich Town Bolton Wanderers 0-0 Accrington Stanley Bristol Rovers 0-1 Shrewsbury Town Burton Albion 1-1 Peterborough United Doncaster Rovers 3-1 Wycombe Wanderers Gillingham 1-2 AFC Wimbledon Oxford United 2-1 Southend United Rotherham 1-1 MK Dons The Championship full-times. Blackburn Rovers 2-2 Swansea City Cardiff City 2-2 Brentford Fulham 2-0 Preston North End Huddersfield Town 4-0 Charlton Athletic Luton Town 1-1 Stoke City Millwall 1-1 Bristol City QPR 2-2 Birmingham City Reading 2-0 Barnsley Sheffield Wednesday 1-3 Derby County WBA 0-1 Wigan Athletic Preston push for an equaliser at Fulham. The home side break up the other end, Aboubakar Kamara making sure of the three points in the fourth minute of injury time. It\u2019s 2-0, and Fulham remain on the shoulders of West Brom and Leeds, six and five points behind in third respectively. It\u2019s four for Huddersfield! Juninho Bacuna has whistled one into the top corner from 25 yards: 4-0. Blackburn have scrambled a draw at home against Swansea thanks to Bradley Johnson\u2019s 95th-minute deflected shot. It\u2019s 2-2 at Ewood. And it\u2019s all over at West Brom, where in-form Wigan have claimed all three points against the leaders: 0-1. All the Premier League full-time scores are in. Bournemouth 2-2 Chelsea Newcastle United 0-0 Burnley West Ham United 3-1 Southampton A third goal for Huddersfield against Charlton. Karlan Grant scores his second of the day: it\u2019s 3-0. Also down at the bottom: Luton equalise against fellow strugglers Stoke in the first minute of injury time, thanks to a James Collins penalty. And a sickener for Ipswich at Blackpool, Joe Nuttall scoring what is surely the winner in the 93rd minute. It\u2019s 2-1 to the Seasiders. West Brom are pushing hard for an equaliser against Wigan. The relegation haunted Latics refuse to bend. See also Newcastle, who are piling forward against Burnley. They\u2019ve got a two-on-one break in injury time, but Matt Ritchie hesitates and is stripped of possession. The Clarets are refusing to buckle as well. An equaliser for Birmingham at QPR. Scott Hogan makes it 2-2 with eight minutes remaining. Meanwhile here\u2019s budding playwright Bill Hargreaves: \u201cOf course the underlying funny thing about the Bayern banner is that poor old Dietmar Hopp will be wishing it all to go away, not for it to be highlighted by the stopping of play etc. All we need now is for the post match interviews to go something like this: Player: Well we had to stop playing because there was a banner saying the owner was the son of a whore. Interviewer: Son of a what? Player: A whore. Huge red letters on a white background. You couldn\u2019t miss it. Over there. Marcos Alonso, goal machine. It\u2019s three in two league games for the rampaging left back. That had been coming, with Chelsea piling on the pressure. Now the Cherries, so close to a precious win, will simply be looking to hang onto a point. Absolutely nothing has happened at St James\u2019 Park in the match between Newcastle and Burnley. Nothing, nowt, zilch, nada, nix, bugger all. There: if that doesn\u2019t guarantee some late drama, nothing will. Steve Mounie has scored a second for Huddersfield against Charlton. This win would catapult the Terriers up to the heady heights of 17th in the Championship table, leaving Charlton one place and two points above the relegation zone. The match at Hoffenheim has restarted. By all accounts, Bayern are just doing keepie-uppies, Jim Baxter style, and Hoffenheim players are merely standing around in the fag-while-waiting-for-bus style. Having a nice chat. Meanwhile the clock ticks on, and the referee doesn\u2019t give two hoots. What is it with touchy billionaires, though? Guess it\u2019s true what the moptops said: money can\u2019t buy you love. A huge goal in the Championship. Wigan take the lead against West Brom at the Hawthorns, Sam Morsy taking advantage of a post-corner scramble to slam home. If this stays the same, Leeds will be just a point behind the Baggies at the top of the table, while Wigan will escape the dropzone at the expense of Middlesbrough. The teamsheets are in at Vicarage Road. Watford: Foster, Femenia, Kabasele, Cathcart, Masina, Hughes, Capoue, Sarr, Doucoure, Deulofeu, Deeney. Subs: Gomes, Dawson, Welbeck, Chalobah, Gray, Pussetto, Pereyra. Liverpool: Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Lovren, van Dijk, Robertson, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Fabinho, Wijnaldum, Salah, Firmino, Mane. Subs: Adrian, Minamino, Lallana, Origi, Matip, Jones, Hoever. Rob Smyth helms the MBM, and will furnish you with all the pre-match analysis you require. And possibly some more. Chelsea have brought on Michy Batshuayi, in the hope of getting back into the game at Dean Court. The erratic Belgian has just slotted home ... but from a clearly offside position. VAR does its job, and Bournemouth remain 2-1 in the lead. Fulham are determined to stay on the tails of West Brom and Leeds in the Championship promotion places. Preston North End appear equally determined to give them a hand. David Nugent has put through his own net, giving the Cottagers a 58th-minute lead. Thin-skinned rich men latest. Bayern Munich are currently 6-0 up at Hoffenheim. But the game has been suspended because their fans are waving an offensive banner against Hoffenheim owner Dietmar Hopp. Dundee United have a Liverpoolesque lead at the top of the Scottish Championship. Second-placed Inverness Caley Thistle aren\u2019t going to catch them, 18 points behind, albeit with two games in their pocket after today. So a defeat today is unlikely to cause the Arabs too much despair. Nevertheless, the leaders are 2-0 down at Dunfermline, Jonathan Afolabi adding to Kevin Nisbet\u2019s first-half goal. Freddie Sears has equalised for momentum-free Ipswich Town at Blackpool. Meanwhile QPR, who were trailing 1-0 at half time at home to Birmingham City, have staged a fine comeback, Marc Pugh and Jordan Hugill scoring the goals in a four-minute burst to snatch the lead. And down near the bottom of the Championship, out-of-form Reading are 2-0 up on Barnsley, George Puscas adding to Yakou Meite\u2019s first-half strike. That cup of half-time tea must have been a tasty drop. Two goals in three minutes, the second from Josh King, has turned things around for the Cherries at Dean Court. Bournemouth, like West Ham, are fighting hard for three precious points. Saints have brought on Danny Ings. And he\u2019s got a job to do, because Michail Antonio has just stretched West Ham\u2019s lead in a must-win game for the hosts. A Tomas Kalas own goal has brought Millwall level against Bristol City. It\u2019s 1-1 at the New Den. Meanwhile from og to Ng: in the old Fourth Division, Perry Ng puts Crewe 1-0 up at Morecambe. As things stand, Crewe will be going to the top of the table. Ryan Fraser swings a corner into the Chelsea mixer. Jefferson Lerma rises highest to bullet a header into the net. It\u2019s his first home goal for the Cherries. The Championship leaders West Brom are being held at home by lowly Wigan. It\u2019s 0-0, and it\u2019s not exactly been a classic at the Hawthorns. Meanwhile at Ewood Park, Swansea have turned things around completely either side of the half-time break, Andre Ayew stroking home a penalty kick on 48 minutes. It\u2019s 1-2. Huddersfield are playing Charlton this afternoon, you\u2019ll have noticed. Any excuse to exhume an old Joy of Six. Why not while away the time before the second-half goals start flying in? Scottish League Two half-times. Albion Rovers 1-2 Elgin City Brechin 0-0 Sterling Albion Cowdenbeath 1-0 Edinburgh City Queen\u2019s Park 2-0 Annan Athletic Stenhousemuir 0-2 Cove Rangers Scottish League One half-times. Clyde 2-1 Falkirk Dumbarton 0-0 Raith Rovers Forfar 0-1 East Fife Montrose 1-0 Airdrieonians Scottish Championship half-times. Alloa Athletic 0-1 Ayr United Dunfermline Athletic 1-0 Dundee United Queen of the South 0-2 Greenock Morton The League Two half-times. Bradford City 2-0 Plymouth Argyle Cambridge United 0-1 Carlisle United Colchester United 0-1 Cheltenham Town Exeter City 0-1 Crawley Town Grimsby Town 0-2 Northampton Town Macclesfield Town 0-2 Salford City Morecambe 0-0 Crewe Alexandra Oldham Athletic 2-0 Newport County Port Vale 1-0 Scunthorpe United The League One half-times. Blackpool 1-0 Ipswich Town Bolton Wanderers 0-0 Accrington Stanley Bristol Rovers 0-0 Shrewsbury Town Burton Albion 0-0 Peterborough United Doncaster Rovers 1-0 Wycombe Wanderers Gillingham 0-0 AFC Wimbledon Oxford United 1-1 Southend United Rotherham United 1-1 MK Dons The Championship half-times. Blackburn Rovers 1-1 Swansea City Cardiff City 2-2 Brentford Fulham 0-0 Preston North End Huddersfield Town 1-0 Charlton Athletic Luton Town 0-1 Stoke City Millwall 0-1 Bristol City QPR 0-1 Birmingham City Reading 1-0 Barnsley Sheffield Wednesday 0-3 Derby County WBA 0-0 Wigan Athletic Rhian Brewster, on loan at Swansea from Liverpool, has just whacked one in from 20 yards against Blackburn. It\u2019s an equaliser, right on the stroke of half-time, Sam Gallagher having given Rovers a 25th-minute lead at Ewood Park. Meanwhile Cardiff have levelled up at home against Brentford, Joe Ralls completing a comeback from two goals down just before the half-time whistle. It\u2019s 2-2 at the Cardiff City Stadium. The Premier League half-times. Bournemouth 0-1 Chelsea Newcastle United 0-0 Burnley West Ham United 2-1 Southampton As things stand, West Ham catapult themselves up to 16th, leapfrogging Bournemouth and pushing Aston Villa into the bottom three. With games against Arsenal, Wolves, Spurs and Chelsea coming up, a win today couldn\u2019t be more precious. But not for long! Sebastien Haller bullies Alex McCarthy as the pair compete for a high ball, then slides home. VAR has a check, harshing West Ham\u2019s buzz, but eventually they\u2019re allowed to celebrate properly. The goal stands, and the Hammers deservedly lead on the balance of play. Could it be one of those days for West Ham? They\u2019ve messed up a three-on-one break, conceded minutes after missing a great chance, and now another goal goes betting. From a corner, Issa Diop fails to connect a couple of yards out, and the score remains 1-1. Cardiff are back in it against Brentford. Junior Hoilett has halved the deficit on 34 minutes; it\u2019s 1-2. Elsewhere in the Championship, Sheffield Wednesday are capitulating at home against Derby. Jason Knight scores a third for the Rams on the half-hour, and already plenty of Owls regulars have decided enough is enough. They\u2019re off to the pub. Bournemouth had started well, but it\u2019s Chelsea who have taken the lead at Dean Court (some habits, etc.). Olivier Giroud hits the bar, and Marcos Alonso rifles home the rebound from close range. The destroyers of Spurs last week combine again. The small margins between success and failure, right here. Pablo Fornals passes up a great chance to make it 2-0 at the London Stadium. Saints break up the other end, Michael Obafemi justifying Ralph Hasenhuttl\u2019s decision to start him ahead of Danny Ings. Ipswich Town have only won four of their last 18 matches. Once leading the old Third Division (some habits are hard to shake) they\u2019re now adrift of the play-off positions in ninth, and not looking likely to turn things around at Blackpool today. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall has given the Seasiders a 26th-minute lead. Derby County are also out of the blocks quickly this afternoon. Tom Lawrence has scored twice in the first 24 minutes at Sheffield Wednesday. While there\u2019s a mid-table flavour to that one, it\u2019s a relegation scrap at Huddersfield Town, where the hosts have taken the lead against Charlton Athletic through Karlan Ahearne-Grant. It\u2019s been a fast start by promotion-chasing Brentford at Cardiff. Luca Racic had given the Bees a fifth-minute lead; Bryan Mbeumo has just slotted away a free kick to double their advantage. As things stand, they\u2019re in fourth spot in the Championship. West Ham are on the front foot now. Haller slams a header straight at Alex McCarthy in the Saints goal. Either side, and the hosts were 2-0 up and well on their way to their first win in nine matches. A minute after Michail Antonio mess up a three-on-one break, Jarrod Bowen scores on his full debut for West Ham! Saints had been growing into the match after West Ham\u2019s fast start, too. An early goal in the Championship relegation six-pointer at Kenilworth Road. Sam Vokes has given Stoke City the lead against hosts Luton Town, finishing a move started by Joe Allen. Meanwhile up the other end of the table, play-off hopefuls Bristol City have gone a goal up at Millwall, Pedro Pereira with the opener for the Robins. West Ham threw down an early marker as well. Within the first minute, Aaron Cresswell clattered into Stuart Armstrong, the Saints midfielder requiring the wet sponge, smelling salts, etc. Armstrong is up and about quickly enough, though, and the game goes on. David Moyes, desperate for the three points today, has clearly told his charges to, er, charge. The first goal of the traditional 3pm kick-offs in any division is scored by East Fife. Daniel Denholm puts the Fifers a goal up at Forfar. They\u2019ll be dancing on the streets of Farncombe, Surrey, and yes that is a tedious in-joke that about four people in the entire world will get. Meanwhile an early statement of intent by Bournemouth, for whom Philip Billing has wasted a couple of good early chances already. Chelsea aren\u2019t out of the dressing room yet. Peep! Tootle! Parp! After some coronavirus-defying handshakes at grounds all around the country, the 3pm kick-offs get underway. Still here? For those of you who haven\u2019t immediately raced straight to the butchers for a couple of pounds of mutton mince, stopping off en route only to pick up a slab of lard ... the Observer\u2019s report of Palace\u2019s win at arch-rivals Brighton has landed. Ed Aarons was our man down by the seaside, and here\u2019s his verdict. Pre-match pie. Further proof that the BBC licence fee is worth every single penny. West Ham fans, having been sold a pup by their preposterous board, will be protesting before their match against Southampton. Stephen Cross, of the Hammers United supporters\u2019 club, explains why it\u2019s come to this. Preach on, brother. Bournemouth v Chelsea team news. Bournemouth welcome back Nathan Ake, Jefferson Lerma, Lewis Cook and Ryan Fraser. Fikayo Tomori replaces Antonio Rudiger in central defence for Chelsea, while Pedro displaces Ross Barkley in midfield. Kepa Arrizabalaga remains on the bench, Willy Caballero continuing in between the sticks. West Ham United v Southampton team news. Jarrod Bowen makes his full West Ham debut against Southampton. He lines up alongside Sebastien Haller and Michail Antonio as David Moyes goes for all-out attack. Feel free to read those seven words back to yourself, ten times or more if necessary. Meanwhile Saints select Michael Obafemi up front. Danny Ings is once again on the bench, Southampton\u2019s leading scorer perhaps understandably running on fumes after carrying the entire team for the past seven months. Newcastle United v Burnley team news. Five changes for Newcastle. Steve Bruce replaces Fabian Schar, Valentino Lazaro, Nabil Bentaleb, Sean Longstaff and Allan Saint-Maximin with Javier Manquillo, Matt Ritchie, Isaac Hayden, Jonjo Shelvey and Dwight Gayle. However, Burnley boss Sean Dyche is in If It Ain\u2019t Broke mode: he names the same XI who started the 3-0 win over Bournemouth last week. Chris Wood is among the substitutes after recovering from a hamstring problem. FULL TIME: Brighton &amp; Hove Albion 0-1 Crystal Palace. It\u2019s also all over at the Amex. Palace win the M23 derby thanks to a second-half Wilfried Zaha goal on the break. Rob Smyth has all the details, plus post-match reaction. FULL TIME: Hull City 0-4 Leeds United. A stunning second-half display by Leeds. Towards the end of it, they were stroking passes around to cheers of ol\u00e9! from the away end. The obvious comparison would be to their famous ball-flicking, back-heeling, shoulder-dropping humiliation of Southampton back in 1972, though everyone forgets Don Revie\u2019s side did pretty much the same thing a fortnight earlier against Manchester United. GOAL! Hull City 0-4 Leeds United (Roberts 84). This is now a rout. A second goal for Tyler Roberts in three minutes, this one a beautiful diving header, meeting Mateusz Klich\u2019s right-wing cross with a header back across George Long and into the top right. Picture-book. Hull will remain four points off the relegation places after this inevitable defeat. They\u2019ve got some big six-pointers coming up against Stoke, Charlton and Middlesbrough, plus extremely tricky away fixtures at Birmingham, West Brom and Bristol City. Survival is far from guaranteed. GOAL! Hull City 0-3 Leeds United (Roberts 81). Leeds really have cleared out their promotion-chasing pipes after that wobble. A length-of-pitch team move that ends with Jack Harrison teeing up Tyler Roberts to viciously sweep into the bottom right from 12 yards. Public service announcement: Five Serie A games have been called off as a result of the current Public Health Emergency of International Concern. We remind you because one of them is still showing up on our live scores, you see. Bournemouth: Ramsdale, Smith, Ake, Stacey, Steve Cook, Billing, King, Lerma, Lewis Cook, Fraser, Callum Wilson. Subs: Boruc, Francis, Gosling, Solanke, Stanislas, Rico, Harry Wilson. Chelsea: Caballero, Azpilicueta, Christensen, Tomori, James, Jorginho, Kovacic, Alonso, Mount, Pedro, Giroud. Subs: Arrizabalaga, Rudiger, Barkley, Willian, Loftus-Cheek, Batshuayi, Gilmour. Newcastle United: Dubravka, Manquillo, Fernandez, Lascelles, Rose, Almiron, Hayden, Shelvey, Ritchie, Gayle, Joelinton. Subs: Schar, Saint-Maximin, Lejeune, Yedlin, Darlow, Sean Longstaff, Bentaleb. Burnley: Pope, Bardsley, Tarkowski, Mee, Taylor, Hendrick, Cork, Westwood, McNeil, Vydra, Rodriguez. Subs: Brownhill, Wood, Brady, Hart, Pieters, Lennon, Long. West Ham United: Fabianski, Ngakia, Diop, Ogbonna, Cresswell, Noble, Rice, Bowen, Fornals, Antonio, Haller. Subs: Balbuena, Zabaleta, Felipe Anderson, Lanzini, Snodgrass, Masuaku, Randolph. Southampton: McCarthy, Ward-Prowse, Stephens, Bednarek, Bertrand, Boufal, Smallbone, Hojbjerg, Armstrong, Obafemi, Long. Subs: Vestergaard, Ings, Adams, Romeu, Walker-Peters, Gunn, Valery. GOAL! Brighton &amp; Hove Albion 0-1 Crystal Palace (Ayew 70). An opener at the Amex, and it\u2019s come against the run of play. Rob Smyth has the details. Click and enjoy. So having said nothing much was happening, Leeds nearly make it three in spectacular fashion. Jack Harrison takes a touch out on the right before whipping a power-curler towards the top left. He\u2019s beaten Hull keeper George Long all ends up, but the ball twangs off the upright and away from danger. That would have been a peach. It\u2019s still just 0-2. Hull have half-an-hour to get back into this. Leeds last won promotion from the second tier in 1990, the same year Liverpool last became champions of England. A good omen for both clubs? Or a tenuous coincidence crowbarred into a rolling blog while nothing much else is going on? The choice, dear reader, is yours. So after that rocky period, Leeds seem to have pulled themselves together as they chase that elusive return to the top flight. If they close this one out, they\u2019ll be eight points clear of third-placed Fulham, who entertain sixth-placed Preston North End this afternoon. GOAL! Hull City 0-2 Leeds United (Hernandez 47). It hasn\u2019t taken long for Leeds to double their advantage. Jack Harrison crosses long from the left. Patrick Bamford causes confusion in the middle. The ball finds Helder Costa down the inside-right channel. He slips in Pablo Hernandez, who fires a low diagonal shot into the bottom left. Here we go, then. It\u2019ll be a little while before the 3pm teamsheets land, so in the meantime let\u2019s concentrate on the lunchtime kick-offs. The M23 derby is goalless at half-time, the square root of nix having occurred so far down on the south coast. Rob Smyth is doing his best with that. Hull City v Leeds United has been a bit more eventful, thankfully. The teams were separated at the break by Luke Ayling\u2019s deflected long-range strike on five minutes. Pablo Hernandez has hit the Hull crossbar, while Leeds keeper Illan Meslier, making his league debut for the club at the age of 19, has been distributing the ball in an esoteric fashion. All set up for a great second half, with Leeds looking to close the gap on leaders West Brom, for a couple of hours at least, and Hull desperately looking for something that\u2019ll put a little more distance between themselves and the relegation places. There aren\u2019t too many Premier League fixtures being played this afternoon. Just the five. And yet it could prove to be quite a significant day in the 2019-20 Premier League. Brighton and Crystal Palace kicked off an hour ago, and you can follow that live, right here, right now, with our old pal Rob Smyth. Today\u2019s other fixtures are as follows (all 3pm unless stated): Bournemouth v Chelsea Newcastle United v Burnley West Ham United v Southampton Watford v Liverpool (5.30pm) So with all the teams at the bottom, bar League Cup finalists Aston Villa, playing, some potentially lethal shots could be fired in the relegation battle. Liverpool could also stretch their lead at the top. It\u2019s a big day. There\u2019s plenty to be keeping up with elsewhere, too, with West Bromwich Albion, Leeds United and Fulham all in Championship action. Other fixtures are additionally available.

      "bodyText": "The history of the budget since the 1990 recession is a story of revenue, and has barely anything at all to do with \u201cmanagement\u201d. Since 1990 every single one of the 10 years the budget has been in surplus or balance, government revenue was 24.5% of GDP or higher. And every year when revenue has been lower than that amount, the budget has been in deficit. We truly spend too much time worrying about the budget balance. Most of the commentary on the budget implies that the government is somehow in control of all the factors that determine whether a surplus or deficit is delivered. They are not and have never been. To suggest that a budget surplus is a sign the government \u201ccan manage the economy\u201d is looking for order in chaos; and for causation when there is mostly coincidence. During the Howard government, the mining boom saw revenue soar as high as 26% of GDP. In its final year, even with massive tax cuts, revenue was still 25% of GDP. The Howard government played no role in creating this tidal wave of revenue unless you believe they were able to cause a huge increase in demand for iron ore within the Chinese economy. By contrast, in 2010-11 government revenue was just 21.3% of GDP. That didn\u2019t happen because the Rudd government massively cut taxes \u2013 but because there was a massive drop in company profits and income due to the GFC. Had the Rudd government the same level of revenue as the final year of the Howard government, Wayne Swan would have had around $52bn more to play with. Because spending that year was just 24.4% of GDP, the budget would also have been comfortably in surplus. Just how irrelevant spending is can be seen by the fact that spending in 2010-11 was lower than it was last year, and yet last year there was a balanced budget, while in 2010-11 the deficit was 3.4% of GDP. So let us stop pretending a budget surplus is about management. At the fringes it might be, but mostly Australian governments are hostage to events \u2013 which the Morrison government has now discovered to their detriment. Their much-boasted-about budget surplus looks to be gone. That Frydenberg and Morrison crowed they had delivered a surplus before actually doing so just means they are guilty of extreme levels of hubris rather than budget mismanagement. The real budget debate should be over the size of the deficit (or surplus). A budget deficit stimulates the economy; a budget surplus slows the economy down. Right now the big problem is not the lack of a budget surplus but the fact our economy was already struggling even before the coronavirus showed up. A budget deficit right now would allow for a strong fiscal response to help counter the impact of the virus. But Scott Morrison said this week: \u201cI can assure taxpayers \u2026 that we\u2019re not a government that engages in extreme fiscal responses.\u201d Why not? Does he believe a situation where our tourism, education and mining sectors are being hit by a possible worldwide pandemic is not extreme enough? Data this week showed that even before the impact of the coronavirus, construction and investment was falling across the economy. The annual growth of both total and full-time employment is now the slowest it has been since 2017. And the underutilisation rate of workers has risen from 13.0% in February last year to 13.9% \u2013 the fastest jump for three years. The economy is limping and the coronavirus is in danger of turning the limp into a break. By Thursday the prime minister was talking of \u201ctargeted, modest and scalable\u201d stimulus, though with no actual explanation of what that might involve other than \u201clooking ahead over the next few months\u201d. Alas, previous economic downturns have shown that \u201cthe next few months\u201d will likely be too late. The past 35 years show us that whether a government delivers a surplus is due mostly to luck and good revenue; not management. Real economic management is not about worrying about whether the budget is in surplus but what you do while the economy slows and looks in danger of grinding to a halt.

The pair then took a highly private 12-day break on the Caribbean island of Mustique just after Christmas, and subsequently disappeared together to Chequers for another 10-day break at half term. As speculation grew among MPs and political commentators, the rumours of Symonds\u2019s pregnancy began to emerge publicly on the Guido Fawkes blog and from the PoliticalPics Twitter account of one of the photographers who works outside No 10. And now Johnson has confirmed the news through a brief statement saying the couple are engaged and their baby is expected in early summer. The congratulations poured in but the announcement comes at a particularly tricky time for Johnson\u2019s government as it feels the heat over its handling of coronavirus, with its home secretary at war with her top civil servant, and flooding devastating parts of England. Having spent so much time away from Downing Street in recent weeks, Johnson has been accused by the opposition of being a \u201cpart-time prime minister\u201d whose mind is not focused on the job. Johnson has fought back against that charge, saying he runs a cabinet with other ministers more than capable of leading responses to big events in their portfolios, such as the flooding. However, there have been growing rumblings among Johnson\u2019s Tory colleagues that they feel he has been distracted in recent weeks and would like to see him more visibly engaged with running the country. Any developments in Johnson\u2019s private life also carry something of a risk for the prime minister.

The prime minister\u2019s divorce from his second wife, Marina Wheeler, is not yet finalised, and his third marriage to Symonds will be the first wedding of a sitting prime minister in 200 years. Yet some of Johnson\u2019s supporters believe the news of a new arrival in Downing Street could provide a \u201cbaby bounce\u201d of good cheer for the country \u2013 at a time of uncertainty and anxiety over coronavirus in particular.

Even allowing for the received wisdom that football is a funny old game, it would be seriously bizarre if Liverpool were denied their first title for 30 years because of a pandemic.</p> <p>If the coronavirus does not end the season early, Liverpool need 12 points from their last 11 games to clinch their first Premier League title. They could still do it at Everton on 16 March, the third of those 11 games, should Manchester City drop points in the meantime. For the time being, their focus is on beating Watford and extending their lead to 25 points. Yawn, meh, 25 points.</p> <p>Hang on, <em>25 points?!</em> I\u2019m not sure Liverpool are getting enough credit. You might not like them, you might think the Premier League is a bit naff, you might be sick of the sight of Jurgen Klopp\u2019s teeth, but come on: they\u2019ve won 35 of their last 36 league games FFS! That has never happened before in Europe\u2019s biggest leagues. In fact, their record this season - P27 W26 D1 L0 - belongs in Sunday League football.</p> <p>There is one difference. A team with 26 wins from 27 in Sunday League football would have a goal difference of around +200. Liverpool\u2019s is a mere +47, and 13 of their 26 victories this season have been by a single goal \u2013 many of them requiring late winners. That might be the reason for the slightly muted response to win after win after win; it feels like Manchester City received more effusive praise two years ago when they regularly thumped teams by four or five. </p> <p>I also think there\u2019s an element of everyone - even Liverpool fans - struggling to get their head around such unprecedented threepointery. Or maybe the world is full of Expected Goals disciples. <a href=\"https://understat.com/league/EPL/2019\">Liverpool are second in the xG table</a>, although an Expected Win tonight will move them within two Expected Points of Manchester City.</p> <p>I\u2019d argue that Liverpool having to work so hard for many wius actually enhances rather than diminishes their achievement. The soundbites may be cheesy but they\u2019re also true: Liverpool <em>are</em> mentality monsters, the toughest in English football for a long while. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/14/liverpool-watford-premier-league-match-report\">Watford played well in a 2-0 defeat at Anfield in December</a>, so you never know what might happen tonight. But 106 points from the last 108 available should give you a pretty good idea.</p> <p><strong>Kick off is at 5.30pm.</strong> </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-29T16:37:51.969Z\">at 4.37pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Sachin Nakrani\u2019s match report has landed, so I\u2019ll leave you with that. Thanks for your company - goodnight. Jurgen Klopp shakes hands with all the Watford players before leaving the field. You\u2019d have to be desperately one-eyed to begrudge Watford that victory. They were the better team throughout and got their rewards in the second half. Ismaila Sarr scored two quickfire goals, the second a beauty, and set up the third for Troy Deeney. Liverpool\u2019s winning run ends at a record-equalling 18 games, and their unbeaten run at 44. They are still going to win the league at a canter, and that\u2019s all that really matters. The real significance of this result is at the bottom, where Watford jump out of the relegation places. They were simply brilliant, with and without the ball, and look far too something to go down. Peep peep! Watford complete a slightly surreal but thoroughly deserved victory over Liverpool. Three-nil! 90+1 min Four minutes of added time. Liverpool are about to lose a Premier League game for the first time in 422 days. 90 min It\u2019s just one defeat, let\u2019s not over-reac- oh. \u201cI\u2019ll be surprised if Lovren ever plays another game for Liverpool,\u201d says Rolf Wilhelm. \u201cMilner is a much better option for centre-back, or any of the kids.\u201d 89 min van Dijk wafts a shot over the bar from 30 yards. Before play resumes, the excellent Abdoulaye Doucoure - who made the first goal - is replaced by NathanIel Chalobah. 88 min \u201cHey Rob,\u201d says J.R. in Illinois. \u201cIt\u2019s very unfair for Liverpool\u2019s undefeated season to end this way. I mean, to make the players wear 40-pound costumes as they walked out onto the field has obviously fatigued them something terrible.\u201d 86 min Watford\u2019s fans are getting greedy: they are now desperate not just for victory but also a clean sheet. Whatever happens in the last few minutes, they\u2019ll talk about this night forever. 85 min Jordan Henderson has been Liverpool\u2019s player of the match. 84 min Robertson, the only Liverpool outfield player who has performed to his usual standard, picks out Lallana. His shot is blocked. 83 min Had Sarr scored it would have gone to VAR for a possible offside. It was very tight, not that it matters now. 82 min Sarr misses a brilliant chance to score a legendary hat-trick! He was put through by Capoue and curled just wide of the far post. It\u2019s his last touch: he leaves the field to a standing ovation, and a brollocking for Alexander-Arnold for not rushing straight off the field. Ignacio Pussetto replaces him. 80 min A 3-0 win would take Watford out of the relegation zone, ahead of Bournemouth on goal difference. It\u2019s deliciously tight down there. 79 min Liverpool make their last change, with Roberto Firmino replaced by Takumi Minamino. 77 min Watford have been fantastic tonight. There has been so much to admire: the work rate, spirit, defensive organisation and most of all their controlled, purposeful attacking. 76 min Mane gets away with a little kick at Masina, who had shepherded the ball out of play. 75 min \u201cTroy Deeney,\u201d says Graham Fulcher, \u201cis an Arsenal legend. I never thought I would write that and be happy about it.\u201d Even Nigel Pearson is shaking his head in disbelief. Alexander-Arnold\u2019s short backpass was intercepted by Sarr, who went round Alisson. The angle was too tight so he turned back, looked up and fed Deeney, who sidefooted the ball calmly over the head of van Dijk on the line. I say. It\u2019s Watford 3 (THREE), Liverpool 0 (NIL)! 72 min It\u2019s all Liverpool now, although Watford\u2019s defensive organisation remains very impressive. 71 min Liverpool are now playing 4-2-4: Origi left, Mane right, Salah and Firmino up front. 70 min \u201cAs all any Arsenal have now is our past,\u201d says Andrew Hurley, \u201chere\u2019s hoping Watford can preserve our two unbeaten records!\u201d 69 min Liverpool are starting to put Watford under serious pressure for the first time in the match. Alexander-Arnold\u2019s whipped free-kick from the right is headed away by Cathcart. 66 min: Lallana hits the post! It was a beautiful effort. A headed clearance came to him 25 yards out, left of centre; he chested the ball down, waited for it to bounce and cut across a left-footed shot that hit the outside of the far post. Foster was beaten. 65 min Divock Origi replaces the disappointing Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. 64 min Almost a third goal! After a lazy Liverpool clearance, Hughes\u2019s first-time shot hits his team-mate Sarr in the six-yard box. That might have been going in. 61 min Adam Lallana comes on to replace Wijnaldum. That was a lovely finish. Deeney, on halfway by the right touchline, curled a speculative pass around the defence, and all of a sudden Sarr was away. He had too much pace for van Dijk and Lovren and was calm enough to flip the ball gently over the outrushing Alisson. What a fine goal. Ismaila Sarr gets his second! 58 min Robertson\u2019s excellent cross into the six-yard box is put behind by Cathcart. Liverpool have an affronted look on their collective coupon, which is possibly bad news for Watford. 56 min It\u2019s probably no coincidence that Ismaila Sarr has been injured for most of Watford\u2019s poor recent run. He was brilliant during their excellent start under Nigel Pearson, and has been a pain in Liverpool\u2019s derriere tonight. It came from a long throw on the left. Deeney allowed it to bounce through to Doucoure, who chested it down on the run and knocked the ball across the six-yard box. Sarr reacted quickest, getting in front of Robertson to poke the ball into the net. Watford take the lead! 53 min Liverpool have their first shot on target. Van Dijk slides an excellent pass down the inside-left channel to Robertson, whose shot is beaten away at the near post by Foster. 52 min Liverpool have attacked with greater urgency since half-time. 50 min As you were: the full-backs have returned to their usual positions. Bit weird. 49 min Salah\u2019s long-range shot is headed away by Kabasele. 47 min Liverpool have switched their full-backs at half-time, with Robertson on the right and Alexander-Arnold on the left. Very interesting. 46 min Sarr forces a save from Alisson in the first minute of the second half. Pereyra played a nice through ball to Sarr, who took the shot first time from the edge of the D. It was well struck but straight at Alisson, who pushed it over the bar. 46 min Peep peep! Liverpool were out early for the second half, which hints at a not inconsiderable brollocking from Jurgen Klopp. \u201cSorry if you\u2019ve been deluged with emails saying we (LFC) are missing Hendo,\u201d says Simon Breed. \u201cBut boy are we missing Hendo\u2019s drive and follow ups...\u201d Half-time reading Peep peep! No goals, and no shots on target until that Deeney opportunity a moment ago. A sluggish Liverpool haven\u2019t really troubled a resilient Watford defence, and the only other incident of note was a nasty-looking knee injury to Gerard Deulofeu. See you in 15 minutes for the second half. 45+5 min Deeney was being wrestled by Lovren in the penalty area just before that chance, but Michael Oliver and VAR weren\u2019t interested. That could easily have been given. 45+5 min Deeney misses an excellent chance! Alisson dropped a bouncing ball at the feet of Deeney, who turned and chipped towards goal. Alisson recovered to save, and Deeney\u2019s follow-up was shepherded wide by van Dijk. 45 min Five added minutes because of the Deulofeu injury. 44 min Wijnaldum reacts aggressively after a foul from Hughes. It looked a bit of a snide one from Hughes, so you can understand why Wijnaldum was so hacked off. 43 min After a confident run, Sarr shoots high over from the edge of the box. 43 min \u201cA grim XI there, Millings,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cPresumably, Troy \u2018Dead\u2019 Parrott was left out on account of the fact that he may not actually exist beyond the fevered imagination of Spurs fans and journalists.\u201d 42 min Deeney is lucky not to be booked for a late tackle on Alexander-Arnold. 41 min This performance isn\u2019t going to do much for Liverpool\u2019s xG. 38 min \u201cI think Liverpool are running on fumes at the moment,\u201d says Rick Harris. \u201c They know they\u2019ve won the league so in the players\u2019 minds there is less mental urgency than was there earlier in the season. They\u2019ve come close to defeat recently against teams in the relegation battle or mid-table and seemed to find it very hard to raise their game after the winter break in the CL against Atletico. I think neutral and Liverpool fans are hoping they can eclipse the Invincibles and stay unbeaten the whole season, but they could just get unlucky.\u201d 37 min Deulofeu is finally stretchered off, with Pereyra replacing him. 34 min Roberto Pereyra is getting ready to replace Deulofeu, who is going to be stretchered off. The poor bloke is in all sorts of distress. 32 min Deulofeu is down, holding his knee, after being eased to the floor by van Dijk. No foul was given, but Michael Oliver stopped play when he realised that Deulofeu was in a lot of pain. His foot got stuck as he fell and he twisted his knee. This doesn\u2019t look good. 29 min Wijnaldum, facing his own goal, hacks the ball clear under pressure from Doucoure. Watford continue to make life difficult for Liverpool, which will make their eventual defeat all the more frustrating. 27 min \u201cIs it just me or does Klopp overplay his front three?\u201d says Zafar Sobhan. \u201cHe does such a good job of rotating elsewhere; his overuse of his forward line is baffling to me. It won\u2019t matter this year - except maybe in Europe - but in past years they have been susceptible to injury and fatigue in the run in.\u201d I used to think that as well, but it doesn\u2019t seem to do much harm. They seem immune to fatigue. 24 min Nothing much to report. Watford have done pretty well so far, and have certainly had the better opportunities. 20 min A Liverpool corner is half-cleared to Oxlade-Chamberlain. He lifts a speculative pass over the outrushing defence that eventually reaches Salah, and he spanks a right-footed half-volley into the side netting. It was a pretty difficult chance. 18 min Lovren hammers a brilliant crossfield pass to Robertson, who tries to run Sarr inside the area and is doggedly dispossessed. 18 min Oxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s pass towards Robertson goes straight out of play. Liverpool are not on their game, at least not yet. 16 min Nothing happens from the corner. 15 min Deulofeu plays a one-two with Deeney and picks out an excellent cutback to Doucoure, whose first-time shot is blocked almost disdainfully by van Dijk. Corner to Watford. 14 min Watford are playing like the away side, allowing Liverpool to have the ball and then springing forward in numbers when they win it. Liverpool\u2019s passing has been a bit slow by their standards. 12 min \u201cI take it Mac Millings\u2019 Death XI play their home matches at Croak Park?\u201d says Peter Oh. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no room in the squad for Virgil Van Dijd, Jordan Enderson, and No Mo\u2019 Salah?\u201d Well this is cheery. No Mo! 11 min Wijnaldum is this close to being robbed by Hughes in his own area. Watford are a threat going forward. 10 min A much better effort from Deulofeu. He runs at Alexander-Arnold on the edge of the box, cuts inside and whips a curling shot towards the far corner that goes just over the bar. I\u2019m not sure Alisson had that one covered. 8 min \u201cSitting in theology seminar reading MBM, hoping not to be caught,\u201d writes YOU THERE I KNOW YOU\u2019RE READING THE MBM ARE MY SEMINARS THAT BLOODY BORING. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think the Reds need a prayer from me to spank Watford, god bless their yellow hearts. Onward Liverpool!!\u201d I think this will be a tough game for Liverpool, and they\u2019ll win 3-1. 7 min Liverpool enjoy an extended spell of possession. Eventually Alexander-Arnold lofts an excellent pass to Oxlade-Chamberlain on the right side of the box. He is held up but returns the ball to Alexander-Arnold, whose cross goes out of play. I think he was pushed but nothing was given. 5 min Deulofeu cuts infield from the left and hit a low shot that goes a few yards wide of the near post. Alisson had it covered. 4 min A quiet start. Has Jurgen Klopp taken Liverpool as far as he can? 1 min Peep peep! Liverpool kick off from left to right as I watch. They are in red; Watford are sporting yellow. The players emerge from the tunnel on a chilly evening in Watford. Let\u2019s watch some football. \u201cI don\u2019t want to bore you with my whole train of thought,\u201d says Mac Millings. \u201cBut I was going to do a Leap Year XI, and then the afternoon results came in, and Watford are playing Liverpool, and I ended up doing a Death one instead. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m fine, and everything is going to be fine: Pepe Reinacarnation Johnny Heavens Cemeterry Butcher Robert Huthanasia Gunnar Valhalle Death Johnson Johnny Met God Djibril Deciss\u00e9 St. Peter Crouch Purgatore Andr\u00e9 Flo Luis Boa Mortality. Johnny Met God. Yeah, I like that. If Liverpool win tonight, they will set a new record for consecutive victories in the top flight: 19. Pre-match reading Watford (4-2-3-1) Foster; Kiko Femenia, Kabasele, Cathcart, Masina; Hughes, Capoue; Sarr, Doucoure, Deulofeu; Deeney. Substitutes: Gomes, Dawson, Chalobah, Pussetto, Pereyra, Welbeck, Gray. Liverpool (4-3-3) Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Lovren, van Dijk, Robertson; Oxlade-Chamberlain, Fabinho, Wijnaldum; Salah, Firmino, Mane. Substitutes: Adrian, Matip, Hoever, Lallana, Jones, Minamino, Origi. Referee Michael Oliver. Hello and welcome to live coverage of Watford v Liverpool from Vicarage Road. Even allowing for the received wisdom that football is a funny old game, it would be seriously bizarre if Liverpool were denied their first title for 30 years because of a pandemic. If the coronavirus does not end the season early, Liverpool need 12 points from their last 11 games to clinch their first Premier League title. They could still do it at Everton on 16 March, the third of those 11 games, should Manchester City drop points in the meantime. For the time being, their focus is on beating Watford and extending their lead to 25 points. Yawn, meh, 25 points. Hang on, 25 points?! I\u2019m not sure Liverpool are getting enough credit. You might not like them, you might think the Premier League is a bit naff, you might be sick of the sight of Jurgen Klopp\u2019s teeth, but come on: they\u2019ve won 35 of their last 36 league games FFS! That has never happened before in Europe\u2019s biggest leagues. In fact, their record this season - P27 W26 D1 L0 - belongs in Sunday League football. There is one difference. A team with 26 wins from 27 in Sunday League football would have a goal difference of around +200. Liverpool\u2019s is a mere +47, and 13 of their 26 victories this season have been by a single goal \u2013 many of them requiring late winners. That might be the reason for the slightly muted response to win after win after win; it feels like Manchester City received more effusive praise two years ago when they regularly thumped teams by four or five. I also think there\u2019s an element of everyone - even Liverpool fans - struggling to get their head around such unprecedented threepointery. Or maybe the world is full of Expected Goals disciples. Liverpool are second in the xG table, although an Expected Win tonight will move them within two Expected Points of Manchester City. I\u2019d argue that Liverpool having to work so hard for many wius actually enhances rather than diminishes their achievement. The soundbites may be cheesy but they\u2019re also true: Liverpool are mentality monsters, the toughest in English football for a long while. Watford played well in a 2-0 defeat at Anfield in December, so you never know what might happen tonight. But 106 points from the last 108 available should give you a pretty good idea. Kick off is at 5.30pm.",

IOC member Dick Pound said this week there is a window of two to three months to decide if conditions are too dangerous to hold the Olympics in Tokyo. Pound said if the coronavirus outbreak poses a threat too great to hold the Olympics in Tokyo, the games likely would be canceled instead of postponed or moved.</p> <p>The Olympic marathon is to be staged in Sapporo, more than 500 miles from Tokyo. The event was moved to protect the runners from the heat in Tokyo.</p> <p>Heat was no issue Saturday in Atlanta. Brisk winds made the temperature of 48 degrees at the race start feel more like 41.

Parker Stinson withdrew from the men\u2019s field because of injuries.</p> <p>The course took the runners past the Olympic cauldron used for the Atlanta Games.

Aliphine Tuliamuk edged Molly Seidel by seven seconds in the closest women\u2019s finish in the trials. Seidel became the first woman to make the US Olympics team while running in his first marathon. Sally Kipyego was third. Tuliamuk and Kipyego are natives of Kenya who have become US citizens. Kipyego won the silver medal in the 10,000-meters race for Kenya. Rupp qualified for his fourth Olympics with a winning time of 2:09.20. The 33-year-old runner won the bronze medal in the marathon at the 2016 Rio Games. He\u2019s only the second man, after Frank Shorter in 1972 and 1976, to win two US trials. Shorter tied for the 1972 win with Kenny Moore. Rupp earned the win with his new coach, Mike Smith, after former coach Alberto Salazar received a four-year doping ban in 2019. Riley is a first-time Olympian. The 43-year-old Abdirahman became a five-time Olympian and the oldest US Olympic runner in history, breaking a record previously held by Bernard Lagat. He finished third in the 2012 trials but missed the 2016 trials with a calf injury. Runners competing for spots on the US team dealt with uncertainty about the Olympics. IOC member Dick Pound said this week there is a window of two to three months to decide if conditions are too dangerous to hold the Olympics in Tokyo. Pound said if the coronavirus outbreak poses a threat too great to hold the Olympics in Tokyo, the games likely would be canceled instead of postponed or moved. The Olympic marathon is to be staged in Sapporo, more than 500 miles from Tokyo. The event was moved to protect the runners from the heat in Tokyo. Heat was no issue Saturday in Atlanta. Brisk winds made the temperature of 48 degrees at the race start feel more like 41. The chilly day was ideal for distance runners, but the city\u2019s 26.2-mile course, with combined uphill climbs of 1,389 feet, posed a challenge. Brian Shrader set the men\u2019s pace for much of the first half of the race but dropped out soon after he was passed by Rupp and others on the 16th mile. More than 700 runners qualified for the trials. The women\u2019s field was twice as large as in 2016, when Amy Cragg was the winner. Cragg withdrew last week because of illness. Parker Stinson withdrew from the men\u2019s field because of injuries. The course took the runners past the Olympic cauldron used for the Atlanta Games. The cauldron was lit on Saturday for the first time since boxing great Muhammad Ali lowered the torch during the opening ceremony in 1996.",

One of them lost a family member because of the virus. Their arrival prompted fears among local residents in the midst of the rapidly spreading outbreak. They had to be repeatedly tested before concerns about their condition abated.</em></p> <p><em>It hasn\u2019t been easy for the nearly 50 members of the Wuhan Zall team, but on Sunday they will get some reprieve from their ordeal by attending the Spanish league cl\u00e1sico between Real Madrid and Barcelona at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium. The team will also tour the famed venue in Madrid on Monday.</em></p> <p><em>Its really a well-deserved reward for them, Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez, the team\u2019s Spanish coach, told the Associated Press in a telephone interview. It will be an experience that without a doubt they will never forget. They have been training and training day after day, distracted by the situation back home, so it will be a nice break for them to watch a game like this between Real Madrid and Barcelona.</em></p> <p><em>The team will be at the Bernab\u00e9u on an invitation from Real Madrid and La Liga, which has a partnership with the Chinese Super League, the country\u2019s main soccer competition. The league has been suspended because of the coronavirus and is not expected to resume until mid-April. Wuhan Zall was originally scheduled to stay in its preseason base in southern Spain until mid-February, just before the leagues planned start. Now it is expected to remain in the country at least until the end of March.</em></p> <p><em>Other Chinese clubs are in a similar situation in countries like Thailand, Japan and the United Arab Emirates, though Wuhan Zall is actually based in the city at the centre of the outbreak that has killed more than 2,800 people worldwide, most of them in China.</em></p> <p><em>Wuhan Zall arrived in Spain at the end of January but previously practiced in the Chinese city of Guanghzou, nearly 1,000 621 miles away from Wuhan. Although the team was far from the initial outbreak, Spanish health authorities had to come out publicly to say there was no reason for local citizens to be concerned about the squads arrival. Three players arrived from China later and had to stay in quarantine and be tested for the virus before joining the rest of the group.</em></p> <p><em>The fear of the unknown obviously always exists, Gonz\u00e1lez said. I understood those who were reticent about the team coming to Spain. But with time it became clear that there was no problem with the team being here.</em></p> <p><em>Gonz\u00e1lez, a former striker who had played in China, said his focus has been to take the players minds away from the situation at home. Going to the cl\u00e1sico was one way of doing that, as was the decision to give them 10 days of vacation while in Spain.</em></p> <p><em>I honestly try to talk about the subject (virus) as little as possible, he said. Because they are already talking about it all the time, in their rooms, with their relatives back home. I dont want to talk about it as well every time I see them.

He\u2019s not saying there is a need for that now. </p> <p>Similarly, with school closures. He\u2019s been clear there is no reason or need for schools en masse to close. If there are particular incidents, Public Health England and local teams will give advice. </p> <p>So what Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, has been saying is, these are all things that, in responsible contingency planning for the future, we will be looking at. </p> <p>But we are clear that these are not needed at the moment and that we believe, as he said, that we will not need to move to that phase on the base of where we are at the moment.</p> </blockquote> <p>Argar refused to comment on reports that the first person to contract coronavirus in the UK also passed it on to their doctor. The Guardian has been told there are fears that a doctor from the patient\u2019s surgery may also have been infected with the virus. If confirmed, this would prompt particular concern as the GP would routinely have seen scores of patients over the course of the last week.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m aware of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/28/fears-that-surrey-gp-is-uks-latest-coronavirus-victim\">the Guardian report</a>, but I\u2019m going on the basis of what I\u2019ve been told.</p> <p>I haven\u2019t had any details of that and I think it would be wrong to comment on speculation in the press without that detailed advice from the chief medical officer. </p> <p>I have not been briefed on anything beyond the detail that the chief medical officer and others have given me about this individual case. </p> <p>It is a new development but the chief medical officer has also said we are still doing the contact tracing around that and we are still looking into the details of that case, so it is probably a bit premature to say more than that at the moment.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-29T11:45:11.583Z\">at 11.45am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e5a22108f086a28115b4edf\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-29T08:42:42.334Z\">8.42am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">South Korea reports another 219 new infections</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>South Korea has reported 219 new coronavirus cases, bringing the country\u2019s total infections to 3,150, the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said on Saturday, <strong>Reuters</strong> reports. <br></p> <p> The new cases are in addition to the 594 confirmed earlier in the day.

      "bodyText": "With the Trump press conference over, we\u2019ll wrap up this blog for the day. In summary, in terms of coronavirus news in the US: The first US coronavirus death has been reported in Washington state. There has been some confusion over the gender of the person who died. Donald Trump has rejected criticism for his remarks at a rally in South Carolina on Friday night, in which he referred to the coronavirus outbreak as a hoax. In the White House briefing room, the president told reporters he had been referring to Democratic criticism of his administration\u2019s response, not to the virus itself. Mike Pence has rejected, or at least skirted, criticism of his appointment to oversee the federal response to the outbreak given his record in office as governor of Indiana, where there was a major HIV outbreak in 2015 which critics said was affected by the conservative Christian\u2019s ideological approach to science-based policy and events. Also, Pence has detailed new US moves: Additional travel restrictions on Iran An increase to the highest level for the advisory that Americans should not travel to specific regions in Italy and South Korea State department co-ordinated screening in those countries of individuals coming to America 30m face masks a week being added to US stocks. We\u2019ll report more as the day goes on, of course. In the meantime, here\u2019s a selection of further Guardian reading: \u2026and with questions from a Russian-sounding reporter about possible arms control talks to come and another on the Afghanistan deal, Trump says \u201cwe\u2019ll be doing this quite often\u201d \u2013 meaning answering questions in the White House briefing room which no longer hosts White House press briefings \u2013 \u201cto keep you abreast of the facts\u201d. The markets are \u201cnot a good situation\u201d, Trump says, but \u201cthe markets will take care of themselves\u201d in a strong economy. He skips a question about reports he might consider tax cuts to ease the coronavirus-related pain but says there will be a \u201cvery major middle income tax cut\u201d proposal soon. Trump is now asked about the economic impact on the US by the coronavirus outbreak and what the Federal Reserve might do as the markets plunge. The Fed has an important psychological role to play, Trump says, and says it should have acted more strongly sooner. He wants lower interest rates. And the Fed should be a \u201cleader not a follower\u201d. \u201cOur Fed has not been a leader at all,\u201d he repeats. Now on to the mentioned meeting with pharmaceutical companies on Monday to discuss a vaccine, although the meeting was set up previously to discuss drug prices. An aide says the development of said medicines can be expedited. Here\u2019s a question about Mike Pence and the 2015 HIV outbreak in Indiana, and how that pertains to the VP\u2019s role in running the coronavirus response. \u201cWhen it came to healthcare Indiana has been a leader,\u201d Trump says, claiming it was started \u201cwith others\u201d by Pence. Pence says Indiana had two experiences with the spread of infectious diseases. He mentions MERS in 2014 and says he then learned of the extraordinary capabilities of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and dealt with the issue effectively. In 2015, he says, the outbreak of HIV was in a \u201cvery small town\u201d and he \u201cimmediately deployed health resources\u201d. The state of Indiana did not allow for needle exchanges, he says, but he declared an emergency and made a needle exchange avaialable, treating the patients and ending the outbreak. Here\u2019s some Guardian coverage of that outbreak, for further reading: Trump says he has been in very close contact with China and President Xi Jinping over the outbreak and again cites US companies re-opening there as proof of Chinese progress: Starbucks and Apple. A health official says there is no evidence of link to travel or contact in the woman who died in Washington state. A question about why Trump would consider closing the border with Mexico, which seems to have little to do with the coronavirus outbreak. Trump says he is not considering closing ports of entry, but is thinking about \u201call borders\u201d in general. \u201cThis too will end,\u201d says Trump about the outbreak. Is the White House taking precautions regarding the president\u2019s travels? Trump thinks so, referring to his \u201ctremendous rally\u201d in South Carolina and all the other travel he does. Dr Fauci now answers a question about the dangers or not to people who get coronavirus, and repeats that the elderly and those with chronic health conditions are most likely to die. Every once in a while there will be a one-off, he says, when a healthy 25-year-old will get ill. \u201cThat\u2019s gonna happen, that happens with influenza,\u201d he says. It also seems that being infected and recovering means one cannot get the virus again. Now a question about the Afghanistan deal and the nomination of John Ratcliffe for director of national intelligence, which is controversial. Now to questions: Trump is asked about his remarks in Charleston about the outbreak being a hoax. \u201cHoax referred to the action they [Democrats] tried to take to try to pin this on somebody,\u201d he says, \u201ccertainly not\u201d to the coronavirus. Was Dr Anthony Fauci \u2013 standing next to president \u2013 ever muzzled? \u201cThat\u2019s a very dishonest question,\u201d says Trump, adding: \u201cHe was never muzzled.\u201d Fauci doesn\u2019t seem keen to speak but he clarifies that \u201chas never been muzzled ever\u201d. He says he merely stood down on some media appearances to clarify what he should be doing and when. Will the southern border be closed? Trump says it\u2019s being looked at \u2013 the new cases overnight were reported at the other end of the country, in the north west. Should Americans change their daily routine? Trump and officials say no. A South Korean question about US troops there: \u201cWe care very much for the troops,\u201d Trump says. It\u2019s all working out fine, he says. Back to the word \u201choax\u201d. Could it make people think he is saying the virus was a hoax even if he wasn\u2019t? He says no, then spins to talking about how well his administration has performed on coronavirus so far. Alex Azar is also expressing sympathy for the family of the Washington state patient who died, referring to her as a woman. He repeats official guidance about the risks from coronavirus and says the government wants to follow a \u201cbasic containment strategy\u201d in terms of travel. Next, Dr Anthony Fauci who does not refer to the gender of the person who died. And in fact, Governor Inslee\u2019s statement has been changed to remove reference to the gender of the person who died too. Pence is up now. He expresses condolences to the family of the \u201cwoman in Washington state who has lost her life to the coronavirus\u201d. Here\u2019s Governor Inslee\u2019s statement saying the person who died was a man: Pence commends Trump for his guidance of course and then announces: Additional travel restrictions on Iran An increase to the highest level for the advisory that Americans should not travel to specific regions in Italy and South Korea The state department will co-ordinate screening in those countries of individuals coming to America Pence then commends the members of his task force for their work and says he has spoken to congressional leaders about a supplementary funding bill for federal agencies and for state and local authorities. \u201cThe average American does not need to go out and buy a mask,\u201d Pence says. But 3M will produce 30m more masks a month nonetheless and availability will be increased. Risks remain low, Pence says, but Trump\u2019s actions \u201cgive evidence to the fact that at his direction we\u2019re going to continue to lead in this effort\u201d. Trump says his administration has taken \u201cthe most aggressive action in modern history to confront this disease\u201d and says moving quickly has put the US ahead of the game. China seems to be making tremendous progress, he says, and \u201ctheir numbers are way down\u201d. Trump is repeating his \u201cmost aggressive\u201d claim for the US response, in comparison to all other countries. On Monday, he says, he\u2019ll be meeting pharmaceutical companies to discuss a developing a vaccine \u201cvery rapidly\u201d. \u201cTremendous amounts of supplies are already on hand,\u201d he says \u2013 there have been problems with federal testing kits. Pence led a task force meeting this morning, Trump says, and they came up with some \u201cpretty strict edicts\u201d. \u201cOur country is prepared for any circumstance, we hope it\u2019s not going to be a major circumstance,\u201d he says, asking the media and politicians not to do \u201canything to incite panic at all\u201d. Here\u2019s what Trump said at a rally last night: Trump is addressing the press flanked by Mike Pence, the vice-president he put in charge of coronavirus response efforts to not-universal acclaim, and federal health officials. It\u2019s a long preamble on Afghanistan, in which Trump said he would personally meet Taliban leaders soon and said the US could yet go back in \u201cwith a force like nobody\u2019s ever seen\u201d. So much for that. The coronavirus outbreak is very important to many people, Trump says, paying tribute to the officials with him and others in a more than usually husky voice. A lot of progress has been made, he says, and he will update us here. Remember, the first US death was confirmed just before he came out. There are 22 patients in the US \u2013 the president says one person died overnight and it was a woman in her late 50s. Washington state governor Jay Inslee just announced it was a man. Trump begins by congratulating the \u201cincredible people\u201d who have worked so long on \u201cour longest war\u201d in Afghanistan for what he says is 20 years. It\u2019s actually a little more than 18 since the invasion in 2001 but regardless an agreement was signed in Doha this morning with the Taliban, committing the US to troop withdrawals if the Taliban keeps the peace. We\u2019ll concentrate on the coronavirus news here of course, so here\u2019s our report on the Afghanistan deal: Here in the US the first coronavirus death has been confirmed, in Washington state out on the west coast. I\u2019m in New York City but the president is at the White House in Washington DC and he is about to give a news conference. We\u2019ll blog it live. Here he comes. US confirms first death from the coronavirus in King county in Washington state. Reuters reports that the number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Italy has climbed above 1,000, according to an official who said the number of deaths had surged to 29. This is from the Associated Press. Its been a tough journey for the first-division soccer club from Wuhan, the city at the epicentre of the virus outbreak in China.The team came to Spain for preseason training and doesn\u2019t know when it will be able to return home. Players haven\u2019t seen their relatives in more than two months. One of them lost a family member because of the virus. Their arrival prompted fears among local residents in the midst of the rapidly spreading outbreak. They had to be repeatedly tested before concerns about their condition abated. It hasn\u2019t been easy for the nearly 50 members of the Wuhan Zall team, but on Sunday they will get some reprieve from their ordeal by attending the Spanish league cl\u00e1sico between Real Madrid and Barcelona at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium. The team will also tour the famed venue in Madrid on Monday. Its really a well-deserved reward for them, Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez, the team\u2019s Spanish coach, told the Associated Press in a telephone interview. It will be an experience that without a doubt they will never forget. They have been training and training day after day, distracted by the situation back home, so it will be a nice break for them to watch a game like this between Real Madrid and Barcelona. The team will be at the Bernab\u00e9u on an invitation from Real Madrid and La Liga, which has a partnership with the Chinese Super League, the country\u2019s main soccer competition. The league has been suspended because of the coronavirus and is not expected to resume until mid-April. Wuhan Zall was originally scheduled to stay in its preseason base in southern Spain until mid-February, just before the leagues planned start. Now it is expected to remain in the country at least until the end of March. Other Chinese clubs are in a similar situation in countries like Thailand, Japan and the United Arab Emirates, though Wuhan Zall is actually based in the city at the centre of the outbreak that has killed more than 2,800 people worldwide, most of them in China. Wuhan Zall arrived in Spain at the end of January but previously practiced in the Chinese city of Guanghzou, nearly 1,000 621 miles away from Wuhan. Although the team was far from the initial outbreak, Spanish health authorities had to come out publicly to say there was no reason for local citizens to be concerned about the squads arrival. Three players arrived from China later and had to stay in quarantine and be tested for the virus before joining the rest of the group. The fear of the unknown obviously always exists, Gonz\u00e1lez said. I understood those who were reticent about the team coming to Spain. But with time it became clear that there was no problem with the team being here. Gonz\u00e1lez, a former striker who had played in China, said his focus has been to take the players minds away from the situation at home. Going to the cl\u00e1sico was one way of doing that, as was the decision to give them 10 days of vacation while in Spain. I honestly try to talk about the subject (virus) as little as possible, he said. Because they are already talking about it all the time, in their rooms, with their relatives back home. I dont want to talk about it as well every time I see them. I try to make training as fun as possible so I can see them smiling a bit. Iraq has detected five new cases of the coronavirus, four in Baghdad and one in the central Babel province, the country\u2019s health ministry has announced, taking the total number of cases in the country to 13. The patients were placed in quarantine, days after Iraq banned public gatherings and barred entry by travellers from Kuwait and Bahrain. It has now prohibited travel to or from a total of nine countries. Iraq has cultural and religious ties with Iran and annually receives millions of Iranian pilgrims. An Iraqi family of four, the first known Iraqis to have caught the disease, who returned from Iran tested positive for the coronavirus in Kirkuk province on Tuesday. However, it was not immediately clear if the five new cases announced on Saturday were people who had recently been in Iran. The Public Health Agency in Northern Ireland has said the region\u2019s first case of coronavirus, which was announced on Thursday, has now been confirmed by laboratory tests. The case was initially announced as a \u201cpresumptive positive\u201d on the basis of tests carried out in Northern Ireland. A sample was then sent to a Public Health England reference laboratory for confirmation. Ruth Hutchinson, interim director of public health for Surrey County Council, said the council remains in \u201ccontinuous contact\u201d with Public Health England (PHE) after a confirmed case in the county on Friday. Hutchinson said in a statement: PHE updated me on their work and steps they have taken since the case was confirmed. They are already urgently contacting anyone that has been in close contact with the individual to provide them with advice about what to do if they start feel unwell and how to manage if they are told to self-isolate. I appreciate that news like this can be a cause for concern, so I would reassure everyone that Surrey County Council, together with the NHS and PHE, is taking every necessary measure to help reduce the risk of the virus spreading. In the few minutes since I last posted, I have already had a number of emails from readers about the essentials they are stocking up their cupboards with in the event that the coronavirus outbreak leads to a major public health crisis in the UK. Many of those who have written have said they are getting in provisions because they live alone and so if they have to self-isolate they will not be able to send anyone else out to the shops in their behalf. Others have pre-existing health issues and so they are preparing for the potential of extended periods away from human contact, in order to avoid contracting Covid-19. One reader writes: As someone who works in local govt, the emergency preparedness plans being put in place and resilience forum talk terrify me, as well as having friends in the NHS that know full well they wouldn\u2019t cope ... So my purchasing is for - Disinfectants and alcohol gels/isopropyl alcohol, as well as bleaches etc. This is to quickly apply to hands or pieces of clothing or masks to disinfect. Most pharmacy shops are sold out and have notices up so I went to a DIY shop. Medications as I have [an autoimmune disease], and most of the precursors for my drugs are made in China. I\u2019ve been told there was a long delay for some of the drugs I need, especially liquid nutrition drinks which replace my solid food intake. Some food that is non perishable and doesn\u2019t need gas/water/electricity to be eaten as, if the documents I\u2019ve seen (similar to the leaked ones on the news a few days ago) are true, infrastructure will be patchy. This is more for neighbours and family as nobody is brave enough to say \u201cOK, this is serious\u201d and act on it. The same correspondent, who preferred to go unidentified, does later admit to having been \u201ca quasi prepper for some years. \u201cFeels like my stuff may be put to use, unfortunately.\u201d Other readers are simply bolstering existing stockpiles that they had already built up amid fears of chaos caused by a hard Brexit. Writes one: I don\u2019t think you could call it panic buying. I did augment my hard Brexit stocks in January when the first reports came from China. Now it\u2019s just a case of stock control and eating according to expiry date if shops run out. I thought we should do this ahead of time, so that we wouldn\u2019t add to the problem by competing for items at the last minute. We also had seasonal flu jabs - not because we thought it would protect us from Covid-19, but because a) we didn\u2019t want to have to contend with two viruses, either together or consecutively b) in the event of a bad case of flu, we didn\u2019t want to inflict a preventable burden on an over-stretched NHS. And Stu Goulden tweeted to me: With the number of confirmed coronavirus infections rising in the UK, and quarantine zones springing up across Europe, are people in Britain beginning to panic buy groceries? This customer circular email from Ocado, the online retailer, suggests they are. Ocado says it is \u201cexperiencing exceptionally high demand\u201d from customers who \u201cseem to be placing particularly large orders.\u201d Here is the email: Dear xxx We want to let you know that we\u2019re experiencing exceptionally high demand at the moment. More people than usual seem to be placing particularly large orders. As a result, delivery slots are selling out quicker than expected. We suggest following these useful tips to avoid any disappointment: Place your order a little further in advance than you might normally. Ideally, try two or three days before. If you can be flexible, book yourself a weekday delivery (Monday\u2013Thursday) instead of a weekend one. We\u2019re unusually busy Friday to Saturday at the moment. Thank you for your patience and understanding. Ocado Customer Service team Are you panic buying in anticipation of the possibility of quarantine rules being imposed in your area? If you are send me a message telling me why, and what kinds of things you are buying in. Remember, you can reach me at damien.gayle@theguardian.com or via my Twitter profile, @damiengayle. The Paris half-marathon, which was scheduled for Sunday with 44,000 registered runners, has been cancelled over fears of coronavirus, French news agency AFP reports. The announcement came after the French government ordered the cancellation of \u201cgatherings of more than 5,000 people\u201d in enclosed areas as well as some external events. French Health Minister Olivier Veran said the cancellations of external events would affect gatherings in open areas where there would be \u201cintermingling with populations from areas affected by the virus\u201d. The weekend programme of French Ligue 1 football matches is unaffected and will go ahead as planned, he said. The weekend games are not taking place in areas of France most affected by the virus, the Oise region north of Paris and La Balme-de-Sillingy village in the southeastern Haute-Savoie region. Veran said there were 16 new cases of coronavirus in France, taking to 73 the number of people affected since the end of January. Two people have died, a 60-year-old French teacher and an 80-year-old Chinese tourist. The number of people tested for coronavirus in Scotland has risen by more than 100 in a day, with no confirmed cases, PA reports. A total of 630 tests had been carried out by Saturday in Scotland, up from 500 on Friday. All have so far proved negative. On Friday, NHS Lothian announced it has introduced a \u201cdrive-through\u201d testing centre for the virus. Some patients with an appointment are being tested for coronavirus in their cars at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh. NHS Lothian medical director Dr Tracey Gillies said: \u201cThis service is for patients who have been assessed by the specialist team, so it is an appointment-only service. \u201cIt is not a drop-in clinic and it is important to stress that patients cannot be seen without an appointment. \u201cThe drive-through facility and the community testing teams allow us to test patients without them coming into healthcare facilities. \u201cPatients will be referred on by their GP or NHS 24 if they are at risk of the virus and meet the clinical criteria. \u201cThey will then be referred on to our teams, who will decide whether they need to be tested in their own homes or if they are well enough and can use their own transport to drive to the Western General Hospital.\u201d Three more patients have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK, bringing the total here to 23. Two of the latest diagnosed patients had just returned from Italy, and the third from Asia, according to the Department of Health and Social Care. The cases are from Gloucestershire, Hertfordshire and Berkshire, the PA News Agency reports. Chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty said: \u201cAll three are being investigated and contact tracing has begun.\u201d The French government banned public gatherings with more than 5,000 people on Saturday due to the coronavirus outbreak as France reported 16 new cases, Reuters reports. \u201cAll public gatherings of more than 5,000 people in a confined space are temporarily banned across France,\u201d Health Minister Olivier Veran told journalists. He also that the number of confirmed cases had risen to 73 and that there had been no new deaths. Health officials are tracing anyone who has been in contact with a coronavirus patient who became the first to catch the illness within the UK, PA News Agency reports. Chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty said it was not clear if the patient had contracted the virus \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d from somebody who had recently travelled abroad. The new diagnosis brought the total number of UK cases to 20 on Friday, while a man who had been on a quarantined cruise ship became the first Briton to die from the virus. Public Health England (PHE) said that one of the latest coronavirus cases was a resident in Surrey and it was working with the county council to manage the situation. Haslemere Health Centre in the county has reopened after it was temporarily closed for cleaning as a \u201cprecautionary measure\u201d on Friday. Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt, MP for South West Surrey, said on Twitter he was thinking of \u201cclinicians, staff and patients\u201d at the surgery during this \u201cworrying time\u201d. He added: \u201cThoughts today with new Covid19 patient and local GP with symptoms alongside their families.\u201d Reuters is reporting that the French health minister has said the number of confirmed coronavirus-infected patients in the country has risen to 73. Chevron Corp said on Saturday that an employee in its Canary Wharf office in London who reported a flu-like illness, prompting the oil firm to send its staff home, has tested negative for the coronavirus, Reuters reports. On Tuesday Chevron asked about 300 British employees to work temporarily from home after an employee in its Canary Wharf office in London developed flu symptoms after returning from Northern Italy. It said it was proceeding with plans to have its staff return to the office. Switzerland is up to 17 cases of coronavirus infection - 12 confirmed and five awaiting confirmation - according to local media. Several areas, including the canton of Bern, have tightened preventive measures first announced on Friday, including a ban on public assemblies of more than 1,000 people, RTS reports. Event cancellations include Moutier carnival, which had been expected to go ahead because less than a thousand visitors were expected. A major real estate exhibition in Cannes has delayed for three months due to growing concern over the spread of the coronavirus. MIPIM, which describes itself as the world\u2019s leading property market, was expected to take place between March 10-13 dates, but it has been pushed back to early June in the hope the threat posed by the coronavirus will have reduced. Paul Zilk, chief executive of Reed MIDEM which organises the event, said: The well-being of our clients and staff is our priority. Given the evolving context, the best course of action is to postpone MIPIM to June. This is not a decision we have taken lightly. We believe these new dates will provide the international MIPIM community with the opportunity to achieve their business objectives. We are grateful to our clients for their support and constructive input during this challenging period, and we look forward to talking with them in the coming days about MIPIM in June. Italy\u2019s tourism industry has been dealt its final blow, the head of its hotel federation has lamented, after the US advised its citizens to reconsider travelling to the country. Hotel reservation cancellations have already reached about 90% in Rome, while Venice has seen bookings plummet after regional officials cancelled the final two days of carnival celebrations this week in an unprecedented move in modern times. On Friday, the US government issued a level three advisory, the second-highest level of warning for the whole of Italy, and announced that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had recommended avoiding non-essential travel to the Mediterranean country. We had already registered a slowdown of Americans coming to Italy in recent days, Federalberghi president Bernabo Bocca said in a statement on Saturday, adding that the final blow had now arrived. Bocca criticised measures to help the tourism industry, including delaying deadlines for tax payments and pausing mortgage repayments, as insufficient. He urged further help to guarantee cash flow to tourism operators to \u201cavoid the collapse\u201d of an industry which operates 300,000 businesses and employs 1.5m people. More than 5.6 million Americans visit Italy every year, the second-largest national group behind Germans, representing 9% of foreign tourists in Italy. Americans are among the biggest spenders at an average of \u20ac140 euros a day for a collective total of \u20ac5bn euros a year, the hotel federation Federalberghi said. Other major countries have only issued warnings about defined areas of northern Italy where most cases of the coronavirus have been recorded. Italy has currently confirmed almost 900 cases, by far the highest figure outside Asia. There have been 21 deaths among people with the virus. World stock markets are expected to fall further next week after the first surveys of China\u2019s economic health since the coronavirus outbreak showed factory output plunged and the country\u2019s service sectors contracted. Illustrating how the virus could wreck the economic forecasts of other affected countries, the world\u2019s second largest economy reported that manufacturing production levels dropped to record lows this month. Stock markets tumbled last week as the virus spread to four continents and UN health officials upgraded the level of threat from the virus to \u201cvery high\u201d. It is likely the fresh data, which measures the economic impact of Beijing\u2019s efforts to clampdown on the virus, will further spook investors who sent global markets tumbling 11% last week in the worst seven-day period for stocks since the 2008 financial crash. With factories forced to remain closed after the traditional lunar new year holiday shutdown, China\u2019s official Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI), a widely-watched measure of economic activity, fell further this month than at any time in the last 12 years, China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics said. The bureau found a worrying collapse in domestic and export orders and a contraction of the country\u2019s burgeoning service sector. Similar surveys expected next month covering Japan and South Korea, both badly affected by the coronavirus outbreak, could prolong the rout on global stock markets, analysts said. The outbreak has already disrupted supplies to factories in Europe, where companies have struggled to access vital components sourced from the far east. Investors expect to find out in the next few days whether the outbreak is accelerating in the United States, the world\u2019s biggest economy, and how far central banks and governments are prepared to go to deal with an epidemic. \u201cRight now the market is saying that this is unbounded. We don\u2019t know what the limits are and we don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going to peak,\u201d said Graham Tanaka, chief investment officer at New York-based Tanaka Capital. Stock markets globally lost about $5tn of value last week, as measured by the MSCI all-country index. Last weekend, president Xi Jinping told local officials that low-risk areas should \u201cresume full production and normal life\u201d. The government reported that larger factories\u2019 reached 85.6%of their capacity by the middle of last week. Analysts at ING said: \u201cThis isn\u2019t as positive as it sounds. Even if China\u2018s factory production can recover in March, it will still face the risk of a low level of export orders. This is because the supply chain will continue to be broken, this time in South Korea, Japan, Europe, and the US, where Covid-19 has begun to spread.\u201d Unofficial reports show that factories outside Hubei province, where the virus started, could be working at no more than 75% of their capacity and many nearer 25% to 50% while millions of workers remain trapped in their home province, unable to travel back to their place of work. The Qatari national who is the first confirmed case of the coronavirus in the Gulf state is a 36 year-old who returned recently from Iran and is in a stable condition, the country\u2019s health ministry has said. The UAE education ministry also announced the suspension of nursery school classes, as the regional business hub and major transit point for air travellers stepped up its contingency plans. Saudi Arabia is now the only Gulf country not to have signalled any cases of the coronavirus. Iran is preparing for the possibility of testing tens of thousands of people for the coronavirus as the number of confirmed cases in the country spiked once again, according to an official quoted by the Associated Press. The virus and the COVID-19 illness it causes have killed 43 people out of 593 confirmed cases in Iran, health ministry spokesperson Kianoush Jahanpour said, disputing reports that four times as many people have died. The death rate from the virus in Iran, about 7%, has caused global consternation and fuelled speculation that the country could be underreporting the number of cases affecting it. However, Jahanpour attempted to put the public health crisis into perspective. He said that more than 480 people in Iran had been killed in traffic accidents, but no one noticed them. Saturday\u2019s new toll of 593 confirmed cases represents a jump of 205 cases, a 52% increase from the 388 reported the day before. Jahanpour has warned that large increases in the number of confirmed cases would happen as Iran now has 15 laboratories testing for the virus, as spray trucks and fumigators into the streets are sent into streets. He went on to suggest tens of thousands could seek testing for the coronavirus, while encouraging people to continue to avoid mass gatherings, even funerals for those who died of the virus. The safest place is our homes and our cities, he said. South Korea has reported a \u201ccritical moment\u201d in its battle against coronavirus transmission after 813 new cases were detected in the country in a single day. The northern Japanese island of Hokkaidao has announced a three-week state of emergency, part of a number of measures implemented in Japan to slow the outbreak. The US has reported three new cases of the virus where the infection if of unknown origin. The patients in California, Washington state and Oregon had not travelled overseas or come into close contact with known carriers. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said it will have new coronavirus testing kits delivered to all states by the end of the week, after the first lot of tests were faulty. Mainland China reported the lowest number of new cases in a month, with 427 new cases reported, of which all but four were in Hubei province. There were 47 new deaths reported. Globally, there are an estimated 85,000 cases of Covid-19 and some 2,900 deaths. The virus has been detected in 58 countries. Qatar\u2019s health ministry reported on Saturday the first case of coronavirus infection in the country, Reuters reports the state-run Qatar News Agency as saying. More than 85,000 people around the world have been confirmed to have been infected with coronavirus according to the latest figures, based on World Health Organisation and national counts: Mainland China: 2,835 deaths among 79,251 cases, mostly in the central province of Hubei Hong Kong: 94 cases, 2 deaths Macao: 10 cases South Korea: 3,150 cases, 17 deaths Japan: 941 cases, including 705 from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, 11 deaths Italy: 888 cases, 18 deaths Iran: 593 cases, 43 deaths Singapore: 98 cases United States: 62 France: 57 cases, 2 deaths Germany: 57 cases Spain: 46 Kuwait: 45 Thailand: 42 Taiwan: 39 cases, 1 death Bahrain: 38 cases Malaysia: 24 Australia: 23 United Kingdom: 20 cases, 1 death United Arab Emirates: 19 cases Vietnam: 16 Canada: 14 Sweden: 12 Switzerland: 10 Iraq: 8 Norway: 6 Oman: 6 Austria: 5 Russia: 5 Croatia: 5 Israel: 5 Philippines: 3 cases, 1 death Finland: 3 cases Greece: 3 India: 3 Lebanon: 3 Romania: 3 Norway: 2 Pakistan: 2 Denmark: 2 Netherlands: 2 Georgia: 2 Mexico: 2 Egypt: 1 Algeria: 1 Afghanistan: 1 North Macedonia: 1 Estonia: 1 Lithuania: 1 Belgium: 1 Belarus: 1 Nepal: 1 Sri Lanka: 1 Cambodia: 1 Brazil: 1 New Zealand: 1 Nigeria: 1 Azerbaijan: 1 Monaco: 1 (Data collated by the Associated Press) The latest patient to be diagnosed with the virus and the GP who is feared to have it were both detected because the surgery where the doctor works is one of 100 practices where patients with breathing problems are now being routinely screened for Covid-19, the Guardian has been told. They were identified as a result of mouth and nasal swabs that were being taken from every patient attending the surgery with flu-like symptoms by staff from Surrey University who specialise in the spread and epidemiology of influenza. The northern Japanese island of Hokkaido has declared a three-week state of emergency, urging residents to stay home as much as possible until 19 March, NHK News reports. Speaking to reporters on Friday, [Hokkaido governor] Naomichi Suzuki said the situation is getting more serious. He urged residents to refrain from going out until March 19, and especially over this weekend. Suzuki said many people go out on weekends, and he wants people to refrain from going out this weekend to reduce the possibility of a surge in infections. He also said he wants children not to leave their homes unless absolutely necessary, adding that nothing is more important than life and wellbeing. Pope Francis has cancelled official engagements for a third day in a row, the Associated Press reports. He last appeared in public on Wednesday, when he was seen coughing and blowing his nose. According to AP: The 83-year-old pope, who lost part of a lung to a respiratory illness as a young man, has never cancelled so many official audiences or events in his seven-year papacy. Francis is, however, continuing to work from his residence at the Vatican\u2019s Santa Marta hotel and is receiving people in private, the Vatican press office said. On Saturday, those private meetings were with the head of the Vatican\u2019s bishops\u2019 office, Francis\u2019 ambassadors to Lebanon and France and a Ukrainian archbishop. Cancelled were his two planned official audiences formal affairs in the Apostolic Palace where Francis would have delivered a speech and greeted a great number of people at the end. Those were to include an audience with an international bioethics organisation and with members of the scandal-marred Legion of Christ religious order. On Sunday, Francis is expected to leave the Vatican with top Holy See bureaucrats for a week of spiritual exercises in the Roman countryside, an annual retreat that the pope attends at the start of each Lent. The official death toll from coronavirus in Iran has reached 43, Reuters reports. There have been unofficial claims that the true figure is much higher. Reuters quoted a health official, Kianush Jahanpur, as telling state TV: Unfortunately nine people died of the virus in the last 24 hours. The death toll is 43 now. The new confirmed infected cases since yesterday is 205 that makes the total number of confirmed infected people 593. The Reuters report continues: Iran, which has the highest death toll outside China, has ordered the shutting of schools until Tuesday and the government has extended the closure of universities and a ban on concerts and sports events for a week. Several high-ranking officials, including a vice-minister, deputy health minister and five lawmakers, have tested positive for the coronavirus as the rapid spread of the outbreak forced the government to call on people to stay at home. Iranian media reported on Saturday that one lawmaker, elected in Iran\u2019s 21 Februaru polls, had died of the coronavirus. Iran\u2019s government spokesman will hold his weekly news conference online due to the outbreak, the semi-official Mehr news agency reported. The Chinese laboratory that first sequenced and shared the coronavirus genome publicly has been closed down by the authorities for \u201crectification\u201d, the South China Morning Post reports. On 12 January, a day after the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Centre\u2019s laboratory shared the information online \u2013 a move that helped companies to devise new diagnostic kits for the virulent respiratory illness \u2013 officials from the Shanghai Health Commission ordered it to close. The PHCC lab is a level-three biosafety facility that had only last month passed its annual inspections. It had obtained the necessary credentials and permissions to research the coronavirus, SCMP reported. It seems that scientists at the laboratory acted unilaterally in releasing the virus because they thought authorities were taking too long to act. The SCMP said the team at the lab, led by Prof Zhang Yongzhen, had isolated and finished the genome sequence of the then-unknown virus on 5 January and reported its findings to the China\u2019s national health commission the same day. SCMP cited an unnamed source linked to the centre as saying: The centre was not given any specific reasons why the laboratory was closed for rectification. [We have submitted] four reports [asking for permission] to reopen but we have not received any replies. The closure has greatly affected the scientists and their research when they should be racing against the clock to find the means to help put the novel coronavirus outbreak under control. An entire Italian Serie C football team is in quarantine after three players and an official tested positive for coronavirus. Players from Pianese, a side based in Tuscany, began to exhibit symptoms last Saturday, while the team played away against Allesandria. The Siena-based club said in a statement: At the moment those infected are four \u2013 three players and a team official. The first is a young player who had started to experience a slight rise in temperature and headache last Saturday, when the team was away to Alessandria to play a championship game. The second player is in self-isolation at his home, while not showing any symptoms, as well as the third player who is slightly feverish. The fourth person tested positive for the swab is a club official who this morning, after spending the night in a feverish state, was transported by ambulance to the hospital in Siena. Currently all the players, the technical staff and the managers present during the trip last weekend are in a 15-day quarantine. Vietnam has announced that all 16 infected coronavirus patients detected in the country have been discharged from hospital and declared cured, Al Jazeera reports. According to the broadcaster, the Vietnamese government has detected no new cases of coronavirus for the past 15 days. For the past 15 days, including on Friday, the government also detected no new cases of infections, the last one having been reported on 13 February. \u201cIf fighting Covid-19 has been a war, then we have won the first round but not the entire war because the situation can be very unpredictable,\u201d the deputy prime minister, Vu Duc Dam, was quoted as saying. Vietnam has taken strict measures to halt the spread of the virus, including shutting down schools across the country. A village north of Hanoi remains under lockdown. An expat teacher in Vietnam tells the Guardian: Ho Chi Minh officials in Vietnam have announced they are closing the schools for another two weeks, after already being closed for the month of February. Kindergartens and younger levels will not return until the 15th [of March] whilst secondary students can return on the 8th. Hanoi have also announced another week off school for all levels until the 8th. Many expat teachers have been out of work now for a month with many returning to their home country whilst the others stick it out. The health minister Edward Argar has said the UK continues to be in a \u201ccontainment phase\u201d of coronavirus spread, and said cancelling events would not be considered unless the outbreak worsened. He told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4: We\u2019re still in the containment phase of this disease. We have been pretty good at containing it thus far. And the chief medical officer has been very clear that there is no reason to think that we shouldn\u2019t be able to continue containing it, so that\u2019s what our focus is on. England\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, has spoken publicly about the possibility of ramping up measures to protect the public. But Agar said there was no reason to curtail mass events. [Whitty] said decisions on large events and whether they should go ahead will be taken at the time on the basis of the evidence. He\u2019s not saying there is a need for that now. Similarly, with school closures. He\u2019s been clear there is no reason or need for schools en masse to close. If there are particular incidents, Public Health England and local teams will give advice. So what Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, has been saying is, these are all things that, in responsible contingency planning for the future, we will be looking at. But we are clear that these are not needed at the moment and that we believe, as he said, that we will not need to move to that phase on the base of where we are at the moment. Argar refused to comment on reports that the first person to contract coronavirus in the UK also passed it on to their doctor. The Guardian has been told there are fears that a doctor from the patient\u2019s surgery may also have been infected with the virus. If confirmed, this would prompt particular concern as the GP would routinely have seen scores of patients over the course of the last week. I\u2019m aware of the Guardian report, but I\u2019m going on the basis of what I\u2019ve been told. I haven\u2019t had any details of that and I think it would be wrong to comment on speculation in the press without that detailed advice from the chief medical officer. I have not been briefed on anything beyond the detail that the chief medical officer and others have given me about this individual case. It is a new development but the chief medical officer has also said we are still doing the contact tracing around that and we are still looking into the details of that case, so it is probably a bit premature to say more than that at the moment. South Korea has reported 219 new coronavirus cases, bringing the country\u2019s total infections to 3,150, the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said on Saturday, Reuters reports. The new cases are in addition to the 594 confirmed earlier in the day. Together they logged a record daily increase in infections since South Korea confirmed its first patient on 20 January. Earlier (5.27am), we reported how South Korean authorities had asked residents to stay at home this weekend to help contain the spread of the coronavirus. Large swathes of Seoul and other cities appear to be largely deserted. Health officials in the US have identified four \u201cpresumptive\u201d coronavirus cases believed to have been infected within the country, in a turning point in efforts to contain Covid-19 there, Reuters is reporting. Three new cases of apparent community transmission, plus the one identified earlier this week in California, are a sign the virus is now spreading within at least four separate locations up and down the US west coast. They span nearly 900 miles, from California\u2019s Silicon Valley region to the Puget Sound near Seattle. The agency reported a U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) statement on Friday citing three new diagnoses \u2013 one each in California, Oregon and Washington state. If confirmed by the CDC, together with a previous case of unknown origin announced on Wednesday in California, that would bring to four the number of diagnosed individuals in the United States with no history of travel to a country where the virus is circulating and no close contact with a person known to be infected. The three latest patients were diagnosed based on results obtained in their respective states from CDC-supplied test kits and are considered \u201cpresumptive positive\u201d cases pending CDC confirmatory testing, the U.S. agency said. A fourth presumptive positive was also announced in Washington state on Friday, but that one is \u201clikely travel-related,\u201d the CDC said.

Australia has announced a travel ban to Iran, placing travellers from that country on the same restrictions as people seeking to travel to Australia from China. Australian citizens and permanent residents returning from either country will be required to self-isolate for 14 days, and foreign nationals seeking to enter Australia will not be able to do so until at least 14 days after they have left China or Iran. It comes as authorities in Queensland are trying to trace up to 40 people who may have received a beauty treatment from a Gold Coast beautician who returned from Iran on Monday and later became ill. She has since tested positive to coronavirus. Iran has the highest number of deaths from the novel coronavirus outside of China. Some 34 deaths have been reported, but the real figure is believed to be much higher. The US has also strengthened its travel advice, raising Iran and Italy to a level three, advising people to \u201cavoid nonessential travel.\u201d The US has reported three new cases of the virus where the infection if of unknown origin. A woman in California, a high school student in Washington state and an elementary school worker in Portland, Oregon have been diagnosed with the virus despite not having travelled overseas or come into close contact with someone who is at known risk. The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention has said it will have new coronavirus testing kits delivered to all states by the end of the week, after the first lot of tests were faulty. US authorities have postponed a planned ASEAN meeting in Las Vegas on 14 March over coronavirus fears, and the UN has recommended ministers and diplomats avoid travelling to New York for a meeting of the Commission on the Status of Women next week. Authorities in South Korea have asked residents to stay home this weekend in an effort to curb the spread of coronavirus, after the country reported the biggest rise of cases in a single day since the virus was first detected in the country on 20 January. Some 594 cases were reported on Saturday, and the country\u2019s death toll has risen to 17. Mainland China reported the lowest number of new cases in a month, with 427 new cases reported, of which all but four were in Hubei province. There were 47 new deaths reported. Globally, there are an estimated 85,000 cases of Covid-19 and some 2,900 deaths. The virus has been detected in 58 countries. You can read a wrap of these developments here. \u2018It just seems sensible\u2019 Some Australians have begun stockpiling food and medication in anticipation of a coronavirus outbreak. Gary Nunn reports that the threat of a pandemic, coming so soon after a horrific summer of bushfires that left many communities cut off for weeks, has made preppers out of people who would previously have laughed at the idea. One Sydney couple have already gathered three months worth of supplies. But experts say it is not necessary. Professor Nigel McMillan, the director of infectious diseases and immunology at the Menzies Health Institute at Griffith University in Queensland, says: There\u2019s no need to stockpile food, medicine, petrol or anything at this stage. We don\u2019t wish to induce panic buying when, for 95 to 99% of the population, this\u2019ll be a mild cold, nothing more. Plus, once we\u2019ve had this strain, we\u2019ll become immune to it. You can read the full piece here. Theme parks and sports stadiums in Japan have been closed to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The Australian government has issued a statement on the travel ban to Iran, saying it is \u201cpart of our ongoing strategy of containment and minimising risk to the Australian community as detailed in our pandemic preparedness plan.\u201d As of 1 March 2020: The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will raise the level of the travel advisory for Iran from level 3 to level 4 \u2013 do not travel; Foreign nationals (excluding permanent residents of Australia) who are in Iran on or after 1 March 2020, will not be allowed to enter Australia for 14 days, from the time they have left or transited through Iran; Australian citizens and permanent residents will still be able to enter, as will their immediate family members (spouses, legal guardians or dependants only). They will be required to self-isolate at home for 14 days from the day they left Iran. In a joint statement, prime minister Scott Morrison, health minister Greg Hunt and foreign minister Marine Payne said the travel advice was lifted on the advice of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee. Guardian Australia\u2019s Melbourne bureau chief, Melissa Davey, explained those reasons here. The United States has updated its travel advice for Iran and Italy, warning people to \u201cavoid nonessential travel\u201d due to the increased spread of coronavirus. It comes as Australia placed a travel ban on Iran, putting it on the same restrictions as China. \u201cAvoid nonessential travel\u201d is a level three warning. China and South Korea were already under the same warning. The ratings for Italy and Iran were updated by the CDC on Friday. The upgraded travel advice for Italy in particular is expected to have implications for businesses that have policies against allowing staff to travel to countries with a level three warning in place. There is no additional travel warning for Hong Kong, and Japan currently sits at a level two, which means travellers are advised to practice \u201cenhanced precautions.\u201d Coronavirus cases from \u2018unknown\u2019 sources concern health officials Health officials in the US are reportedly worried that the novel coronavirus is spreading through communities on the west coast, after three patients \u2014 one in Oregon, one in California and one in Washington \u2014 were infected through unknown means. This report from Associated Press. The patients are: An older woman in northern California with chronic health conditions A high school student in Everett, Washington An employee at an elementary school in Portland, Oregon None of the patients had recently travelled overseas or had any known close contact with a traveller or an infected person, authorities said. Santa Clara County in the San Francisco Bay Area also reported two cases where the source of infection wasn\u2019t known, AP reported. The new coronavirus cases of unknown origin marks an escalation of the worldwide outbreak in the U.S. because it means the virus could spread beyond the reach of preventative measures like quarantines, though state health officials said that was inevitable and that the risk of widespread transmission remains low. California public health officials on Friday said more than 9,380 people are self-monitoring after arriving on commercial flights from China through Los Angeles and San Francisco. That\u2019s up from the 8,400 that Gov. Gavin Newsom cited on Thursday, though officials said the number increases daily as more flights arrive. Officials are not too worried, for now, about casual contact, because federal officials think the coronavirus is spread only through \u201cclose contact, being within six feet of somebody for what they\u2019re calling a prolonged period of time,\u201d said Dr. James Watt, interim state epidemiologist at the California Department of Public Health. The virus can cause fever, coughing, wheezing and pneumonia. Health officials think it spreads mainly from droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how the flu spreads. Cherry blossom festivals in Japan have been cancelled due to fears around the coronavirus. From AFP: The traditional spring celebrations in Tokyo and Osaka, which attract millions of people wanting to seeing the white and pink flowers, will not go ahead as planned in April. \u201cWe are sincerely sorry for those who were looking forward to the viewing ... but please give us your understanding,\u201d the Japan Mint in Osaka said Friday. Other cherry blossom events - feverishly anticipated by locals and tourists - are likely to follow suit, according to local media. Organisers of Tokyo\u2019s Nakameguro Cherry Blossom Festival said people could still enjoy the blooming trees that grow along public roads. Trees in Tokyo will soon be in full bloom, with friends, families and colleagues typically flocking to parks for sometimes raucous, alcohol-fuelled celebrations. The cancellations come as authorities step up efforts to tackle the outbreak in Japan, which has reported more than 230 infections and five deaths. Schools are closed and the government is urging people to work from home or commute during off-peak hours and avoid large gatherings. The operator of Tokyo\u2019s two Disney resorts - Disneyland and DisneySea - said Friday the parks would be closed for around two weeks due to the virus. Universal Studios Japan in Osaka has also shuttered for a fortnight. Tiger Ye, a 21-year-old student in Wuhan, contracted the novel coronavirus. He wrote about the experience in The Guardian. By 26 January getting up had become extremely difficult and I was shivering with cold. I felt I was having a high fever, and I was: 39C. Reports later said that the situation could develop extremely fast in the middle stage, but before I knew it, by that evening the fever was gone. It felt like having been to hell and back. That period from 21 January to the 26th was the worst time. I coughed so bad my stomach was hurting and my back ached. Those were some of the worst days in my life. You can read the full story here: Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, says people should not stockpile face masks. We know that people stockpiling masks has caused an issue with mask supply around Australia, and we don\u2019t support that. Australia has implemented a travel ban against Iran, placing it under the same restrictions as China, because of an increased risk of coronavirus. It follows the first case in Australia of a person who had travelled to Iran. Health minister Greg Hunt is explaining the ban to reporters in Melbourne at the moment. From tomorrow, 1 March, people who have travelled to Iran are required to self-isolate for 14 days upon return to Australia. Also, from tomorrow, non-citizens or permanent residents, and people who are not family members of citizens or permanent residents, will be prevented from entering Australia unless they left Iran at least 14 days before entering Australia. Hunt said the level 4 travel advice on Iran is identical to travel advice already in place for China. The Smartraveller website is yet to be updated. They [Iran] have the highest death rate, I think the latest advice we have is 34 deaths, outside of Hubei. There is likely at this stage a high level of undetected cases and therefore those cases . won\u2019t be intercepted or detected on departure from Iran. As of Saturday, more than 85,000 cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed and 2,900 people have died. The virus has now spread to 58 countries. Chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said it was \u201cnot possible to isolate Australia further\u201d and place travel bans on every country where the virus had been detected. But he said his office had recommended the increased travel warning against Iran, due to the nature of the outbreak there. Thailand has reported one new case of coronavirus, bringing its total to 42, Reuters reports. South Korean authorities have asked residents to stay at home this weekend to help contain the spread of the coronavirus, and it seems that advice has been heeded. This shopping area in Seoul is usually busy. Today it was empty. Quarantine operations are underway in Daegu, the city at the centre of the outbreak in South Korea. Current advice for Australia Just to recap on the situation as it currently stands in Australia: the total number of cases confirmed in Australia is 25. Fifteen of these people are reported to have recovered and the remaining are in a stable condition. Nine are passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. People who become ill after travelling to China or a region with reported coronavirus cases are advised to isolate themselves and call their doctor. There is no need for people to buy and wear face masks \u2014 and authorities ask that you don\u2019t buy up supplies \u2014 but extra careful hand washing is advised. The current travel advice from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) is for Australians to not travel to mainland China. They also advise that Australians \u201creconsider\u201d travel to Iran and \u201cexercise a high degree of caution\u201d in regions of northern Italy, South Korea, Japan, and Mongolia. The Australian government\u2019s official up-to-date advice is here. South Korea has urged its citizens to stay indoors and warned it is facing a \u201ccritical moment\u201d in its battle against the coronavirus, Reuters reports. It comes as the country records its biggest daily jump in the number of cases reported since it reported its first case on 20 January, with 594 new cases reported on Saturday. The total number of cases is 2,931. Another person is confirmed to have died from the virus bringing the death toll to 17. Vice health minister Kim Kang-lip told a briefing on Saturday that residents were advised to stay home. We have asked you to refrain from taking part in public events, including a religious gathering or protest, this weekend. He said it was a \u201ccritical moment\u201d in curbing the spread of the virus. Please stay at home and refrain from going outside and minimise contact with other people. Many of the new cases have been linked to a church. More from Reuters: As many as 476 of the new cases were from southeastern Daegu city, the site of a church at the centre of the outbreak, and 60 from the nearby province of North Gyeongsang, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said. Health authorities have run tests on more than 210,000 members and 65,000 trainees of the church linked to a majority of cases after a 61-year-old woman known as \u201cPatient 31\u201d attended religious services there before testing positive. More than 88% have been checked, and about 3,300 have shown symptoms such as fever, Kim added. Some provincial officials want to press criminal charges against the church, saying it refused to release a complete list of members, although the church denied the accusation, and urged an end to \u201cslander and oppression\u201d of its followers. Kim said the government was working with the municipal authorities to check if the church provided an incomplete list. A court rejected a plan by conservative groups critical of President Moon Jae-in for a massive weekend rally in downtown Seoul, citing health concerns. Speaking of airports \u2014 Guardian Australian news editor Mike Ticher reports that about 50% of all passengers and staff at Singapore airport are wearing masks, despite the Singapore government\u2019s instruction that there is no need to do so unless people are feeling unwell. He writes: There are few outward signs of unease about coronavirus at Singapore airport, although the waiting areas seem sparsely populated on Saturday morning. Traffic at the airport was reported to be 25% down in the first two weeks of February. Singapore is one of the countries identified by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee where the coronavirus situation is of particular concern. In LAX, the flight crews are wearing masks. The UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has recommended that ministers and diplomats skip travelling to a meeting in New York of the Commission on the Status of Women due to the coronavirus outbreak, Reuters reports. More than 7,000 people usually attend the annual meeting, officials said, which is dedicated to the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women. It is due to be held from March 9 to 20. However, in a letter to UN member states from the chair of the commission, Armenia\u2019s UN Ambassador Mher Margaryan said Guterres had recommended that member states \u201cshorten and scale down the session\u201d and cancel dozens of side events. \u201cHe also strongly recommended that capital-based representatives refrain from traveling to headquarters for the session,\u201d Margaryan wrote. The bureau of the Commission on the Status of Women proposed that member states agree to Guterres\u2019 recommendations at a meeting on Monday. UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Guterres made the recommendations given the \u201cfast-evolving situation\u201d with the coronavirus and the need to \u201cbalance the UN\u2019s critical work and public health concerns.\u201d The most recent coronavirus case in the United States has led to the temporary closure of an elementary school in Portland after authorities confirmed that the infected person worked at the school. The new case in Oregon \u2014 the first in that state \u2014 was reported on Friday. It\u2019s the third case of unknown origin in the US. More from AP: \u201cThe case was not a person under monitoring or a person under investigation. The individual had neither a history of travel to a country where the virus was circulating, nor is believed to have had a close contact with another confirmed case the two most common sources of exposure,\u201d the Oregon Health Authority said in a statement. The Lake Oswego School District sent a robocall to parents saying that Forest Hills Elementary will be closed until Wednesday so it can be deep-cleaned by maintenance workers. Health authorities planned to spend the weekend scrambling to find everyone the unidentified person, who has been hospitalised, had been in contact with. Hours before the case emerged, the state ramped up efforts to combat an outbreak amid potential challenges, including closing schools, businesses and events, and sustained shortages of medical supplies. At a hastily called news conference, state health officials did not release details on the person, citing patient privacy. But they said the person had spent time at the elementary school, located in a Portland suburb. \u201cState and local authorities are responding quickly to this case,\u201d Oregon Gov. Kate Brown told the Portland news conference. Brown urged people not to panic. Authorities are monitoring 78 people in Oregon for signs of the virus. Another 178 have completed monitoring without developing systems. Two more developed symptoms but tested negative. The case brings the number of people in the US with the novel coronavirus to 62. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, held a meeting of party officials on Friday calling for stronger efforts to control the novel coronavirus, saying there would be serious consequences if it spread into his country. South Korea has the second highest number of infections outside mainland China, but North Korea is yet to report a confirmed case. This image was released by Korea\u2019s Central News Agency, showing Kim Jong Un observing a Korean People\u2019s Army joint strike drill at an undisclosed location. Workers in North Korea were disinfecting checkout counters on Friday. Only one of the 61 (or 62, the numbers are unclear) confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States represents a patient who is still in hospital, vice president Mike Pence said on Friday. There have been 15 confirmed cases in the US and 46 \u2014 or 47, according to the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention \u2014 cases among people who returned to the country from overseas and were quarantined. Reuters says a CDC spokeswoman was not able to explain the difference in the numbers. Pence said in a news conference with Florida governor Ron DeSantis on Friday that: \u201cIn every case, people are being treated and by all accounts are doing well.\u201d Meanwhile, Orange County officials say federal authorities have dropped a plan to transfer passengers returning from the Diamond Princess cruise ship to the Fairview Developmental Center in Costa Mesa. Officials were looking at using the centre to house passengers from the cruise ship who were evacuated from the ship to Travis Air Force Base in Northern California, had tested positive for the virus, but did not need hospital care. Third case of unknown origin in the US There has been another case of unknown origin reported in the United States, bringing the total number of cases of unknown origin to three. The Oregon health authority declared its first presumptive case of novel coronavirus on Friday. More from Reuters: According to the statement, the infected individual identified as a resident of Washington County neither had history of travel to a country where the virus was circulating, nor is believed to have had a close contact with another confirmed case. Public health officials are considering it a likely community-transmitted case, which means that the origin of the infection is unknown, the statement added. Two other cases of unknown origin have been reported in California. Queensland Health has just sent through a press statement with a few more details on that Gold Coast case. The beauty salon was Hair Plus at the Australia Fair shopping centre. But the woman in question did facials and other beauty treatments \u2014 not haircuts. That\u2019s significant because beauty treatments, in this salon, were much shorter appointments. The biggest concern is people who had a beauty appointment lasting more than 15 minutes, or who may have been in the room for two or more hours. Anyone who attended Hair Plus from 11am onwards on Thursday, 27 February, has been asked to go to the Gold Coast University Hospital. People who were at the Australia Fair shopping centre, but not the beauty salon, on Thursday have been told there is \u201cno need for concern\u201d but they can call 13HEALTH for advice. Health minister Steven Miles said the risk of the virus spreading in Queensland remained very low. There are nine confirmed cases in Queensland. This latest case brings the number of confirmed cases in Australia to 25. Chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young said that with the novel coronavirus spreading to an increasing number of countries, anyone who feels unwell shortly after arriving in Australia from overseas should contact their doctor for advice. The number of affected countries has spread to 49, and the World Health Organisation has elevated the risk of spread of the virus to \u201cvery high\u201d. A pandemic has not been declared, but Young said it would happen. We know we will be seeing an epidemic here in Queensland eventually. We would like to contain that as much as possible, as we have been. Young said that more than 80% of all recorded cases of the Covid-19 virus were mild, and the mortality rate had fallen from 2-3% when the virus was first reported, as more mild cases are detected. It\u2019s now estimated to be about 1%. Said Young: I am very very confident here in Queensland, because of the. warning that we have been given.... that we will see [mortality] rates even lower than that. Young said the demographic at the highest risk from the virus were the elderly and those with co-morbidities like diabetes, hypertension, or cardiovascular conditions. She said children had a \u201cminimal risk\u201d \u2014 not an elevated risk, as they have with other respiratory conditions like the flu \u2014 and the risk to pregnant women is understood to be the same as the general population. Miles said Queensland had asked the federal government to declare the coronavirus a disaster, because of its broader economic impacts. We are doing everything we can from a health perspective to contain the virus but it is impacting on business, it is impacting on the economy.... in the same way that a disaster does. The Queensland health minister, Steven Miles, spoke just now in Brisbane now about the latest coronavirus case in Australia, which is a 63-year-old woman who recently returned from Iran. The woman flew back on Monday 24 February, and was not unwell on the flight. She began to feel unwell on Thursday 27 February, and authorities are trying to trace anyone who may have come into contact with the woman while she was working as a beautician on the Gold Coast on Thursday. The beauty salon is at the Australia Fair shopping centre on the Gold Coast. Queensland\u2019s chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young said they believe she saw 30 to 40 clients on Thursday, mostly for very short appointments. Interactions of less than 15 minutes have a low risk of transmitting the virus, Young said. Young said the woman mainly gave facials, and that customers often did not book and paid cash \u2014 so they have made a public call-out for anyone who attended the beauty salon on Thursday to come forward. On the risk of transmission, Young said: It\u2019s a very brief interaction so the risk is very low. She said there was \u201cno need to have any concerns prior to that,\u201d because the woman was not symptomatic. She said that once she began to feel unwell, the woman immediately notified her doctor that she had returned from Iran \u2014 which has the highest number of deaths from coronavirus outside of mainland China \u2014 and was at risk. If you didn\u2019t go to that salon then there is no need to have any concern at all. If you are unsure about the seriousness of the coronavirus \u2014 and there has been some fairly confused information about this \u2014 science correspondent Hannah Devlin has busted some of the most common myths. For one, she writes that while we do not know a precise fatality rate for Covid-19, current estimates are a fatality rate of about 1%. Hannah writes: This would make Covid-19 about 10 times more deadly than seasonal flu, which is estimated to kill between 290,000 and 650,000 people a year globally. So: worse than flu.

Postponing the ASEAN summit a \u2018difficult decision\u2019: US officials Here is a bit more on that announcement from the United States to delay a regional ASEAN summit scheduled to take place in Las Vegas in two weeks time. From AFP: The United States has delayed a regional ASEAN summit scheduled to take place in Las Vegas next month due to fears of the coronavirus, a senior administration official said Friday. \u201cAs the international community works together to defeat the novel coronavirus, the United States, in consultation with ASEAN partners, has made the difficult decision to postpone the ASEAN leaders meeting,\u201d said the official on condition of not being named. Leaders from the Association of South East Asian Nations had been due to be hosted by President Donald Trump on March 14. The official said the United States \u201cvalues our relationships with the nations of this critical region, and looks forward to future meetings.\u201d The announcement came as health officials in California confirmed the United States\u2019 second case believed to have been transmitted to a person who did not travel overseas or come in contact with anyone known to be ill. The Las Vegas meeting was scheduled after US president Donald Trump skipped the ASEAN summit in Thailand in November. More from AFP: Trump had skipped an ASEAN summit and parallel East Asia Summit last year in Bangkok. He instead sent his national security advisor Robert O\u2019Brien, in the lowest-level participation ever by the United States in the East Asia Summit. The move came after years of US efforts to show that the United States is committed to Asia in the face of a rising China. Hello and welcome to our continued live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. This is where the situation stands: The World Health Organisation says that the coronavirus could reach most \u201cif not all countries.\u201d It has already spread to 49 countries. You can check our map of the outbreak here. The latest figures from mainland China report 427 new cases, all but four of which were in Hubei province. There have been about 80,000 confirmed cases in mainland China. The death toll rose by 47, bringing the total number of deaths to 2,835. South Korea reported 594 new cases on Saturday, the biggest increase to date for the country, taking the national total to 2,931 infections. 90% of the cases are in the outbreak centre of Daegu. Three women are confirmed to have died, taking the national death toll to 16. The US government will reportedly suspend a planned meeting of Asean leaders in Las Vegas on 14 March over coronavirus fears. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK has risen to 20, with the first death of a UK citizen \u2014 a 70-year-old passenger on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, who lived abroad \u2014 confirmed on Friday. Australian authorities have reported two new confirmed cases, including a 63-year-old woman now in hospital on the Gold Coast who travelled to Queensland from Iran, where infection rates are suspected to be much higher than reported. The US has confirmed its second case of the virus in a patient who had not travelled to affected areas or come into known contact with an infected person. The US Centre for Disease Control (CDC) has promised it will have working test kits in every state by the end of next week after the first test was found to be faulty.

In Washington, however, the deal was not greeted with universal enthusiasm even by Trump allies such as Lindsey Graham or by former presidential aides, among them the former national security adviser John Bolton. Many observers counselled caution and pointed to a difficult road ahead. Most pointed out that the deal leaves peace in Afghanistan to be negotiated between the Taliban and an Afghan government the militants have always denounced as a puppet.

      "body": "<p>The US recorded its first death from coronavirus yesterday, when a man in his 50s died in a care home. A further 21 residents were confirmed to be suffering from the virus, with four of them said to be very ill.</p> <p>The outbreak at the home in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland led to the vice president, Mike Pence, announcing a ban on travel to Iran and stronger warnings on travel to Italy and South Korea.</p> <p>The US president, Donald Trump, said that there were likely to be more cases and he would consider additional restrictions, including closing the US border with Mexico in response to the virus\u2019s spread.</p> <p>The victim was said to be of a high medical risk and there was no evidence he had travelled abroad or had links to anyone who had. Washington state health officials said other residents and some staff were also showing \u201csome sort of symptoms\u201d but had not yet been diagnosed.</p> <p>About 60 cases have been confirmed in the US. Trump said healthy Americans should recover if they contract the virus, as he tried to reassure Americans and global markets. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken the most aggressive actions to confront the coronavirus,\u201d he said. \u201cOur country is prepared for any circumstance. There is no reason to panic at all.\u201d</p> <p>Elsewhere, Ireland reported its first case of the virus, as did Ecuador and Luxembourg. Mexico reported two more cases, bringing the country\u2019s total to four, and Brazil announced its second.</p> <p>France and Italy imposed strict bans on public gatherings as numbers of coronavirus cases rose dramatically in both countries.</p> <p>One of the first casualties of the ban was Sunday\u2019s Paris half-marathon, which has been cancelled, while a major four-day trade show in Cannes for property investors has been put back from March to June.</p> <p>In Italy, five key football matches were postponed this weekend. The games include the crunch top-of-the-table Serie A clash between Inter Milan and Juventus. The matches had been scheduled to take place behind closed doors after the Italian government banned public gatherings as part of its campaign to try to slow the spread of Covid-19. But now Serie-A officials have decided the matches will be played on 13 May \u2013 when fans will be able to attend. </p> <p>Nearly 900 people have tested positive for the virus in Italy, and authorities in northern regions \u2013 where Europe\u2019s worst outbreak is centred \u2013 on Saturday ordered that schools and universities should stay closed for a second week, dashing any hopes of a swift return to normality.</p> <p>In France, authorities on Saturday reported 16 new cases of the virus. \u201cAll public gatherings of more than 5,000 people in a confined space are temporarily banned,\u201d health minister Olivier V\u00e9ran announced.</p> <p>He also advised people to cut back on <em>la bise</em> \u2013 the custom of greeting friends and relatives with kisses. As of Saturday, France had registered 73 virus cases, up from 57 on Friday and of these, 59 people remained in hospital, two had died and 12 had recovered, V\u00e9ran added.</p> <p>More than 50 countries have now reported cases, and the World Health Organization (WHO) has upgraded the global risk of the outbreak to \u201cvery high\u201d \u2013 its top level of risk assessment.</p> <p>Globally, there are an estimated 85,000 cases, and there have been 2,900 deaths. The virus has been detected in 58 countries, although the WHO said on Friday that there was still a chance of containing it if its chain of transmission were broken.</p> <p>Azerbaijan said on Saturday that it had closed its border with Iran for two weeks. Iran\u2019s death toll \u2013 43 out of 593 confirmed cases \u2013 is the highest in the world apart from China, and puts the country\u2019s death rate from the disease at more than 7%, much higher than other countries. That has worried experts at the WHO, who fear Iran may be under-reporting the number of cases now affecting it.</p> <p>South Korea has also reported a \u201ccritical moment\u201d in its battle against transmission, after 813 new cases were detected in the country in a single day, while the Japanese island of Hokkaido announced a three-week state of emergency, part of a number of measures to slow the outbreak.</p> <p>\u2022 The main image used on this article was changed on 2 March 2020 to more accurately reflect the text.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The US recorded its first death from coronavirus yesterday, when a man in his 50s died in a care home. A further 21 residents were confirmed to be suffering from the virus, with four of them said to be very ill. The outbreak at the home in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland led to the vice president, Mike Pence, announcing a ban on travel to Iran and stronger warnings on travel to Italy and South Korea. The US president, Donald Trump, said that there were likely to be more cases and he would consider additional restrictions, including closing the US border with Mexico in response to the virus\u2019s spread. The victim was said to be of a high medical risk and there was no evidence he had travelled abroad or had links to anyone who had. Washington state health officials said other residents and some staff were also showing \u201csome sort of symptoms\u201d but had not yet been diagnosed. About 60 cases have been confirmed in the US. Trump said healthy Americans should recover if they contract the virus, as he tried to reassure Americans and global markets. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken the most aggressive actions to confront the coronavirus,\u201d he said. \u201cOur country is prepared for any circumstance. There is no reason to panic at all.\u201d Elsewhere, Ireland reported its first case of the virus, as did Ecuador and Luxembourg. Mexico reported two more cases, bringing the country\u2019s total to four, and Brazil announced its second. France and Italy imposed strict bans on public gatherings as numbers of coronavirus cases rose dramatically in both countries. One of the first casualties of the ban was Sunday\u2019s Paris half-marathon, which has been cancelled, while a major four-day trade show in Cannes for property investors has been put back from March to June. In Italy, five key football matches were postponed this weekend. The games include the crunch top-of-the-table Serie A clash between Inter Milan and Juventus. The matches had been scheduled to take place behind closed doors after the Italian government banned public gatherings as part of its campaign to try to slow the spread of Covid-19. But now Serie-A officials have decided the matches will be played on 13 May \u2013 when fans will be able to attend. Nearly 900 people have tested positive for the virus in Italy, and authorities in northern regions \u2013 where Europe\u2019s worst outbreak is centred \u2013 on Saturday ordered that schools and universities should stay closed for a second week, dashing any hopes of a swift return to normality. In France, authorities on Saturday reported 16 new cases of the virus. \u201cAll public gatherings of more than 5,000 people in a confined space are temporarily banned,\u201d health minister Olivier V\u00e9ran announced. He also advised people to cut back on la bise \u2013 the custom of greeting friends and relatives with kisses. As of Saturday, France had registered 73 virus cases, up from 57 on Friday and of these, 59 people remained in hospital, two had died and 12 had recovered, V\u00e9ran added. More than 50 countries have now reported cases, and the World Health Organization (WHO) has upgraded the global risk of the outbreak to \u201cvery high\u201d \u2013 its top level of risk assessment. Globally, there are an estimated 85,000 cases, and there have been 2,900 deaths. The virus has been detected in 58 countries, although the WHO said on Friday that there was still a chance of containing it if its chain of transmission were broken. Azerbaijan said on Saturday that it had closed its border with Iran for two weeks. Iran\u2019s death toll \u2013 43 out of 593 confirmed cases \u2013 is the highest in the world apart from China, and puts the country\u2019s death rate from the disease at more than 7%, much higher than other countries. That has worried experts at the WHO, who fear Iran may be under-reporting the number of cases now affecting it. South Korea has also reported a \u201ccritical moment\u201d in its battle against transmission, after 813 new cases were detected in the country in a single day, while the Japanese island of Hokkaido announced a three-week state of emergency, part of a number of measures to slow the outbreak. \u2022 The main image used on this article was changed on 2 March 2020 to more accurately reflect the text.",

He took delight in mocking each of his Democratic rivals. \u201cWe\u2019ve got Sleepy Joe [Biden], we\u2019ve got Crazy Bernie [Sanders], we\u2019ve got Mini Mike [Bloomberg] but I think he\u2019s out of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was probably the worst debate performance in the history of presidential debates. \u201cIt just shows you can\u2019t buy an election. I mean, there\u2019s a point at which people say, \u2018You gotta bring the goods a little bit, too.\u2019\u201d Trump parodied Bloomberg\u2019s height by crouching behind the lectern and the crowd went wild, laughing ecstatically and chanting: \u201cFour more years! Four more years!\u201d The president said: \u201cWe hit a nerve!\u201d He also took a swipe at Biden, the former vice-president, for a gaffe in a recent debate: \u201cDid he just say that we killed 150 million people? That\u2019s half of our population.\u201d Trump even held an instant poll by asking the audience to \u201cscream\u201d for whether he would beat Biden or Sanders more easily. There was a significant scream for Biden but a much louder and sustained one for the democratic socialist senator from Vermont. Trump suggested Biden would be \u201csitting in a home\u201d for the elderly rather than governing, whereas Sanders might be a communist. That chimed with the conference\u2019s theme: \u201cAmerica vs socialism\u201d. Of the Democrats, Trump warned darkly: \u201cThey want to take away your money, take away your choice, take away your speech, take away your guns, take away your religion, take away your history, take away your future and ultimately take away your freedom. But we will never let them do that.\u201d In a characteristically rambling monologue, he seemed genuinely unable to comprehend how teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg beat him to the precious title of Time magazine person of the year. But he finished his speech by hugging and kissing the flag \u2013 a familiar move which elicited a huge cheer from his devoted subjects. For them, and for Trump\u2019s loyal courtiers at the White House and on Capitol Hill, it is a case of long live the king.",

Amid attacks over budget cuts to epidemic defences as his administration asked Congress for funding to address coronavirus, Trump\u2019s decision to put Pence in charge of US response has also met with criticism. Republicans and supporters of Trump have fired back, accusing the president\u2019s opponents and the media of seeking political gain. On Friday Donald Trump Jr told Fox News Democrats had reached a \u201cnew level of sickness\u201d and wanted to see coronavirus kill \u201cmillions of people\u201d. That night, Trump said: \u201cWe are doing everything in our power to keep the infection and those carrying the infection from entering the country. We have no choice.\u201d He also sought without offering evidence to tie coronavirus cases in the US to the southern border, the focus of his hardline immigration policy. \u201cWhether it\u2019s the virus that we\u2019re talking about,\u201d Trump said, \u201cor the many other public health threats, the Democrat policy of open borders is a direct threat to the health and wellbeing of all Americans.\u201d At the White House on Saturday, Trump said the administration was not seriously considering closing the border with Mexico.",
