We have a confusion of \u201covercrowding\u201d standards in housing law and even the latest minimum standards for licensing of houses in multiple occupation originated in the 1930s \u2013 is 10.22 square metres really adequate for two people to live and sleep in as their permanent home? We need an overhaul of these standards that must recognise the adverse health effects of lack of space and crowding, including the spread of infectious diseases, unintentional injuries and mental ill health.</p> <p>Prof Gabriel Scally, quoted in the article, is right: the housing market has led to the modern equivalent of the Victorian slums that the new diseases will just love.

Along with many others who have regarded Johnson\u2019s elevation with concern for the future of this country, I am glad that he is recovering from his brush with Covid-19.

We have a confusion of \u201covercrowding\u201d standards in housing law and even the latest minimum standards for licensing of houses in multiple occupation originated in the 1930s \u2013 is 10.22 square metres really adequate for two people to live and sleep in as their permanent home? We need an overhaul of these standards that must recognise the adverse health effects of lack of space and crowding, including the spread of infectious diseases, unintentional injuries and mental ill health. Prof Gabriel Scally, quoted in the article, is right: the housing market has led to the modern equivalent of the Victorian slums that the new diseases will just love. At the same time, we build the smallest new homes in Europe, so we are storing up problems for the future. Dr Stephen Battersby Surbiton, Surrey Toby Helm quotes a fellow journalist in his article on \u201cBoris Johnson\u2019s darkest hour\u201d (Focus) as saying that the PM \u201calways seemed to regard being ill as a form of moral weakness\u201d. Along with many others who have regarded Johnson\u2019s elevation with concern for the future of this country, I am glad that he is recovering from his brush with Covid-19. But his attitude to illness, and the sense of invulnerability with which he appears to have been imbued, would help to explain the cavalier way in which he conducted himself immediately before his positive test for the virus, engaging widely with people from whom a safe distance should have been kept.

      "body": "<p>Last week, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-berkshire-52309654\">Dr Peter Tun died</a> from coronavirus at the Royal Berkshire hospital in Reading, where he had worked for more than 20 years. His son has reported that he had complained about personal protective equipment (PPE) being reallocated from the ward on which he worked and that at least four patients on that ward later tested positive for Covid-19. \u201cThe thought that if only he had a proper protective mask, he might still have been able to enjoy his hard-earned retirement after a lifetime of service just kills me,\u201d<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelTun1/status/1250676186159681536?s=20\"> his son said</a> on Thursday.</p> <p>It should haunt us all. Tun is one of at least 55 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/doctors-nurses-porters-volunteers-the-uk-health-workers-who-have-died-from-covid-19\">people working in the NHS who have lost their lives</a> to Covid-19; the true number is likely to be higher, and the number that includes care home and homecare staff even greater still. Every day, medical staff report having to work without adequate protective equipment that would minimise the risk to other patients and to themselves and their families. And on Friday night, it became apparent that Public Health England guidance that stipulates the protective equipment doctors and nurses need to wear when treating patients with Covid-19 has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/nhs-staff-to-be-asked-to-treat-coronavirus-patients-without-gowns\">watered down</a> in the face of national shortages. Staff are now being told to wear flimsy plastic aprons in place of full-length waterproof gowns when the latter run out, a situation many NHS trusts are expected to face this weekend.</p> <p>There are global shortages of PPE, most of which is sourced from countries such as China, where production has dramatically slowed as a result of the lockdown there. This means that ensuring an adequate supply would always have required finding ways to kickstart domestic production as well as coordinating with other countries to try to expand global production, rather than simply competing for scarce supplies on the open market. There is little evidence that this has been happening behind the scenes and there are few signs that lessons have been learned from other serious errors that the government has made in responding to this pandemic, from its hapless efforts to get extra ventilators manufactured to its slow-off-the-mark attempts to expand testing capacity.</p> <h2>Missed opportunities</h2> <p>Coronavirus is without doubt the biggest logistical challenge our government has faced in decades. No government would get everything right; making some mistakes in a highly pressured and uncertain environment is perhaps inevitable. But there is growing evidence that the British government has made unforced errors that have cost lives. And that, perhaps most critically, there is not much to suggest that ministers are learning from these mistakes in real time, in order to save lives in the future.</p> <p>There is much to comment on in terms of the lack of preparedness for a pandemic that was <a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/expert-advice-government-pandemics\">predicted by experts </a>and rated as a high risk by the government. In particular, 10 years of underfunding have left the NHS and care services struggling to meet normal levels of demand, let alone with any excess capacity to help them cope with an extraordinary outbreak. We are today paying the price for this disregard of very real threats to our national wellbeing and the cutting back of core public services to the bone.</p> <p>We cannot turn the clock back now, but it is absolutely right to ask whether the government is learning from the mistakes it has made so far. There have been some real successes. The herculean expansion in critical care capacity that has taken place with the new NHS Nightingale hospitals has been extraordinary. The stay-at-home messaging has encouraged people to respect social distancing and has played a part in bringing down infection rates to the extent that much of that capacity has not yet had to be used.</p> <p>But there have also been serious, and avoidable, errors. Hindsight makes the decision to ignore World Health Organization advice to test and trace all coronavirus cases, and to delay the imposition of social distancing in the absence of testing and tracing, look even more ill judged than it did at the time. The call-out to the private sector for the production of extra ventilators was only made in mid-March. It has emerged that the government prioritised the production of ventilators built to new specifications rather than existing models and that these specifications were simply inadequate for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. In the meantime, existing British companies that supply and produce ventilators reported that they got in touch with government to offer their support, only to be ignored, while the government missed opportunities to take part in an EU procurement scheme. The <em>Financial Times</em> has reported that, of the two consortiums selected to produce ventilators according to new specifications, one has ended the project and the other has paused it.</p> <p>There have also been delays around building up testing capacity. And domestic textiles companies report that they have contacted government offering to produce personal protective equipment, but that, as with ventilators, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/apr/16/government-ignores-uk-textiles-firms-desperate-to-make-ppe\">no one has been in touch</a>. It should have been clear from the start that insufficient global supplies would have always meant that the government would have to find a way of working with the private sector here to produce this lifesaving equipment and it is far less complex a product than ventilators. Why the delay? Why did ministers and officials not learn from their mistakes rather than repeatedly asserting there were no problems with supply in recent weeks?</p> <h2>Testing, testing, testing</h2> <p>These questions cannot be reserved for a post-hoc inquiry.

      "bodyText": "Last week, Dr Peter Tun died from coronavirus at the Royal Berkshire hospital in Reading, where he had worked for more than 20 years. His son has reported that he had complained about personal protective equipment (PPE) being reallocated from the ward on which he worked and that at least four patients on that ward later tested positive for Covid-19. \u201cThe thought that if only he had a proper protective mask, he might still have been able to enjoy his hard-earned retirement after a lifetime of service just kills me,\u201d his son said on Thursday. It should haunt us all. Tun is one of at least 55 people working in the NHS who have lost their lives to Covid-19; the true number is likely to be higher, and the number that includes care home and homecare staff even greater still. Every day, medical staff report having to work without adequate protective equipment that would minimise the risk to other patients and to themselves and their families. And on Friday night, it became apparent that Public Health England guidance that stipulates the protective equipment doctors and nurses need to wear when treating patients with Covid-19 has been watered down in the face of national shortages. Staff are now being told to wear flimsy plastic aprons in place of full-length waterproof gowns when the latter run out, a situation many NHS trusts are expected to face this weekend. There are global shortages of PPE, most of which is sourced from countries such as China, where production has dramatically slowed as a result of the lockdown there. This means that ensuring an adequate supply would always have required finding ways to kickstart domestic production as well as coordinating with other countries to try to expand global production, rather than simply competing for scarce supplies on the open market. There is little evidence that this has been happening behind the scenes and there are few signs that lessons have been learned from other serious errors that the government has made in responding to this pandemic, from its hapless efforts to get extra ventilators manufactured to its slow-off-the-mark attempts to expand testing capacity. Missed opportunities Coronavirus is without doubt the biggest logistical challenge our government has faced in decades. No government would get everything right; making some mistakes in a highly pressured and uncertain environment is perhaps inevitable. But there is growing evidence that the British government has made unforced errors that have cost lives. And that, perhaps most critically, there is not much to suggest that ministers are learning from these mistakes in real time, in order to save lives in the future. There is much to comment on in terms of the lack of preparedness for a pandemic that was predicted by experts and rated as a high risk by the government. In particular, 10 years of underfunding have left the NHS and care services struggling to meet normal levels of demand, let alone with any excess capacity to help them cope with an extraordinary outbreak. We are today paying the price for this disregard of very real threats to our national wellbeing and the cutting back of core public services to the bone. We cannot turn the clock back now, but it is absolutely right to ask whether the government is learning from the mistakes it has made so far. There have been some real successes. The herculean expansion in critical care capacity that has taken place with the new NHS Nightingale hospitals has been extraordinary. The stay-at-home messaging has encouraged people to respect social distancing and has played a part in bringing down infection rates to the extent that much of that capacity has not yet had to be used. But there have also been serious, and avoidable, errors. Hindsight makes the decision to ignore World Health Organization advice to test and trace all coronavirus cases, and to delay the imposition of social distancing in the absence of testing and tracing, look even more ill judged than it did at the time. The call-out to the private sector for the production of extra ventilators was only made in mid-March. It has emerged that the government prioritised the production of ventilators built to new specifications rather than existing models and that these specifications were simply inadequate for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. In the meantime, existing British companies that supply and produce ventilators reported that they got in touch with government to offer their support, only to be ignored, while the government missed opportunities to take part in an EU procurement scheme. The Financial Times has reported that, of the two consortiums selected to produce ventilators according to new specifications, one has ended the project and the other has paused it. There have also been delays around building up testing capacity. And domestic textiles companies report that they have contacted government offering to produce personal protective equipment, but that, as with ventilators, no one has been in touch. It should have been clear from the start that insufficient global supplies would have always meant that the government would have to find a way of working with the private sector here to produce this lifesaving equipment and it is far less complex a product than ventilators. Why the delay? Why did ministers and officials not learn from their mistakes rather than repeatedly asserting there were no problems with supply in recent weeks? Testing, testing, testing These questions cannot be reserved for a post-hoc inquiry. Answering them in real time can help save lives today. In a month, will we hear from another son or daughter sharing their anguish that they will live forever with the knowledge that a parent\u2019s life might have been saved if only they had the right protective equipment? Moreover, improving the effectiveness of the government\u2019s response is key to the ability to safely relax some \u2013 though not all \u2013 aspects of social distancing. Mass production of a vaccine or of effective treatments that can reduce the mortality rate of the virus are, at the very least, months away. The experiences of places such as South Korea and Hong Kong, which have been able to take a more relaxed approach to social distancing while keeping infection rates lower, suggest that there are ways to ease the burden before then, without putting lives at risk. If that is possible, it is imperative to do so; the longer it goes on, the worse an impact this lockdown will have on people\u2019s physical, mental and economic wellbeing. But it will be entirely dependent on a huge expansion in the capacity to test and trace contacts in order to prevent any relaxation of social distancing creating another rise in infection and, ultimately, death rates. The government has pledged to increase testing capacity to 100,000 a day in less than two weeks\u2019 time. But its track record to date does not inspire confidence \u2013 it has missed previous targets and is testing at fewer than 20,000 a day currently.

On contact tracing, the experience of countries that have done this successfully, such as Singapore, suggest that apps are insufficient alone; they can only be used to support teams of contact tracers and effective plans to get people who are at risk of exposure to observe a strict quarantine, including from others in their household. Yet it would appear that the government has placed far too much emphasis on technology-based solutions, which are already unravelling, and not enough on building up teams of contact tracers, for example, from the thousands of environmental health officers who already work for local authorities.

None of this seems to bother conservative Republicans, who believe all such relief creates what\u2019s called \u201cmoral hazard\u201d \u2013 the risk that government benefits will allow people to slack off. The Republican senator Lindsey Graham, for example, says state unemployment offices are overwhelmed because the extra $600 is \u201cincentivizing people to leave the workforce\u201d. Hello? When it comes to big corporations and their CEOs, however, conservatives don\u2019t worry about moral hazard. They should. Before the coronavirus outbreak, corporations were borrowing money like mad, capitalizing on the Fed\u2019s bargain-basement interest rates. Total business debt topped $16tn last year. Corporations used much of this debt to buy back their own shares of stock. This raised the earnings of each remaining share, creating a bonanza for big investors and top executives. Trump never tired of pointing out how spectacularly stocks had risen on his watch. But he neglected to mention those stocks were floating on a rising sea of corporate debt \u2013 which left corporate America dangerously unprepared for any sharp downturn. Then came Covid-19 and the sharpest downturn on record. American corporations spent $730bn on buybacks last year and more than $370bn this year before the virus, much of it financed by debt. If they hadn\u2019t frittered away that trillion or so dollars, they\u2019d be better able to cope with this emergency. Over the past five years, four big airlines and the aerospace giant Boeing spent more than $70bn buying back their own stock, putting them deep in debt. If they hadn\u2019t binged on buybacks, they\u2019d be better equipped to weather this storm. No worries. Government is bailing them out, just as it did the Wall Street banks that exploded in 2008.

But by saving the backsides of big corporations and their CEOs, the bailouts have rewarded corporate America\u2019s obsession with short-term profits regardless of longer-term risks to the corporation, its employees, and the overall economy. Why is moral hazard a problem when it comes to millions of jobless Americans who can\u2019t even collect $600 in unemployment benefits, but not a problem when it comes to CEOs who have borrowed to the hilt, used the money to artificially boost share prices, and pocketed $20m a year? Giving the vast majority of Americans a bit more cushion against the downside risks they face surely poses less harm than giving CEOs a cushion against the risks they take with the entire economy. It\u2019s not too late for the Fed and the treasury to take shares of stock in every corporation that gets bailed out. This way, CEOs and big investors aren\u2019t rewarded for binging on debt to finance stock buybacks. The public gets in on the upside of any eventual recovery.

      "body": "<p>Doctors and nurses treating Covid-19 patients face shortages of protective full-length gowns for weeks to come, it has emerged, as anger builds over the failure to stockpile the garments.</p> <p>Critical shortages of the gowns have meant that some trusts have already had to make do with the best available alternatives as a result of the shortages, which forced a sudden change in Public Health England (PHE) guidelines on the use of gowns on Friday. Concerns are being raised within the NHS over why the gowns did not form part of the government\u2019s pandemic stockpile.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/nhs-staff-to-be-asked-to-treat-coronavirus-patients-without-gowns\">NHS staff told 'wear aprons' as protective gowns run out</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is understood shortages are already forcing some NHS workers to use the controversial new guidelines, which tell them to wear a plastic apron with coveralls should the specialist fluid-repellent gowns run out. Workers are also advised to reuse washed aprons.</p> <p>Meanwhile, surgeons are being told by senior colleagues not to put themselves at risk should they be unable to wear a protective gown. Professor Neil Mortensen, from the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said surgeons should not risk their health if fluid-repellent gowns or coveralls could not be used. \u201cWe are deeply disturbed by this latest change to personal protective equipment (PPE) guidance, which was issued without consulting expert medical bodies,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter weeks of working with PHE and our sister medical royal colleges to get PPE guidance right, this risks confusion and variation in practice across the country.\u201d</p> <p>Health unions warned that staff could begin to refuse to work if they felt the new guidelines put them at serious risk of contracting the coronavirus. Sara Gorton, Unison\u2019s head of health, said: \u201cManagers must be truly honest with health workers and their union reps over the weekend. If gowns run out, staff in high-risk areas may well decide that it\u2019s no longer safe for them to work.\u201d</p> <p>Last night, the British Medical Association (BMA) also warned that it would support doctors who refused to work with inadequate PPE.</p> <p>\u201cThere are limits to the level of risk staff can be expected to expose themselves and their patients to,\u201d said Dr Chaand Nagpaul, BMA council chair. \u201cIn the most extreme circumstances, if adequate protective measures are not in place, doctors can refuse to put themselves at risk of becoming infected, and inform their management to make alternative arrangements, and the BMA will robustly support its members who have to make this weighty decision.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4eb95035b814215728d6879bf76805c401bd59d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4eb95035b814215728d6879bf76805c401bd59d5/0_0_1959_1625/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Hancock\" width=\"1000\" height=\"830\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">GMB union says trust in Matt Hancock is \u2018draining away\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Parsons/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Niall Dickson, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents various service providers within the NHS, said: \u201cOnce the weekend is over, you still have the same problem. It is not just hand to mouth in the hospitals. It is hand to mouth at the national level. Although we may get through this weekend, there may well be problems over the next few weeks.\u201d</p> <p>The anger over the revised safety advice comes after weeks of wrangling and delays over PPE for both NHS and care workers. Ministers have repeatedly attempted to grip the issue, but have been hampered by a global shortage and bottlenecks, with equipment ordered weeks ago still not arriving in full.</p> <p>The government will attempt to gain control of the mounting PPE concerns by appointing Paul Deighton, the former chief executive of the London Olympics organising committee, to lead efforts to produce PPE for frontline health and social care staff in Britain. A military flight was also understood to be bringing in 84 tonnes of PPE equipment from Turkey, though it was unclear what the shipment contained.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/uk-missed-three-chances-to-join-eu-scheme-to-bulk-buy-ppe\">UK missed three chances to join EU scheme to bulk-buy PPE</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The GMB union, which represents some NHS and ambulance staff, said trust in health secretary Matt Hancock was \u201cdraining away\u201d after the decision to change official guidance. It also questioned the government\u2019s assertion that the guidance was in line with the World Health Organization\u2019s recommendations.</p> <p>Saffron Cordery, the deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals trusts, said the situation was now \u201ccritical and this is an extremely worrying situation\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Doctors and nurses treating Covid-19 patients face shortages of protective full-length gowns for weeks to come, it has emerged, as anger builds over the failure to stockpile the garments. Critical shortages of the gowns have meant that some trusts have already had to make do with the best available alternatives as a result of the shortages, which forced a sudden change in Public Health England (PHE) guidelines on the use of gowns on Friday. Concerns are being raised within the NHS over why the gowns did not form part of the government\u2019s pandemic stockpile. It is understood shortages are already forcing some NHS workers to use the controversial new guidelines, which tell them to wear a plastic apron with coveralls should the specialist fluid-repellent gowns run out. Workers are also advised to reuse washed aprons. Meanwhile, surgeons are being told by senior colleagues not to put themselves at risk should they be unable to wear a protective gown. Professor Neil Mortensen, from the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said surgeons should not risk their health if fluid-repellent gowns or coveralls could not be used. \u201cWe are deeply disturbed by this latest change to personal protective equipment (PPE) guidance, which was issued without consulting expert medical bodies,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter weeks of working with PHE and our sister medical royal colleges to get PPE guidance right, this risks confusion and variation in practice across the country.\u201d Health unions warned that staff could begin to refuse to work if they felt the new guidelines put them at serious risk of contracting the coronavirus. Sara Gorton, Unison\u2019s head of health, said: \u201cManagers must be truly honest with health workers and their union reps over the weekend. If gowns run out, staff in high-risk areas may well decide that it\u2019s no longer safe for them to work.\u201d Last night, the British Medical Association (BMA) also warned that it would support doctors who refused to work with inadequate PPE. \u201cThere are limits to the level of risk staff can be expected to expose themselves and their patients to,\u201d said Dr Chaand Nagpaul, BMA council chair. \u201cIn the most extreme circumstances, if adequate protective measures are not in place, doctors can refuse to put themselves at risk of becoming infected, and inform their management to make alternative arrangements, and the BMA will robustly support its members who have to make this weighty decision.\u201d Niall Dickson, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents various service providers within the NHS, said: \u201cOnce the weekend is over, you still have the same problem. It is not just hand to mouth in the hospitals. It is hand to mouth at the national level. Although we may get through this weekend, there may well be problems over the next few weeks.\u201d The anger over the revised safety advice comes after weeks of wrangling and delays over PPE for both NHS and care workers. Ministers have repeatedly attempted to grip the issue, but have been hampered by a global shortage and bottlenecks, with equipment ordered weeks ago still not arriving in full. The government will attempt to gain control of the mounting PPE concerns by appointing Paul Deighton, the former chief executive of the London Olympics organising committee, to lead efforts to produce PPE for frontline health and social care staff in Britain. A military flight was also understood to be bringing in 84 tonnes of PPE equipment from Turkey, though it was unclear what the shipment contained. The GMB union, which represents some NHS and ambulance staff, said trust in health secretary Matt Hancock was \u201cdraining away\u201d after the decision to change official guidance. It also questioned the government\u2019s assertion that the guidance was in line with the World Health Organization\u2019s recommendations. Saffron Cordery, the deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals trusts, said the situation was now \u201ccritical and this is an extremely worrying situation\u201d. She added: \u201cWe all hope that this temporary disruption to supply will be short-lived and that the gowns that were ordered a long time ago, and should have already arrived, start arriving consistently and reliably rather than in the current fits and starts.\u201d Government sources said that everything was being done to ensure PPE supplies were flowing, adding that there is huge global demand. They added that the government\u2019s stockpiles were designed to tackle a flu pandemic and that the specific requirements of treating Covid-19 \u2013 a new virus \u2013 could not have been predicted. A spokesperson said the new guidance had been reviewed by the Health and Safety Executive and was in line with the WHO. They said the guidelines would only be needed \u201cin exceptional circumstances\u201d. PPE issues also persist in the social care sector. Ministers have now put in place new plans to boost testing and PPE for care workers, but some care providers said their staff had been told to make trips of up to 90 miles to the nearest testing centre \u2013 practically impossible for those without a car.

Anglicare has also sought to bring more staff on site to ensure care for all residents.",

      "body": "<p>It was noticeable from the initial outbreak in Wuhan that Covid-19 was killing more men than women. By February, <a href=\"http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/en/article/id/e53946e2-c6c4-41e9-9a9b-fea8db1a8f51\">data from China</a>, which involved 44,672 confirmed cases of the respiratory disease, revealed the death rate for men was 2.8%, compared to 1.7% among women. For past respiratory epidemics, including Sars, Mers and the 1918 Spanish flu, men were also at significantly greater risk. But why?</p> <p>Much of the reason for the Covid-19 disparity was put down to men\u2019s riskier behaviours \u2013 around half of Chinese men are smokers, compared with just 3% of women, for instance. But as the coronavirus has spread globally, it\u2019s proved deadlier to men everywhere that data exists (the UK and US notably \u2013 and questionably \u2013 do not collect sex-disaggregated data). Italy, for instance, has had a case fatality rate of 10.6% for men, versus 6% for women, whereas the sex disparity for smoking (<a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2002032\">now</a><a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2002032\"> a known risk factor</a>) is smaller there than China \u2013 28% of men and 19% of women smoke. In Spain, twice as many men as women have died. Smoking, then, is unlikely to account for all of the sex disparity in Covid-19 deaths.</p> <p>Age and co-morbidity (pre-existing health conditions, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease or cancer) are the biggest risk factors, and that describes more older men than women. There may also be a sex difference in how people fight infection, due to immunological or hormonal differences \u2013 oestrogen is shown to increase the antiviral response of immune cells.</p> <p>If women are mounting a more effective immune response to Covid-19, it could be because many of the genes that regulate the immune system are encoded on the X chromosome. Everybody gets one X chromosome at conception from their mother. However, sex is determined (for the vast majority) by the chromosome received from their father: females get an additional X, whereas males do not (they receive a Y). According to <em>The Better Half</em> by American physician Sharon Moalem, having this second X chromosome gives women an immunological advantage. Every cell in a woman\u2019s body has twice the number of X chromosomes as a man\u2019s, and so twice the number of genes that can be called upon to regulate her immune response, he says. Only one of the X chromosomes in each cell will be active at any time, but having that diversity of options gives women a better immunological toolbox to fight infections.</p> <p>Moalem describes the possession of XX chromosomes as \u201cfemale genetic superiority\u201d. In the case of Covid-19, for instance, the virus uses <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/new-study-sheds-light-on-coronavirus-infection-mechanism\">its spike protein</a> as a key to \u201cunlock\u201d a receptor protein on the outside of our human cells, called ACE-2, and gain entry. As the ACE-2 protein is on the X chromosome, men will have identical versions of ACE-2 on all their cells \u2013 if the virus can unlock one, it can unlock all, he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sharonmoalem/status/1246092130763837440\">wrote recently in a Twitter thread</a>. Women, though, have two different ACE-2 genes on their two X chromosomes, which may make it harder for the Covid-19 virus to break into all their cells, as it has to unlock two different proteins. Furthermore, once the ACE-2 is \u201cunlocked\u201d, it cannot perform its function, which, in the case of lung cells, is to clear fluid buildup during infection. So males, with all of their ACE-2 proteins affected, will suffer this more than females, he says. Moalem believes this may be \u201cthe crucial advantage\u201d that XX-carrying women have over XY-carrying men in Covid-19 infection mortality.</p> <p>It\u2019s an intriguing theory, and in his provocative book (written before the Covid-19 outbreak) Moalem expands the XX advantage to explain a whole range of life factors, from women\u2019s increased longevity to their lesser incidence of autism. It is incontrovertible that women are far less likely to suffer from X-linked genetic disorders, which include everything from Hunter syndrome to colour-blindness, because they usually have an unaffected X chromosome to fall back on. Indeed, in the case of colour vision, Moalem posits that having a second X chromosome can give some women a \u201cvisual superpower\u201d, enabling them to see 100 times the usual colour range due to the extra diversity of receptors they carry on their multiple Xs.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is striking that Moalem barely references environmental and social factors in a book about sex differences in health outcomes</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>However, the evidence for other of Moalem\u2019s claims for the protective role of a second X chromosome, such as in autism spectrum disorders or behavioural traits, is less convincing. A broad range of genes play complex roles in the workings of the brain, and attributing a simple chromosomal relationship is brave. (It should be noted that Moalem authored the questionable <em>The DNA Restart: Unlock Your Personal Genetic Code to Eat for Your Genes, Lose Weight, and Reverse Ageing</em> in 2016.)</p> <p>Outside of inherited genetic disorders, such as haemophilia, most conditions are attributable to a range of factors, including cultural norms, behaviours and social and environmental aspects as well as a host of biological factors. For Covid-19, for instance, gender-based norms around smoking and hand-washing, collective or individualistic mindsets that affect compliance with social-distance requests, how polluted your city is, whether you are a caregiver, and poverty and nutrition level all play a part in determining your infection risk and disease outcome. And, as we\u2019ve seen, a range of co-morbidities increase risk \u2013 are they too made more likely by absence of a second X chromosome? In many cases, such as cancers and lung disease, Moalem believes so \u2013 a fascinating theory that surely deserves more study.</p> <p>It is striking, though, that Moalem barely references environmental and social factors in a book about sex differences in health outcomes. This is particularly problematic when discussing sex differences in the brain, given the history of prejudicial research in this area.

Moalem\u2019s point is that, just as women\u2019s discoveries have been ignored, so too has the importance of their second X chromosome. Even today, medical and pharmaceutical research <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/feb/23/truth-world-built-for-men-car-crashes\">overwhelmingly favours male subjects</a>, blinding us to knowledge that could lead to breakthroughs, and disadvantaging women who suffer inappropriate treatments and dosing.

      "bodyText": "It was noticeable from the initial outbreak in Wuhan that Covid-19 was killing more men than women. By February, data from China, which involved 44,672 confirmed cases of the respiratory disease, revealed the death rate for men was 2.8%, compared to 1.7% among women. For past respiratory epidemics, including Sars, Mers and the 1918 Spanish flu, men were also at significantly greater risk. But why? Much of the reason for the Covid-19 disparity was put down to men\u2019s riskier behaviours \u2013 around half of Chinese men are smokers, compared with just 3% of women, for instance. But as the coronavirus has spread globally, it\u2019s proved deadlier to men everywhere that data exists (the UK and US notably \u2013 and questionably \u2013 do not collect sex-disaggregated data). Italy, for instance, has had a case fatality rate of 10.6% for men, versus 6% for women, whereas the sex disparity for smoking (now a known risk factor) is smaller there than China \u2013 28% of men and 19% of women smoke. In Spain, twice as many men as women have died. Smoking, then, is unlikely to account for all of the sex disparity in Covid-19 deaths. Age and co-morbidity (pre-existing health conditions, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease or cancer) are the biggest risk factors, and that describes more older men than women. There may also be a sex difference in how people fight infection, due to immunological or hormonal differences \u2013 oestrogen is shown to increase the antiviral response of immune cells. If women are mounting a more effective immune response to Covid-19, it could be because many of the genes that regulate the immune system are encoded on the X chromosome. Everybody gets one X chromosome at conception from their mother. However, sex is determined (for the vast majority) by the chromosome received from their father: females get an additional X, whereas males do not (they receive a Y). According to The Better Half by American physician Sharon Moalem, having this second X chromosome gives women an immunological advantage. Every cell in a woman\u2019s body has twice the number of X chromosomes as a man\u2019s, and so twice the number of genes that can be called upon to regulate her immune response, he says. Only one of the X chromosomes in each cell will be active at any time, but having that diversity of options gives women a better immunological toolbox to fight infections.

      "body": "<p>Good evening, and welcome to our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Michael McGowan bringing you the main stories on Sunday 19 April.</p> \n<h2>Australia records two new Covid-19 deaths</h2> \n<p>The national death toll has risen to 71, after a 94-year-old<strong> </strong>New South Wales man who was a resident at the Newmarch House aged care facility in western Sydney, died. It is the second death from the aged care facility after a significant outbreak. There are now 39 cases from the facility, including 13 staff. A man in his 80s from Victoria also died overnight.</p> \n<h2>Government calls for global investigation</h2> \n<p>The foreign affairs minister, <strong>Marise Payne</strong>, has called for an independent international investigation into the spread of Covid-19. Payne says she does not think the World Health Organisation should run the investigation, saying she shares some of the concerns expressed by the US about the agency\u2019s handling of the pandemic. Payne, who was interviewed on ABC\u2019s Insiders program on Sunday morning, was also reluctant to answer questions about whether she \u201ctrusts\u201d China in terms of its response to the virus.</p> \n<h2>Elective surgery and IVF could resume within days</h2> \n<p>The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, said elective surgery and IVF could resume sooner than previously expected, thanks to an increase in personal protective equipment equipment available to Australia\u2019s healthcare system. Hunt also took a swipe at the World Health Organisation, saying its response to the crisis \u201cdidn\u2019t help the world\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Some Sydney eastern suburbs beaches to open</h2> \n<p>Beaches in some parts of the Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs will reopen from Monday. Randwick mayor Danny Said announced that Clovelly, Coogee and Maroubra beaches would reopen for exercise only. That means jogging on the sand, walking, swimming, surfing and other exercise activities will now be permitted. But ocean pools in Randwick council area will remain closed until further notice as they are subject to a public health order to close.

      "bodyText": "Good evening, and welcome to our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Michael McGowan bringing you the main stories on Sunday 19 April. Australia records two new Covid-19 deaths The national death toll has risen to 71, after a 94-year-old New South Wales man who was a resident at the Newmarch House aged care facility in western Sydney, died. It is the second death from the aged care facility after a significant outbreak. There are now 39 cases from the facility, including 13 staff. A man in his 80s from Victoria also died overnight. Government calls for global investigation The foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, has called for an independent international investigation into the spread of Covid-19. Payne says she does not think the World Health Organisation should run the investigation, saying she shares some of the concerns expressed by the US about the agency\u2019s handling of the pandemic. Payne, who was interviewed on ABC\u2019s Insiders program on Sunday morning, was also reluctant to answer questions about whether she \u201ctrusts\u201d China in terms of its response to the virus. Elective surgery and IVF could resume within days The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, said elective surgery and IVF could resume sooner than previously expected, thanks to an increase in personal protective equipment equipment available to Australia\u2019s healthcare system. Hunt also took a swipe at the World Health Organisation, saying its response to the crisis \u201cdidn\u2019t help the world\u201d. Some Sydney eastern suburbs beaches to open Beaches in some parts of the Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs will reopen from Monday. Randwick mayor Danny Said announced that Clovelly, Coogee and Maroubra beaches would reopen for exercise only. That means jogging on the sand, walking, swimming, surfing and other exercise activities will now be permitted. But ocean pools in Randwick council area will remain closed until further notice as they are subject to a public health order to close. Beaches in the neighbouring Waverley council area \u2013 Bondi, Tamarama and Bronte \u2013 remain closed for now. On Saturday Waverley mayor Paula Masselos said the area remained \u201ca hotspot for coronavirus cases and we have no intention of reopening our beaches at this time\u201d. $5,000 fines for spitting The New South Wales health minister, Brad Hazzard, announced anyone who spat on a worker could receive a $5,000 fine. It\u2019s an expansion of a previous decision to allow the fines for people who spat on health workers or police. Lives saved in NSW Brad Hazzard also said NSW had avoided some 700 deaths, based on projections during the peak of the outbreak.

He said: \u201cNo one, as far as I can see, has built it up from the bottom, depending on predicted demand. It\u2019s not an easy thing to do, but even looking at various scenarios would help.\u201d</p>",

If the epidemic is controlled, hundreds of thousands of lives could be saved, intensive care units will no longer be overloaded, and the effects of lockdown on mental ill-health and unemployment will end.\u201d It comes amid continuing doubts about how the government came to its testing target of 100,000 a day by the end of the month. Medical experts and scientists have suggested that it is both too big for the current demand from key workers who think they are infected, and too low to be useful for a mass \u201ctest and trace\u201d strategy to loosen the lockdown. Allan Wilson, president of the Institute of Biomedical Science (IBMS) which represents NHS lab staff and biomedical scientists, said there \u201cwas no evidence base\u201d to the figure. He said: \u201cNo one, as far as I can see, has built it up from the bottom, depending on predicted demand. It\u2019s not an easy thing to do, but even looking at various scenarios would help.\u201d",

It would be \u201can important part of the mix\u201d of loans and grants on offer to rescue firms, she said. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has suggested that a government guarantee for loans under \u00a325,000 might be the only way to circumvent standard bank credit checks. \u201cIs there a case [for 100% guarantees] for very small firms that account for quite a high volume of applications?

It is not known if the remaining 22,000 applicants have been rejected or are still waiting to find out how their application has fared. Last week shadow business secretary Ed Miliband urged the business secretary Alok Sharma to overhaul the Cbils loans scheme, or risk thousands of firms going under. Miliband recommended that Sharma and Sunak examine the Swiss model, which is based on a single government form that is used by all lenders, and is backed by a 100% government guarantee. At the time, business leaders were reticent to back Miliband\u2019s call, but over the last week the low level of applications and loan agreements has spurred them on to demand a rethink. They have also been joined by former chancellors George Osborne, Norman Lamont and Sajid Javid, who have called on Sunak to \u201ccut out the banks\u201d and move to 100% government-backed business loans.

The researchers estimate that almost 2 million jobs in the wholesale and retail industry (48% of the total) and 1.3 million jobs in hotels, pubs, restaurants and cafes (75% of the total) have disappeared, with a further 1 million being lost in the service sector. Modelling also suggests that 800,000 jobs in the non-compulsory educational sector have also gone, many of these in nurseries. Professor Matteo Richiardi, an expert on modelling labour markets who carried out the study, warned that whether the jobs are lost for ever depends on the duration of the lockdown. \u201cIf this is short, say a few months, the links between employers and employees of affected industries might not be severed, and individual careers might not suffer too much,\u201d he said. \u201cUnder a longer lockdown, losses of human capital and scarring effects will occur. The economy will still bounce back, but at a higher cost for individuals.\u201d Richiardi said the analysis confirms that a continued lockdown is economically unsustainable, a position that will force the government to find a way to get the country working again. \u201cThis is why we need to make the most out of the extra time the lockdown is buying us, and increase our capacity to trace and isolate new cases, especially asymptomatic cases, so that the economy can be restarted before a vaccine is ready.\u201d In the meantime, some sectors will need more help than others. \u201cWhat our results show is that the extra support available will be drained more by workers coming from some sectors than others,\u201d Richiardi said. \u201cThis, however, needs to be complemented with targeted industrial policy, by means of specific packages for badly hit sectors, such as retail and education.\u201d The threat to nurseries would be felt acutely across the economy, should they close permanently. Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance which represents nurseries and child minders, said the sector had faced significant financial challenges even before the emergence of Covid-19. \u201cThe sector is struggling to stay afloat, and many providers have had to take the decision to furlough staff \u2013 workers who are frequently singled out by the Low Pay Commission as some of the lowest earners in the country,\u201d he said. \u201cThe early years sector has played a crucial role in supporting key workers to go to work during the coronavirus crisis, but without serious financial support from the government, workers could lose their jobs as many providers could be forced to close.\u201d Richiardi called for the lockdown to be phased out across sectors and regions, and phased in again if needed, rather than switched on and off altogether. \u201cIn deciding which sectors should reopen first, epidemiological considerations should be given priority, exactly as epidemiological considerations led to the decisions to close down those sectors in the first place,\u201d he said. \u201cCountries that initially put the economy first, like the US, are not performing very well in the crisis, while countries where strong, early action took place, such as Taiwan, are experiencing reduced economic effects.\u201d A time of unprecedented crisis, he suggested could be met by only one response: \u201cWhen the free market is stopped, the state has to step in.\u201d",

But is it?</p> <p>For most of history, sport was seen as an indispensable building block of the good society. Plato regarded sport as essential in the development of the virtues, especially fortitude. Martial arts in Japan have long been celebrated as a means of both spiritual development and social ordering. In 19th-century Britain, sport became an instrument through which to teach the ruling class to rule and the working class to obey. It\u2019s only today, as the top layers of sport have been insufferably commercialised and turned into a mega-rich industry, that its moral and social significance has become obscured and it has become viewed primarily as a form of entertainment.</p> <p>Much of the historical discussion about sport has explored the moral and social significance of engaging in sporting activity. But what about watching sport? \u201cI fell in love with football as I was to later fall in love with women,\u201d Nick Hornby writes in <em>Fever Pitch</em>. \u201cSuddenly, inexplicably, uncritically, giving no thought to the pain or disruption it would bring with it.\u201d It\u2019s a wonderful account of fan obsession, almost to the point of derangement, something that many other fans would recognise.</p> <p>Supporting a team becomes a strand of who you are and is absorbed into your identity, turning, in Papineau\u2019s words, into one of \u201clife\u2019s projects\u201d. Whether political, cultural, sporting or personal, each such project helps give meaning to one\u2019s life.

Which is one of the reasons why Belarus football left me cold \u2013 I had no emotional attachment to any of the teams.</p> <p>Being a fan is, however, not just a personal obsession. It also draws you into a collective project with thousands of other fans. In many towns, from Barnsley to Sunderland, football clubs are often one of most important social institutions.

Police, politicians and sections of the media, most notably the <em>Sun</em>, scapegoated fans, inventing lurid stories about their behaviour and blaming them for the carnage.

      "body": "<p>More than half of social care workers putting their health at risk during the coronavirus outbreak are paid below the real cost of living, according to an analysis of their working conditions. Staff are also four times more likely to be on a zero-hours contract than the average worker.</p> <p>Many care workers and providers were continuing to experience <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/ppe-could-be-reused-as-last-resort-says-leaked-phe-document\">shortages of personal protective equipment</a> (PPE) and access to testing this weekend, amid concerns in local government over the extent of the pandemic. One estimate suggests that 5,300 people have died in care homes from Covid-19, dwarfing official estimates. <a href=\"http://www.careengland.org.uk/\">Care England</a>, an industry trade association, said the figure could be above 7,000 deaths.</p> <p>With care workers battling to help the vulnerable, there are renewed demands for a rethink of their pay. The <a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/what-happens-after-the-clapping-finishes\">Resolution Foundation think tank</a> said that about half of frontline care workers, some 1 million people, were paid less than the real living wage of \u00a310.75 an hour in London and \u00a39.30 an hour across the rest of Britain. The figure, set by the Living Wage Foundation, is based on everyday living costs in the UK. Among the lowest rung roles in private care companies in England, as many as 90% of workers were paid below the real living wage last year. Tens of thousands also appear to be being paid illegally below the national minimum wage.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Clapping is welcome, but care workers will value better pay and conditions even more</p> <footer> <cite>Resolution Foundation</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cClapping is welcome, but care workers will value better pay and conditions even more,\u201d the analysis states. \u201cBetter pay in care should have long been a priority given the vital role care workers play in protecting the vulnerable \u2013 delivering it now is the least we can do.\u201d</p> <p>There are also concerns that some care providers may not survive the crisis. Some are already being propped up by cash-strapped councils. In response, the government announced on Fridaythat councils across England <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/17/english-councils-set-for-1bn-bailout-coronavirus-ravages-finances\">will receive a further \u00a31.6bn</a> to deal with the immediate impacts of coronavirus, taking total pandemic funding to more than \u00a33.2bn.</p> <p>The impact of coronavirus in care, and especially care homes, remains unclear. The Office for National Statistics recorded 217 care home deaths from the virus by 3 April. However, <a href=\"https://www.laingbuisson.com/\">Laing Buisson</a>, a leading healthcare industry analysis company, said it estimated there had been 5,300 deaths in homes, based on calculations made after an industry survey. Government officials are working to improve the data, but warned that estimates risked causing alarm.</p> <p>A new coronavirus strategy for adult social care was published last week after outcries from care homes and other providers that they were struggling to deal with outbreaks and with PPE shortages and access to testing.

      "bodyText": "More than half of social care workers putting their health at risk during the coronavirus outbreak are paid below the real cost of living, according to an analysis of their working conditions. Staff are also four times more likely to be on a zero-hours contract than the average worker. Many care workers and providers were continuing to experience shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) and access to testing this weekend, amid concerns in local government over the extent of the pandemic. One estimate suggests that 5,300 people have died in care homes from Covid-19, dwarfing official estimates. Care England, an industry trade association, said the figure could be above 7,000 deaths. With care workers battling to help the vulnerable, there are renewed demands for a rethink of their pay. The Resolution Foundation think tank said that about half of frontline care workers, some 1 million people, were paid less than the real living wage of \u00a310.75 an hour in London and \u00a39.30 an hour across the rest of Britain. The figure, set by the Living Wage Foundation, is based on everyday living costs in the UK. Among the lowest rung roles in private care companies in England, as many as 90% of workers were paid below the real living wage last year. Tens of thousands also appear to be being paid illegally below the national minimum wage. \u201cClapping is welcome, but care workers will value better pay and conditions even more,\u201d the analysis states. \u201cBetter pay in care should have long been a priority given the vital role care workers play in protecting the vulnerable \u2013 delivering it now is the least we can do.\u201d There are also concerns that some care providers may not survive the crisis. Some are already being propped up by cash-strapped councils. In response, the government announced on Fridaythat councils across England will receive a further \u00a31.6bn to deal with the immediate impacts of coronavirus, taking total pandemic funding to more than \u00a33.2bn. The impact of coronavirus in care, and especially care homes, remains unclear. The Office for National Statistics recorded 217 care home deaths from the virus by 3 April. However, Laing Buisson, a leading healthcare industry analysis company, said it estimated there had been 5,300 deaths in homes, based on calculations made after an industry survey. Government officials are working to improve the data, but warned that estimates risked causing alarm. A new coronavirus strategy for adult social care was published last week after outcries from care homes and other providers that they were struggling to deal with outbreaks and with PPE shortages and access to testing. New systems are in place to distribute protective equipment, while access to testing has been widened. Liz Kendall, the shadow care minister, said: \u201cThe emerging crisis in our care homes must be a wake-up call for the government. Despite repeated claims it is clear ministers aren\u2019t getting enough protective equipment or testing to the frontline. Millions of elderly and disabled people, their families and care workers need to know exactly how and when the government will get a grip and prevent further lives being lost.\u201d Ian Hudspeth, chairman of the Local Government Association\u2019s community wellbeing board, said: \u201cSocial care as a whole has been desperately underfunded for decades and we have been consistently calling for a cross-party consensus on the future of care and how we pay for it, long before the coronavirus crisis.\u201d A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: \u201cOur adult social care action plan sets out how we are protecting workers by ramping up testing across the system for care workers and their families and we\u2019re ensuring millions of additional PPE items reach those on the frontline with local resilience forums identifying those most in need of more.\u201d",

Across all sectors, more than 53,000 jobs are vulnerable, out of about 94,000 in the area.</p> <p>Peter Lamb, the Labour leader of Crawley borough council, says airport workers live in up to one in four homes.

      "bodyText": "Elizabeth Laker received the email telling her she would be made redundant less than six weeks after discovering she was pregnant. \u201cIt took me a couple of days to respond to them. Being pregnant, my hormones were all over the place. I\u2019d done a lot of crying, I wasn\u2019t sure how we\u2019d keep a roof over our heads.\u201d The 26-year-old from Crawley, who worked in sales, is among thousands in the West Sussex town now facing financial hardship amid the coronavirus pandemic. As the health emergency mutates into an economic crash, with the country in lockdown, Crawley has been identified as being the town at highest risk of job losses in Britain. More than half of jobs here could be furloughed or lost, according to a report from the Centre for Cities thinktank. Dean Laker, Elizabeth\u2019s husband, has been furloughed under the government\u2019s coronavirus job retention scheme from his assistant store manager role at a retail outlet near Gatwick airport, the heart of the local economy. His reduced wages just about cover the rent and bills, while Elizabeth awaits her first universal credit payment. Elizabeth, who was told she was being made redundant because she had just been taken on, said it took her two days to apply for benefits after joining an online queue of more than 152,000 people. \u201cBefore this we were living quite comfortably. We had disposable money at the end of each month, but now we\u2019re left high and dry. I have no idea what to do.\u201d Far from the usual hive of activity, with planes taking off and landing almost every minute at Gatwick during peak times, Crawley has fallen quiet as Covid-19 spreads. People in face masks, standing two metres apart, queue outside food shops, but the town centre is otherwise eerily empty. In the shadow of Britain\u2019s second busiest airport, Crawley had the highest concentration of aviation jobs of 62 locations the Centre for Cities studied, putting it at heightened risk with global air traffic largely grounded. Across all sectors, more than 53,000 jobs are vulnerable, out of about 94,000 in the area. Peter Lamb, the Labour leader of Crawley borough council, says airport workers live in up to one in four homes. He fears such dependence on a single industry could turn the town into a modern, southern version of a northern mining or shipbuilding community during the 1980s, bereft of employment. The International Monetary Fund fears the worst global economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Britain\u2019s economy could shrink by 35% this spring, the government\u2019s independent economic forecaster has warned, with unemployment hitting more than 2 million by June. As a new town developed to move Londoners out of poor and bombed-out homes after the second world war, Crawley enjoyed relative prosperity for decades. Before Covid-19, average wages were higher and unemployment lower than the national average. Sitting in the empty town hall, a 1950s concrete monolith now under redevelopment, Lamb says a boom in air travel helped avoid industrial job losses in the 1980s. \u201cThere is simply no experience of trying to deal with mass unemployment. It was quite clear that we were going to be harder hit than almost anywhere else. Maybe now the problem will actually get a look-in from government.\u201d Replacing the normal taxis, cars and flustered families waving goodbye in a tangle of suitcases, a solitary police car watches over the drop-off point of Gatwick\u2019s north terminal, temporarily mothballed. The three-lane link road of the M23, recently widened to cope with 46 million annual passengers, is quiet, with only buzzards and hawks overhead. Instead of 55 planes an hour, as few as three will depart today. In normal times, Gatwick adds about \u00a32.3bn to Britain\u2019s economy each year. More than 250 firms employ 24,000 staff at duty-free shops, pubs, restaurants, car hire and bureaux de change. A further 20,000 work in the supply chain. Despite losing out to Heathrow on a new runway to boost Britain\u2019s airport capacity, Gatwick put in place expansion plans to create 20,000 jobs. Lamb fears they could be at risk. \u201cRight now, everything has ground to a halt.\u201d Tamara Butler, 22, worked as cabin crew for EasyJet at Gatwick, but resigned in February to take a job at a cosmetics company in the duty-free shopping area. Left with no job to go to as the crisis hit, she found work at a local Tesco, as one of an army of temps being taken on by supermarkets to cope with demand from families forced to stay home. \u201cYou don\u2019t really expect anything like this to happen in your lifetime, you can\u2019t be prepared for it. I\u2019m done with Brexit, then when you think you\u2019re over something \u2013 this comes along. If they don\u2019t make a film about 2020, I\u2019ll be shocked.\u201d Government bailouts for airlines have been mooted, including for Virgin Atlantic, based in Crawley. Butler\u2019s former employer, burning through \u00a340m a week as its planes sit idle, will benefit from a \u00a3600m government-backed loan. But pleas from Richard Branson, the owner of the Virgin empire, prompted a backlash over his tax status. Meanwhile EasyJet\u2019s owner, Stelios Haji-Ioannou, and his family received almost \u00a360m in dividends last month. Henry Smith, the Conservative MP for Crawley, said tough conditions must be attached to any bailouts. \u201cThere are certain airlines that might be British brands, but are significantly foreign-owned or by non-domiciled taxpayers, so there are some sensitive issues around that. I\u2019m not going to name names but I think you can guess.\u201d While his party has faced criticism for overseeing a decade of austerity - eroding the welfare safety net \u2013 he said unprecedented government support could help Britain to quickly recover. \u201cI sincerely hope it doesn\u2019t mean we are entering a period of austerity or renewed high taxation. I\u2019m hoping that we can come out of the immediate health emergency as soon as possible so that we can recover what is fundamentally a strong economy.\u201d",

They say it\u2019s very unfortunate, that they are investigating, and that it\u2019s a matter of the training personnel, but they will not acknowledge that presymptomatic or asymptomatic spread is a factor.\u201d<br><br>The agency\u2019s advice to those managing and working at nursing homes, like its policy towards coronavirus in general, has been based on its judgment that the \u201cspread from those without symptoms is responsible for a very limited share\u201d of those who get infected.<br><br>Its advice to the care workers and nurses looking after older people such as Bondesson\u2019s 69-year-old mother is that they should not wear protective masks or use other protective equipment unless they are dealing with a resident in the home they have reason to suspect is infected.<br><br>Otherwise the central protective measure in place is that staff should stay home if they detect any symptoms in themselves.<br><br>\u201cWhere I\u2019m working we don\u2019t have face masks at all, and we are working with the most vulnerable people of all,\u201d said one care home worker, who wanted to remain anonymous. \u201cWe don\u2019t have hand sanitiser, just soap. That\u2019s it. Everybody\u2019s concerned about it. We are all worried.\u201d<br><br>\u201cThe worst thing is that it is us, the staff, who are taking the infection in to the elderly,\u201d complained one nurse to Swedish public broadcaster SVT. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable that more of them haven\u2019t been infected. It\u2019s a scandal.\u201d<br><br>Einhorn was one of 22 researchers who on Tuesday called for Sweden\u2019s politicians to break with the country\u2019s tradition of entrusting policy to its expert agencies, and to seize control of Sweden\u2019s coronavirus strategy from the agency.</p> <p>She argues that the reason why Sweden has a much higher number of cases in care homes than in Norway and Finland is not because of the homes themselves, but because of Sweden\u2019s decision to keep schools and kindergartens open, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/as-the-rest-of-europe-lives-under-lockdown-sweden-keeps-calm-and-carries-on\">not to shut restaurants or bars</a>.<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s not like it goes from one old age home to another. It comes in separately to all of these old age homes, so there\u2019s no way it can be all be attributed to the personnel going in and working when they are sick. There\u2019s a basic system fault in their recommendations. There\u2019s no other explanation for it.\u201d</p> <p><br>Tegnell\u2019s colleague AnnaSara Carnahan on Friday told Sveriges Radio that the number of deaths reported from old people\u2019s homes was \u201cprobably an underestimate\u201d, as regional health infectious diseases units were reporting that many elderly who died were not being tested.<br><br>Bondesson\u2019s mother, who has dementia, is worried, he says. \u201cShe is aware of most things that you talk about, it\u2019s just that she might have bad short-term memory, on and off,\u201d he said. \u201cShe had also been questioning the lack of face masks. She thinks it\u2019s really sad to have to be there constantly for weeks and not to know when it\u2019s going to end.\u201d</p>",

The same day prime minister Stefan L\u00f6fven said that the country faced a \u201cserious situation\u201d in its old people\u2019s homes, announced efforts to step up protections, and ordered the country\u2019s health inspectorate to investigate. Lena Einhorn, a virologist who has been one of the leading domestic critics of Sweden\u2019s coronavirus policy, told the Observer that the government and the health agency were still resisting the most obvious explanations. \u201cThey have to admit that it\u2019s a huge failure, since they have said the whole time that their main aim has been to protect the elderly,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what is really strange is that they still do not acknowledge the likely route. They say it\u2019s very unfortunate, that they are investigating, and that it\u2019s a matter of the training personnel, but they will not acknowledge that presymptomatic or asymptomatic spread is a factor.\u201d The agency\u2019s advice to those managing and working at nursing homes, like its policy towards coronavirus in general, has been based on its judgment that the \u201cspread from those without symptoms is responsible for a very limited share\u201d of those who get infected. Its advice to the care workers and nurses looking after older people such as Bondesson\u2019s 69-year-old mother is that they should not wear protective masks or use other protective equipment unless they are dealing with a resident in the home they have reason to suspect is infected. Otherwise the central protective measure in place is that staff should stay home if they detect any symptoms in themselves. \u201cWhere I\u2019m working we don\u2019t have face masks at all, and we are working with the most vulnerable people of all,\u201d said one care home worker, who wanted to remain anonymous. \u201cWe don\u2019t have hand sanitiser, just soap. That\u2019s it. Everybody\u2019s concerned about it. We are all worried.\u201d \u201cThe worst thing is that it is us, the staff, who are taking the infection in to the elderly,\u201d complained one nurse to Swedish public broadcaster SVT. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable that more of them haven\u2019t been infected. It\u2019s a scandal.\u201d Einhorn was one of 22 researchers who on Tuesday called for Sweden\u2019s politicians to break with the country\u2019s tradition of entrusting policy to its expert agencies, and to seize control of Sweden\u2019s coronavirus strategy from the agency. She argues that the reason why Sweden has a much higher number of cases in care homes than in Norway and Finland is not because of the homes themselves, but because of Sweden\u2019s decision to keep schools and kindergartens open, and not to shut restaurants or bars. \u201cIt\u2019s not like it goes from one old age home to another. It comes in separately to all of these old age homes, so there\u2019s no way it can be all be attributed to the personnel going in and working when they are sick. There\u2019s a basic system fault in their recommendations. There\u2019s no other explanation for it.\u201d Tegnell\u2019s colleague AnnaSara Carnahan on Friday told Sveriges Radio that the number of deaths reported from old people\u2019s homes was \u201cprobably an underestimate\u201d, as regional health infectious diseases units were reporting that many elderly who died were not being tested. Bondesson\u2019s mother, who has dementia, is worried, he says. \u201cShe is aware of most things that you talk about, it\u2019s just that she might have bad short-term memory, on and off,\u201d he said. \u201cShe had also been questioning the lack of face masks. She thinks it\u2019s really sad to have to be there constantly for weeks and not to know when it\u2019s going to end.\u201d",

The chains, which asked not to be named, wanted to help solve the absence of refuge places as domestic violence soars. Jennifer Nadel, co-director of Compassion in Politics, described the government\u2019s response as \u201cfoot-dragging at its most unnecessary, irresponsible and lethal\u201d. The offer from two hotel chains and a hostel with tens of thousands of rooms comes as the National Domestic Abuse Helpline reports a 25% increase in calls since the lockdown began. Domestic abuse killings have trebled, with at least 16 suspected deaths compared with an average of five in the same period over the past decade. Campaigners say a written offer of hotel rooms was made earlier this month. On 9 April, the domestic abuse commissioner, Nicole Jacobs, and the victims commissioner for England and Wales, Dame Vera Baird, wrote to ministers stating: \u201cWe call on you to offer a hotel \u2026 free of charge, to women fleeing domestic abuse where they have been unable to access refuge.\u201d When the home secretary, Priti Patel, made an announcement on domestic violence last Saturday, she said: \u201cWhere a victim, and their children, do need to leave, we will ensure they have a safe place to go.

      "body": "<p>Hard as it is to imagine now, in the early part of last year there was a belief \u2013 somewhat desperately expressed \u2013 that a new politics might be possible in Britain. One not based on the two \u201clegacy\u201d parties, but that might be open to compromise, a certain fluidity of structure, pragmatism. The idea coalesced around a slogan, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/05/the-guardian-view-on-britains-broken-politics-a-peoples-assembly-can-heal-the-wounds\">politics is broken</a>\u201d. The question was, how to fix it.</p> <p>One solution was proposed by a breakaway group of MPs, eight from Labour, three from the Conservatives, whose new party \u2013 the cumbersomely named <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/independent-group-for-change\">Independent Group for Change</a> or Change UK \u2013 was accepted by the Electoral Commission 12 months ago this week. Both of the main parties were in disarray, propping up leaders for whom there was no love in parliament. The government had recently suffered the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/15/theresa-may-suffers-historic-defeat-as-tories-turn-against-her\">biggest defeat in parliamentary history</a> on the \u201cfirst meaningful vote\u201d on Theresa May\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/22/desperate-deluded-doomed-what-the-papers-say-on-mays-new-brexit-deal\">doomed Brexit deal</a>. If there was consensus on anything, it was that something had to give.</p> <p>At the time of the formation of the new party, <a href=\"https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/0pbqegswmo/TIG%20and%20centrism.pdf\">YouGov asked a poll question:</a> \u201cWould you say that British politics is working well or poorly at present?\u201d Eighty-two per cent of respondents said poorly. The poll suggested a number of possible remedies. The most popular, with 73% agreement, was: \u201cParties and politicians trying harder to work together and reach compromise.\u201d This finding was directly contradicted, however, by another solution: \u201cParties and politicians trying harder to stay true to their core beliefs\u201d (57%). It was in the space between these two demands that the new party was conceived, and in which it quickly floundered.</p> <p>In retrospect, the brief flame of the Independent Group \u2013 <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/02/28/what-does-public-think-independent-group\">this time last year 18% of voters said they would vote for it in a general election</a> \u2013 is illuminated by a few memorable images. There were, to begin with, the tentative speeches of the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/18/in-their-own-words-why-seven-mps-are-quitting-labour-independent-group\">magnificent seven</a>\u201d breakaway Labour MPs \u2013 Mike Gapes, Ann Coffey, Chris Leslie, Chuka Umunna, Gavin Shuker, Angela Smith, Luciana Berger \u2013 who stepped forward, one after the other, led by Berger, eight months pregnant, to offer heartfelt explanations why they could no longer be a part of a Corbyn Labour party. They were joined overnight by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/17/change-uk-joan-ryan-look-at-your-hands\">Joan Ryan</a>, then the following day by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/feb/20/joan-ryan-becomes-eighth-labour-mp-to-join-independent-group-politics-live\">three Conservative MPs</a> \u2013 Anna Soubry, Heidi Allen, Sarah Wollaston \u2013 who, naively as it turned out, dubbed themselves \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/20/who-are-the-three-tory-defectors\">the three amigos</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Certain collective pictures became memes. There was the photo opportunity in which all 11 stared up to the heavens as if the sky might be the limit. There was a selfie from an evening in which they gathered self-consciously for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/26/independent-group-nandos-photo\">a cheeky Nando\u2019s</a>, and Twitter pored over the signifiers (\u201cThe difference is the last supper only had one Judas\u201d). And there was the morning when they took their places together in the House of Commons, waving to potential comrades trying to avoid their eyes on either side of the aisle. The caption seemed to want to read: come on in, the water\u2019s lovely!</p> <p>In the last few weeks, I have been speaking to some of those who were at the heart of that rebellion, on and off the record, conversations that have emphasised that cliche of the past seeming like another country. My questions really, boiled down to one: did Change UK change anything?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ff38aea0ee1017e7196638a9b1c4585f945332b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ff38aea0ee1017e7196638a9b1c4585f945332b/0_0_3376_2250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Independent Group in Parliament, 20 February: bottom row, left to right: Luciana Berger, Heidi Allen, Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston, Ann Coffey; top row, left to right: Angela Smith, Chuka Umunna, Chris Leslie, and Gavin Shuker.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Independent Group in Parliament, 20 February: bottom row, left to right: Luciana Berger, Heidi Allen, Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston, Ann Coffey; top row, left to right: Angela Smith, Chuka Umunna, Chris Leslie, and Gavin Shuker.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Taylor/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Those who were keen to talk \u2013 and several were keener not to reopen that recent wound \u2013 dated the beginning of the party to way before last spring. Mike Gapes, 27 years a Labour MP, long-time chair of the Foreign Affairs select committee, said the start for him was back in 2015, when Jeremy Corbyn was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/12/jeremy-corbyn-wins-labour-party-leadership-election\">elected </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/12/jeremy-corbyn-wins-labour-party-leadership-election\">party leader</a>. At the time Gapes was recuperating after two months in hospital with a heart problem. Recovery influenced his desire above all to be true to himself. He agreed with Umunna, who says that by the beginning of 2018, it had long since become \u201cunconscionable to stand on a platform sponsoring someone to become our prime minister who I believed threatened our economic and national security\u201d.</p> <p>Anna Soubry, the Nottinghamshire MP who had become the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/05/peoples-vote-brexit-labour-party-anna-soubry\">firebrand voice</a> of the People\u2019s Vote on the Tory side, ascribes her motivation to the lies told in the name of the Vote Leave campaign. \u201cIt felt that anyone who refused to go along with a hideous populist agenda was just either ignored or howled down. We still need voices that say: Excuse me, that is not how we do things in this country!\u201d</p> <p>Gavin Shuker, who had represented his home constituency for nine years, dates the genesis to a meeting at the Luton Hoo hotel between himself and Gapes and Chris Leslie, the former shadow chancellor, at the beginning of 2018. \u201cIn the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/general-election-2017\">2017 general election</a>,\u201d he says, \u201cmany Labour MPs went around telling people on the doorstep that they could vote for us as candidates because there was no real danger of Corbyn getting in. We all knew he was completely unsuitable for office. My feeling was, after the result in 2017, that loophole was closed.\u201d</p> <p>At that meeting at Shuker\u2019s house it was discussed how plan A was still to fight and reclaim the Labour party. It was also agreed that there needed to be \u201csome people thinking what plan B might look like\u201d.</p> <p>Shuker had worked as an organiser in the church prior to entering parliament. He saw his role as \u201ccreating the psychological space\u201d in which people might leave the main parties. On this basis he started to have conversations over coffee with 40 or 50 disgruntled Labour MPs. Their responses ranged, he says, from \u201cThank goodness someone is saying it\u201d to \u201cI agree with everything you\u2019ve said, but I have five years to pay off my mortgage\u201d.</p> <p>Gapes, who had been in the trenches with Neil Kinnock \u201cfighting Trotskyists and tankies who wanted to take over the party\u201d in the days of Militant, now believed the coup had happened. He kept a little diary of his thoughts. \u201cThe questions that kept cropping up for me back then were,\u201d he says: \u201cDo you run away? Do you wait for them to come for you? Or do you do something to make a difference?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"05e0075b7804b0419158275df6308b5ca75cd569\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05e0075b7804b0419158275df6308b5ca75cd569/0_76_3966_2381/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rachel Johnson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rachel Johnson, the prime minister\u2019s sister, who stood for Change UK at the European elections last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The answer was made for him after he \u201cvented on a WhatsApp group of friends about antisemitism and some kind person gave that to the <em>Times</em>,\u201d he says. \u201cThe fact was, though, that all of us had our own reasons. For me it wasn\u2019t about Brexit. It was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/26/antisemitism-labour-everything-you-need-to-know\">antisemitism</a>, Corbyn\u2019s foreign policy, the deplorable comments about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/14/jeremy-corbyn-under-fire-over-response-to-pms-russia-statement\">Skripal poisoning</a>.\u201d</p> <p>At the same time that Shuker was sounding out Labour MPs, Chuka Umunna and Chris Leslie, who had shared an office at Westminster, were having conversations with likely Tory MPs. Brexit had fractured party loyalties. Umunna was not sure at that time how many Tories would join them. \u201cThey were two to three years behind Labour in being hijacked by an ugly populism \u2013 in their case, of the right \u2013 and it was hard to tell when that would happen, to what degree,\u201d he says. Several prominent Tory MPs told him \u201cthat they would hop on board\u201d if it looked like Change UK would succeed. \u201cBut this was a bit chicken and egg \u2013 unless a critical mass of MPs defected from the main parties and joined, it would not succeed.\u201d</p> <p>Soubry was among those to take the leap, partly on the understanding that Umunna would lead the new party. She saw Umunna as a potential prime minister. \u201cAbso-bloody-lutely,\u201d she says. \u201cI genuinely believed that.\u201d She spoke to a number of Tories about the idea of resigning the whip. Several wavered, but the two that eventually agreed were Wollaston and Allen.</p> <p>While the Brexit votes and debates were at loud-hailer volume within and outside Westminster, the commitment of various dissenters was being tested. A series of three clandestine meetings, two-day overnight gatherings, were organised by Shuker at a farm in East Sussex for the \u201c20 or so\u201d Labour MPs who were then seriously considering defection. The first time they all sat down for dinner, \u201cthere were people in tears around the table\u201d, Shuker says, as members discussed abandoning a lifelong commitment to the Labour movement.</p> <p>At the time the thinking was not to form a new party, Gapes says, at least not yet. \u201cWe thought of it in terms of trimesters,\u201d Shuker recalls. \u201cThe first trimester was the one we were in. The second would be as an independent parliamentary group, which would go on as long as possible while we agreed how to do the technicalities. The third would be as a political party, which meant that we would be judged by those standards. In the event, the second and third of those phases collapsed into each other and we obviously failed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f9001d69964782aa4def945898d7346c3b2228c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f9001d69964782aa4def945898d7346c3b2228c/0_270_5653_3394/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chuka Umunna on the doorsteps for the Lib Dems with Hugh Grant in December.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chuka Umunna on the doorsteps for the Lib Dems with Hugh Grant in December.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicola Tree/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That language of gestation was pointed. As Gapes observes, they had, in Berger\u2019s pregnancy, a very real deadline to make the change \u2013 it had to happen before she departed on maternity leave. \u201cThat helped to sharpen it,\u201d Shuker says, \u201cand in February a parting in the clouds emerged.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Chuka Umunna had the chance to take responsibility on more than one occasion and he chose not to do it</p> <footer> <cite>Anna Soubry</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Secrecy was paramount. \u201cI told my mother, a lifelong Labour member, that I was going to make a big announcement on TV, but I didn\u2019t tell her what it was,\u201d Gapes, 67, says. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell my brother, a lifelong trade union activist. Mainly because I didn\u2019t want anyone to talk me out of it.\u201d</p> <p>Those I spoke to can still just about recall the heady optimism of that moment of departure \u2013 hundreds of thousands of people signed up online as supporters, donations started flooding in. For Soubry, if there is one thing that changed everything, it was watching Luciana Berger stand up and be counted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3ff101db2ab077c89ef07dcb0fc3d2a0f23ce5d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ff101db2ab077c89ef07dcb0fc3d2a0f23ce5d2/1267_0_3931_4480/877.jpg\" alt=\"Luciana Berger\" width=\"877\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luciana Berger: allegedly \u2018hounded out\u2019 of the Labour party.

She still believes that things might have been different if the former Streatham MP had taken on the responsibility as promised. \u201cHe had the chance on more than one occasion and he chose not to do it,\u201d she says. She never had an explanation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/19/independent-group-for-change-party-disbanded\">Independent Group for Change to be disbanded</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Umunna rejects the idea that he reneged on any promises to lead, saying that the proper time to settle the question of leadership would have been in the autumn of 2019, once the group had a proper structure. Shuker puts that reluctance to take responsibility down to the planned progression of the trimesters. For the new group to get any traction, it needed as many defectors as possible. \u201cPeople would say, this sounds attractive, but I don\u2019t want to hitch my future to one person\u2019s vanity project,\u201d Shuker says. \u201cChuka is someone I respect and am still friends with. At one point I had to give him a list of 20 people who were telling me that they would not join a political party led by him, because they thought there should be a more collaborative process. A flatter structure.\u201d</p> <p>That flatter structure quickly came up against the Electoral Commission. The group reckoned they had maybe a one-in-five chance of becoming a real political force, but if there was an early election \u201cthey would probably be screwed\u201d. When the party formed it was far from clear that the UK would take part in the European elections planned for May \u2013 constitutionally it appeared absurd.</p> <p>When the EU insisted that in the absence of a Brexit deal Britain must take part, however, the group was forced drastically to accelerate its plans. \u201cWe had no organisation. No membership. No name,\u201d Gapes recalls. \u201cWe tried to register ourselves as the Independent Group and the Electoral Commission would not allow that. So we then became the Independent Group for Change Not ideal. We had a good logo, but that was rejected because it had a hashtag in it. And we imagined we could share the leadership, but the Electoral Commission insisted on us naming one leader.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Lib Dems set out to kill us and they ruthlessly did so \u2013 as they have done to others in the past</p> <footer> <cite>Mike Gapes</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Heidi Allen, the least experienced of the MPs involved, who had been selected for the safest of Tory seats in South Cambridgeshire in 2015, was installed as a compromise interim leader. \u201cHeidi had some great qualities,\u201d Gapes says, \u201cbut she was completely inexperienced as a campaigner.\u201d Having selected a list of 70 candidates from 3,500 applicants in a frenzied Easter weekend of interviews in a London hotel suite, there was immediate confusion about whether to collaborate with other parties. Acting on dubious promises of a united Remainer front, Gapes says, \u201cHeidi started telling people to vote tactically for the Greens or the Lib Dems. And of course the Lib Dems set out to kill us and they ruthlessly did so, as they have done to others in the past.\u201d</p> <p>Umunna suggests that he knew the writing was on the wall as soon as they had to fight the election, which was a \u201close-lose\u201d decision. Until then, he says: \u201cWe presented no threat, and even traditionally Tory-supporting media were favourable, because they admired the stand we had taken against Corbynism and the hard Brexiters. However, as soon as we registered as a party, the entire establishment \u2013 Labour and Tory \u2013 turned their fire on us.\u201d</p> <p>New parties might survive many things, Shuker suggests, but they cannot survive ridicule. \u201cThe ambition when we launched was to get to the end of the week without becoming a punchline. And we did that pretty well. But you get one shot at forming a political party and if you end up in the calamity that was the European election campaign, where we literally did become the punchline, there was no coming back from that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a058c2b84e7aa89119a3324b4ad2f6915f3c4081\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a058c2b84e7aa89119a3324b4ad2f6915f3c4081/0_172_4885_2931/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mike Gapes of Change UK\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Change UK\u2019s Mike Gapes speaking at a European election rally last April. Photograph: AFP/Getty</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The new ideals of consensual politics did not work in the heat of media scrutiny of a campaign. The street fighters in the group who had prevailed in marginal seats over the years came up against those who had a slightly dewy-eyed faith in a \u201cmovement\u201d in which things could be done differently. The split was generational as much as ideological. Soubry suggests that \u201cthose with deep experience of winning tough elections \u2013 Mike, Joan Ryan, Anne Coffey \u2013 were elbowed out a bit\u201d.</p> <p>Far from modelling a new politics, the group started to look like they had brought with them the ingrained habits of rats in a sack. \u201cThere were a lot of egos,\u201d Shuker says. \u201cAt one point I brought in FTSE 100 executive coaching to try to get the group to realise that the biggest threat we faced was holding on to the culture they had left behind. But then you found that some people could not resist going back to the old ways of anonymous briefing to the press and so on.\u201d</p> <p>Umunna puts those clashes down to the inability of some in the group, including himself, to understand the cultural difference between \u201cmaking the weather in one of the two main parties\u201d and \u201csurviving as a third force\u201d. The result of the European elections, in which the group polled 3.4% of the vote, was a fatal falling out, with old friends Umunna and Leslie on opposing sides. \u201cWe were a group of 11 that split into two taxis,\u201d Shuker says. \u201cWhich is a bit embarrassing.\u201d</p> <p>After the results came through, there was a showdown, Gapes says, between the six who wanted to close the party down \u2013 Ummuna, Allen, Berger, Smith, Shuker and Wollaston \u2013 and the other five older hands who thought they should battle on. Parliamentary politics after all was as fluid as it had ever been. \u201cBut the six decided no. There was no mention in any of that, of anyone joining the Lib Dems. None whatsoever,\u201d Gapes says. (That is not quite how Umunna remembers it, he says, in that he \u201cdidn\u2019t rule out\u201d the possibility.) Within weeks, all of those who left, apart from Shuker, joined the Liberal Democrats.</p> <p>Soubry became the reluctant leader of the remaining five. Over the following months, her most significant role in that capacity was to sit in on meetings that tried to resolve the impasse over Brexit. At one point in October, as prime minister Boris Johnson dissolved parliament and tried to keep open the idea of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/oct/28/boris-johnsons-election-vote-looms-as-eu-decides-on-brexit-delay-politics-live\">no deal</a>, it seemed likely that an interim government might form. \u201cBut the thought of me going back to my group and saying \u2018Right guys, the plan is we\u2019re going to rally behind Jeremy Corbyn\u2019 was never really going to happen,\u201d Soubry says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fdccea015c0c1f81d48743f5d02b4bf2fd96f752\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fdccea015c0c1f81d48743f5d02b4bf2fd96f752/1334_142_3193_3192/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anna Soubry pictured in September 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anna Soubry pictured in September 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alastair Grant/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the general election in December, not one of the original 11 defectors was elected. Does Soubry regret their efforts?</p> <p>\u201cNot for a moment,\u201d she says. \u201cI think truthfully, I\u2019m now 63, I was 62 at the time. I didn\u2019t have a mortgage to pay. But the people with real courage were the ones like Chris Leslie, who gave up a potentially great career in the Labour party, and who did have mortgages to pay.\u201d She still believes that the forces that produced their party will \u201ccome back and bite. We can\u2019t have a situation where the prime minister is surrounded by sycophants and there is no credible opposition. If Starmer does prove he is the man who can reform the Labour party, then there is some hope.

      "bodyText": "Hard as it is to imagine now, in the early part of last year there was a belief \u2013 somewhat desperately expressed \u2013 that a new politics might be possible in Britain. One not based on the two \u201clegacy\u201d parties, but that might be open to compromise, a certain fluidity of structure, pragmatism. The idea coalesced around a slogan, \u201cpolitics is broken\u201d. The question was, how to fix it. One solution was proposed by a breakaway group of MPs, eight from Labour, three from the Conservatives, whose new party \u2013 the cumbersomely named Independent Group for Change or Change UK \u2013 was accepted by the Electoral Commission 12 months ago this week. Both of the main parties were in disarray, propping up leaders for whom there was no love in parliament. The government had recently suffered the biggest defeat in parliamentary history on the \u201cfirst meaningful vote\u201d on Theresa May\u2019s doomed Brexit deal. If there was consensus on anything, it was that something had to give. At the time of the formation of the new party, YouGov asked a poll question: \u201cWould you say that British politics is working well or poorly at present?\u201d Eighty-two per cent of respondents said poorly. The poll suggested a number of possible remedies. The most popular, with 73% agreement, was: \u201cParties and politicians trying harder to work together and reach compromise.\u201d This finding was directly contradicted, however, by another solution: \u201cParties and politicians trying harder to stay true to their core beliefs\u201d (57%). It was in the space between these two demands that the new party was conceived, and in which it quickly floundered. In retrospect, the brief flame of the Independent Group \u2013 this time last year 18% of voters said they would vote for it in a general election \u2013 is illuminated by a few memorable images. There were, to begin with, the tentative speeches of the \u201cmagnificent seven\u201d breakaway Labour MPs \u2013 Mike Gapes, Ann Coffey, Chris Leslie, Chuka Umunna, Gavin Shuker, Angela Smith, Luciana Berger \u2013 who stepped forward, one after the other, led by Berger, eight months pregnant, to offer heartfelt explanations why they could no longer be a part of a Corbyn Labour party. They were joined overnight by Joan Ryan, then the following day by three Conservative MPs \u2013 Anna Soubry, Heidi Allen, Sarah Wollaston \u2013 who, naively as it turned out, dubbed themselves \u201cthe three amigos\u201d. Certain collective pictures became memes. There was the photo opportunity in which all 11 stared up to the heavens as if the sky might be the limit. There was a selfie from an evening in which they gathered self-consciously for a cheeky Nando\u2019s, and Twitter pored over the signifiers (\u201cThe difference is the last supper only had one Judas\u201d). And there was the morning when they took their places together in the House of Commons, waving to potential comrades trying to avoid their eyes on either side of the aisle. The caption seemed to want to read: come on in, the water\u2019s lovely! In the last few weeks, I have been speaking to some of those who were at the heart of that rebellion, on and off the record, conversations that have emphasised that cliche of the past seeming like another country. My questions really, boiled down to one: did Change UK change anything? Those who were keen to talk \u2013 and several were keener not to reopen that recent wound \u2013 dated the beginning of the party to way before last spring. Mike Gapes, 27 years a Labour MP, long-time chair of the Foreign Affairs select committee, said the start for him was back in 2015, when Jeremy Corbyn was elected party leader. At the time Gapes was recuperating after two months in hospital with a heart problem. Recovery influenced his desire above all to be true to himself. He agreed with Umunna, who says that by the beginning of 2018, it had long since become \u201cunconscionable to stand on a platform sponsoring someone to become our prime minister who I believed threatened our economic and national security\u201d. Anna Soubry, the Nottinghamshire MP who had become the firebrand voice of the People\u2019s Vote on the Tory side, ascribes her motivation to the lies told in the name of the Vote Leave campaign. \u201cIt felt that anyone who refused to go along with a hideous populist agenda was just either ignored or howled down. We still need voices that say: Excuse me, that is not how we do things in this country!\u201d Gavin Shuker, who had represented his home constituency for nine years, dates the genesis to a meeting at the Luton Hoo hotel between himself and Gapes and Chris Leslie, the former shadow chancellor, at the beginning of 2018. \u201cIn the 2017 general election,\u201d he says, \u201cmany Labour MPs went around telling people on the doorstep that they could vote for us as candidates because there was no real danger of Corbyn getting in. We all knew he was completely unsuitable for office. My feeling was, after the result in 2017, that loophole was closed.\u201d At that meeting at Shuker\u2019s house it was discussed how plan A was still to fight and reclaim the Labour party. It was also agreed that there needed to be \u201csome people thinking what plan B might look like\u201d. Shuker had worked as an organiser in the church prior to entering parliament. He saw his role as \u201ccreating the psychological space\u201d in which people might leave the main parties. On this basis he started to have conversations over coffee with 40 or 50 disgruntled Labour MPs. Their responses ranged, he says, from \u201cThank goodness someone is saying it\u201d to \u201cI agree with everything you\u2019ve said, but I have five years to pay off my mortgage\u201d. Gapes, who had been in the trenches with Neil Kinnock \u201cfighting Trotskyists and tankies who wanted to take over the party\u201d in the days of Militant, now believed the coup had happened. He kept a little diary of his thoughts. \u201cThe questions that kept cropping up for me back then were,\u201d he says: \u201cDo you run away? Do you wait for them to come for you? Or do you do something to make a difference?\u201d The answer was made for him after he \u201cvented on a WhatsApp group of friends about antisemitism and some kind person gave that to the Times,\u201d he says. \u201cThe fact was, though, that all of us had our own reasons. For me it wasn\u2019t about Brexit. It was antisemitism, Corbyn\u2019s foreign policy, the deplorable comments about the Skripal poisoning.\u201d At the same time that Shuker was sounding out Labour MPs, Chuka Umunna and Chris Leslie, who had shared an office at Westminster, were having conversations with likely Tory MPs. Brexit had fractured party loyalties. Umunna was not sure at that time how many Tories would join them. \u201cThey were two to three years behind Labour in being hijacked by an ugly populism \u2013 in their case, of the right \u2013 and it was hard to tell when that would happen, to what degree,\u201d he says. Several prominent Tory MPs told him \u201cthat they would hop on board\u201d if it looked like Change UK would succeed. \u201cBut this was a bit chicken and egg \u2013 unless a critical mass of MPs defected from the main parties and joined, it would not succeed.\u201d Soubry was among those to take the leap, partly on the understanding that Umunna would lead the new party. She saw Umunna as a potential prime minister. \u201cAbso-bloody-lutely,\u201d she says. \u201cI genuinely believed that.\u201d She spoke to a number of Tories about the idea of resigning the whip. Several wavered, but the two that eventually agreed were Wollaston and Allen. While the Brexit votes and debates were at loud-hailer volume within and outside Westminster, the commitment of various dissenters was being tested. A series of three clandestine meetings, two-day overnight gatherings, were organised by Shuker at a farm in East Sussex for the \u201c20 or so\u201d Labour MPs who were then seriously considering defection. The first time they all sat down for dinner, \u201cthere were people in tears around the table\u201d, Shuker says, as members discussed abandoning a lifelong commitment to the Labour movement. At the time the thinking was not to form a new party, Gapes says, at least not yet. \u201cWe thought of it in terms of trimesters,\u201d Shuker recalls. \u201cThe first trimester was the one we were in. The second would be as an independent parliamentary group, which would go on as long as possible while we agreed how to do the technicalities. The third would be as a political party, which meant that we would be judged by those standards. In the event, the second and third of those phases collapsed into each other and we obviously failed.\u201d That language of gestation was pointed. As Gapes observes, they had, in Berger\u2019s pregnancy, a very real deadline to make the change \u2013 it had to happen before she departed on maternity leave. \u201cThat helped to sharpen it,\u201d Shuker says, \u201cand in February a parting in the clouds emerged.\u201d Secrecy was paramount. \u201cI told my mother, a lifelong Labour member, that I was going to make a big announcement on TV, but I didn\u2019t tell her what it was,\u201d Gapes, 67, says. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell my brother, a lifelong trade union activist. Mainly because I didn\u2019t want anyone to talk me out of it.\u201d Those I spoke to can still just about recall the heady optimism of that moment of departure \u2013 hundreds of thousands of people signed up online as supporters, donations started flooding in. For Soubry, if there is one thing that changed everything, it was watching Luciana Berger stand up and be counted. \u201cI think that will stand as the iconic moment,\u201d she says. \u201cLuciana was very striking, heavily pregnant, and the sight of her saying she had left the party that had been her life because as a Jewish person she had been hounded out\u2026 I think that was the moment that completely destroyed Corbyn\u2019s chances of ever getting elected.\u201d Even at the time of the Nando\u2019s summit, Soubry was adamant in her faith that she was joining a new party led by Umunna. She still believes that things might have been different if the former Streatham MP had taken on the responsibility as promised. \u201cHe had the chance on more than one occasion and he chose not to do it,\u201d she says. She never had an explanation. Umunna rejects the idea that he reneged on any promises to lead, saying that the proper time to settle the question of leadership would have been in the autumn of 2019, once the group had a proper structure. Shuker puts that reluctance to take responsibility down to the planned progression of the trimesters. For the new group to get any traction, it needed as many defectors as possible. \u201cPeople would say, this sounds attractive, but I don\u2019t want to hitch my future to one person\u2019s vanity project,\u201d Shuker says. \u201cChuka is someone I respect and am still friends with. At one point I had to give him a list of 20 people who were telling me that they would not join a political party led by him, because they thought there should be a more collaborative process. A flatter structure.\u201d That flatter structure quickly came up against the Electoral Commission. The group reckoned they had maybe a one-in-five chance of becoming a real political force, but if there was an early election \u201cthey would probably be screwed\u201d. When the party formed it was far from clear that the UK would take part in the European elections planned for May \u2013 constitutionally it appeared absurd. When the EU insisted that in the absence of a Brexit deal Britain must take part, however, the group was forced drastically to accelerate its plans. \u201cWe had no organisation. No membership. No name,\u201d Gapes recalls. \u201cWe tried to register ourselves as the Independent Group and the Electoral Commission would not allow that. So we then became the Independent Group for Change Not ideal. We had a good logo, but that was rejected because it had a hashtag in it. And we imagined we could share the leadership, but the Electoral Commission insisted on us naming one leader.\u201d Heidi Allen, the least experienced of the MPs involved, who had been selected for the safest of Tory seats in South Cambridgeshire in 2015, was installed as a compromise interim leader. \u201cHeidi had some great qualities,\u201d Gapes says, \u201cbut she was completely inexperienced as a campaigner.\u201d Having selected a list of 70 candidates from 3,500 applicants in a frenzied Easter weekend of interviews in a London hotel suite, there was immediate confusion about whether to collaborate with other parties. Acting on dubious promises of a united Remainer front, Gapes says, \u201cHeidi started telling people to vote tactically for the Greens or the Lib Dems. And of course the Lib Dems set out to kill us and they ruthlessly did so, as they have done to others in the past.\u201d Umunna suggests that he knew the writing was on the wall as soon as they had to fight the election, which was a \u201close-lose\u201d decision. Until then, he says: \u201cWe presented no threat, and even traditionally Tory-supporting media were favourable, because they admired the stand we had taken against Corbynism and the hard Brexiters. However, as soon as we registered as a party, the entire establishment \u2013 Labour and Tory \u2013 turned their fire on us.\u201d New parties might survive many things, Shuker suggests, but they cannot survive ridicule. \u201cThe ambition when we launched was to get to the end of the week without becoming a punchline. And we did that pretty well. But you get one shot at forming a political party and if you end up in the calamity that was the European election campaign, where we literally did become the punchline, there was no coming back from that.\u201d The new ideals of consensual politics did not work in the heat of media scrutiny of a campaign. The street fighters in the group who had prevailed in marginal seats over the years came up against those who had a slightly dewy-eyed faith in a \u201cmovement\u201d in which things could be done differently. The split was generational as much as ideological. Soubry suggests that \u201cthose with deep experience of winning tough elections \u2013 Mike, Joan Ryan, Anne Coffey \u2013 were elbowed out a bit\u201d. Far from modelling a new politics, the group started to look like they had brought with them the ingrained habits of rats in a sack. \u201cThere were a lot of egos,\u201d Shuker says. \u201cAt one point I brought in FTSE 100 executive coaching to try to get the group to realise that the biggest threat we faced was holding on to the culture they had left behind. But then you found that some people could not resist going back to the old ways of anonymous briefing to the press and so on.\u201d Umunna puts those clashes down to the inability of some in the group, including himself, to understand the cultural difference between \u201cmaking the weather in one of the two main parties\u201d and \u201csurviving as a third force\u201d. The result of the European elections, in which the group polled 3.4% of the vote, was a fatal falling out, with old friends Umunna and Leslie on opposing sides. \u201cWe were a group of 11 that split into two taxis,\u201d Shuker says. \u201cWhich is a bit embarrassing.\u201d After the results came through, there was a showdown, Gapes says, between the six who wanted to close the party down \u2013 Ummuna, Allen, Berger, Smith, Shuker and Wollaston \u2013 and the other five older hands who thought they should battle on. Parliamentary politics after all was as fluid as it had ever been. \u201cBut the six decided no. There was no mention in any of that, of anyone joining the Lib Dems. None whatsoever,\u201d Gapes says. (That is not quite how Umunna remembers it, he says, in that he \u201cdidn\u2019t rule out\u201d the possibility.) Within weeks, all of those who left, apart from Shuker, joined the Liberal Democrats. Soubry became the reluctant leader of the remaining five. Over the following months, her most significant role in that capacity was to sit in on meetings that tried to resolve the impasse over Brexit. At one point in October, as prime minister Boris Johnson dissolved parliament and tried to keep open the idea of no deal, it seemed likely that an interim government might form. \u201cBut the thought of me going back to my group and saying \u2018Right guys, the plan is we\u2019re going to rally behind Jeremy Corbyn\u2019 was never really going to happen,\u201d Soubry says. At the general election in December, not one of the original 11 defectors was elected. Does Soubry regret their efforts? \u201cNot for a moment,\u201d she says. \u201cI think truthfully, I\u2019m now 63, I was 62 at the time. I didn\u2019t have a mortgage to pay. But the people with real courage were the ones like Chris Leslie, who gave up a potentially great career in the Labour party, and who did have mortgages to pay.\u201d She still believes that the forces that produced their party will \u201ccome back and bite. We can\u2019t have a situation where the prime minister is surrounded by sycophants and there is no credible opposition. If Starmer does prove he is the man who can reform the Labour party, then there is some hope. But if he is unable to do that \u2013 and I fear he will not be able to stand up to the Trots \u2013 then we really have problems.\u201d What does she make of those who so obviously swallowed their principles \u2013 I mention Nicky Morgan, though she doesn\u2019t \u2013 for the promise of reward? \u201cThere are a few where you think, how do they look themselves in the mirror?\u201d she says. \u201cI assume they say: \u2018I did the right thing for my family.\u2019 But if you are in politics that can never be enough in my view\u2026\u201d She plans to write a book about her experiences. \u201cIt\u2019s funny,\u201d she says, with a laugh. \u201cAfter the event, a very senior Labour politician said to me: \u2018Why didn\u2019t you just speak to me first and I would have told you what Chuka is like.\u2019\u201d Umunna himself, at 41, is more philosophical about the defeat. He\u2019d never been fully accepted by the Labour membership, and saw Change UK as a last political throw of the dice in a way. He knew if it did not work out there would be offers for him to resume his former legal career in the city. \u201cI was,\u201d he says now, \u201cdetermined to be out of politics by the time my children [his eldest is three] reached an age where what I do would encroach on their lives in ways they were aware of \u2013 I think it is incredibly challenging to have a parent in politics, with all the abuse and threats they see you subject to.\u201d He insists he has no intention of returning to stand for parliament, but remains proud that each one of the group followed their conscience. Mike Gapes also went down fighting at the election. Did Change UK change anything? \u201cI think we had a moment when we could have made a difference,\u201d he says. \u201cEven in the autumn if Corbyn had been big enough to say, I will stand aside for an interim prime minister, whether that was Margaret Beckett or Ken Clarke, that could have been a game changer.

The group, led by Sarah Gilbert, has since <a href=\"https://covid19vaccinetrial.co.uk/blog-how-long-will-it-take-get-oxford-vaccine-deployment\">stated</a> that a vaccine shown to be effective in phase-3 clinical trials that could be manufactured in large quantities won\u2019t be ready before the autumn even in a best-case scenario.

If it proves safe and generates a promising immune response in this pre-clinical phase, it enters human or clinical trials. These are divided into three phases, each of which takes longer and involves more people than the previous one. Phase 1 establishes the vaccine\u2019s safety in a small group of healthy individuals, with the goal of ruling out debilitating side effects. Phases 2 and 3 test efficacy, and in an outbreak like the present one they are conducted in places where the disease is prevalent. In parallel with these later phases, production capacity for the candidate vaccine is gradually built up, so that factories are capable of producing it on a large scale if and when regulatory agencies judge that it should be licensed.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2005630\">article</a> published in <em>The New England Journal of Medicine</em> on 30 March, representatives of the Oslo-based not-for-profit Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), which is helping to finance and coordinate Covid-19 vaccine development, laid out an accelerated version of this process that they believe is more suited to a pandemic. This \u201cpandemic paradigm\u201d implements certain steps in parallel, such as animal and phase-1 clinical testing. It also involves scaling up production capacity before sufficient safety and efficacy data are available \u2013 a financially risky step, given that that may never materialise, and one that requires governments and not-for-profit organisations such as Cepi to share that extra financial risk with pharmaceutical companies if they want them to engage. Mass production is critical in a pandemic, when hundreds of millions if not billions of doses are needed \u2013 and many countries are now scrambling to build new vaccine production facilities.</p> <p>\u201cPeople now appreciate that the lengthy process of conventional licensing of vaccines is not going to be helpful in the context of an epidemic,\u201d says Beate Kampmann, who heads the vaccine centre at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Bringing a new vaccine to the clinic has taken 10 to 20 years in the past</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Prudently, Cepi did not attach a timeline to its accelerated paradigm, but the 12- to 18-month estimate already takes it into account.

A Boston-based biotech firm, Moderna, saw its experimental Covid-19 vaccine enter human trials on 16 March, just 10 weeks after the first genetic sequences of Sars-CoV-2 \u2013 the virus that causes the disease \u2013 were released.

      "body": "<p>Crisis reveals character. Under the intense stress test imposed by the coronavirus, Britons are getting an education about themselves and the institutions that define their country. Some of the lessons are cheering, some are worrying and some are disturbing.</p> <p>Start at the very top. This country still looks to the Queen to be its comforting national figurehead, the anchor point in a sea of uncertainty. The job of monarch is nothing like as risky as that of a frontline health worker, a royal castle is not such a bad place to spend lockdown and she has had seven decades of practice to become pitch-perfect at being the reassuring great-grandmother of the nation. She does it extremely well. The Queen\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52176208\">\u201cwe will meet again\u201d broadcast</a>, invoking wartime solidarity more subtly and authentically than politicians straining to channel Churchill, was watched live by <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/almost-24m-tune-in-queen-s-address-a4407876.html\">24 million people</a>.</p> <p>Most watched it on the BBC. Before the crisis, Auntie was being threatened with a beating by elements of the government. Hoodlums in the Downing Street gang put it about that the BBC was going to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/mar/08/we-wont-let-dominic-cummings-whack-the-bbc\">\u201cwhacked\u201d</a> and Number 10 ordered a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/dec/15/boris-johnson-threatens-bbc-with-two-pronged-attack\">ministerial boycott</a> of the <em>Today</em> programme. That sounds even more puerile now than it did then. The nation has once again turned to the BBC in a crisis as its central source of reliable information. Viewing figures are up by more than a third on this time last year. Most Tories I speak to think that the threat to the corporation from the Johnson regime is much diminished.</p> <p>The army is another battered national institution that has received a boost. British fondness for a plucky old soldier has expressed itself in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/coronavirus-capt-tom-moore-raises-12m-nhs-completes-garden-walk\">millions in donations</a> raised by Captain Tom Moore, the 99-year-old Second World War veteran doing laps of his garden to raise money for health charities. The modern army, scarred by its humiliations on the battlefields of Afghanistan and Iraq, has not done much recent fighting in foreign fields and had been struggling to justify itself to ministers. So the military were delighted to be asked to help set up the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/01/we-drew-up-the-plan-over-a-brew-inside-operation-nightingale\">Nightingale emergency hospitals</a> and give logistical support such as transporting oxygen supplies. This has been a reminder of the contribution they can make to battles at home. \u201cThe army is good in a crisis,\u201d remarks one senior Tory. \u201cYou set them a task and they get on and do it.\u201d That will strengthen the hand of the generals when the postponed strategic defence review considers allocating future resources.</p> <p>Of all the institutions being stress tested by this crisis, the NHS wears the brightest halo. The former Tory chancellor <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2018/07/04/brits-still-love-nhs-they-are-nervous-about-its-fu\">Nigel Lawson</a> once remarked, with a whiff of derision, that \u201cthe NHS is the closest thing the English people have to a religion\u201d. Faith in it and worship of it, expressed by the weekly street congregations to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/apr/16/coronavirus-people-across-the-uk-play-music-and-clap-for-carers-video\">clap for carers</a>, have become more passionate. On his release from hospital, and after thanking the doctors and nurses who saved his life, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/apr/12/coronavirus-boris-johnson-nhs-hospital-video\">Boris Johnson</a> called the NHS \u201cthe beating heart of this country... the best of this country\u201d. </p> <p>A cold-eyed assessment of the health service\u2019s performance would be less poetic. Some of its achievements have been hugely impressive. So much so that even Labour politicians, whose usual default is to say that the NHS has been wrecked by years of Tory underspending, are full of praise. Hospitals have reorganised themselves with remarkable speed to deal with this novel enemy. The dedication of the staff has been awesome. Bureaucracy was swiftly swept aside to allow retired health workers to return to the service. In other respects, the NHS is not always flattered by international comparisons. Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/uk-must-learn-from-german-response-to-covid-19-says-whitty\">openly acknowledged</a> that Britain has things to learn from Germany. The health service is still struggling to muster adequate supplies of key equipment and ramp up testing to the levels required. But even where it is judged to have underperformed, the public is not going to blame the service and its staff. That will be laid at the door of political mismanagement, bureaucratic bungling and lack of resources.</p> <p>I make one confident prediction about the health service - it can expect to be a big winner of future spending rounds. Mr Johnson has told the nation that he owes his life to the NHS. For so long as he is prime minister, it will be pretty much impossible for his government to refuse the health service almost anything that it asks for.</p> <p>The Bank of England and the Treasury, both applying critical lessons learned during the financial crisis, took quick and decisive action to try to contain the damage done to the economy. The stock of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/12/rishi-sunak-dilemma-over-how-to-pay-for-his-coronavirus-spending\">Rishi Sunak</a>, an assured public performer who exhibits some flair as a phrase-maker, has so soared that many colleagues have marked up the chancellor as the next Tory leader. That observation comes with a big but. \u201cThis is the easy bit for him when he can be the cavalry riding to the rescue,\u201d comments one Tory colleague. \u201cThe hard part comes later when Rishi has to find the money to pay for all his emergency measures.\u201d</p> <p>The crisis has found other institutions wanting. We have been reminded of the perils of concentrating a huge amount of power among a tiny number of people at Number 10. Early mistakes came about because the prime minister and his circle were captured by assumptions about the disease and the public that proved to be wrong. They were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/15/boris-johnson-reacted-too-slowly-to-covid-19-says-ex-scientific-adviser\">slow to announce a lockdown</a> in part because Number 10 faultily assumed that many Britons would disobey. \u201cWe had that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51917562\">weird period</a> when Boris was telling people not to go to the pub, but letting the pubs stay open,\u201d observes one former cabinet minister. \u201cThis is because the people around Boris at Number 10 are in the small minority of this country who are natural hooligans, people who won\u2019t be told what to do.\u201d</p> <p>A cabinet with more experience and confidence might have challenged the Number 10 view. But this cabinet was appointed not to question the prime minister, but to be supplicants to him. \u201cBoris\u2019s problem is that he appointed a cabinet of yes-men,\u201d says one senior Tory. This is not quite right because he also appointed some yes-women. Dominic Raab has not made any evident errors during his period as a facsimile prime minister, but then again he has not been empowered to make any big decisions either. The crisis has underlined the dangers of having a very dominant prime minister surrounded by a weak and neophyte cabinet.</p> <p>At the height of a national emergency without any modern precedent, many of the necessary checks and balances on government are not functioning. Even before parliament was shut down at the end of March, it was not impressive as an invigilator of the executive. The science select committee and the health committee have done useful work gathering evidence. The former health secretary Jeremy Hunt is among the select minority of MPs who have distinguished themselves by getting on the government\u2019s case about the sluggish pace of some of its responses. Parliament as a collective hasn\u2019t had much influence on the course of events. The prime minister has simply ignored the Commons. Whereas Tony Blair felt obliged to regularly explain himself to MPs during the Iraq war, and Gordon Brown did the same during the financial crisis, Mr Johnson has not once made a full statement direct to the Commons about the coronavirus crisis. He ought to do so as soon as his health permits.</p> <p>Parliament will return to work this week in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/13/hybrid-virtual-parliament-plans-to-be-put-to-mps-next-week\">a hybrid form</a>, with up to 50 MPs present in the chamber and another 120 able to contribute remotely at any one time. There are grounds for being sceptical about whether an e-parliament will be very effective at holding the government to account. As we\u2019ve seen from the video news conferences mounted by Number 10, the format makes it much easier for ministers to bat away questions they don\u2019t want to answer. Let\u2019s hope MPs can make it work and that the resumed parliament is virtual only in the technical sense. Ministers have taken extraordinary powers to control people\u2019s lives and that requires constant scrutiny. We also need more ministerial explanation and accountability for the choices they are making.</p> <p>Every crisis is an opportunity. From the NHS to the monarch, the BBC to the army, several of our institutions are reminding the nation why they are essential to Britain. The challenge before parliament, which is supposed to be the beating heart of our democracy, is to demonstrate that it can do the same.</p> <p>\u2022<em> </em>Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</p>",

      "bodyText": "Carl Anhalt hadn\u2019t made a loaf of bread in years. But stuck in his New York City apartment during the coronavirus lockdown, he started thinking about bread again. Anhalt works as a high school math teacher, and like many educators he now spends his weeks dealing with meetings, emails and distance learning. But when his school recently went on spring break, he began working on a sourdough starter, posting pictures of his progress on Instagram. He says it\u2019s helped him feel productive and deal with stress. \u201cIt was a good exercise in mindfulness and a distraction from thinking about the world, so in those ways it certainly eased some anxiety,\u201d he says. Baking your way through anxiety or uncertainty is nothing new \u2013 in fact anxiety has been on the rise since 2016, according to the American Psychiatric Association, and baking has climbed with it. But with the pandemic confining millions to their homes, the practice is rising faster than a packet of quick-acting yeast. While cakes, cookies, noodles and pastas are all proving popular, bread has emerged as the baking project of choice. Yeast shortages have been reported in supermarkets across the UK and the US, with yeast suppliers calling the current demand \u201cunprecedented\u201d. In France and Australia, flour is becoming hard to find. Google has documented an all-time high in queries about bread, including yeast, and \u201chow to make bread without yeast.\u201d Clemence Gossett, the founder and co-owner of The Gourmandise School in Santa Monica, California, says she was initially surprised by the turn to bread \u2013 she initially thought that people prefer making cakes and cookies. But she surmises that people have been attracted to bread baking not just because of its practicality as a grocery staple, but because of its meditative qualities during challenging times. Rolling, kneading and mixing all have a calming quality, forcing you to be in the moment and not stuck mentally in the future or past. That may help bakers manage the uncertain emotions. \u201cI think that there is this desire for people to express themselves and it\u2019s really hard to do that when you can\u2019t communicate and have this back and forth with others,\u201d says Gossett. \u201cWe have lost that in a way. There\u2019s this wonderful tangibility with baking and lets you work out emotions and express yourself.\u201d Some studies show that baking is connected to positive feelings. Psychologists have started exploring cooking and baking as a therapeutic tool to help people dealing with things like depression and anxiety, and a 2016 study, published in the Journal of Positive Psychology, suggests that people who frequently take a turn at small, creative projects report feeling more relaxed and happier. That makes sense to Gossett \u2013 her cooking school offers a class that combines therapy and pie-baking. The class creates a space for people to work on anxiety, particularly perfectionism, using the simple, delicious experience of learning how to make pies. Ken Forkish, the owner of Ken\u2019s Artisan Bakery in Portland, Oregon, and author of the book Flour Water Salt Yeast, says that people are also looking to make their own bread at home because trips to the grocery store have become riddled with stress. \u201cPeople want to have fresh bread while avoiding the grocery store as much as possible,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got time on your hands, and maybe you have wanted to learn to bake bread and now you have the time to do it.\u201d Time is a necessary ingredient for bread, Forkish adds, and that extra time at home has prompted bakers to attempt things they may not have before \u2013 such as sourdough, which can take days to produce. Professional bakers are turning to social media to demystify the process, and amateur bakers are posting their homemade experiments. The bakers at Tartine Bakery in San Francisco, which helped kickstart the global sourdough craze, have posted instructional videos on making sourdough starter and their signature sourdough loaves which have been viewed tens of thousands of times.

The school also has a hotline and email address where people can reach out; she said the response has been overwhelming \u2013 running the hotline has become a full-time job, answering questions about which ingredients can be substituted or what meals to make with a random assortment of food in the fridge and pantry. Gossett is even doing FaceTime calls to coach people through their baking challenges. Gossett thinks the pandemic has prompted a shift in how people view baking as a part of their days. \u201cInstead of asking: how can I make this fit in my schedule, it\u2019s more about how can I make myself available to learn this new process.\u201d",

We can\u2019t change used ones\u201d. EVs will soon make up 10% of Norway\u2019s passenger fleet, she said, and are slowly coming on to the used market. She said she was confident for the future of electric vehicles, even in countries without a big renewable power sector, and studies show that EVs running on power generated from fossil fuel are responsible for roughly the same level of overall CO2 emissions as petrol cars. \u201cAs a society, we clearly have to do two things,\u201d she said. \u201cProduce more renewable energy and products \u2013 like cars \u2013 that can run on it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to do both, as fast as possible. We can\u2019t hang around until we\u2019re producing 100% renewable energy.\u201d Electric cars are \u201cnever going to be truly environmentally friendly\u201d, Bu said. \u201cThe main problem is making the batteries. We need clean battery producers in Europe. But look, we need transport. We need cars and vans, particularly outside our cities. And for us, electric is the answer.\u201d This story is a part of Covering Climate Now\u2019s week of coverage focused on Climate Solutions, to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day. The Guardian is the lead partner in Covering Climate Now, a global journalism collaboration committed to strengthening coverage of the climate story.",

The audience for the BBC <em>News at One</em> has risen 85%, the <em>News at Six</em> 74%, and the <em>News at Ten</em> of by 50%. The evening news programmes, and the two on which Walsh and his colleague Hugh Pym, the BBC\u2019s health editor, appear most often, now have a combined nightly audience of around 12.8 million \u2013 and no wonder. It isn\u2019t only that audiences are hungry for information. Between them, Walsh and Pym, together with their producers and cameramen, are delivering powerful journalism: most notably their reports from inside intensive care units at, respectively, University College Hospital in London and Addenbrooke\u2019s Hospital in Cambridge.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019d been trying to get access to an ICU for some weeks,\u201d says Walsh. \u201cA lot of the coverage was coming out of the 5pm press conference. I felt we had to get back to the reality of what the virus can do. I was trying very hard to persuade people to let me in. There were good reasons why they weren\u2019t, but in the end it came down to a question of trust. I\u2019ve been doing this job a long time, and I\u2019ve built up a level of trust. I know a lot of the team at UCH \u2013 and they felt very strongly that they wanted people to see what they were having to cope with, the better to reinforce the stay-at-home messaging.\u201d</p> \n<p>Staff at UCH have since told him that they have been contacted by hospitals from across the country expressing gratitude that the reports went out.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>There were moments when I was deeply troubled by what I was seeing ...

I\u2019ve reported from all over the world on some very tough medical conditions. But nothing has affected me like this. There were moments when I was deeply troubled by what I was seeing. I walked into an operating theatre that had been repurposed to house two intensive care beds. That theatre looks over the Euston Road, and being there really affected me: the stark contrast between the relative normality of life outside, and what was happening inside. I thought: <em>people just don\u2019t realise</em>.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn the ICU, a patient needed to be turned on their front. There were eight staff, all in full PPE, very delicately turning this patient. It took a long time, and they were so gentle. I still find that very affecting even now. It haunts me, and [this has given me a sense of] how profoundly staff have been affected. They\u2019re not able to save a lot of those patients. They don\u2019t have a drug that will make them better. But they do what they can. What I\u2019m doing is nothing \u2013 <em>nothing \u2013 </em>compared to what they\u2019re doing. They are simply amazing.\u201d</p> \n<p>He and Pym (who\u2019s also talking to me via Zoom, and who have known each other since they trained together in Falmouth) are aware of the criticism journalists are getting on social media for their coverage of the crisis: a perceived lack of tenaciousness at the government\u2019s daily press conference; talk of NHS heroism that obscures the reality of government failure.</p> \n<p>\u201cGiven the technology [thanks to social distancing, journalists now attend remotely] the press conferences have been tricky,\u201d says Pym. \u201cPeople say: why didn\u2019t you follow up? But until they started allowing follow-up questions, that was difficult. The government side has offered us the chance to do filming on testing or drug trials, but it\u2019s so fast-moving: the communications team, civil servants and ministers are under huge pressure.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c664152a2fa6d7c899caee4d6f0f23bedb6d96d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c664152a2fa6d7c899caee4d6f0f23bedb6d96d/70_46_1346_807/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A critically ill patient in the intensive care unit at University College Hospital in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A critically ill patient in the intensive care unit at University College Hospital in London.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Has he been leant on?

There is a disconnect between what officials think is good for the media, and what hospital staff and journalists want to do.\u201d</p> \n<p>In terms of tone, it\u2019s more difficult. \u201cYou know some people feel you haven\u2019t got it right,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd you know yourself you don\u2019t always get it right. You can only do your best.\u201d</p> \n<p>Walsh is aware that his tone has shifted over the weeks. \u201cEarly on, I tried not to alarm people: coronavirus is mild for most. I emphasised that 99 out of 100 people will survive it. But when millions of people are affected, the small minority who die becomes a huge number. The tone has had to change. When it comes to language, I agonise over every sentence I write. I have used military metaphors. I do think we are in a war against the virus; the ICUs are the frontline in that war. But I don\u2019t think fights should be assigned to people. If someone dies, they haven\u2019t lost a battle, they\u2019ve been killed by a disease.\u201d</p> \n<p>Where will the story go next? Looking ahead, what\u2019s of most concern? For Pym, it\u2019s a question of what the NHS will look like after we pass the peak. \u201cHow long will critical care beds need to be available? How long can staff keep going at this level? When can the service get back to routine operations?\u201d</p> \n<p>What about Walsh? He sounds more grave. \u201cNo country in the world has an exit strategy yet. I\u2019m concerned about what the next year will bring. The only real exit strategy involves a vaccine, and though we may get small doses this year, in terms of mass production there\u2019s unlikely to be anything for 18 months.</p> \n<p>\u201cAdditionally, a lot of vaccines are not completely effective in older people, whose immune system response tends to be lower \u2013 so you can\u2019t protect the people most at risk. There seem to be only bad options in terms of how we get out of this. A price will have to be paid. I don\u2019t have very optimistic things to say to you. We\u2019re in for a very difficult time. Restrictions may have to continue for the next 12 months.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"dba75589-4ad7-4069-9b28-03e4dd72eab5\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DnnZMbBqEgk?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Is the story taking its toll on them?

Johnson\u2019s \u201cstrong Britain\u201d may amount only to England weakly imitating the repressive populism of Poland or Hungary.</p> <p>Yet a great emergency, like this shared time of pestilence, leaves people sensing their own power, aware that they can act without waiting for yesterday\u2019s leaders.

Johnson\u2019s \u201cstrong Britain\u201d may amount only to England weakly imitating the repressive populism of Poland or Hungary. Yet a great emergency, like this shared time of pestilence, leaves people sensing their own power, aware that they can act without waiting for yesterday\u2019s leaders. When we finally wake up from the long sleep cure, there is a chance to make those \u201cnever agains\u201d more than a fading dream. A chance \u2013 but lasting only for a few months of creative confusion as we all stand up again and look around. \u201cRise like lions after slumber,\u201d said Shelley. There is plenty to do, but we have to do it fast. \u2022 Neal Ascherson is a journalist and writer",

Thank you all for your company and your insights. Below, a summary of today\u2019s Covid-19 news in Australia.</p> \n  <p>Be well all of you, and be kind to each other.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Australia recorded two new Covid-19 deaths. One, in New South Wales, was <strong>a 94-year-old man</strong>. He was a resident at the <strong>Newmarch House aged care facility</strong> in western Sydney. It is the second death from the aged care facility after a significant outbreak. There are now 39 cases from the facility, including 13 staff. <strong>A man in his 80s from Victoria also died overnight</strong>.</li> \n   <li>The foreign minister, <strong>Marise Payne</strong>, has called for an independent global investigation into the spread of Covid-19. Payne says she does not think the <strong>World Health Organisation</strong> should run the investigation, saying she shares some of the concerns expressed by the US about the agency\u2019s handling of the pandemic. Payne was also reluctant to answer questions about whether she \u201ctrusts\u201d China in terms of its response to the virus during an interview with the ABC.<br></li> \n   <li>The federal health minister, <strong>Greg Hunt</strong>, said elective surgery and IVF could resume sooner than previously expected, thanks to an increase in PPE equipment available to Australia\u2019s healthcare system. <strong>H</strong><strong>unt also took a swipe at the WHO</strong>, saying its response to the crisis \u201cdidn\u2019t help the world\u201d.</li> \n   <li>The New South Wales health minister, <strong>Brad Hazzard</strong>, announced anyone who spat on a worker could receive a $5,000 fine. It\u2019s an expansion of a previous decision to allow the fines for people who spat on health workers or police.</li> \n   <li>Hazzard also said NSW had avoided some 700 deaths, based on projections during the peak of the outbreak.</li> \n   <li>Beaches in some parts of the Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs will reopen from Monday. Randwick mayor Danny Said announced that Clovelly, Coogee and Maroubra beaches would reopen for exercise only from Monday. </li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-19T08:40:53.958Z\">at 9.40am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9c07ea8f080ee1104479f7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-19T08:24:31.360Z\">9.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">No new cases of Covid-19 in South Australia</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>For the second straight day, South Australia has reported zero new cases of Covid-19.</p> \n  <p>From SA Health:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There have been no new cases of COVID-19 today.

Payne says she does not think the World Health Organisation should run the investigation, saying she shares some of the concerns expressed by the US about the agencies handling of the pandemic. Payne was also reluctant to answer questions about whether she \u201ctrusts\u201d China in terms of its response to the virus during an interview with the ABC.</li> \n   <li>The federal health minister, <strong>Greg Hunt</strong>, said elective surgery and IVF could resume sooner than previously expected, thanks to an increase in PPE equipment available to Australia\u2019s healthcare system. <strong>H</strong><strong>unt also took a swipe at the WHO</strong>, saying its response to the crisis \u201cdidn\u2019t help the world\u201d.</li> \n   <li>The New South Wales health minister, <strong>Brad Hazzard</strong>, announced anyone who spat on a worker could receive a $5,000 fine. It\u2019s an expansion of a previous decision to allow the fines for people who spat on health workers or police.</li> \n   <li>Hazzard also said NSW had avoided some 700 deaths, based on projections during the peak of the outbreak.</li> \n   <li>Beaches in some parts of the Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs will re-open from Monday.

Obviously we need to make sure that we have that capacity where we need it, so that includes the capacity to be able to transport patients and equipment into a regional setting or back into the metropolitan area. But this means that we are ready, we stand ready if this virus does start to afflict a large number of people. As you know, we\u2019re coming into our winter flu season.

      "bodyText": "We are going to close this live coverage now. Thank you all for your company and your insights. Below, a summary of today\u2019s Covid-19 news in Australia. Be well all of you, and be kind to each other. Australia recorded two new Covid-19 deaths. One, in New South Wales, was a 94-year-old man. He was a resident at the Newmarch House aged care facility in western Sydney. It is the second death from the aged care facility after a significant outbreak. There are now 39 cases from the facility, including 13 staff. A man in his 80s from Victoria also died overnight. The foreign minister, Marise Payne, has called for an independent global investigation into the spread of Covid-19. Payne says she does not think the World Health Organisation should run the investigation, saying she shares some of the concerns expressed by the US about the agency\u2019s handling of the pandemic. Payne was also reluctant to answer questions about whether she \u201ctrusts\u201d China in terms of its response to the virus during an interview with the ABC. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, said elective surgery and IVF could resume sooner than previously expected, thanks to an increase in PPE equipment available to Australia\u2019s healthcare system. Hunt also took a swipe at the WHO, saying its response to the crisis \u201cdidn\u2019t help the world\u201d. The New South Wales health minister, Brad Hazzard, announced anyone who spat on a worker could receive a $5,000 fine. It\u2019s an expansion of a previous decision to allow the fines for people who spat on health workers or police. Hazzard also said NSW had avoided some 700 deaths, based on projections during the peak of the outbreak. Beaches in some parts of the Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs will reopen from Monday. Randwick mayor Danny Said announced that Clovelly, Coogee and Maroubra beaches would reopen for exercise only from Monday. For the second straight day, South Australia has reported zero new cases of Covid-19. From SA Health: There have been no new cases of COVID-19 today. There remains a total of 435 cases in South Australia. To date, 354 people have been cleared of COVID-19. There are only 77 active cases in South Australia. There have been four reported deaths in SA from COVID-19. Two people are currently in intensive care at the Royal Adelaide Hospital. A 68-year-old man is in a critical condition while a 75-year-old man is stable. SA Pathology has undertaken more than 43,000 tests for COVID-19 so far. The average wait time for a test result is 17 hours. Until 30 April, any South Australian who has a fever or respiratory symptoms consistent with COVID-19, no matter how mild, is encouraged to attend a COVID-19 clinic or their GP, for assessment and testing. The state\u2019s health minister Stephen Wade said he was cautiously optimistic the virus was being brought under control, but warned it was too early to abandon social distancing measures. This is the third week where we have zero or single digit cases each day, but that should not be a seed for complacency \u2013 that should spur us on for even further efforts. We\u2019ve got to this point through social distancing and border control. There is the chance that people will get slack. Over the next two to four weeks, I would very much encourage the public to hold the course. We will all stand to benefit at the end of this. Internationally, while some countries - such as New Zealand - are looking at relaxing restrictions after successfully \u2018flattening the curve\u2019 of their Covid-19 infections, in other countries, they are asking, how did this all go so wrong. In the UK, the distractions of Brexit and reshuffles, the ignoring of expert medical advice at critical times, and the (now-discarded) strategy of \u2018herd immunity\u2019. Extraordinary read here: And in Sweden, there is growing anger over systemic failures in aged care homes. Anglicare, which runs Newmarch House in western Sydney, has released a statement regarding the death of a 94-year-old resident today. We are very sad to advise that a 94-year-old male resident of Newmarch House, who tested positive for Covid-19, passed away this morning. The resident\u2019s cause of death will be formally confirmed in the coming days. The resident\u2019s immediate family have been informed. Our thoughts and prayers are with them as they grieve. All Newmarch House residents and their families have been notified, as well as all staff. All relevant authorities have also been notified. Although the cause of death has not been determined, this is tragically our second resident who has died in recent days, who had received a positive diagnosis of Covid-19. The death of any of our residents is always difficult for their family, neighbours and friends, as well as for our staff and volunteers, many of whom know the resident closely having cared for the resident over a number of years. First it was Llandudno in Wales being noisily browsed by a herd of goats. Then deer venturing into Nara, Japan. More wildlife reclaiming the world. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has prohibited cruise ship crew from travelling on commercial flights within America, leaving 107 Australians stranded, an unable to get home. Australian dancer Amber Jenkins is one of 107 Australian crew members stranded on 40 ships off the coast of the US and in the Caribbean after the coronavirus pandemic wreaked havoc on the cruise industry. Jenkins, a 22-year-old from Kempsey on the NSW mid north coast, and three other Australian crew members are on Royal Caribbean\u2019s Adventure of the Seas. The ship offloaded its passengers weeks ago and there have been no cases of coronavirus on the vessel, but a lack of available flights has meant the Australians are floating off the coast of Florida not sure when they will be able to fly home. \u201cAmber is safe,\u201d her mother, Tina Keast, told AAP on Saturday. \u201cShe is being fed, is well looked after, has a guest room, and they are doing the quarantining and wearing the masks on the ship even though there is no virus on there and no passengers.\u201d Australia\u2019s ambassador to the US Arthur Sinodinos used social media on Friday to write a letter to the stranded Australians, assuring them the government was \u201cworking tirelessly to assist with your safe and timely repatriation to Australia\u201d. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has prohibited cruise ship crew from travelling on commercial flights in the US. \u201cThis is making it extremely difficult for cruise lines to make viable logistical arrangements for the repatriation of its crew members,\u201d Sinodinos wrote. The Australian government has worked with cruise ship companies across the globe to help facilitate the return of Australian passengers and crew. There are no longer Australian passengers on cruise ships, a Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade spokesperson said. Keast said her daughter was booked on a flight three weeks ago but it was cancelled. They hope a charter flight can be organised to get the Australians home. The Adventure of the Seas is scheduled to dock at Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on Sunday for supplies, but Jenkins won\u2019t be able to disembark unless she has a flight booked. \u201cThe cruise company is really looking after them well and everyone on the ship is happy,\u201d Keast said. \u201cIf they can get a charter flight organised for all of them to fly home, they will all jump on and do it.\u201d (As the parent of a school-aged child, I find this interesting. My child is un-teachable anyway. Five years old, knows everything). Parents in Queensland are not expected to teach their children from home amid school closures, the education minister Grace Grace has said. Schools remain open for essential workers and vulnerable children when term two begins on Monday. People uncertain about whether children should be at school should contact their school\u2019s principal, health authorities have said. Parents who have children at home with them are not required to take any classes. That\u2019s a job for teachers and teacher aides employed across the state who will help children learn via digital devices and hard copies of the curriculum, the education minister said. \u201cThis is remote learning,\u201d Grace told reporters on Sunday. \u201cNo parent is required to be a teacher.\u201d Thousands of new electronic devices have been purchased for schools and print learning material has been prepared. The school restriction measures are expected to be reviewed in five weeks and help lines have been established for those who have questions or need help. Grace said she expected between 10% to 15% of students would attend schools from Monday. Good afternoon. Ben Doherty here in Sydney. Across the Tasman Sea from where I sit on this glorious autumnal Sunday, New Zealand looks likely to announce a relaxation of its lockdown laws, after low number of new Covid-19 cases for more than a week. You can read more on how are countries are navigating their \u2018exit strategies\u2019 here. From Ben McKay at AAP in New Zealand: One day out from a decision on whether to relax New Zealand\u2019s coronavirus clampdown, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has asked Kiwis to keep a diary of their daily movements. Ardern believes the homespun idea could help the country\u2019s contact-tracers with their work. \u201cI would ask New Zealanders to think about doing that. Just keeping a quick note of where you\u2019ve been, and who you\u2019ve been with,\u201d Ardern said. \u201cIt will not only help them, it will help us. If you imagine, even asking someone six days later to account every movement over a period of time, it\u2019s an incredibly hard task. \u201cSo I would ask New Zealanders to have new practises, new things that they do at the end of the day. \u201cThe better that we are able to do ... the sooner we can move through down the alert levels and the sooner life feels more normal.\u201d On Monday, cabinet will meet to decide whether to end four weeks of level four restrictions and downscale to a level three lockdown, which mirrors many of Australia\u2019s restrictions. That will include re-opening schools, allowing more businesses \u2013 including the construction and forestry industries \u2013 to get back to work and let restaurants operate for delivery orders only. It will also allow Kiwis to extend their bubbles of people with which they have personal contact, which presents a challenge for contact tracing. Contact tracing is the process where health officials track down people that have been in contact with confirmed cases of Covid-19, asking them to self-isolate and get tested. Just as in Australia, officials are hoping to use a tracking app to assist the process, along with diary entries. On Sunday, health officials announced just nine new cases across the country, the eighth straight day in which new cases have been no higher than 20. The country\u2019s death toll stands at 12, after the death of a man in Invercargill last Tuesday was confirmed to be linked to Covid-19. In keeping with the country\u2019s health-first approach, Ardern announced four criteria that would decide whether the country would relax its restrictions \u2013 with none related to the economy. The first is the satisfaction of health professionals that undetected community transmission is unlikely. The second is strong contact tracing capacity, the third is the strength of border controls and the the fourth is the health system\u2019s ability to stand up. \u201cOur focus has been to protect the health of New Zealanders,\u201d Ardern said, while acknowledging the hurt in the business community. \u201cThe best thing for the economy has been to stop the virus. But I do what to say thank you to a very special group ... small business owners and operators. Nobody underestimates how hard this situation is for all of you.\u201d The New Zealand government has paid out more than $NZ9bn ($A$8.8bn) in wage subsidies to businesses, representing more than 1.5 million people, to date. That\u2019s me done for today. I will leave you in the capable hands of my colleague Ben Doherty, who will take you through the rest of the afternoon and into the evening. First, though, here\u2019s a quick summary of what\u2019s happened so far today: Australia recorded two new Covid-19 deaths. One, in New South Wales, was a 94-year-old man. He was a resident at the Newmarch House aged care facility in western Sydney. It is the second death from the aged care facility after a significant outbreak. There are now 39 cases from the facility, including 13 staff. A man in his 80s from Victoria also died overnight. The foreign minister, Marise Payne, has called for an independent global investigation into the spread of Covid-19. Payne says she does not think the World Health Organisation should run the investigation, saying she shares some of the concerns expressed by the US about the agencies handling of the pandemic. Payne was also reluctant to answer questions about whether she \u201ctrusts\u201d China in terms of its response to the virus during an interview with the ABC. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, said elective surgery and IVF could resume sooner than previously expected, thanks to an increase in PPE equipment available to Australia\u2019s healthcare system. Hunt also took a swipe at the WHO, saying its response to the crisis \u201cdidn\u2019t help the world\u201d. The New South Wales health minister, Brad Hazzard, announced anyone who spat on a worker could receive a $5,000 fine. It\u2019s an expansion of a previous decision to allow the fines for people who spat on health workers or police. Hazzard also said NSW had avoided some 700 deaths, based on projections during the peak of the outbreak. Beaches in some parts of the Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs will re-open from Monday. Randwick mayor Danny Said announced that Clovelly, Coogee and Maroubra beaches would re-open for exercise only from Monday. Western Australia has recorded just one new Covid-19 case overnight. But the state\u2019s health minister, Roger Cook, has urged people not to become complacent. He announced a little earlier that the state had invested in preparing to give its health department significant \u201csurge capacity\u201d, going from a little more than 100 ventilator beds to \u201cwell over 660\u201d. That means we have a huge surge capacity to respond to anything that this virus throws against us. Obviously we need to make sure that we have that capacity where we need it, so that includes the capacity to be able to transport patients and equipment into a regional setting or back into the metropolitan area. But this means that we are ready, we stand ready if this virus does start to afflict a large number of people. As you know, we\u2019re coming into our winter flu season. As a result of that we need to also make sure we have capacity to manage that cohort of patients and any Covid-19 patients. The current numbers suggest we\u2019ve got this virus under control but we can\u2019t be complacent. Queensland Health have issued a correction. Instead of four new cases, the state has five. That includes the death of the 83-year-old man, which was announced yesterday. Not Covid-19 related exactly, but this is quite a story from my colleague Malcolm Farr. A legal clash is looming after claims a senior adviser to the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has pirated Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s memoir before its official publication on Monday. A letter of complaint has been sent to a senior Morrison adviser from Nicholas Pullen of lawyers HWL Ebsworth, representing Turnbull and his publishers. Lawyers for Turnbull and his publisher Hardie Grant believe unauthorised digital copies of the book, A Bigger Picture, were widely distributed with recipients encouraged to forward them to others. I should stress that beaches in neighbouring Waverley \u2013 so Bondi, Tamarama and Bronte \u2013 remain closed for now. On Saturday Waverley mayor Paula Masselos said the area remained \u201ca hotspot for coronavirus cases and we have no intention of reopening our beaches at this time\u201d. The council is, however, looking at ways to provide managed access to the water for the sole purpose of ocean swimming and surfing for exercise. The council has been looking at ways to manage restrictions at our beaches ever since they were closed on 21 March due to limits on public gatherings introduced by the state government. Masselos also said the council was working with Randwick City and Woollahra councils \u201con a coordinated approach to the situation at our beaches in consultation with our local police and health authorities\u201d. So, watch this space I guess. A number of beaches in Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs will reopen on Monday, but only for exercise. Randwick Council says that from tomorrow Coogee, Maroubra and Clovelly Beaches will be made available for \u201cexercise purposes only\u201d. That means jogging on the sand, walking, swimming, surfing and other exercise activities will now be permitted. Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs beaches were closed on 28 March after large crowds were filmed gathering at neighbouring Bondi Beach. \u201cLiving along the coast, I know how important our beaches are to the mental and physical health of so many in the community,\u201d Randwick mayor Danny Said said. \u201cThe past three weeks have been difficult as we\u2019ve all had to make changes and sacrifices to our daily routines. Our decision to close the beaches three weeks ago was not taken lightly and factored in the risk of coronavirus spread, particularly given the concentration of Covid-19 cases in the eastern suburbs area along with the popularity of our beaches. \u201cOur decision was also based upon expected crowd numbers and people\u2019s initial behaviour in relation to social distancing rules. \u201cBy not going to the beach, each of us has helped others in need. We\u2019ve helped slow the spread and flatten the curve. I know it\u2019s been tough, but I thank everybody for doing the right thing.\u201d Ocean rock pools in Randwick will remain closed until further notice as they are subject to a public health order to close. The ABC is reporting that there has been another death at the Newmarch House aged care home in Western Sydney after a 94-year-old resident died this morning. It\u2019s the second death at the aged care home, after a 93-year-old man died yesterday. The New South Wales health minister Dr Kerry Chant said this morning that there were now 39 confirmed cases from the aged care home, including 13 staff. That\u2019s an increase of nine cases from yesterday. The outbreak occurred after a staff member attended work without realising she was infected. Queensland recorded four new cases of Covid-19 overnight, taking the state\u2019s total to 1,019. The state\u2019s health department says 275 of those cases remain active. Thanks to Josh, as always. Police in New South Wales charged seven people and issued 45 fines for alleged breaches of Public Health Orders in the past 24 hours. A few of the fines handed out included: A 43-year-old man who was stopped by police in Kings Cross just after midnight. The man was driving a McLaren 650S in Potts Point. He told officers he was driving to Woolloomooloo to get petrol. After being warned, he informed officers driving is a form of exercise. The man and his 60-year-old passenger were each issued a $1000 fine. The driver allegedly told police \u201cdo what you want mate, I don\u2019t care. This $1,000 fine won\u2019t hurt with my $15m.\u201d At about 8.40am, officers attended a home in Auburn and found four men congregating in a small room, with one man hiding behind the door. Only one of the four men, a 39-year-old, resided at the address and no one in the group \u2013 including a 25-year-old man from Guildford, a 36-year-old man from another Auburn address and a 40-year-old man from Fairfield East \u2013 are related. They were each issued a $1,000 fine. At about 12.30am, officers stopped and spoke to a 29-year-old man in Pendle Hill. The man was issued a $1,000 fine after telling police he was out to go a visit a friend. At about 2am, officers stopped and spoke to a 19-year-old woman in Enmore. The woman was issued a $1,000 fine after telling officers she was going to pay rent in Lakemba and then drive to Cabramatta to buy a pork roll. Just after 4pm, officers spoke with a 22-year-old man at a shopping centre in Mt Druitt about being in a public place without a reasonable excuse. The man had previously been warned and after telling police he was on his way to a friend\u2019s house to \u201csmoke weed\u201d he was subsequently issued a $1,000 fine. At about 12.50am officers attended a home in Merewether, Newcastle, following reports of a party. Police found six people sitting on an upstairs balcony area. Three people were directed to leave as it was not their place of residence. One of the men \u2013 aged 40 \u2013 allegedly refused to leave and yelled at police. He eventually complied and together with a 49-year-old man and a 50-year-old woman, they were issued a $1,000 fine. Good afternoon, I am now handing back the blog to Michael McGowan. A handy bit of information from the agriculture department about Australia\u2019s food security situation: \u201cAustralia imports just over 10% of domestically consumed food and beverages, to meet consumer preferences for taste and variety. It is unlikely \u2013 but possible \u2013 that Covid-19 could disrupt these supply chains temporarily, resulting in inconvenience for some consumers. This would not threaten the food security of most Australians.\u201d You can read the full report here. On the coronavirus contact tracing app again, just worth noting that the deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly said yesterday that the app would not track location, so it is similar to the Singapore app in that respect. Just a bit more on the NSW government fines for spitting and coughing: \u201cUnfortunately, there have now also been incidents in which retail staff and transport staff have also been subjected to this disgusting, dangerous behaviour, and it will not be tolerated,\u201d NSW health minister Brad Hazzard said. \u201cEvery worker in this Covid-19 crisis is now an essential worker and will have the added protection they deserve, including those in retail stores and those critical to our public transport system. OK, I\u2019m going to hand you over to my colleague Josh Taylor while I take a short break. There have been no new cases of Covid-19 in the ACT for the sixth straight day. The territory still has 103 confirmed cases, 89 of which have recovered. The 14 remaining cases are self-isolating at home, meaning there are currently no cases in Canberra hospitals. The ACT has recorded three deaths in total during the pandemic. A fascinating story from my colleague in San Francisco, Lois Beckett, on protests against Covid-19 restrictions in the US. A day after the US president Donald Trump encouraged Americans to protest against strict public health measures, demonstrations were held in state capitals in Maryland, Texas and Ohio. Hundreds of people stood shoulder-to-shoulder at the Texas Capitol on Saturday, chanting \u201cFire Fauci!\u201d as part of a protest organized by the conspiracy theory site InfoWars. Anthony Fauci is the top public health expert on the White House coronavirus taskforce. Bowen is asked whether Australia should \u201ctrust\u201d China in the wake of the spread of Covid-19. He says \u201ctrust is something that is earned and something constantly reinforced by good actions and by full accountability\u201d. Everybody around the world would want to trust China. Whether that is the case or not depends on the quality of information provided and whether it is credible. Of course we would call on the Chinese government to be as upfront as possible at all times with the information they provided. Looking back, could China have done more in relation to accountability and transparency earlier in this crisis? Yes. Many countries could have done more and better. In relation to trust, it is something which is not static \u2013 it\u2019s something that is owned and maintained through being truthful and honest at all times. Shadow health minister Chris Bowen is speaking in Sydney. He says his \u201cinclination\u201d would be to download the government\u2019s Covid-19 tracing app. My inclination would be to support efforts by downloading the app, but whether you are an MP, an ordinary Australian, any Australian, you are entitled to know more before being asked to download it. Like all Australians, I would look at the proposal being put forward by the prime minister. I\u2019d look at all that information to see if it\u2019s something I wanted to do. If the government is trying to do something positive with Covid-19, we\u2019ve supported that as opposition and as individuals, but we are all entitled to see much more detail and accountability. Quickly back to New South Wales, Hazzard is asked about that figure of 700 fewer deaths than projected. He says on the state government\u2019s early predictions it had been preparing for 700 deaths. He says that\u2019s a \u201cconservative\u201d figure and that \u201c700 lives have been saved\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re doing very well but let\u2019s not get too excited at this point because as Dr Chant has said we\u2019re barely halfway through the first quarter of this very long game.\u201d Government services minister Stuart Robert has slapped down former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce for refusing to download the government\u2019s Covid-19 tracking app. Joyce told the Nine Newspaper on Sunday he would not download the app, citing privacy concerns. \u201cI treasure the government knowing as little about me as possible,\u201d Joyce told Nine newspapers on Sunday. But Stuart, who has said the app would not track people\u2019s location, said Joyce did not understand the purpose of the app. \u201cLook Barnaby, no one wants to know where you\u2019ve gone, pal, we are not interested. And plus the app doesn\u2019t do geolocation,\u201d the minister told 2GB/4BC radio on Sunday. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in where you are on the face of the earth.\u201d Stuart said the Bluetooth connecting app aims to digitise the present manual process and collects four things \u2013 name, mobile number, age and postcode. \u201cIf you\u2019re within one and a half metres of someone else with the app for more than 15 minutes, both of those apps swap mobile numbers or details,\u201d Robert said. \u201cThen, if you confirm positive for the virus, that information goes to a secure national data store, then straight to state health authorities and then they can call people you\u2019ve been in contact with, or, they can call you if you\u2019ve been in contact with someone.\u201d Hazzard has announced the $5,000 on-the-spot fine for people who spit or cough at healthcare workers has been extended now to include all workers. Assistant police minister Karen Webb says that overnight, a 25-year-old man from Nowra was arrested for a number of offences including allegedly spitting at police officers. Tony Smith, the state secretary of the fast food and retail workers union, has welcomed the extension of the fines. Just in the last last week, I\u2019ve had four matters raised with me by members across the state from people deliberately coughing or spitting on people ... It is vile and it is disgusting and unacceptable. New South Wales health minister Brad Hazzard is providing an update on new cases in the state. He says to 8pm last night there were 21 new cases of Covid-19, taking the state\u2019s total number of confirmed cases to 2,957. There are 245 people being treated in hospital, including 21 in intensive care and 17 on ventilators. There are nine new cases at the Newmarch aged care home in western Sydney, where a 93-year-old man died yesterday. There are now 39 cases at the aged care home, including 13 staff. Hazzard says looking back to March when the state was seeing hundreds of new cases a day he \u201ccouldn\u2019t have imagined we would be doing as well as we are\u201d. He says the state were expecting \u201cup in the order of 700 deaths, possibly more\u201d. But, Hazzard says, there is still a long way to go. \u201cWe\u2019re doing much better than we could have expected at this point but I also want to remind the community this is a long game. It\u2019s a team game. Probably at this point we aren\u2019t very far into the game. Extending the sport metaphor, Hazzard says that during a conversation with the chief health officer Kerry Chant he \u201cwondered aloud whether we were at the end of the first quarter\u201d. She looked at me and said minister probably if we\u2019re lucky we\u2019re 10 minutes into the first quarter. There is no room here for us to forget this is a long game and a game with a lot more to go. Health minister Greg Hunt and government services minister Stuart Robert have been out over the weekend explaining a bit more about the coronavirus contact tracing app. Firstly, it will be open source, meaning the public can have more confidence that the app is only doing what it says it is going to do, and not collecting any more data than required. Robert also said the privacy impact assessment would be made public and the government would delete the data once the pandemic is over. Hunt said around 40% of the population would need to be using the app in order for it to be effective. You can find out more about the app by reading our explainer. Labor\u2019s shadow foreign affairs minister Penny Wong describes the arrest of major pro-democracy figures in Hong Kong in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic as \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d The prime minister, Scott Morrison, will still make a commemorative address at the Australian War Memorial\u2019s empty Dawn Service on Anzac day. Anzac Day memorials will not go ahead as usual this year. Instead, the Dawn Service at the War Memorial will be broadcast nationally, while the Returned Services League has started a #lightupthedawn campaign year asking Australians to stand in their driveway, balcony or living room, with a torch or candle, immediately following in the televised dawn service \u201cANZAC day is a sacred day for all Australians. It is an important time to remember the sacrifices of those who have gone before us, those who have laid down their lives or suffered great hardship to protect Australians\u2019 way of life,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cThis year, we will not be gathering at the local cenotaph, or attending gunfire breakfasts at the local RSL, or gathering together to bow our heads in silence and listen to the bugles at dawn. \u201cBut we will still remember the sacrifice of those who gave so much for us at Gallipoli and on many fronts, as we ourselves give what we can to protect Australian lives while we face this terrible virus.\u201d The dawn service will still include a ceremonial piper, didgeridoo player and bugler among other traditional elements, supplied by the Australian Defence Force. The New South Wales shadow minister for health, Ryan Park, is speaking in Port Kembla addressing the delayed departure of the Ruby Princess cruise ship. Can I say it is time the New South Wales government through the minister outline exactly what are the plans to get this ship moving. We don\u2019t want to see this ship move until we\u2019ve got a guarantee that the crew\u2019s safety and wellbeing is paramount and is assured. What we don\u2019t know is what is the criteria? What will the criteria be to allow this ship to set sail? What will be the health criteria, because we know that New South Wales police have effectively said it is up to [the] health [department] now to make the call about when this happens. Park, who is also the local MP in Port Kembla, says he wants to know where the ship\u2019s crew will be taken if they are deemed too sick to remain on board. Some joy! The Guardian is live-streaming the first six(!) hours of the One World: Together At Home event, organised by the World Health Organisation and Global Citizen in collaboration with Lady Gaga. The Guardian will be streaming the first six hours today. Stars appearing in the earlier part of the show include John Legend, Megan Rapinoe, the Killers, Samuel L Jackson, Jameela Jamil, Jennifer Hudson and many more. When I turned it on a little earlier Keith Urban was playing, though, so, you know, timing\u2019s everything I guess. Some housekeeping: This morning, we briefly reported that the national Covid-19 death toll was 70. It is actually 69. The mistake occurred because Queensland counts the death of any Queenslanders in its figures but two of those deaths have occurred in New South Wales and are counted there. On Saturday, both New South Wales and Queensland recorded deaths for the same person, an 83-year-old man who passed away in New South Wales after recently returning from the Celebrity Eclipse, an overseas cruise ship that docked in San Diego. On the government\u2019s Covid-19 tracing app, Hunt is asked whether any rollback of lockdown measures will be affected if the government fails to meet its target of having 40% of the population download the app. It is a goal, but anything which adds to our tracing capability, adds to our ability to protect those who might have been inadvertently infected. What this is about is protecting those who might have been inadvertently in contact, inadvertently infected, and any uptake increases our capacity to help with the contact tracing which increases our capacity to save lives and protect lives, to protect our health workers and to limit the spread. Greg Hunt backs foreign affairs minister Marise Payne\u2019s call for an independent review of the global response to Covid-19, including the role of the World Health Organisation. He also takes a swipe at the WHO\u2019s handling of the crisis in the process. What we have seen is Australia has been able to have, by global standards, just a profoundly important and successful human outcome, but we have done that by following the course that our medical experts here in Australia set out. We do know there was very considerable criticism when we imposed on the 1 February the China ban from some of the officials and the WHO in Geneva. The regional body has done well in terms of polio, measles, malaria, but what we saw from some officials in Geneva, we think was a response which didn\u2019t help the world. We have done well because we made our own decisions as a country. Federal health minister Greg Hunt is speaking in Victoria. He says national cabinet will meet this week to discuss the resumption of elective surgery and IVF treatments after a boost of PPE supply. Hunt announced Australia has received a shipment of 60 million masks two weeks earlier than expected, which \u201copens up the possibility of elective surgery and in particular, IVF, recommencing at an earlier date than had previously been thought possible\u201d. National cabinet is meeting on Tuesday and Thursday. \u201cThe elective surgery decision was made on two grounds, one was PPE, of which masks were critical [and] the second was the concern that if the coronavirus had grown dramatically, our hospitals would have been under intense pressure. \u201cAt this point, Australians have done magnificently and we are not facing a threat to our hospitals, now it is about securing the master and PPE and today is an important part of that and laying the foundation for this week on the road out.\u201d Hunt says there are currently 6,586 cases of Covid-19 in Australia. Of those, 185 are in hospitals, 51 in ICU, 33 on ventilation. The rate of increase of new cases has been less than 1% for seven consecutive days. News Corp is reporting that a woman who was forcibly quarantined at a Sydney hotel after returning from overseas tested positive for coronavirus immediately after being cleared for release. News.com.au reports the woman, in her 20s, felt \u201cweird\u201d and suspected she had been infected with Covid-19 on her travels, but was refused access to testing while in police lockdown. The woman said she had no contact with healthcare workers until she was contacted by a nurse in the second week of her quarantine. She told the nurse she was experiencing mild symptoms but was told she didn\u2019t need to be inspected further. After she left quarantine she arranged to be tested and received a positive result. Health experts have expressed concerns about Australia\u2019s policy of forcing returning travellers to quarantine inside hotels. One Sydney doctor who has been treating returned travellers ordered into forced hotel isolation in NSW told the Guardian the situation was a \u201cdisaster\u201d and said people are in conditions \u201cworse than prison\u201d. In Western Australia an investigation was launched after a man ended up in an induced coma in intensive care despite his wife allegedly calling for a doctor nearly nine hours before he was admitted to hospital. Speaking on the ABC right now Sydney Kings star Andrew Bogut says he wouldn\u2019t want to return to playing in the near future, saying it could set the wrong example while Australians were still locked down in their homes. I think if we are urging the community and cafes and restaurants and everyday workers to not open their business and be around people, then I think we as athletes can\u2019t be hypocritical and we probably need to wait until things are good and safe enough to go. Because we know that children and everyone, even adults around the world look up to us. If we\u2019re out there playing on a field they might think why can\u2019t I go to the beach and hang out with my family or go to the pub. There is more than just playing sport and we want everything to be safe before we get out there. Victoria police issued 65 fines for breaches of public health orders in the past 24 hours. Victoria have issued more than 1,000 fines since the lockdown rules came into place, far more than any other state. Since 21 March, police in Victoria have conducted a total of 24,102 spot checks of homes and businesses. AAP reports that flu vaccine manufacturing is being ramped up this season in the hope higher public immunity to influenza will free up hospitals to focus on coronavirus. Melbourne manufacturer Seqirus has partnered with the federal government to make an additional two million influenza vaccines for the 2020 flu season, with nine million vaccines in total to be distributed across the country. The company says there is already strong early demand for flu vaccines. \u201cThis is a positive trend, because we know that flu vaccination programs will be more important than ever due to the Covid-19 pandemic,\u201d Seqirus executive director Danielle Dowell told AAP. The additional vaccines will be available through GP clinics, pharmacies and immunisation providers. Of Australians stranded overseas, Payne says that three flights returned from the Philippines this morning landing in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. She calls it \u201ca mammoth effort\u201d. She says the government is working on further flights from India, where there are more than 6,000 Australians who have registered with the high commission there who want to come home. There\u2019s been a number of flights which have left from India supported by the high commission in India. As you know, it is also in lockdown. The different states have different rules. We are processing people to be able to be able to travel across those areas. We are also very focused on making sure that every single Australian who needs an application to leave India has that facilitated by the high commission. We are in discussions with a number of other airlines for the coming week to endeavour to identify further flights. But these are challenging times. Payne says it was \u201cregrettable\u201d that an Australian air force plane which was delivering supplies to Vanuatu after Cyclone Harold was unable to land because a Chinese plane would not move from the runway. The supplies were delivered on April 12 ... There was an A-320 on the tarmac on the Sunday which had been unloading stores delivered from China. The unloading took a long period of time and the plane was still on the tarmac unexpectedly for Australia on the Sunday. Speers asks Payne whether the Chinese plane had \u201cdeliberately\u201d tried to prevent Australia from landing. We have raised our concerns with officials in Vanuatu and in appropriate places with the Chinese government. I don\u2019t know whether it was deliberate or not, David. I wasn\u2019t there. But what is most important is that countries like Australia, countries like Australia and New Zealand working together, and others in the region, are able to support our Pacific neighbours in the way that is so important now. Payne says relationships between Australia and China \u201cwill be changed in some ways\u201d. What is really important is, in my view, in our view, how the world comes together now to cooperate, to rebuild, is absolutely key to this.\u201d Speers asks her whether the government\u2019s trust in China has been \u201ceroded\u201d by the crisis. She says the government \u201cwould be very clear that we believe transparency is essential\u201d. All of these things will need to be reviewed, will need to be considered in the light of changes in the world economy. In the light of changes in international health security. And so many other things. And that is the work that we are doing at the moment. Pressed for an answer, Payne finally says: \u201cI trust China in terms of the work that we need to do together.\u201d David Speers is interviewing foreign affairs minister Marise Payne on Insiders. He asks her \u201cwhat questions\u201d she\u2019d like China to answer about the origins of Covid-19, after ministers including Peter Dutton have criticised China\u2019s handling of the virus in recent days. She says she wants to see a global independent review, and \u201ctransparency\u201d from all countries. Well, we need to know the sorts of details that an independent review would identify for us about the genesis of the virus, about the approaches to dealing with it. and addressing it. [As well as] about the openness with which information was shared [and] interaction with the World Health Organisation into action with other international leaders. She says it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate for the World Health Organisation to run such a review. Payne says the government shares \u201cconcerns\u201d about the WHO\u2019s handling of the virus. \u201cWe share some of the concerns that the United States have identified in relation to the World Health Organisation. That is certainly correct. I think it is about an independent mechanism, and I\u2019m not sure that you can have the health organisation which has been responsible for disseminating much of the international communications material, and doing much of the early engagement and investigative work, also as the review mechanism. That strikes me as something poacher and gamekeeper. Anglicare have released a statement following the death of a 93-year-old resident yesterday. In a statement the Anglicare CEO Grant Millard said the man had \u201cmultiple health issues\u201d along with his positive Covid-19 diagnosis. We know this is a very difficult time for you all and one which can cause significant anxiety. Anglicare management has put in place a number of measures to maximise the safety and wellbeing of those in our home. Millard said Nepean hospital had established a \u201chospital in the home\u201d which would mean all residents who have tested Covid-19 positive in Newmarch will still be cared for in the home, but with \u201caccess to hospital resources and with oversight by hospital specialists in infectious diseases, as if in the hospital setting\u201d. This will mean, if required, more intensive supports can be brought into the home under the direction of the hospital specialist. Anglicare is also sourcing more staff on site to ensure adequate coverage of care for all residents as well as recruiting some staff who are specifically dedicated to working with residents who have tested positive. The aged care facility has seen a major outbreak after a staff member worked for six days without knowing she had the virus. Foreign affairs minister Marise Payne will join David Speers on the ABC\u2019s Insiders this morning. I\u2019ll bring you any highlights from the interview. What does the road out of lockdown look like? My colleague Ben Doherty has looked to what overseas countries are doing as a guide to how an exit strategy might look. Don\u2019t get too excited though: the Nine newspapers this morning quote Peter Collignon, a professor of microbiology at the Australian National University, saying he doesn\u2019t expect pubs to be open until September. The New South Wales government has announced an additional $25m to help fast-track research and clinical trials aimed at stopping the spread of Covid-19. The funds are part of about $800m in extra health funding allocated by the government to bolster the health system last month. NSW health minister Brad Hazzard said the funding would be directed to research on: accurate and timely diagnosis of Covid-19; support conducting Covid-19 clinical trials including vaccine trials; monitoring, developing and evaluating strategies to slow community transmission; developing and evaluating treatments for Covid-19. Andrews also said during that interview that he expected Victorian schools to remain closed throughout term 2. That\u2019s despite calls from Scott Morrison for schools to reopen as soon as possible, and NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian\u2019s decision to have students return via a roster. Andrews said it was \u201ccommon sense\u201d that students being at school would contribute to the spread of the virus. \u201cThe Victorian chief health officer has a very firm view (that schools should be closed),\u201d he told Sky. \u201c[But] if we were continuing to see very stable numbers \u2026 then of course we would always reserve the right to look at those restrictions.\u201d Victoria has recorded its 15th death overnight, the premier Daniel Andrews has confirmed. Speaking on Sky News, Andrews said a man in his 80s died overnight in hospital. Andrews said the state had recorded nine new cases overnight. As the prime minister, Scott Morrison, urges Australians to download its new Covid-19 tracing app it appears some MPs aren\u2019t so keen. The Nine newspapers are reporting former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce is refusing to download the app. He\u2019s quoted this morning as saying: \u201cI treasure the government knowing as little about me as possible\u201d. Others including the Labor MP Julian Hill told the paper he was not inclined to download it, but \u201cmay be persuaded\u201d if privacy concerns were addressed. Morrison has said the app will not be mandatory, but the government wants more than 40% of Australians to download it to increase its effectiveness. On Saturday the government services minister, Stuart Robert, said there would be no surveillance, geo-location or tracking in the app. Good morning, it\u2019s 19 April. Welcome to today\u2019s live coverage of all things Covid-19. Here\u2019s a quick wrap of what we learned yesterday: Australia recorded four new Covid-19 deaths. Three were in New South Wales; a 58-year-old woman, an 83-year-old Queensland man who died in Sydney and a 93-year-old man who was a resident of Newmarch House, an aged care facility where there has been an outbreak of the virus. A 74-year-old man also died in Tasmania\u2019s Mersey hospital. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the government\u2019s coronavirus contact tracing app would not be compulsory. The government services minister, Stuart Robert, said the app would not be a surveillance device. The Artania cruise ship departed Western Australia with 300 crew and 11 passengers on board. The Queensland government has offered $200m to struggling airline Virgin Australia, but with a number of conditions, including that the company keeps its headquarters in Brisbane. The deputy chief medical officer said as growth in new infections slowed, Australia needed to expand its testing regime to make it more proactive, rather than waiting for cases to present at hospitals and medical practices.",

Fauci was <a href=\"https://history.nih.gov/nihinownwords/assets/media/pdf/publications/NI917687.pdf\">one of the first scientists</a> to document \u201csevere opportunistic infections among apparently previously healthy homosexual men\u201d. His lab at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) led the charge for a cure, and he became the public face of the government\u2019s fight to stop the virus.</p> <p>In the intervening 30 years, Fauci has continued his life\u2019s work, leading the effort to contain infectious diseases from Sars to Ebola to swine flu. Trump, meanwhile, has gone from playboy to TV star to US president.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fa27f770298203f683e5dec1edabb73ec19de468\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa27f770298203f683e5dec1edabb73ec19de468/0_0_2973_1982/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump arrives behind Dr. Anthony Fauci for the start of the daily coronavirus response briefing in Washington.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump arrives behind Dr. Anthony Fauci for the start of the daily coronavirus response briefing in Washington.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Brenner/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That last extraordinary leap, and the rise in the last four months of the deadly Covid-19 pandemic, has now created a most unlikely and delicate partnership between Trump and Fauci on which the future of the country hinges. The two men appear to share little by way of philosophy, but each night they share a stage in front of a scared nation in the grip of a terrifying pandemic; a nation looking to these two very different men to save it from further disaster.</p> <p>For Fauci, 79, facing down this coronavirus is a date with destiny he has been working his entire life toward. For Trump, 73, the coronavirus is a rare brush with accountability, a moment when boasts and threats and lies do not work.</p> <p>To achieve success according to their respective definitions of the word, the two men need each other. Trump needs Fauci to shore up fading public trust in his administration\u2019s disaster response. Fauci needs Trump to take action that saves lives.</p> <p>Their purposes have been mostly \u2013 though not always \u2013 well aligned. But the rise of an anti-Fauci movement on the political right \u2013 and the president\u2019s frequent intolerance for being overshadowed \u2013 have fueled concerns that for all its practical necessity, and the stakes for the nation, the Fauci-Trump partnership could come to pieces.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Tony was just a master at relationships</p> <footer> <cite>Derek Hodel, worked with Fauci in the 1990s</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If that happens, said Derek Hodel, a senior program adviser at Physicians for Human Rights who worked with Fauci as an Aids activist and advocate in the 1990s, it would be a rare defeat for Fauci\u2019s political skills.</p> <p>\u201cTony was just a master at relationships,\u201d Hodel said. \u201cThis is his sixth administration, and although the dynamics of the Trump administration are louder and crazier than any other administration, they\u2019re not all of them different.\u201d</p> <p>After graduating at the top of his class from Cornell medical school in the Vietnam war era, Fauci fulfilled a public health service requirement by taking a researcher post at NIAID, where he became director in 1984. He would spend the next five decades there, surfacing in the public eye whenever the country was confronted with the specter of bio-terror (anthrax) or deadly contagion (Ebola).</p> <p>Working with the current president, Fauci appears to sense that keeping his job depends on keeping Trump happy. When he has contradicted Trump, he has usually done so gently.</p> <p>When Trump pushed the lupus drug hydroxychloroquine as a miracle cure, Fauci said: \u201cIn terms of science, I don\u2019t think we can definitively say it works.\u201d Asked <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/i-m-going-keep-pushing-anthony-fauci-tries-make-white-house-listen-facts-pandemic\">by Science magazine</a> why he did not rebut Trump\u2019s overblown claims about the efficacy of a ban on foreign travelers from China, Fauci said: \u201cLet\u2019s get real, what do you want me to do? \u2026 I can\u2019t jump in front of the microphone and push him down.\u201d</p> <p>The White House last week dismissed questions about tension between Trump and Fauci as \u201cmedia chatter\u201d and said: \u201cPresident Trump is not firing Dr Fauci.\u201d</p> <p>But the drumbeat of calls for Fauci to be ousted have been promoted most aggressively by pro-Trump zealots in the far-right media ecosystem \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanhatesthis/youtube-anthony-fauci-deep-state-coronavirus#4ldqpgc\">political bomb-throwers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/13/anti-vaccine-activists-fire-fauci-furor-185001\">medical quacks</a> and an unknown number of <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/foreign-disinformation-is-stoking-coronavirus-fears-us-officials-say-2020-03-16\">foreign bots</a> posing as American internet users.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"eb0d6ce9ed4062e5d2982cdfc3628e81cf2690e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb0d6ce9ed4062e5d2982cdfc3628e81cf2690e2/43_0_2944_1955/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr. Anthony Fauci (R) lecturing to Pres.

Last week, Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1249470237726081030\">retweeted</a> one Fauci critic with the hashtag #FireFauci.</p> <p>The voices are growing louder. The Republican congressman Andy Biggs of Arizona <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RepAndyBiggsAZ/status/1249762423214608387?s=20\">said</a> on a radio show last week: \u201cI think it\u2019s time for Dr Fauci to move along \u2026 He\u2019s emasculated the economy and is just totally tone-deaf on that.\u201d</p> <p>The far-right commentator Laura Ingraham <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IngrahamAngle/status/1250462822577975296\">complained</a> last week that it was \u201ctime to get your freedom back\u201d, tweeting footage of people sitting in a line of cars in a Michigan protest against social distancing. The more extreme critics accuse Fauci of being a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/13/anti-vaccine-activists-fire-fauci-furor-185001\">deep state plant</a>\u201d with a shadowy agenda.</p> <p>It is not the first time Fauci has encountered blowback from telling hard scientific truths.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Decades ago, [Fauci] said things that we didn\u2019t want to hear ... about the pace of research, about the inability to pull a cure out of his hat</p> <footer> <cite>Derek Hodel</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cDecades ago, he said things that we didn\u2019t want to hear,\u201d said Hodel, the Aids activist. \u201cHe said a lot of things we did want to hear as well, but he said a lot of things we didn\u2019t want to hear, about the pace of research, about the inability to pull a cure out of his hat, about the need for safe sex, early on.\u201d</p> <p>As a boy in Brooklyn growing up in the postwar boom years, Fauci delivered prescriptions on his bicycle for the family business, a pharmacy. He went to Catholic schools and at 5ft 7in was a standout basketball star. He was awarded the presidential medal of freedom, the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor, in 2008. Fauci has been married 35 years, has three daughters, is an avid jogger and \u2013 in contrast to the \u201cexecutive time\u201d loving president \u2013 is also a notoriously industrious worker who frequently clocks 15 hour days.</p> <p> On his philosophy for working with political leaders, Fauci has <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/04/20/how-anthony-fauci-became-americas-doctor\">told</a> the New Yorker\u2019s Michael Specter that he \u201crelies on the pseudo-Latin expression Illegitimi non carborundum: don\u2019t let the bastards grind you down.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6c45330b2742373c13f95a44ca354e45c3855006\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c45330b2742373c13f95a44ca354e45c3855006/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fauci speaks to NBC on the pandemic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Anthony Fauci speaks to NBC on the pandemic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou stay completely apolitical and non-ideological, and you stick to what it is that you do,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cI\u2019m a scientist and I\u2019m a physician. And that\u2019s it.\u201d</p> <p>An adamant 78% majority of Americans approves of Fauci\u2019s performance, according to a <a href=\"https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=3658\">Quinnipiac poll</a> this month that found Trump\u2019s approval rating at 46%.</p> <p>Hodel said Fauci was motivated by a lifelong dedication to science and by an equal dedication to people.</p> <p>\u201cI have great confidence in Dr Fauci\u2019s ability to maintain his integrity and to speak the truth.

The Associated Press reported in 1991 that Trump \u201casks women to take an Aids test at his doctor\u2019s office before he wines and dines them\u201d. Over the same decade, in Bethesda, Maryland, grappling with the HIV epidemic became the life\u2019s work of a fellow New York native, Dr Anthony Fauci. Fauci was one of the first scientists to document \u201csevere opportunistic infections among apparently previously healthy homosexual men\u201d. His lab at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) led the charge for a cure, and he became the public face of the government\u2019s fight to stop the virus. In the intervening 30 years, Fauci has continued his life\u2019s work, leading the effort to contain infectious diseases from Sars to Ebola to swine flu. Trump, meanwhile, has gone from playboy to TV star to US president. That last extraordinary leap, and the rise in the last four months of the deadly Covid-19 pandemic, has now created a most unlikely and delicate partnership between Trump and Fauci on which the future of the country hinges. The two men appear to share little by way of philosophy, but each night they share a stage in front of a scared nation in the grip of a terrifying pandemic; a nation looking to these two very different men to save it from further disaster. For Fauci, 79, facing down this coronavirus is a date with destiny he has been working his entire life toward. For Trump, 73, the coronavirus is a rare brush with accountability, a moment when boasts and threats and lies do not work. To achieve success according to their respective definitions of the word, the two men need each other. Trump needs Fauci to shore up fading public trust in his administration\u2019s disaster response. Fauci needs Trump to take action that saves lives. Their purposes have been mostly \u2013 though not always \u2013 well aligned. But the rise of an anti-Fauci movement on the political right \u2013 and the president\u2019s frequent intolerance for being overshadowed \u2013 have fueled concerns that for all its practical necessity, and the stakes for the nation, the Fauci-Trump partnership could come to pieces. If that happens, said Derek Hodel, a senior program adviser at Physicians for Human Rights who worked with Fauci as an Aids activist and advocate in the 1990s, it would be a rare defeat for Fauci\u2019s political skills. \u201cTony was just a master at relationships,\u201d Hodel said. \u201cThis is his sixth administration, and although the dynamics of the Trump administration are louder and crazier than any other administration, they\u2019re not all of them different.\u201d After graduating at the top of his class from Cornell medical school in the Vietnam war era, Fauci fulfilled a public health service requirement by taking a researcher post at NIAID, where he became director in 1984. He would spend the next five decades there, surfacing in the public eye whenever the country was confronted with the specter of bio-terror (anthrax) or deadly contagion (Ebola). Working with the current president, Fauci appears to sense that keeping his job depends on keeping Trump happy. When he has contradicted Trump, he has usually done so gently. When Trump pushed the lupus drug hydroxychloroquine as a miracle cure, Fauci said: \u201cIn terms of science, I don\u2019t think we can definitively say it works.\u201d Asked by Science magazine why he did not rebut Trump\u2019s overblown claims about the efficacy of a ban on foreign travelers from China, Fauci said: \u201cLet\u2019s get real, what do you want me to do? \u2026 I can\u2019t jump in front of the microphone and push him down.\u201d The White House last week dismissed questions about tension between Trump and Fauci as \u201cmedia chatter\u201d and said: \u201cPresident Trump is not firing Dr Fauci.\u201d But the drumbeat of calls for Fauci to be ousted have been promoted most aggressively by pro-Trump zealots in the far-right media ecosystem \u2013 political bomb-throwers, medical quacks and an unknown number of foreign bots posing as American internet users. The critics blame Fauci and his fellow scientists for the economic misery tied to the government\u2019s social distancing recommendations \u2013 omitting any calculation of what economic and human disaster would result if the viral floodgates were opened. There are indications that the online mob is gaining traction with the president and other elected officials \u2013 and with the American public. Last week, Trump retweeted one Fauci critic with the hashtag #FireFauci. The voices are growing louder. The Republican congressman Andy Biggs of Arizona said on a radio show last week: \u201cI think it\u2019s time for Dr Fauci to move along \u2026 He\u2019s emasculated the economy and is just totally tone-deaf on that.\u201d The far-right commentator Laura Ingraham complained last week that it was \u201ctime to get your freedom back\u201d, tweeting footage of people sitting in a line of cars in a Michigan protest against social distancing. The more extreme critics accuse Fauci of being a \u201cdeep state plant\u201d with a shadowy agenda. It is not the first time Fauci has encountered blowback from telling hard scientific truths. \u201cDecades ago, he said things that we didn\u2019t want to hear,\u201d said Hodel, the Aids activist. \u201cHe said a lot of things we did want to hear as well, but he said a lot of things we didn\u2019t want to hear, about the pace of research, about the inability to pull a cure out of his hat, about the need for safe sex, early on.\u201d As a boy in Brooklyn growing up in the postwar boom years, Fauci delivered prescriptions on his bicycle for the family business, a pharmacy. He went to Catholic schools and at 5ft 7in was a standout basketball star. He was awarded the presidential medal of freedom, the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor, in 2008. Fauci has been married 35 years, has three daughters, is an avid jogger and \u2013 in contrast to the \u201cexecutive time\u201d loving president \u2013 is also a notoriously industrious worker who frequently clocks 15 hour days. On his philosophy for working with political leaders, Fauci has told the New Yorker\u2019s Michael Specter that he \u201crelies on the pseudo-Latin expression Illegitimi non carborundum: don\u2019t let the bastards grind you down. \u201cYou stay completely apolitical and non-ideological, and you stick to what it is that you do,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cI\u2019m a scientist and I\u2019m a physician. And that\u2019s it.\u201d An adamant 78% majority of Americans approves of Fauci\u2019s performance, according to a Quinnipiac poll this month that found Trump\u2019s approval rating at 46%. Hodel said Fauci was motivated by a lifelong dedication to science and by an equal dedication to people. \u201cI have great confidence in Dr Fauci\u2019s ability to maintain his integrity and to speak the truth. And this is probably not the first time that his career was at risk. I can also say with great confidence that when history is written, Dr Fauci will be the hero.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been asked \u2013 and we\u2019ve asked ourselves \u2013 why <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-latest-at-a-glance-thursday\">Covid-19</a> seems to be impacting Princess so heavily.\u201d Thus spoke Jan Swartz, president of Princess Cruises, in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZC1jVkY9hqE\">video posted</a> on social media in mid-March. She looks sad-eyed and baffled into the camera: \u201cWe don\u2019t really know.\u201d Perhaps, she muses, the problem is something to do with the \u201cdiverse mix of people onboard our ships\u201d and is \u201cbeing magnified by our core values to respect, protect and connect the world\u201d. She implores her \u201cguests\u201d with a \u201csimple request\u201d: \u201cWe ask you to book a future Princess cruise to your dream destination \u2026 as a symbol to the world that the things that connect us are stronger than those that divide us.\u201d </p> <p>Her company does seem to have been terribly unlucky. Their <a href=\"https://www.ship-technology.com/news/covid-19-diamond-princess-cruise-ship-eighth-death/\">Diamond Princess</a>, quarantined off Yokohama, which suffered over 700 infections and eight deaths among its passengers and crew, was a conspicuous early victim of the pandemic, its global fame growing on wry-turning-to-desperate postings from its passengers. The Ruby Princess, from which 2,700 passengers disembarked in Sydney on March 19, became the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/criminal-investigation-launched-ruby-princess-cruise-ship-coronavirus-disaster\">single largest source of Covid-19 cases in Australia</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/from-paradise-to-coronavirus-the-grand-princess-and-the-cruise-from-hell\">Grand Princess</a> was stuck outside San Francisco, its passengers confined to their cabins, after an outbreak in early March. Something similar happened to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/coral-princess-cruise-ship-docks-florida-coronavirus-pandemic\">Coral Princess</a> in early April, off the coast of Florida. And this to say nothing of the <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/tourism-cruises/article240761311.html\">Caribbean Princess</a>, which has twice this year had to end cruises early, due to hundreds falling ill from a quite different infection, the vomiting bug norovirus.</p> <p>But not everyone is yet convinced that all of Princess\u2019s misadventures are purely bad luck. New South Wales police have launched a criminal investigation into the Ruby Princess, to see whether its owners were \u201ctransparent in contextualising the true patient and crew health conditions relevant to Covid-19\u201d. They are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/criminal-investigation-launched-ruby-princess-cruise-ship-coronavirus-disaster\">suspected of lying</a>, in other words, about conditions on the ship. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-cruiseship-law/passengers-sue-over-coronavirus-hit-grand-princess-cruise-ship-idUSKBN20W30T\">Legal actions</a> have sprung up from unhappy \u201cguests\u201d of the Grand Princess, their trips-of-a-lifetime wrecked by allegedly inadequate screening procedures. Professor Kentaro Iwata, a Japanese expert on infectious diseases who went on to the Diamond Princess, described the onboard response to the virus as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/02/scientist-decries-completely-chaotic-conditions-cruise-ship-japan-quarantined-after#\">completely chaotic</a>\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a53e45a0502b247b90ec7290a5fd7ec3f7cf45e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a53e45a0502b247b90ec7290a5fd7ec3f7cf45e8/220_0_3280_1969/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Princess Cruises president, Jan Swartz, greets passengers from the Diamond Princess as they disembark after their quarantine on 20 February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Princess Cruises president, Jan Swartz, greets passengers from the Diamond Princess as they disembark after their quarantine on 20 February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Princess Cruises/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Princess is not alone in its troubles. It is one of several lines owned by Carnival Corporation, a giant and aggressive company, which as long ago as 1996 was reported by David Foster Wallace, in an <a href=\"https://harpers.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/HarpersMagazine-1996-01-0007859.pdf\">epic article</a> on the cruise experience, to be nicknamed \u201cCarnivore\u201d. Carnival\u2019s roughly <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_cruise_lines\">40% share of the market</a> also includes the Holland America line, which owns the Zaandam, which had to travel up the west coast of South America with sick and dying passengers on board, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/apr/07/zaandam-onboard-the-coronavirus-hit-cruise-ship\">Chile closed its ports</a>. Other ships, both owned by Carnival and not, have had outbreaks of disease or been denied permission to enter ports. All new cruises have now been suspended, with some provisionally scheduled to <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/cruises/articles/cruise-lines-suspending-operations-over-coronavirus/\">restart in May</a>.</p> <p>A rather obvious question is whether Covid-19 is simply an act of God, or whether its impact on their passengers, crew and host ports has been magnified by the practices of cruise companies. They vigorously push back against this suggestion: a spokesman for Carnival tells me that \u201cthe cruise industry took action before most other industries on land took actions\u201d, that \u201ccruise ships are social gathering places, but no less risky than any other social gathering venue\u201d, and asks \u201cwhen was the last time you were asked to fill out a health record before being allowed to enter a concert?\u201d In the case of the Diamond Princess, say Princess Cruises, they were following instructions from the Japanese health authorities.</p> <p>Trust on this question, on the other hand, is not improved by reports that some cruise-line salespeople (not Carnival), in mid-March, were being instructed to talk punters out of their concerns about Covid-19, for example claiming that the coronavirus could not survive in tropical climates and that therefore it was a good time to visit the Caribbean. Trust is further weakened by the cruise industry\u2019s long history of environmental and safety lapses, and their special skill at minimising the consequences to themselves.</p> <p>A bigger question is whether the virus will dent, deflect or alter what has been a phenomenon of our times, the many-times multiplication of ship sizes, of passenger numbers and of profits, generated by an industry that manufactures its own version of reality, then shapes the places that its ships visit in the image of that reality. Cruises, as Wallace put it, serve that \u201cpart of me that craves pampering and passive pleasure: the dissatisfied-infant part of me, the part that always and indiscriminately <em>wants</em>\u201d. Cruises are founded on fantasy, which means the removal from view of anything irksome or demanding of difficult choices.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8b9a1dd891f550306dbe490afdfde8ca614f95a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b9a1dd891f550306dbe490afdfde8ca614f95a5/0_46_1407_844/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Medics transport a body from the MS Zaandam, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, 2 April.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Medics transport a body from the MS Zaandam, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, 2 April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SMG/Zuma Press/PA Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cruise companies have been growing at least since the 1980s, with a 7.2% compounded <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemicallef/2020/01/20/state-of-the-cruise-industry-smooth-sailing-into-the-2020s/#46c597465fa2\">rate of revenue growth</a> from 2010 to 2019. Their ships, which were generally under 50,000 tons until the mid-90s, have become beasts of 220,000 tons and more. Alongside the growth in quantity has gone an ever-advancing science of customer experience, of investment in ice rinks, climbing walls, spas and casinos, in decking out ships like Vegas resorts, a process that reached some kind of apogee with the 5.260-passenger <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/cruises/news/venice-themed-cruise-ship-with-its-own-st-marks-square-built-for-chinese/\">Costa Venezia</a>. Aimed at the Asian market, this Venice-themed ship comes<strong> </strong>complete with gondola rides and a version of the Piazza San Marco. For cruising is above all an entertainment and hospitality industry, albeit grafted on to the serious engineering needed to keep large ships afloat.</p> <p>All of which might be good, clean fun, if the growth of cruises weren\u2019t accompanied by reports of pollution spills, outbreaks of disease, accidents, mistreatment of workers and sexual assaults and other crimes. If these reports don\u2019t change much over the decades it is because the cruise lines don\u2019t change much, either. They can spend lavishly on lobbying and campaign contributions to friendly politicians, and hire lawyers to see off the lawsuits when things go wrong. Their business being offshore, cruise lines are free to choose the countries where they register their ships and incorporate their business, which means places like Panama, the Bahamas or Bermuda, where they can <a href=\"https://thehustle.co/the-economics-of-cruise-ships/\">pay low taxes and get an easy ride</a> on labour rights, and on health, safety and environmental regulations.</p> <p>\u201cThey only change when they have to,\u201d says Ross Klein, a sociology professor at Memorial University in Newfoundland, whose website <a href=\"http://cruisejunkie.com/\">cruisejunkie.com</a> chronicles the mishaps of the cruise business. And nobody much makes them change. There is<strong> </strong>a trade body, the <a href=\"https://cruising.org/\">Cruise Lines International Association</a> (CLIA), which promotes the business and in theory upholds standards. \u201cThey will tell you that they have mandatory regulations and that they meet or exceed international regulations,\u201d says Klein. \u201cWell, we asked CLIA\u2019s senior vice-president what happens when a company violates these regulations: nothing. Perhaps a stern talking-to, but otherwise nothing.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It's not just the filth and damage that ships emit, but the superficial interaction that cruise ships generate</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Cruise companies\u2019 aversion to responsibility can be seen in a legendary court filing following the \u201c<a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2013/12/17/travel/carnival-cruise-triumph-problems/index.html\">poop cruise</a>\u201d of 2013, in which failing generators on the Carnival Triumph caused a backup of raw sewage into the passenger areas. Carnivals\u2019 lawyers, CNN reported, said that the \u201cticket contract makes absolutely no guarantee for safe passage, a seaworthy vessel, adequate and wholesome food, and sanitary and safe living conditions.\u201d Equally striking was the legal outcome to the 2012 wreck of the Costa Concordia, when the party atmosphere of cruises mixed fatally with questions of navigation: the owner Costa Crociere (another part of the Carnival empire), with the help of a plea bargain and \u20ac1m fine, and despite <a href=\"https://lloydslist.maritimeintelligence.informa.com/LL1120956/Marine-professionals-call-for-jailed-Costa-Concordia-masters-case-to-be-reviewed\">clear failings</a> on its part, was freed of any management and operational responsibility.</p> <p>Or you could take another incident that befell the ever unfortunate Princess Cruise lines, when the Caribbean Princess was found to have been dumping oily waste in the sea off southern England. In 2017 a Florida court found that the Caribbean and four more Princesses had been engaging in <a href=\"https://www.cruiselawnews.com/2016/12/articles/pollution/deliberate-dumping-coverup-and-lies-doj-fines-princess-cruises-40000000/\">illegal practices</a>, issued a <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/cruise-line-ordered-pay-40-million-illegal-dumping-oil-contaminated-waste-and-falsifying\">record fine of $40m</a> and put the company on probation for five years.

Among <a href=\"https://skift.com/2019/08/19/venices-big-money-conundrum-to-solving-its-cruise-ship-crisis/\">the complications</a> in finding a solution is the fact that Carnival, Royal Caribbean and other big cruise companies are shareholders of the company that owns Venice\u2019s maritime port.</p> <p>The issue is not just about the filth and damage that ships emit into Venetian air and water, but of the superficial interaction that cruise ships generate between passengers and their host city. Eleonora Sovrani, of the local campaign group <a href=\"https://weareherevenice.org/\">We Are Here Venice</a>, argues that the cruises\u2019 \u201cguests\u201d \u2013 on their brief visits, following itineraries proposed by the ships, visiting outlets suggested by them \u2013 never leave the cruise \u201cbubble\u201d.

In pre-virus Sydney, successive ships would be moored near the considerably smaller Opera House, almost permanently blocking certain views, while others would be waiting their turn out in the bay. Cruises have shown increasing enthusiasm for invading the Arctic and Antarctic, their paths eased by the melting of globally warmed ice, with many thousands of gawpers descending on tiny Inuit settlements. In New Zealand, Princess Cruises \u2013 hello, my old friend \u2013 were obliged to apologise for their crassness, after some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/02/cruise-company-apologises-after-staff-pose-as-maori-for-traditional-welcome\">non-Maori men</a> with DIY skirts and scribbles on their face were hired to perform an am-dram version of a traditional Maori welcome to passengers on the Golden Princess.</p> <p>To all these points<strong> </strong>the cruise industry naturally has its responses. <a href=\"https://cruising.org/about-the-industry/policy-priorities/public-health-and-medical/nororvirus-on-cruise-ships\">They make claims</a> about health, safety and the environment, which for the reasons given by Ross Klein should be treated sceptically. They say, for example, that <a href=\"https://cruising.org/about-the-industry/policy-priorities/public-health-and-medical/nororvirus-on-cruise-ships\">norovirus is rare</a> on cruise ships, using data from the US <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. The CDC, however, is only able to obtain information on ships that visit US ports, so can\u2019t give global statistics, which limits the usefulness of any conclusions that might be drawn.</p> <p>Cruise companies argue that they create employment, which they do, for everyone from officers to crew to waiters to beauticians and standup comedians. They say that they bring revenue to their host cities, which they also do, though Klein and others <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0261517717302418\">dispute the level of benefits</a> claimed by the companies</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cadfe9b58d82b8aef0dc2f894c71122cf32b0a28\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cadfe9b58d82b8aef0dc2f894c71122cf32b0a28/0_65_5760_3458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The bar and dancefloor of the Costa Fortuna, owned by the Carnival corporation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The bar and dancefloor of the Costa Fortuna, owned by the Carnival corporation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frans Lemmens/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since cruise passengers sleep on their ships and also tend to eat and drink on them, their benefit to local hotels, restaurants and bars is limited. Those shore-based traders to whom the ships direct their passengers generally have to pay a handsome cut for the privilege. Cruise lines also acquire interests in terminals and retail outlets, such that even more income is whisked away from their host ports. Just supposing that the tourist dollar were not so relentlessly hoovered up by cruises, might it not be generating other, maybe more rewarding jobs in businesses that don\u2019t have the same breaks on taxes and regulations?</p> <p>The cruise companies\u2019 strongest argument is that their customers love their product. Which, mostly, they do. Even some who endured the Covid-cursed cruises say they will go back to the ships when they can. And to sail the seas and see the world is, indeed, a great thing. But perhaps cruise passengers would have an even better time if there weren\u2019t a nagging feeling that the management might not be totally on top of novel or familiar viruses on their ship, or that the excretions and eructations of their big white ships are trashing the beauties they are paying to see.</p> <p>And claims of passenger satisfaction and revenue-generation should not invalidate the wishes of host cities for basic respect or the argument that the quality of interaction between tourists and locals is as important as the quantity. As Sovrani puts it, cruises should adapt to cities, not the other way round. Again, cruise passengers might have a better time if they were not thrust into the cogs of an engine of exploitation.</p> <p>Much, of course, depends on what happens in the world to come after the virus, which not so long ago was barely a blip on the radar. <em>Forbes</em> magazine, on January 20, could see only \u201c<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemicallef/2020/01/20/state-of-the-cruise-industry-smooth-sailing-into-the-2020s/#36bb9cc065fa\">smooth sailing</a> into the 2020s\u201d.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWe\u2019ve been asked \u2013 and we\u2019ve asked ourselves \u2013 why Covid-19 seems to be impacting Princess so heavily.\u201d Thus spoke Jan Swartz, president of Princess Cruises, in a video posted on social media in mid-March. She looks sad-eyed and baffled into the camera: \u201cWe don\u2019t really know.\u201d Perhaps, she muses, the problem is something to do with the \u201cdiverse mix of people onboard our ships\u201d and is \u201cbeing magnified by our core values to respect, protect and connect the world\u201d. She implores her \u201cguests\u201d with a \u201csimple request\u201d: \u201cWe ask you to book a future Princess cruise to your dream destination \u2026 as a symbol to the world that the things that connect us are stronger than those that divide us.\u201d Her company does seem to have been terribly unlucky. Their Diamond Princess, quarantined off Yokohama, which suffered over 700 infections and eight deaths among its passengers and crew, was a conspicuous early victim of the pandemic, its global fame growing on wry-turning-to-desperate postings from its passengers. The Ruby Princess, from which 2,700 passengers disembarked in Sydney on March 19, became the single largest source of Covid-19 cases in Australia. The Grand Princess was stuck outside San Francisco, its passengers confined to their cabins, after an outbreak in early March. Something similar happened to the Coral Princess in early April, off the coast of Florida. And this to say nothing of the Caribbean Princess, which has twice this year had to end cruises early, due to hundreds falling ill from a quite different infection, the vomiting bug norovirus. But not everyone is yet convinced that all of Princess\u2019s misadventures are purely bad luck. New South Wales police have launched a criminal investigation into the Ruby Princess, to see whether its owners were \u201ctransparent in contextualising the true patient and crew health conditions relevant to Covid-19\u201d. They are suspected of lying, in other words, about conditions on the ship. Legal actions have sprung up from unhappy \u201cguests\u201d of the Grand Princess, their trips-of-a-lifetime wrecked by allegedly inadequate screening procedures. Professor Kentaro Iwata, a Japanese expert on infectious diseases who went on to the Diamond Princess, described the onboard response to the virus as \u201ccompletely chaotic\u201d. Princess is not alone in its troubles. It is one of several lines owned by Carnival Corporation, a giant and aggressive company, which as long ago as 1996 was reported by David Foster Wallace, in an epic article on the cruise experience, to be nicknamed \u201cCarnivore\u201d. Carnival\u2019s roughly 40% share of the market also includes the Holland America line, which owns the Zaandam, which had to travel up the west coast of South America with sick and dying passengers on board, after Chile closed its ports. Other ships, both owned by Carnival and not, have had outbreaks of disease or been denied permission to enter ports. All new cruises have now been suspended, with some provisionally scheduled to restart in May. A rather obvious question is whether Covid-19 is simply an act of God, or whether its impact on their passengers, crew and host ports has been magnified by the practices of cruise companies. They vigorously push back against this suggestion: a spokesman for Carnival tells me that \u201cthe cruise industry took action before most other industries on land took actions\u201d, that \u201ccruise ships are social gathering places, but no less risky than any other social gathering venue\u201d, and asks \u201cwhen was the last time you were asked to fill out a health record before being allowed to enter a concert?\u201d In the case of the Diamond Princess, say Princess Cruises, they were following instructions from the Japanese health authorities. Trust on this question, on the other hand, is not improved by reports that some cruise-line salespeople (not Carnival), in mid-March, were being instructed to talk punters out of their concerns about Covid-19, for example claiming that the coronavirus could not survive in tropical climates and that therefore it was a good time to visit the Caribbean. Trust is further weakened by the cruise industry\u2019s long history of environmental and safety lapses, and their special skill at minimising the consequences to themselves. A bigger question is whether the virus will dent, deflect or alter what has been a phenomenon of our times, the many-times multiplication of ship sizes, of passenger numbers and of profits, generated by an industry that manufactures its own version of reality, then shapes the places that its ships visit in the image of that reality. Cruises, as Wallace put it, serve that \u201cpart of me that craves pampering and passive pleasure: the dissatisfied-infant part of me, the part that always and indiscriminately wants\u201d. Cruises are founded on fantasy, which means the removal from view of anything irksome or demanding of difficult choices. Cruise companies have been growing at least since the 1980s, with a 7.2% compounded rate of revenue growth from 2010 to 2019. Their ships, which were generally under 50,000 tons until the mid-90s, have become beasts of 220,000 tons and more. Alongside the growth in quantity has gone an ever-advancing science of customer experience, of investment in ice rinks, climbing walls, spas and casinos, in decking out ships like Vegas resorts, a process that reached some kind of apogee with the 5.260-passenger Costa Venezia. Aimed at the Asian market, this Venice-themed ship comes complete with gondola rides and a version of the Piazza San Marco. For cruising is above all an entertainment and hospitality industry, albeit grafted on to the serious engineering needed to keep large ships afloat. All of which might be good, clean fun, if the growth of cruises weren\u2019t accompanied by reports of pollution spills, outbreaks of disease, accidents, mistreatment of workers and sexual assaults and other crimes. If these reports don\u2019t change much over the decades it is because the cruise lines don\u2019t change much, either. They can spend lavishly on lobbying and campaign contributions to friendly politicians, and hire lawyers to see off the lawsuits when things go wrong. Their business being offshore, cruise lines are free to choose the countries where they register their ships and incorporate their business, which means places like Panama, the Bahamas or Bermuda, where they can pay low taxes and get an easy ride on labour rights, and on health, safety and environmental regulations. \u201cThey only change when they have to,\u201d says Ross Klein, a sociology professor at Memorial University in Newfoundland, whose website cruisejunkie.com chronicles the mishaps of the cruise business. And nobody much makes them change. There is a trade body, the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), which promotes the business and in theory upholds standards. \u201cThey will tell you that they have mandatory regulations and that they meet or exceed international regulations,\u201d says Klein. \u201cWell, we asked CLIA\u2019s senior vice-president what happens when a company violates these regulations: nothing. Perhaps a stern talking-to, but otherwise nothing.\u201d Cruise companies\u2019 aversion to responsibility can be seen in a legendary court filing following the \u201cpoop cruise\u201d of 2013, in which failing generators on the Carnival Triumph caused a backup of raw sewage into the passenger areas. Carnivals\u2019 lawyers, CNN reported, said that the \u201cticket contract makes absolutely no guarantee for safe passage, a seaworthy vessel, adequate and wholesome food, and sanitary and safe living conditions.\u201d Equally striking was the legal outcome to the 2012 wreck of the Costa Concordia, when the party atmosphere of cruises mixed fatally with questions of navigation: the owner Costa Crociere (another part of the Carnival empire), with the help of a plea bargain and \u20ac1m fine, and despite clear failings on its part, was freed of any management and operational responsibility. Or you could take another incident that befell the ever unfortunate Princess Cruise lines, when the Caribbean Princess was found to have been dumping oily waste in the sea off southern England. In 2017 a Florida court found that the Caribbean and four more Princesses had been engaging in illegal practices, issued a record fine of $40m and put the company on probation for five years. President Jan Swartz performed a hand-wring to camera, as she has over Covid-19, to say that \u201cwe are very sorry for the actions of our employees\u201d and that \u201cthe marine environment is incredibly important to us\u201d. Princess ships then continued to pollute, for example by depositing faecal coliform in Alaskan waters. In 2019 they were fined a further $20m. If a combined penalty of $60m sounds like a lot, it is as Klein points out a small portion of the $3bn or so annual profits of Princess\u2019s owner, Carnival. \u201cTo them, that\u2019s just a cost of doing business,\u201d he says. And you have Venice, the actual city rather than the theme versions, where for years what are effectively multistorey hotels have been looming over its historic architecture, their mighty parps competing with church bells, their diesel smoke polluting the air, damaging the ecology of the lagoon and, say protesters, the foundations of buildings with the water they displace, and discharging thousands-strong fluxes of tourists on highly managed six-hour trinket-and-selfie binges in the city. Then, last summer, the 65,000-ton MSC Opera, its engine failing, crunched into a moored tourist boat like a boot on to a bug. There were miraculously no deaths, but the crash made the cruise industry\u2019s previous assurances of safety sound hollow. Despite excited reports last year that large ships would be banned from the city, nothing definite has been decided. At most, larger ships will be displaced to other ports in the Venetian lagoon, which would involve new environmental impacts. Among the complications in finding a solution is the fact that Carnival, Royal Caribbean and other big cruise companies are shareholders of the company that owns Venice\u2019s maritime port. The issue is not just about the filth and damage that ships emit into Venetian air and water, but of the superficial interaction that cruise ships generate between passengers and their host city. Eleonora Sovrani, of the local campaign group We Are Here Venice, argues that the cruises\u2019 \u201cguests\u201d \u2013 on their brief visits, following itineraries proposed by the ships, visiting outlets suggested by them \u2013 never leave the cruise \u201cbubble\u201d. The city is forced \u201cto change its aspect to answer expectations of the cruise companies,\u201d she says, in what is a form of \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d. What goes for Venice now goes for many other places in the world. In pre-virus Sydney, successive ships would be moored near the considerably smaller Opera House, almost permanently blocking certain views, while others would be waiting their turn out in the bay. Cruises have shown increasing enthusiasm for invading the Arctic and Antarctic, their paths eased by the melting of globally warmed ice, with many thousands of gawpers descending on tiny Inuit settlements. In New Zealand, Princess Cruises \u2013 hello, my old friend \u2013 were obliged to apologise for their crassness, after some non-Maori men with DIY skirts and scribbles on their face were hired to perform an am-dram version of a traditional Maori welcome to passengers on the Golden Princess. To all these points the cruise industry naturally has its responses. They make claims about health, safety and the environment, which for the reasons given by Ross Klein should be treated sceptically. They say, for example, that norovirus is rare on cruise ships, using data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC, however, is only able to obtain information on ships that visit US ports, so can\u2019t give global statistics, which limits the usefulness of any conclusions that might be drawn. Cruise companies argue that they create employment, which they do, for everyone from officers to crew to waiters to beauticians and standup comedians. They say that they bring revenue to their host cities, which they also do, though Klein and others dispute the level of benefits claimed by the companies Since cruise passengers sleep on their ships and also tend to eat and drink on them, their benefit to local hotels, restaurants and bars is limited. Those shore-based traders to whom the ships direct their passengers generally have to pay a handsome cut for the privilege. Cruise lines also acquire interests in terminals and retail outlets, such that even more income is whisked away from their host ports.

As Sovrani puts it, cruises should adapt to cities, not the other way round. Again, cruise passengers might have a better time if they were not thrust into the cogs of an engine of exploitation. Much, of course, depends on what happens in the world to come after the virus, which not so long ago was barely a blip on the radar. Forbes magazine, on January 20, could see only \u201csmooth sailing into the 2020s\u201d. In February CNN quoted various experts saying it was still OK to cruise.

Her role as a leading progressive voice, she explained, was to \u201cpush back against everyone\u201d, including her own party. \u201cThat makes people uncomfortable,\u201d she said. \u201cbut we\u2019re just not where we need to be right now.\u201d At the same time, Ocasio-Cortez is strident in her resolve to \u201crally around\u201d Biden, calling the November presidential election a \u201cmatter of life and death\u201d for her constituents, primarily people of color and immigrants. Though there are some progressives resisting calls for party unity, Democrats appear to have little appetite for the drama and infighting that defined the 2016 primary contest. Fear of a drawn-out nomination battle in 2020 proved unfounded as the primary resolved far sooner and more amicably than most expected. \u201cThis is an existential moment for Americans \u2013 not just with this pandemic, but with this presidency,\u201d said Addisu Demissie, who was New Jersey senator Cory Booker\u2019s presidential campaign manager until he ended his run in January. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be plenty of time during a Biden presidency \u2013 as there was during an Obama presidency \u2013 to negotiate within \u2018the family\u2019 and figure out how far we want to push things.\u201d Against this backdrop, many Democrats are cautiously optimistic. But party leaders are under no illusion that defeating Trump will be easy \u2013 he has strong support in battleground states, a campaign operation that is larger and better funded, and the built-in advantages that come with incumbency. Polls suggest the race will be close and won, once again, on the margins. Whether Ocasio-Cortez and Biden join forces to defeat Trump or instead continue to march separately in the same direction could be instructive for the rest of the progressive movement. \u201cRight now it\u2019s a balance between pushing the movement forward \u2013 fighting for the most progressive agenda possible \u2013 and staying focused on the main goal,\u201d said Marisa Franco, director and cofounder of Mijente, a Latinx advocacy group that endorsed Sanders. \u201cRemoving Trump from office.\u201d",

Incumbency bestows another advantage: critics can come to resemble Cassandras. Just as the president racks up a record, good or bad, his foes rack up predictions, some of which date poorly. Ch\u00e1vez enjoyed reciting warnings that he was or would become a communist dictator. In fact there was a petro-dollar-fuelled consumer boom for much of his rule. Elect Trump, it was said in 2016, and he would blow up the economy, democracy, Nato, North Korea and possibly apple pie. Four years later the damage wrought by Trump on ordinary lives, environmental standards and US values is indeed immense. But he did not start wars, lock up Hillary Clinton or make everyone burn coal. The sky did not fall. Until coronavirus the economy hummed and Trump became, if not normalised, at least familiar. Many people who hesitated to vote for him because he was so outlandish, so risky, may feel emboldened to back him this time. In Venezuela they were called ni-nis, voters who were neither for Chavez nor for the opposition, who floated in the middle until election day and then voted with their pocketbook. The comandante, a pragmatist more than a socialist, knew how to get them onside. In battleground states in November it will be the turn of his US apprentice. Rory Carroll was based in Venezuela as the Guardian\u2019s Latin America correspondent from 2006 to 2012. He is the author of Comandante: Hugo Chavez\u2019s Venezuela",

I have to eat and go to the toilet sometimes.\u201d He found it increasingly hard to breathe and called an ambulance. \u201cThey found me lying in the bed and gave me oxygen,\u201d he said. \u201cI was worried I might pass away.\u201d The YMCA hostel moved him into a self-contained room in the main hostel when he came back from the nearby Whittington hospital. Jouda, who became homeless when he was evicted and ended up sleeping in a park, was readmitted to hospital 10 days later, where he recovered from the virus. Although he is well now, he is worried he might be reinfected in his shared flat. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that people who have had coronavirus can get it again.\u201d",

As many people are discovering during the Covid-19 crisis, even something as seemingly straightforward as the count of people who have died might not be as robust as to be taken at face value.

Arguably, the most important problem is the \u201cdenominator\u201d \u2013 what is the actual number of people who are infected by the virus? This is virtually impossible to determine, except perhaps in the unlikely scenario of real-time, continuous, population-wide testing. The absence of this figure creates problems when rescaling the outcomes \u2013 for example, deaths \u2013 to the number of people at risk, which is not known with precision.

But other, more subtle features may play a fundamental role. For instance, there is <a href=\"https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/covid-pm\">evidence</a> to suggest a strong association between air pollution and Covid-19-related mortality. This may explain why heavily polluted areas such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/apr/06/coronavirus-bergamo-work-ethic-lockdown\">Lombard</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/apr/06/coronavirus-bergamo-work-ethic-lockdown\">y in Italy</a> have been badly affected by the virus.</p> <p>But even when focusing on absolute mortality (that is, the number of deaths, for instance, in a specific location at a given time) there are issues, and figures may appear inconsistent. Broadly speaking, in the UK there are two main sources of data: the DHSC and the ONS; in reality, the data for both comes from an even more composite pool of sources. For example, the DHSC combines figures from the four devolved administrations, and these are not fully harmonised \u2013 the England and Wales counts are done at 5pm the day before they are published, while Scotland stops the clock at 9am and the Northern Ireland count is at the unconventional cut-off of 9.15am.</p> <p>One crucial difference between the two meta sources is the temporal resolution: the DHSC provides daily updates, while from 31 March the ONS has been reporting weekly data.

For England, this excludes deaths outside hospitals, which is increasingly of concern, given the potential for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/15/coronavirus-death-toll-in-englands-care-homes-reaches-1400\">large numbers of Covid-19-related deaths in care homes</a>.

In this sense, the figures represent a gold standard as they are likely to include more deaths due to Covid-19. But the ONS only includes England and Wales so direct comparison is possible only in a limited geographical area in the country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8c35cc835c1b231a9e807d30fe4d87f689df4bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8c35cc835c1b231a9e807d30fe4d87f689df4bb/0_0_765_584/500.jpg\" alt=\"UK coronavirus deaths graph\" width=\"500\" height=\"382\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The graph above shows the potential differences in the data, comparing the DHSC figures to two \u201cdata cuts\u201d from the ONS.

Despite that, parents are contacting teachers to lobby for their children. Some are offering mitigating circumstances for disappointing mock results, for instance, or insisting that as their child has a private tutor, they would have done better than expected in exams.</p> <p>Tom Middlehurst, the director of policy and public affairs at SSAT, a school network with 3,000 members, many of them academies, said: \u201cThe difficulty is that the kind of parents who are having those discussions and making that effort are likely to be middle-class parents and what we must really not allow to happen this summer is that educational inequality widens. Already with home schooling and school closures <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/fears-that-cancelling-exams-will-hit-black-and-poor-pupils-worst\">there is likely to be a long-term impact on the more disadvantaged </a>and we have to mitigate this where we can.

      "bodyText": "Anxious pupils and parents are bombarding schools with pleas to award good grades in the new teacher assessments that have been put in place in lieu of cancelled exams. Schools are being forced to advise staff to ignore contact from families who are trying to influence teachers\u2019 judgments. GCSE and A-level teachers have been told to stop setting work for pupils in a bid to deflect attempts to sway teacher assessments and the final grades teachers they submit to the exam boards. The government announced last month that all A-level and GCSE exams will be cancelled because of the pandemic. Instead, teachers will score and rank their pupils in each subject, based on mock exam results, coursework, marks in assignments and any other evidence. The grades that they issue to exam boards by the end of May are what they believe candidates would have achieved in public examinations if the school year had operated as normal. Ofqual, the exam regulator, has instructed schools not to share those grades or discuss them with families. Despite that, parents are contacting teachers to lobby for their children. Some are offering mitigating circumstances for disappointing mock results, for instance, or insisting that as their child has a private tutor, they would have done better than expected in exams. Tom Middlehurst, the director of policy and public affairs at SSAT, a school network with 3,000 members, many of them academies, said: \u201cThe difficulty is that the kind of parents who are having those discussions and making that effort are likely to be middle-class parents and what we must really not allow to happen this summer is that educational inequality widens. Already with home schooling and school closures there is likely to be a long-term impact on the more disadvantaged and we have to mitigate this where we can. Of course parents want to be reassured by what is going on but they must allow teachers to use their professional judgments to make those decisions.\u201d The Alsager School in Cheshire, in response to students badgering staff about grades, has told parents and pupils that \u201cthere is nothing that individuals can do that will influence their final grades\u201d and that GCSE and A-level pupils will no longer be set work by their subject teachers. Ormiston Forge Academy in the West Midlands has also asked pupils to \u201cplease refrain from contacting teachers about suggested awarded grades\u201d. Elsewhere, teachers are receiving a sudden rush of extra work from pupils who fear they have underperformed in class, in the hope of an 11th hour reprieve. One member of staff at a high-performing sixth form college said he had never received so many emails from parents thanking him for teaching their child. Teachers face a difficult and novel challenge in putting classmates in rank order. The number of candidates for GCSE maths and English in particular, is substantial, with hundreds of pupils bunching around grades 4 and 5. Even then, the grades schools submit to exam boards are likely to change when the final results are published in August. A standardisation process will apply statistical adjustments to teacher-assessed grades, using data about each school\u2019s performance in previous years and the cohort\u2019s prior achievement in key stage 2 tests or GCSEs. Ofqual has said that it plans to put \u201cmore weight on statistical expectations\u201d to even out teacher grading that is too severe or too generous. But some headteachers are concerned that if too much weight is given to schools\u2019 previous results, it may disadvantage pupils in secondaries that are on an upward trajectory. Middlehurst said: \u201cWhile we understand the need for using schools\u2019 prior attainment, we are concerned that this will unfairly disadvantage the students at schools that have made concerted efforts to improve in the last 12 months. Many SSAT members have been in touch to say that they are honestly predicting significantly better results in 2020 than in previous years. This is not about league tables as they will not be published this year; it is about the individual pupil getting a fair result.\u201d Concerns have also been raised about whether high achieving pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds will receive the grades they deserve.

Costs will return. The big question is, will the customers?</p> <p>A significant issue is the government\u2019s initiative to underwrite loans from the banks to businesses, with the proviso that those businesses be viable. Most restaurants, even apparently successful ones, run on a tight financial model, riding seasonal waves of trade, often with great peaks and troughs. The first three months of the year just gone are famously a major trough. Viable restaurants could easily be made unviable by the lockdown itself. \u201cPeople think there\u2019s some pot of gold sitting in the bank,\u201d says chef Angela Hartnett, who has the Michelin-starred Murano and three Murano Cafes scattered around central London. \u201cBut there really isn\u2019t. Restaurants are run on very tight margins.\u201d</p> <p>Chef Richard Corrigan, who has three restaurants including Bentley\u2019s off Piccadilly and the recently opened Daffodil Mulligan in Shoreditch, agrees. \u201cIf this was a three-month closure, we\u2019d get through. The real issue we\u2019re facing is a six-month closure which, in the absence of any cash flow, will exhaust us.\u201d Under the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/05/sunak-emergency-loan-cbils-flaws-isnt-superman-after-all\">Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme</a>, the banks have agreed to provide \u00a3250,000 without personal guarantees.

Restaurateurs report that some landlords have been extremely accommodating, by offering to write off up to three months\u2019 rent. Others have been far less flexible. In late March the<em> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/24643dcc-5860-4401-8d92-511ed7952e58\">Financial Times </a></em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/24643dcc-5860-4401-8d92-511ed7952e58\">reported</a> that Criterion Capital, which owns large slabs of property around London\u2019s Leicester Square, had threatened the 37-strong Caffe Concerto group, which occupies one of its sites on Haymarket, with a winding up order, because it had not paid rent on one site. Caffe Concerto director <a href=\"https://www.thecaterer.com/news/aggressive-landlords-back-off-suck-it-up-industry-says\">Stephano Borjak</a><a href=\"https://www.thecaterer.com/news/aggressive-landlords-back-off-suck-it-up-industry-says\"> told the</a><em><a href=\"https://www.thecaterer.com/news/aggressive-landlords-back-off-suck-it-up-industry-says\"> Caterer</a></em>: \u201cWe are using our cashflow for wages.

(Any ingredients left over at the shutdown were used in meals provided for free to the homeless in Chester.) And then there\u2019s the question of whether they will still have the staff with which to do so. Angela Hartnett shut down her restaurants even before the government had officially told her she had to. \u201cPartly we did that to enable our staff, 80% of whom come from the likes of Italy, Spain and France, to get home to their families. I\u2019d like to think they\u2019ll still want to work for us at the end but I just don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>But the bluntest of issues is: will there be any customers? As Beckett says, \u201cThere will probably still be a demand for social distancing at first.\u201d And even if there isn\u2019t, people\u2019s behaviour may well have changed. \u201cWith all this time at home people will have learned to cook more and take pleasure in it,\u201d says Usher. \u201cI simply wonder what people\u2019s relationship with restaurants will be.\u201d</p> <p>One gastropub operator told me: \u201cPeople think we\u2019re in the food and drink business but we\u2019re not. We\u2019re in the atmosphere business. The food is terribly important but it\u2019s not what brings people in. It\u2019s about the social side.\u201d And who will want to socialise after this? The optimistic view is that, after a lengthy lockdown, everyone. \u201cThere may be lots of people who want to go out,\u201d says Hart. \u201cBut then again, lots of people have lost their jobs and will be absolutely skint.\u201d</p> <p>All the chefs and restaurateurs I spoke to described some form of staggered reopening to match the likely slow return of customers. \u201cI could see us opening for a few services but not for all of them,\u201d says Hart, \u201cand expanding out from there.\u201d Or as Usher says, \u201cWe might reopen one of our restaurants a week.\u201d What will matter, Hartnett says, \u201cis if restaurants looked after their regulars well. Then they are more likely to return.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc0e1d47c9e949e6e38da363611a9b17814afb31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc0e1d47c9e949e6e38da363611a9b17814afb31/0_254_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Restaurants being boarded up in Soho, London due to coronavirus, 24 March 2020: \u2018People think we\u2019re in the food and drink business but we\u2019re not.

The restaurant business must get enough warning that the lockdown is coming to an end, says UK Hospitality\u2019s Nicholls. \u201cThe government mustn\u2019t turn the taps off on the business support quickly. It has to be tapered or we\u2019ll be looking at mass unemployment across the sector.\u201d</p> <p>Is there any lighter news? Perhaps a little. Usually, if there\u2019s strife in the restaurant industry, it\u2019s the small independents who suffer first. But there\u2019s good reason to think the smaller operations will find reopening more straightforward than the big groups. \u201cBecause we\u2019re small, we\u2019re adaptable,\u201d says Max Gott of game-based restaurant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jan/12/bistro-46-newcastle-a-small-restaurant-with-heart-game\">Bistro 46 in Newcastle</a>, which has just three full-time members of staff. \u201cIf we need to do some takeaway to get us through then we will. We shoot a lot of our own game so that\u2019s still there, and we deal with small suppliers who have moved to a delivery model for the duration.\u201d</p> <p>However, like everyone else, he wonders \u201cwhether people will still want to eat out\u201d. Which brings us to the one thing we, the diners, can do. If we want restaurants to return to trading, if we want them all to reopen their boarded-up eyes, we need to give them our business as soon as we feel able to do so. It\u2019s as simple as that.</p>",

The optimistic view is that, after a lengthy lockdown, everyone. \u201cThere may be lots of people who want to go out,\u201d says Hart. \u201cBut then again, lots of people have lost their jobs and will be absolutely skint.\u201d All the chefs and restaurateurs I spoke to described some form of staggered reopening to match the likely slow return of customers. \u201cI could see us opening for a few services but not for all of them,\u201d says Hart, \u201cand expanding out from there.\u201d Or as Usher says, \u201cWe might reopen one of our restaurants a week.\u201d What will matter, Hartnett says, \u201cis if restaurants looked after their regulars well. Then they are more likely to return.\u201d Obviously, the state also has a part to play. The restaurant business must get enough warning that the lockdown is coming to an end, says UK Hospitality\u2019s Nicholls. \u201cThe government mustn\u2019t turn the taps off on the business support quickly. It has to be tapered or we\u2019ll be looking at mass unemployment across the sector.\u201d Is there any lighter news? Perhaps a little. Usually, if there\u2019s strife in the restaurant industry, it\u2019s the small independents who suffer first. But there\u2019s good reason to think the smaller operations will find reopening more straightforward than the big groups. \u201cBecause we\u2019re small, we\u2019re adaptable,\u201d says Max Gott of game-based restaurant Bistro 46 in Newcastle, which has just three full-time members of staff. \u201cIf we need to do some takeaway to get us through then we will. We shoot a lot of our own game so that\u2019s still there, and we deal with small suppliers who have moved to a delivery model for the duration.\u201d However, like everyone else, he wonders \u201cwhether people will still want to eat out\u201d. Which brings us to the one thing we, the diners, can do. If we want restaurants to return to trading, if we want them all to reopen their boarded-up eyes, we need to give them our business as soon as we feel able to do so. It\u2019s as simple as that.",

      "bodyText": "Michael Gove has conceded that Boris Johnson missed five consecutive emergency meetings in the buildup to the coronavirus crisis, and that the UK shipped protective equipment to China in February. The government faced intense pressure on Sunday over its initial response to the pandemic, as Labour accused Johnson of having been \u201cmissing in action\u201d during the crucial weeks when the virus first arrived in the UK. Gove initially insisted a Sunday Times story detailing failures during this period had numerous inaccuracies and would be corrected. Asked on Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday show whether Johnson missed five meetings of the government\u2019s Cobra emergency committee, and about the shipment of hundreds of thousands of items of personal protective equipment (PPE) to China during February, Gove refused to comment. \u201cI won\u2019t go through, here, a point-by-point rebuttal of all the things in the Sunday Times story that are a little bit off-beam, but that will be done later,\u201d he said. But in a subsequent interview on BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show, Gove, who holds the cabinet role of chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, accepted that both claims were correct. He said missing Cobra meetings was normal for a PM. \u201cMost Cobra meetings don\u2019t have the prime minister attending them,\u201d Gove said. \u201cThat is the whole point.\u201d Cobra meetings were \u201cled by the relevant secretary of state in the relevant area\u201d, he argued. \u201cWhoever is chairing those meetings reports to the prime minister. The prime minister is aware of all of these decisions and takes some of those decisions. You can take a single fact, wrench it out of context, whip it up in order to create a j\u2019accuse narrative. But that is not fair reporting.\u201d Gove is correct in that prime ministers do not always, or even routinely, chair Cobra meetings. But it is common for them to do so during a major crisis. The five meetings Johnson missed came during a period in late January and February where he spent an entire parliamentary recess out of sight at his official country retreat of Chequers, prompting Labour to accuse him at the time of being a \u201cpart-time prime minister\u201d. The Sunday Times quoted one unnamed senior adviser as saying Johnson \u201cdidn\u2019t work weekends\u201d, and \u201cthere was a real sense that he didn\u2019t do urgent crisis planning\u201d. Gove told the Ridge show it was wrong to argue that Johnson had been \u201canything other than energetic, focused, determined and strong in his leadership against this virus\u201d. \u201cThe idea that the prime minister skipped meetings that were vital to our response to the coronavirus I think is grotesque,\u201d Gove said. On the shipment of PPE to China, in his interview on the Ridge show Gove refused to say three times whether this had happened, saying only that some aspects of the Sunday Times story were wrong. A shortage of PPE for NHS and care home staff has been a repeated criticism of the UK response to coronavirus, with the Guardian revealing on Friday that NHS staff had been told to wear plastic aprons if stocks of protective gowns ran out. But on the Marr show he accepted it was true, saying this was done \u201cto help with the most extreme outbreak in Wuhan\u201d. The PPE had not come from pandemic stockpiles, Gove said, and since then the UK had received \u201cfar more\u201d PPE from China, he added. Asked whether the government had made mistakes in its response to the pandemic, Gove accepted this broad point: \u201cAll governments make mistakes, including our own. We seek to learn, and to improve every day. It is the case, I\u2019m sure, at some point in the future that there will be an opportunity for us to look back, to reflect and to learn some profound lessons.\u201d Labour\u2019s Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, told the Ridge show that Gove had given \u201cpossibly the weakest rebuttal of a detailed expos\u00e9 in British political history\u201d. There were, Ashworth added, \u201cserious questions as to why the prime minister skipped five Cobra meetings throughout February, when the whole world could see how serious this was becoming\u201d. He said: \u201cAnd we know that serious mistakes have been made. We know that our frontline NHS staff don\u2019t have the PPE, that they\u2019ve been told this weekend that they won\u2019t necessarily have the gowns which are vital to keep them safe. We know that our testing capacity is not at the level that is needed.\u201d In this context, he added, the knowledge Johnson had missed key meetings \u201csuggests that early on he was missing in action\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The Trump administration and Russia are blocking efforts to win binding UN security council backing for a global ceasefire to help fight the coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed more than 150,000 lives worldwide. The UN secretary-general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, called for an immediate end to fighting involving governments and armed groups in all conflict areas almost one month ago. \u201cThe fury of the virus illustrates the folly of war,\u201d he said. Yet despite strong support for a universal truce from dozens of countries, including leading US allies such as Britain, France and Germany, as well as human rights groups, charities and the pope, the Trump administration is refusing to be bound by the measure. In an attempt to break the impasse, Emmanuel Macron, the French president, has proposed a draft security council resolution which attempts to overcome US and Russian objections by, in effect, making it impossible to enforce. The resolution, as drafted, is understood to welcome the UN secretary-general\u2019s appeal and express support for his efforts. But it does not insist on a binding, universal ceasefire, allowing exceptions to be made at the discretion of individual member states. The US objections arise from White House, Pentagon and State Department concerns that an all-encompassing measure could hinder their ability to prosecute military operations against terrorist groups, for example Isis in Iraq, and other targets that are deemed hostile to US interests. Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, is believed to have similar reservations regarding the impact on Russian military operations in Syria and on Moscow\u2019s unacknowledged support for proxy groups and non-state militias in wartorn countries such as Libya. According to a special report published by the US-based Foreign Policy website, \u201cboth governments fear that a universal ceasefire could potentially constrain their own efforts to mount what they consider legitimate counter-terrorism operations overseas. \u201cThe US is also concerned that a blanket ceasefire could inhibit Israel\u2019s ability to engage in military operations throughout the Middle East,\u201d the report\u2019s author, Colum Lynch, said \u2013 a reference to Israeli airstrikes in recent months on targets in Syria, Iraq, and Lebanon. In addition, analysts say, president Donald Trump and his advisers want to retain the freedom to launch attacks on pro-Iranian militia in Iraq, as happened recently, or carry out opportunistic strikes against Iran\u2019s military leaders, similar to the US drone strike in January that killed the Revolutionary Guards Corps general, Qassem Suleimani. Speaking on 23 March, Guterres appealed to warring parties across the globe to end hostilities and join together to fight Covid-19 instead. \u201cEnd the sickness of war and fight the disease that is ravaging our world. It starts by stopping the fighting everywhere. Now. That is what our human family needs, now more than ever,\u201d he said. Guterres\u2019s call was endorsed earlier this month by charities, religious organisations and human rights groups. Pope Francis threw his weight behind it in an Easter Sunday address. On Friday, Henrietta Fore, head of the UN children\u2019s fund, Unicef, warned that 250 million children living in the \u201cwaking nightmare\u201d of conflict desperately needed warring parties to stop fighting as the pandemic spread. More than 50 governments have also backed Guterres\u2019s initiative, including several Nato allies. In a joint letter, which the US and Russia declined to sign, they expressed concern that the UN security council had yet to take action. \u201cAs the global Covid-19 pandemic spreads, we are concerned about the plight of women, children, and all civilians caught in armed conflicts \u2026 these populations are already impacted disproportionately by armed conflict. \u201cAn immediate global ceasefire would markedly reduce these impacts, allow for much-needed humanitarian assistance and protection, and hopefully diminish the spread of Covid-19,\u201d the letter said. Dominic Raab, the UK foreign secretary and acting prime minister, has pledged Britain\u2019s backing. Coronavirus was \u201cthe fight of our lives and we must unite against it\u201d, he said. But the US continues to prevaricate, while negotiations continue. Kelly Craft, US ambassador to the UN, expressed support for a global truce earlier this week and said she hoped the French resolution could be agreed soon, possibly this week. But a State Department spokesman was more circumspect. \u201cThe United States supports the secretary-general\u2019s call for a global ceasefire, but have noted that we will continue to fulfil our legitimate counter-terrorism mission,\u201d the spokesman told Foreign Policy. Agreement on a ceasefire has been further delayed by US demands, now reportedly dropped, that the resolution refer to Covid-19 as the \u201cWuhan virus\u201d, a description that would have drawn a Chinese veto. The US also objected to language supportive of the World Health Organization, which Trump has attacked and defunded. Macron nevertheless expressed optimism on Wednesday that the draft resolution would be agreed. He said he had spoken personally to Trump, China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, and the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, and all had offered their backing. Macron said he was hopeful Putin would also come onboard, and that a video summit of the five permanent members of the security council would be held to announce their agreement. While such an outcome may enhance the prestige of the council, which has been sharply criticised for inaction during the Covid-19 crisis, it may disappoint those demanding an unconditional truce and an effective, joined-up international response. If the big powers can choose to ignore a UN-mandated global ceasefire when it suits them, analysts warn, then non-state actors and terrorist groups may decide to do likewise. Since Guterres made his call last month, sporadic progress has been reported in several conflict zones. The Saudi-led coalition announced a ceasefire in Yemen, and there have been positive responses in Colombia and the Philippines.

      "bodyText": "When big white field hospital tents appeared in Central Park in late March, they became a potent symbol of the scale and severity of New York\u2019s coronavirus crisis. But just over two weeks since the opening of the 68-bed facility run by Franklin Graham\u2019s organisation Samaritan\u2019s Purse, questions are mounting over why the controversial religious leader viewed by many to be homophobic, Islamophobic and politically extreme was chosen to perform this vital role outside Mount Sinai hospital on Fifth Avenue, and who sanctioned it. Graham, a close ally whom Donald Trump praised in a recent briefing, has previously described Islam as \u201cevil\u201d and has described gay people as \u201cthe enemy\u201d. Coronavirus, he recently said, was a result of \u201cthe sin that\u2019s in the world\u201d. Samaritan\u2019s Purse \u2013 which has so far treated 130 coronavirus patients and has about 90 staff at the Central Park field hospital \u2013 requires all staff and volunteers to sign a \u201cstatement of faith\u201d. Statements in the document include \u201cwe believe that marriage is exclusively the union of one genetic male and one genetic female\u201d and \u201chuman life is sacred from conception to its natural end\u201d. The decision to allow the group to run such a key Covid-19 effort in the city has drawn protests from both activists and politicians. \u201cHis hostility towards LGBTQ people does not comport, in my opinion, with his desire to provide assistance and relief to New Yorkers during this time of crisis,\u201d the New York state senator Brad Hoylman said. \u201cThat said, the federal government has put us in the unfortunate position of having to accept charity from bigots like Franklin Graham and at the very least I think it\u2019s government\u2019s responsibility to ensure that he follows the law.\u201d Hoylman has requested that the Mount Sinai hospital network ask Samaritan\u2019s Purse staff to sign a non-discrimination agreement acknowledging their understanding of New York\u2019s human rights law. But he still fears the organisation\u2019s presence in the city will cause \u201cincalculable\u201d damage. \u201cI do fear that we\u2019ve given Franklin Graham a platform in one of the most famous pieces of public land in the country to spew his hatred of LGBTQ people, and unfortunately at the same time legitimise his homophobia,\u201d Hoylman said. On Easter Sunday, Graham \u2013 son of the late evangelist Billy Graham \u2013 gave an Easter message from outside the Central Park hospital, broadcast on Fox News with the charity logo on a banner in the background. Natalie James, a member of Reclaim Pride Coalition, which staged a protest outside the hospital on Tuesday, said: \u201cFranklin Graham, their notoriously transphobic and homophobic leader of their organisation, had an Easter sermon right there in Central Park next to those tents, which I can only imagine was furthering their fundraising.\u201d Among those who spoke at the protest was Timothy Lunceford-Stevens, who said he was rejected as a volunteer by Samaritan\u2019s Purse because he did not want to sign the statement of faith. James said the protesters were not necessarily trying to shut down the hospital \u2013 acknowledging that help was needed \u2013 but that the group wanted Samaritan\u2019s Purse to drop the statement of faith, which they believe could be in violation of state and city human rights laws. A group of US lawmakers from New York \u2013 including the Democrats Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Adriano Espaillat and Jerry Nadler \u2013 wrote a public letter warning of their \u201cconcern about the policies governing Samaritan\u2019s Purse emergency field hospital in Central Park specifically, the implications for LGBTQIA+ New Yorkers with Covid-19\u201d. The letter, addressed to New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo; the New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio; and the Mount Sinai Health System CEO, Kenneth Davis, called for answers to a series of questions, including details of the process that granted the charity use of public land, any non-discriminatory agreements in place and funding. New York state approved the field hospital application. De Blasio has previously said that he found the organisation \u201ctroubling\u201d but that Mount Sinai had assured him there would be no discrimination and that his office would be monitoring. Espaillat, whose district includes Mount Sinai hospital, said he believes the situation has come about because the city is in \u201ccrisis mode\u201d. He added: \u201cHad it been any other time, this would have been a major scandal.\u201d Despite all the outrage, Graham, 67, told the Guardian in an interview on Thursday that he believed \u201cthe vast majority of New Yorkers are glad that we are there\u201d and that the organisation would remain in Central Park for as long as it was needed. The preacher, who lives in Boone, North Carolina, added: \u201cIt\u2019s just a small handful of people who are opposed. And I find in life there\u2019s always somebody who\u2019s opposed to whatever you do and they\u2019re just naysayers who disagree with our difficult positions and take exception to that.\u201d Defending the statement of faith, he said: \u201cWe are an evangelical Christian organisation and we want to have people of like mind.\u201d He said \u201ca handful\u201d of qualified people had been turned away because they could not sign the statement of faith, which he said was non-negotiable. \u201cIf they agree with it they\u2019ll sign it, if they don\u2019t agree with it then they move on. That\u2019s just who we are and we\u2019re not going to change who we are.\u201d But he insisted that all patients were treated the same \u201cregardless of their sexual orientation, their race or their religion, it doesn\u2019t matter\u201d. He also claimed he was not homophobic or Islamophobic, but added: \u201cI certainly disagree with homosexuality and I believe the Bible\u2019s very clear about what it has to say about homosexuality, and that\u2019s my opinion and that\u2019s what I believe, but I\u2019m not anti-gay.\u201d The charity is also working in Cremona, Italy, where it has another coronavirus field hospital, and Alaska, where it has airlifted medical supplies.

A record 160m barrels of oil has been stored in \u201csupergiant\u201d oil tankers outside the world\u2019s largest shipping ports following the deepest fall in oil demand in 25 years because of the coronavirus pandemic. The so-called \u201csupertankers\u201d, which can each hold up to 2m barrels of oil, are in high demand by oil traders as conventional oil storage facilities have quickly filled up with oil left unused during the coronavirus lockdown. The last time floating storage reached levels close to this was in 2009, when traders stored more than 100m barrels at sea before offloading stocks when the economy began to recover. Charter rates for giant vessels that can be used to store oil have more than doubled in the last month to reach highs of $350,000 (\u00a3280,000) a day as traders scramble to find space for crude that cannot be sold on to refineries. Shipping experts told the Reuters news agency that 60 supertankers have been chartered to store oil, mostly off the coast of Singapore and in the US gulf coast, as well as smaller crude oil tankers. The number has climbed quickly from between 25 and 40 super-large vessels at the start of the month, and 10 in February.

The slump in demand has created an oversupply of 9m barrels a day in the global market which threatens to swamp the world\u2019s traditional oil storage within weeks, according to S&amp;P Global Platts Analytics. The analysts expect a \u201cmassive\u201d increase in oil storage of between 500m to 1bn barrels of oil compared with stock levels at the end of February, which could fill global storage facilities to the brim by May. This could trigger an oil market collapse to an average price of between $10 to $20 a barrel in the second quarter of the year \u2013 from about $65 a barrel at the start of the year \u2013 and force oil producers to shut their wells. S&amp;P Global expects an oil market recovery to be \u201clargely delayed\u201d until next year even after the world\u2019s largest oil producers struck the most ambitious supply deal in history to cut up to 20% of world\u2019s output from next month to ease the global glut. \u201cThis may be too little and too late,\u201d S&amp;P Global said.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s the author\u2019s equivalent of the no-trousers-in-class nightmare: your first book is finally published but almost every bookshop across the world is closed. With the outbreak of coronavirus, this once unimaginable vision is now reality for hundreds of writers who have been cruelly caught out \u2013 a book newly published and no shelf to put it on.</p> <p>Naoise Dolan is one such author. We were supposed to meet in a London cafe in mid-March, but events intervened and our cosy meeting was hurriedly changed \u2013 to a socially distant interview across two park benches, then a very socially distant chat on Skype. The 28-year-old Dubliner, who is here to promote her novel, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/06/exciting-times-by-naoise-dolan-review-a-bracing-witty-debut\">Exciting Times</a></em>, groans: \u201cI just did a bunch of interviews in Ireland and now I know every single one is going to start: \u2018I met Naoise Dolan in simpler times, in a simple cafe, as she sipped her simple flat white and simply shook hands.\u2019\u201d </p> <p>Her aptly named debut follows Ava, a directionless 22-year-old who leaves Ireland by spending her \u201cabortion fund\u201d on a ticket to Hong Kong. There she teaches English and meets Julian, a 28-year-old Etonian banker, and the two enter a careful sexual arrangement that teeters on becoming emotionally meaningful. As Ava sees their relationship: \u201cIt didn\u2019t have a name, apart from hanging out, catching up, or popping in for a chat, which was, to be fair, the content of what we were doing.\u201d </p> <p>When Julian temporarily returns to England, along comes Edith, a Cambridge-educated lawyer a drifter among Hong Kong\u2019s elite twentysomethings. (\u201cHer accent was churchy, high\u00adup, with all the cathedral drops of English intonation,\u201d Ava observes.) Where Julian is emotionally distant, Edith is unabashedly enthusiastic about dating Ava and the two are happy for a while. But for all her clever thoughts about love, sex and power, Ava\u2019s reluctance to tell either Julian and Edith about each other begins to cause problems; as Edith says later: \u201cIf you really think there\u2019s nothing intrinsically wrong with fucking multiple people \u2013 and you\u2019re right, there isn\u2019t \u2013 then why did you lie to me?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I can explain why people do things in a way that completely spooks them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><em>Exciting Times</em> is, at its heart, not about the pros and cons of bisexual polyamory but a touching exploration of modern female self-loathing as seen in recent novels such as Ottessa Moshfegh\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/22/my-year-of-rest-and-relaxation-ottessa-moshfegh-review\">My Year of Rest and Relaxation</a></em> or Sally Rooney\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/01/normal-people-sally-rooney-review\">Normal People</a></em>. (During her time as editor of literary magazine the <em>Stinging Fly</em>, Rooney published the first excerpt of <em>Exciting Times</em>.) And in a time when even prolific readers are struggling to keep their attention on books, I\u2019ve been pushing <em>Exciting Times</em> on everyone I know: it is the perfect blend of caustically clever and emotionally engaging. Some of Dolan\u2019s pithy observations of her characters are the best I\u2019ve read since Edward St Aubyn. \u201cThere was something Shakespearean about imperious men going down on you: the mighty have fallen,\u201d Ava thinks after sex with Julian. Ralph, a self-described \u201cPPEist\u201d, \u201chad voted for Brexit to have tighter borders, and was applying for an Irish passport to avoid being stopped at them.\u201d Victoria \u201chad large teeth. They made it dif\ufb01cult for her to smile without scaring people, which was why Victoria smiled a lot.\u201d</p> <p>Dolan grew up in Dublin, surrounded by books and with no urge to become a writer until she studied at Trinity College. She has lived in Singapore, Hong Kong, Oxford, London, Italy and then Ireland again. \u201cI\u2019m more interested living outside of Ireland than in it,\u201d she says. \u201cSome of that is material reality \u2013 it is not nice living somewhere that is very expensive and falling down all around you. But it is also easier for me to be away from people I know.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking to Dolan, it\u2019s hard not to be dazzled by how accomplished she is, both as an author and as a thinker. She doesn\u2019t buy into the idea of \u201cthe Author\u201d. (The tale of how <em>Exciting Times</em> came to be could be summed up, as she puts it: \u201cI wanted to write a book, so I wrote one.\u201d) When asked about her thoughts on, say, the role of writers in a time of crisis, she says, seriously: \u201cWell, I seek to dismantle the idea that having a job is a good thing because jobs are an excuse for a social construct whereby a minor social class hoard the means of survival and portion them out as and when they see fit to ultimately allow them to hoard more. But, inasmuch as we need to produce to justify our worth, I guess there is an argument that if people don\u2019t read novels, they will find solace in other ways that deplete our resources more \u2013 so, maybe, in a roundabout way, novels ultimately save us from burning fossil fuels?\u201d</p> <p>Such big picture thinking may sound exhausting but it is standard for Dolan, who is watching people\u2019s reactions to the current crisis with interest. \u201cI do wonder, when people I know who aren\u2019t panicked by climate change won\u2019t leave their house over this, how much blind panic should I then be feeling, as the person who is normally reacting to ecological and social breakdown way before everyone else,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019m just gormlessly scrolling Twitter.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fa77f5c5711855c19c1f62f8fddf30c6cd216598\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa77f5c5711855c19c1f62f8fddf30c6cd216598/0_0_310_500/310.jpg\" alt=\"The jacket of Naoise Dolan\u2019s Exciting Times\" width=\"310\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Dolan is autistic and finds comfort in small routines, a source of solace now much curtailed. She gives the example of buying a flat white: \u201cNow that sounds like such a ridiculous thing to complain about. But it\u2019s not about the coffee, it is about having a certainty from which things can flow. Because so much of the world is overwhelming to you when you are autistic, being able to put some things on autopilot is a huge relief and lets you make decisions in a reasonable time frame. So buying a flat white tells me I can then look at my emails or write 1,000 words. When one thing goes, the whole ecosystem goes. But it is objectively ridiculous to complain about a coffee.\u201d</p> <p>Does she find it frustrating how quickly great change has happened, planes grounded and allowances made for remote working, as an environmentally minded autistic person who was told such change was impossible? \u201cIt is understandable \u2013 if you think something will personally impact you tomorrow, you will have a more visceral response to it than if it will kill people in other countries in 10 years\u2019 time,\u201d she says. \u201cBut the fact that accommodations can instantly happen is quite annoying. Autistic people have been asking for these allowances for so long \u2013 now abled people need them, snap, they\u2019re here.\u201d</p> <p>She doesn\u2019t think calamity makes for better books. \u201cI wasn\u2019t tracking literature when 9/11 happened, being a primary school kid and that,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think the fact that we\u2019re not talking about the great age of 9/11 novels is because, in practice, ecological and societal breakdown makes people worry and not better writers.\u201d The idea of her own novel providing comfort now is \u201cabsurd\u201d, she says \u2013 but then adds, almost sweetly, \u201cthough I hope it does.\u201d</p> <p>She suspects many readers won\u2019t like Ava, for her indecisiveness, her self-hatred, her self-awareness. \u201cThey\u2019re allowed,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I feel quite vulnerable when people judge things based on whether they like people or not, because I\u2019m not good at presenting myself as likable. I find it jarring when people describe politicians as wooden or cold \u2013 not critiquing their policies, but saying: \u2018I think his face was insufficiently caring.\u2019\u201d Citing a recent controversy in Irish politics (former Fine Gael politician Catherine Noone describing the taoiseach Leo Varadkar as <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-51282527\">autistic</a>), she says, darkly: \u201cThere are plenty of reasons to criticise Leo Varadkar without saying: \u2018He\u2019s on the spectrum.\u2019\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/06/exciting-times-by-naoise-dolan-review-a-bracing-witty-debut\">Exciting Times by Naoise Dolan review \u2013 bracing, witty debut novel</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Both Dolan and Ava are unsettled by the idea of doing something just because other people are. \u201cYou had to pretend to feel sad if you\u2019d been single too long,\u201d Ava notes. \u201cI hated doing that because there were other things I was actually sad about.\u201d Dolan gives the example of small talk about weather: \u201cPeople say they don\u2019t know why we talk about weather, but we know exactly why: so we can avoid talking about other things and they still want noise. People don\u2019t want to be told that. But I need to know the underlying purpose, why things are the way they are, which means I discover why people act the way they do when others wouldn\u2019t have to analyse that behaviour. I can explain why people do things in a way that completely spooks them.\u201d It is like Ava teaching English: she uses grammar intuitively, but only understands it when unpacking the rules for the children in her classes. \u201cI am allistic as a second language, in that sense,\u201d says Dolan.</p> <p>In several ways, her radar for the minutiae of human interactions, and her wry understanding of why we dance certain dances, is what makes her such a brilliant novelist, at 28 and with one book under her belt.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s the author\u2019s equivalent of the no-trousers-in-class nightmare: your first book is finally published but almost every bookshop across the world is closed. With the outbreak of coronavirus, this once unimaginable vision is now reality for hundreds of writers who have been cruelly caught out \u2013 a book newly published and no shelf to put it on. Naoise Dolan is one such author. We were supposed to meet in a London cafe in mid-March, but events intervened and our cosy meeting was hurriedly changed \u2013 to a socially distant interview across two park benches, then a very socially distant chat on Skype. The 28-year-old Dubliner, who is here to promote her novel, Exciting Times, groans: \u201cI just did a bunch of interviews in Ireland and now I know every single one is going to start: \u2018I met Naoise Dolan in simpler times, in a simple cafe, as she sipped her simple flat white and simply shook hands.\u2019\u201d Her aptly named debut follows Ava, a directionless 22-year-old who leaves Ireland by spending her \u201cabortion fund\u201d on a ticket to Hong Kong. There she teaches English and meets Julian, a 28-year-old Etonian banker, and the two enter a careful sexual arrangement that teeters on becoming emotionally meaningful. As Ava sees their relationship: \u201cIt didn\u2019t have a name, apart from hanging out, catching up, or popping in for a chat, which was, to be fair, the content of what we were doing.\u201d When Julian temporarily returns to England, along comes Edith, a Cambridge-educated lawyer a drifter among Hong Kong\u2019s elite twentysomethings. (\u201cHer accent was churchy, highup, with all the cathedral drops of English intonation,\u201d Ava observes.) Where Julian is emotionally distant, Edith is unabashedly enthusiastic about dating Ava and the two are happy for a while. But for all her clever thoughts about love, sex and power, Ava\u2019s reluctance to tell either Julian and Edith about each other begins to cause problems; as Edith says later: \u201cIf you really think there\u2019s nothing intrinsically wrong with fucking multiple people \u2013 and you\u2019re right, there isn\u2019t \u2013 then why did you lie to me?\u201d Exciting Times is, at its heart, not about the pros and cons of bisexual polyamory but a touching exploration of modern female self-loathing as seen in recent novels such as Ottessa Moshfegh\u2019s My Year of Rest and Relaxation or Sally Rooney\u2019s Normal People. (During her time as editor of literary magazine the Stinging Fly, Rooney published the first excerpt of Exciting Times.)

      "body": "<p>For the last few weeks a nightly musical ritual has taken hold of a small but growing corner of Twitter. Thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tim_Burgess\">Tim Burgess</a>, singer with the longstanding British group the Charlatans, <a href=\"https://timstwitterlisteningparty.com/\">each evening at an appointed time</a>, anyone who fancies participating puts on a particular album \u2013 and, as it plays, posts their thoughts with the hashtag #timstwitterlisteningparty. Better still, musicians who made the tracks often join in, adding their insights and recollections.</p> <p>I have taken part in two events far \u2013 for the Flaming Lips\u2019 1999 masterpiece The Soft Bulletin and Our Favourite Shop, the Style Council\u2019s evocation of Britain in the Thatcher years, released in 1985. Music of any kind is usually life-affirming: talking and thinking about it often has the same effect. This is a big part of how many of us are getting through the crisis.

      "bodyText": "For the last few weeks a nightly musical ritual has taken hold of a small but growing corner of Twitter. Thanks to Tim Burgess, singer with the longstanding British group the Charlatans, each evening at an appointed time, anyone who fancies participating puts on a particular album \u2013 and, as it plays, posts their thoughts with the hashtag #timstwitterlisteningparty. Better still, musicians who made the tracks often join in, adding their insights and recollections. I have taken part in two events far \u2013 for the Flaming Lips\u2019 1999 masterpiece The Soft Bulletin and Our Favourite Shop, the Style Council\u2019s evocation of Britain in the Thatcher years, released in 1985. Music of any kind is usually life-affirming: talking and thinking about it often has the same effect. This is a big part of how many of us are getting through the crisis. Moreover, as the grim effects of the outbreak become clearer by the day, what we are listening to offers a comforting reminder of the world we suddenly left behind mere weeks ago.

Netflix, which is expected to smash its forecast of 7 million new global subscribers when it reports first-quarter results on Tuesday, is the main target as millions of new potential customers seek entertainment while confined to their homes. The cybersecurity firm Mimecast has identified around 700 suspicious scam websites impersonating the world\u2019s most-popular streaming service that appeared between 6 April and Easter. The newer Disney+, which started its international rollout in earnest last month launching in western Europe\u2019s main markets including the UK, was mimicked by four new websites in the same one-week period. Some of the counterfeit sites can look extremely convincing, selling subscriptions or free accounts to harvest personal and credit card data, although most are poorly designed and have language errors that mark them out as suspicious. \u201cWe have seen a dramatic rise in suspicious domains impersonating a variety of streaming giants for nefarious purposes,\u201d said Carl Wearn, the head of e-crime at Mimecast. \u201cThese spoof websites often lure unsuspecting members of the public in with an offer of free subscriptions to steal valuable data. The data harvested includes names, addresses and other personal information, as well as stealing credit card details for financial gain.\u201d Government lockdowns to curb the spread of coronavirus have proved to be a boon for TV \u2013 UK broadcasters recorded a 29% increase in viewing over Easter compared with last year \u2013 and subscription services. Disney+, whose content offering includes the hit $100m Star Wars live-action series The Mandalorian, almost doubled global subscriber numbers to 50 million between February, when the virus took hold, and early April. Netflix, which has more than 160 million subscribers globally, has seen its market value surge to a record $192bn during the lockdown \u2013 more than that of Disney, the world\u2019s biggest entertainment company. \u201cThis Covid-19 environment is a bonanza for streaming giants like Netflix,\u201d said Daniel Ives, the managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities. \u201cTech stalwarts like Netflix and Amazon continue to lead the overall tech market higher as investors realise the strong are getting stronger.

That\u2019s why it\u2019s so urgent that we identify who is vulnerable so we can put measures in place.\u201d</p> \n<p>But he cautioned that, while much of the support offered was likely to be digital while physical distancing continues, we must still ensure those interventions have been properly trialled: \u201cOne of my concerns is that in our rush to be supportive there\u2019s this widespread rollout of digital technologies that are not evidence-based.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/urgent-studies-needed-mental-health-coronavirus-lockdown\">'Urgent studies needed' into mental health impact of coronavirus</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The survey of 3,077 UK adults recruited according to age, sex and socioeconomic background is being led by the University of Glasgow in collaboration with Samaritans and the Scottish Association for Mental Health.</p> \n<p>The survey is exploring new territory, O\u2019Connor said. \u201cWe know from research into Sars in China that there can be a mental health impact, but we don\u2019t know who is likely to be affected.\u201d</p> \n<p>With interim findings expected in the next few weeks, O\u2019Connor is hopeful that researchers can gain an impression of the impact of lockdown, along with indications about the groups of people who need immediate support.</p> \n<p>Central to this, said O\u2019Connor, was understanding what the factors are that predict feelings of loneliness and entrapment in some people but not others.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between people who are socially isolated and do feel lonely, and those who don\u2019t? If you look at the research on loneliness, it is such a strong predictor of death by physical causes as well as death by suicide.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnother factor to understand is that of entrapment. People feel trapped by mental pain, but in this current context they are feeling physical entrapment. What is the interface between lockdown measures and psychological entrapment? Again, we know entrapment is such an important predictor of depression and suicidal thoughts and behaviour.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>As regards entrapment, for example, participants will be asked to rate on a sliding scale the extent to which the statements relate to them, such as \u201cI feel powerless to change things\u201d and \u201cI feel trapped inside myself\u201d.</p> \n<p>The respondents will be surveyed six times over six months, completing a range of questions covering their background, living arrangements, lifestyle factors such as drinking and exercise, mental health and wellbeing, their experience of Covid-19, financial issues, as well as any pre-existing health problems. They will also be asked about feelings of entrapment, loneliness and other psychological variables.</p> \n<p>O\u2019Connor was one of a group of experts who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/urgent-studies-needed-mental-health-coronavirus-lockdown\">wrote in the journal Lancet Psychiatry </a>last week highlighting the need for a thorough and coordinated programme of research into the potentially profound and long-lasting impact of both the virus itself and the experience of lockdown and other measures on the population\u2019s mental health.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>While the team will have a much clearer picture after six months, O\u2019Connor is certain that the economic consequences, already felt by so many, will have a significant effect. \u201cOur feeling is, if there is an impact, it will be much longer term: there will be a short-term impact, but it will really be when the economic consequences kick in.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe know this will have a disproportionate effect on people who are already vulnerable \u2013 that could be having pre-existing mental health problems, but it could also mean those who are feeling trapped, or those experiencing financial hardship. Now we are trying to get a sense of who we need to identify and then how they can best be protected.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>\u2022 In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or by emailing <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a>.

The survey is exploring new territory, O\u2019Connor said. \u201cWe know from research into Sars in China that there can be a mental health impact, but we don\u2019t know who is likely to be affected.\u201d With interim findings expected in the next few weeks, O\u2019Connor is hopeful that researchers can gain an impression of the impact of lockdown, along with indications about the groups of people who need immediate support. Central to this, said O\u2019Connor, was understanding what the factors are that predict feelings of loneliness and entrapment in some people but not others. \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between people who are socially isolated and do feel lonely, and those who don\u2019t? If you look at the research on loneliness, it is such a strong predictor of death by physical causes as well as death by suicide. \u201cAnother factor to understand is that of entrapment. People feel trapped by mental pain, but in this current context they are feeling physical entrapment. What is the interface between lockdown measures and psychological entrapment? Again, we know entrapment is such an important predictor of depression and suicidal thoughts and behaviour.\u201d As regards entrapment, for example, participants will be asked to rate on a sliding scale the extent to which the statements relate to them, such as \u201cI feel powerless to change things\u201d and \u201cI feel trapped inside myself\u201d. The respondents will be surveyed six times over six months, completing a range of questions covering their background, living arrangements, lifestyle factors such as drinking and exercise, mental health and wellbeing, their experience of Covid-19, financial issues, as well as any pre-existing health problems. They will also be asked about feelings of entrapment, loneliness and other psychological variables. O\u2019Connor was one of a group of experts who wrote in the journal Lancet Psychiatry last week highlighting the need for a thorough and coordinated programme of research into the potentially profound and long-lasting impact of both the virus itself and the experience of lockdown and other measures on the population\u2019s mental health. While the team will have a much clearer picture after six months, O\u2019Connor is certain that the economic consequences, already felt by so many, will have a significant effect. \u201cOur feeling is, if there is an impact, it will be much longer term: there will be a short-term impact, but it will really be when the economic consequences kick in. \u201cWe know this will have a disproportionate effect on people who are already vulnerable \u2013 that could be having pre-existing mental health problems, but it could also mean those who are feeling trapped, or those experiencing financial hardship. Now we are trying to get a sense of who we need to identify and then how they can best be protected.\u201d \u2022 In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or by emailing jo@samaritans.org.

Having delayed payments from the over-75s and stepped up its public service offering with education and more during the pandemic, the BBC faces a cash-strapped future of its own. It would be a travesty if it\u2019s now forced to help local news even more, having stumped up millions for the Local Democracy Reporting Service already. The post-Covid world is likely to see less money for everyone, of course, with the exception of Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg. We will all need to work out what needs supporting with limited resources. Even discussing state support for journalism shows how far the news business has fallen. But if we accept that journalism is vital to society, and the current economic model doesn\u2019t work, then something must be done, not just by the government but by all of us.",

      "bodyText": "The Portuguese government has attributed the country\u2019s low coronavirus caseload to a swift, flexible \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d response and to the early closure of schools and universities on 16 March. Despite the fact that around 22% of Portugal\u2019s 10.3 million people are aged 65 or over, making them particularly vulnerable to the virus, the country has so far registered just over 20,000 cases and 714 deaths \u2013 far fewer than its neighbours. Spain has recorded more than 195,000 cases and more than 20,000 deaths, Italy 176,000 cases and more than 23,000 deaths, and France 153,000 cases and around 20,000 deaths. Portugal\u2019s coronavirus mortality rate is around 3%, compared with 13% in the UK and Belgium and 10% in Spain. Ant\u00f3nio Sales, the secretary of state for health in Portugal\u2019s socialist minority government, said the administration had \u201ctaken the right measures at the right time\u201d after monitoring the spread of the virus from the end of January. \u201cThe Portuguese response to the global coronavirus outbreak has, since the very beginning, been based on the best scientific advice and on other countries\u2019 experience,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cIt has been regularly reassessed and adapted to a very fast evolution. The country has been preparing for the worst-case scenario.\u201d Sales said that the decision to close all schools and universities in mid-March \u2013 when the country had logged 112 cases and no fatalities \u2013 had proved pivotal. \u201cAnticipating the spread of the infection and community transmission, the government decided to close educational institutions in order to limit the contact of a large amount of people in a confined place,\u201d he said. Six days after the country\u2019s educational establishments were shut, Portugal declared a state of emergency and moved into full lockdown after recording 448 cases. Spain had gone into lockdown on 14 March after logging more than 6,000 cases. Sales said the government had also moved quickly to increase laboratory and invasive ventilation capacity and to plan for the provision of more intensive care unit beds. He added that Portugal\u2019s rapid reaction had been helped by five years of sustained investment to bring the national health service back to pre-austerity levels. \u201cBetween December 2015 and December 2019, the national health workforce has increased by 13%, which means that more 15,000 healthcare workers, including 3,700 doctors and 6,600 nurses, are working,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, between 2015 and 2019, government expenditure on health has increased by 18% (\u20ac1.6bn).\u201d Many health workers across the border in Spain argue that its response to the pandemic has been hampered by a lack of investment in health services \u2013 especially in Madrid, the region hit hardest by the virus. In\u00eas Fronteira, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the institute of hygiene and tropical medicine at Lisbon\u2019s Nova University, said investment in the health system had paid off, but added that Covid-19\u2019s relatively late arrival in Portugal had bought the country more time to monitor and prepare. \u201cWe detected the first case on 2 March and then local transmission began on 12 March \u2013 much later than in France and Spain, or Italy,\u201d she said. \u201cSo Portugal had the opportunity to watch what other countries were going through, to see what measures were being taken, and to learn from those experiences. Portugal ended up implementing more or less the same measures as other countries \u2013 and at the same time \u2013 but the epidemic here was at a much earlier stage than in other countries.\u201d Fronteira said Portugal\u2019s centralised health system and cross-party support for the emergency measures had also helped. In Spain, healthcare is the responsibility of the country\u2019s 17 autonomous regional governments and the response was not brought under the control of the central government until the state of emergency was declared. Despite a recent poll showing that almost 90% of Spaniards felt that all political parties should support the government\u2019s crisis management, opposition leaders have repeatedly attacked the socialist-led coalition government of Pedro S\u00e1nchez. That has not been the case in Portugal. \u201cPolitical parties have adopted a responsible behaviour because everybody understood very well the importance of being united to tackle an unexpected pandemic with dramatic consequences,\u201d said Sales. According to Fronteira, the pandemic underscores the need for proper preparation. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be crucial to the next stage of the epidemic as we start discussing whether to loosen the measures or not,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to take one step at a time because you need to have time to measure the impact of each of the measures.

Seven people were in isolation at his hospital, he said, and the disease appeared to be a coronavirus, from the same family as Sars.</p> <p>In early January he was called in by police, reprimanded for \u201cspreading rumours online\u201d, and forced to sign a paper acknowledging his \u201cmisdemeanour\u201d and promising not to repeat it.</p> <p>Many early cases were linked to the city\u2019s Huanan seafood and fresh produce market, which also sold wildlife, suggesting that the first cases were contracted there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"530a63bd00148e7bdeaa4e6481f85167334f3ca0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/530a63bd00148e7bdeaa4e6481f85167334f3ca0/0_0_4000_2774/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Wuhan hygiene emergency response team leave the closed Huanan seafood wholesale market on 11 January 11.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"694\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Wuhan hygiene emergency response team leave the closed Huanan seafood wholesale market on 11 January.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Noel Celis/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Scientists would discover the disease had probably originated in bats and had then passed through a second species \u2013 in all likelihood, but not certainly, pangolins, a type of scaly anteater \u2013 before infecting humans.</p> <p>But the infections were soon spreading directly between patients, so fast that on 23 January the government announced an unprecedented lockdown of Wuhan city and the surrounding Hubei province.</p> <p>Two weeks later, on 7 February, Li, who had contracted coronavirus himself, died in hospital from the condition about which he had tried to raise the alarm. He had no known underlying conditions and left behind a wife and young child.</p> <p>Li became the face of the mysterious new disease. The story of his death and pictures of him in a hospital bed wearing an oxygen mask made media headlines across the globe, including in the UK.</p> <p>The world, it seemed, was slowly becoming more aware of how lethal coronavirus could be, that it was not just another form of <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-mixed-messages-idUSKBN2102GY\">flu </a>with fairly mild symptoms.</p> <p>But while UK scientists and medical researchers were becoming more concerned, and studying the evidence from China, those among them who were most worried were not getting their messages through to high places.</p> <h2>Distracted by Brexit and reshuffles</h2> <p>The Conservative government of Boris Johnson had other more immediate preoccupations at the start of this year.</p> <p>Johnson was still basking in his general election success last December. After he returned from a celebratory Caribbean holiday with his fiancee, Carrie Symonds, the political weather for the prime minister seemed to be set fair. It was honeymoon time.</p> <p>Three and a half years on from the Brexit referendum, the UK was finally about to leave the EU on 31 January. The fireworks and parties for the big night were being planned, the celebratory 50p coins minted.</p> <p>Minds were certainly not on a developing health emergency far away, as Johnson prepared to exploit the moment of the UK\u2019s departure from the European Union for all it was worth. \u201cI think there was some over-confidence,\u201d admitted one very senior Tory last week.</p> <p>The prime minister and his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, wanted to make an early impression at home in other ways too, as domestic reformers. Cummings was waging a war on civil servants in Whitehall, throwing his weight around and deliberately upsetting the Westminster applecart.</p> <p>While he made the headlines, briefing about his iconoclastic ambitions, Johnson was preparing a big Cabinet reshuffle to assert his own authority in other areas now Brexit was done and dusted.</p> <p>With Labour effectively leaderless after its fourth consecutive election defeat, there was little opposition to trouble Johnson on any front at all \u2013 and certainly no-one of note asking tough questions about coronavirus.</p> <p>The prime minister duly recast his cabinet team on 13 February \u2013 five days after Li\u2019s death in Wuhan.

And lastly, in a more sombre voice, he spoke of \u201cdealing with coronavirus and keeping the public safe\u201d before adding, as the grin returned: \u201cNow let\u2019s get back to work!\u201d</p> <p>It is perhaps too early to conclude for sure that Johnson, Hancock and the government\u2019s entire team of scientific and medical advisers were caught asleep at the wheel. But the fact that Johnson and Hancock themselves, in common with much of the Downing Street staff, would go on to contract the virus or suffer symptoms, further suggests that people at the top had not been sufficiently on their guard.</p> <p>Now, 11 weeks on from the first cases being confirmed in the UK on 31 January \u2013 a period during which <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">more than 14,000 people</a> (and probably several thousands more once care home fatalities are counted) in the UK have died from Covid-19 \u2013 and with the country in lockdown, the economy facing prolonged recession as a result, schools closed, and no sign of an end in sight \u2013 hard questions have to be asked.</p> <p>We already know with some certainty that other countries, such as Germany, South Korea, Taiwan and New Zealand, will emerge from this crisis having performed far better than the UK. A few weeks ago the government\u2019s advisers crassly said that fewer than 20,000 deaths would be \u201ca very good result\u201d for the UK.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/michael-gove-fails-to-deny-pm-missed-five-coronavirus-cobra-meetings\">Boris Johnson missed five coronavirus Cobra meetings, Michael Gove says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As we fast approach that grim tally, many experts now believe the UK may come out of this crisis, whenever that may be, with one of the worst records on fighting coronavirus of any European nation. Once the full tally is counted, few expect the number of deaths to be below 20,000.</p> <p>By contrast, on Friday, Germany was saying it thought it had brought coronavirus largely under control. It had had 3,868 deaths, less a third of the total in the UK (and Germany\u2019s population, at 83 million, is far higher), having conducted widespread testing for Covid-19 from early on, precisely as the UK has failed to do.</p> <p>How, then, did it come to this? How did coronavirus spread across the globe, prompting different responses in different countries? Did the UK simply fail to heed the warnings? Or did it just decide to take different decisions, while others settled on alternative actions to save lives?</p> <h2>The warnings grow louder</h2> <p>David Nabarro, professor of global health at Imperial College, London, and an envoy for the World Health Organization on Covid-19, says one thing is for sure. All governments were warned how serious the situation was likely to become as early as the end of January. Ignorance of the danger that was coming can be no excuse. Yet it would not be until late March \u2013 later than many other countries \u2013 that Johnson would announce a complete lockdown.</p> <p>\u201cWHO had been following the outbreak since the end of December and within a few weeks it called a meeting of its emergency committee to decide if this outbreak was a \u2018public health emergency of international concern\u2019,\u201d said Nabarro.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>WHO made it very clear \u2013 to every country in the world \u2013 that we were facing something very serious indeed</p> <footer> <cite>Prof David Nabarro, Imperial College, London</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThat is the highest level of alert that WHO can issue, and it issued it on January 30. It made it very clear then \u2013 to every country in the world \u2013 that we were facing something very serious indeed.\u201d</p> <p>Well before the end of January, the WHO had been tracking the growing threat minutely: 14 January was a key day in the spread of the disease that would become known as Covid-19. The first case was confirmed outside China, with a woman hospitalised in Thailand.</p> <p>A WHO official warned then that it was possible that <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-pneumonia-who-idUSKBN1ZD16J\">human-to-human transmission</a> had occurred in families of victims \u2013 a sign that the disease had potential to spread far and fast \u2013 and, inside China, officials were quietly <a href=\"https://apnews.com/68a9e1b91de4ffc166acd6012d82c2f9?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_medium=AP\">told to prepare for a pandemic</a>.</p> <p>There was little international attention on the day, though, because Beijing\u2019s dire warnings about a pandemic were made in secret, and a WHO spokesman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/14/case-of-mystery-coronavirus-found-outside-china-for-the-first-time-thailand\">rowed back from his colleague\u2019s claim</a>.</p> <p>Officially, China had not seen a new case of the coronavirus for over a week; the outbreak appeared to be fading. It took another six days for China to publicly acknowledge the gravity of the threat, time that scientists believed meant a further 3,000 people were infected.</p> <p>But on 20 January, officials announced more than 100 new cases and admitted the virus was spreading between humans, a red flag for concern to anyone who works on infectious diseases. The virus could no longer be contained by finding the animal source of the infection and destroying it.</p> <p>Two days later, the scale of the challenge was made clear to the general public when Beijing locked down millions of people. All transport into and out of the metropolis of Wuhan was cut off, an unprecedented modern quarantine that would come at huge human and economic cost.</p> <p>On 29 January, the UK would have its first two confirmed cases of the disease. There was little sense that China\u2019s dilemma and its approach \u2013 shut down life as we know it or watch the death toll spiral out of control \u2013 might have to be our nightmare within weeks.</p> <p>In early February, Donald Trump announced a ban on travellers who had passed through China in the previous 14 days. Europe began focused testing of people with symptoms and travel histories that linked them to the disease, but little else.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Johnson, it seemed, still had Brexit and free trade much more on his mind. Any hint of draconian action to fight coronavirus that might hurt the economy was the last thing he was entertaining.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-speech-in-greenwich-3-february-2020\">speech on Brexit</a> in Greenwich on 3 February, he made clear his views on Wuhan-style lockdowns. \u201cWe are starting to hear some bizarre autarkic rhetoric,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen barriers are going up, and when there is a risk that new diseases such as coronavirus will trigger a panic and a desire for market segregation that go beyond what is medically rational to the point of doing real and unnecessary economic damage.</p> <p>\u201cThen, at that moment, humanity needs some government somewhere that is willing at least to make the case powerfully for freedom of exchange, some country ready to take off its Clark Kent spectacles and leap into the phone booth and emerge with its cloak flowing as the supercharged champion of the right of the populations of the Earth to buy and sell freely among each other.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Herd immunity\u2019: UK goes it alone</h2> <p>By early March it was abundantly clear to many academics and scientists that the approach being adopted by the UK was markedly different from those followed by other countries. From South Korea to Germany, governments had invested heavily in expanding testing capacity from the first weeks of the epidemic.</p> <p>Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore had brought in controls on travellers from infected regions and strict contact tracing to help understand who could have been exposed, inform them and require self isolation. Face masks became widespread in east Asia, long before it was recommended elsewhere.</p> <p>Testing and contact tracing has been at the heart of the approach advocated by the WHO, so that countries can establish how transmission chains were occurring, in order to break them<em>.</em></p> <p>Many also brought in some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-and-social-distancing-is-it-risky-to-go-to-the-pub-or-gym\" title=\"\">social distancing</a> measures, banning large gatherings, closing schools or extending holidays, and encouraged those who could do to work from home. None were as extreme as China\u2019s shutdown, or the European and American lockdowns that would follow.</p> <p>Writing in the Observer last month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/britain-goes-it-alone-over-coronavirus-we-can-only-hope-the-gamble-pays-off\">Devi Sridhar</a>, chair of global public health at the University of Ediburgh, noted the distinct UK approach. \u201cRather than learning from other countries and following the WHO advice, which comes from experts with decades of experience in tackling outbreaks across the world, the UK has decided to follow its own path. This seems to accept that the virus is unstoppable and will probably become an annual, seasonal infection.</p> <p>\u201cThe plan, as explained by the chief science adviser, is to work towards \u2018herd immunity\u2019, which is to have the majority of the population contract the virus, develop antibodies and then become immune to it. This theory has been widely used to advocate for mass vaccination for measles, mumps and rubella. The thinking is that, if most of the population is vaccinated, a small percentage can go unvaccinated without cases emerging.\u201d</p> <p>It was not just the UK whose politicians and scientific advisers were, arguably, slow to act in the early stages. Others countries, including Spain and France, were caught out too, but it was Italy\u2019s tragedy that alerted Europe to the scale of the threat it faced.</p> <p>European governments and citizens were forced to reckon with the reality that in an age of global travel, the thousands of miles separating them from China meant almost nothing at all. Thousands of Britons were holidaying in Italy the week that it shut down. They were advised to go into self-quarantine on return, but were not registered by the health authorities, nor were their contacts tracked.</p> <p>Italy and the UK had both had had their first case a day apart at the end of January, but cases rose faster in Italy. The country may just have been unlucky that carriers of the disease flew to its northern cities and ski resorts rather than to other European capitals.</p> <p>Whatever the reason, cases and then deaths started climbing sharply in northern Italy in late February. Dozens of towns were locked down from the 21st, but in the rest of the country life carried on as normal.</p> <p>It was soon clear that the problem had not been contained. On 8 March, the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, quarantined 16 million people across the north of the country, and the next day extended the lockdown to all of Italy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da874a2da80ade88d27d5e6cc500ded7835d54bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da874a2da80ade88d27d5e6cc500ded7835d54bf/0_0_4262_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Russian biological warfare troops, called in by the Italian authorities, disinfect the Pope John Paul I care home near Bergamo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"704\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Russian biological warfare troops, called in by the Italian authorities, disinfect the Pope John Paul I care home near Bergamo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Russian Defence Ministry/TASS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The measures saved lives, but came too late for thousands of Italians. The death toll outstripped China, and the world looked on horrified as hospitals were overwhelmed, doctors forced to choose who should have a chance on a ventilator and who should die. On 11 March, the WHO declared a global pandemic. On 14 March, Spain went into lockdown, and three days later France did the same.</p> <p>But in the UK there appeared to be greater reluctance to act decisively with lockdowns: the banning of mass gatherings and the closure of pubs and restaurants. The government\u2019s scientific and behavioural science advisers were warning ministers that the public might react badly to draconian measures and would not tolerate them for long.</p> <p>In an apparent show of defiance against the lockdowners, Johnson and Symonds attended the England v Wales rugby match at Twickenham on 7 March. The Cheltenham Festival, attended over three days to 13 March by 250,000 racegoers, was allowed to go ahead.</p> <h2>Shutdown: Johnson changes tack</h2> <p>The tone was about to change. In a Downing Street press conference on 12 March, Johnson, who had said a few days before the first UK death that the disease was \u201clikely to spread a bit more\u201d suddenly became the deliverer of grave warnings.</p> <p>Previous talk by his advisers of avoiding lockdowns and developing \u201cherd immunity\u201d had been banished and replaced by a brutal honesty. \u201cI must level with you,\u201d Johnson told reporters. \u201cMore families, many more families, are going to lose loved ones before their time.\u201d On 18 March \u2013 just days after Downing Street had suggested it was not on the cards \u2013 the government announced the closure of all schools until further noticed. Pubs and restaurants were ordered to shut on 20 March. The UK had come late into line.</p> <p>One former cabinet minister last week described the change of approach as a \u201cscreeching U-turn\u201d. Johnson and his ministers were now, even more than before, taking cover behind, and advice from, their scientific and medical advisers. Many of these advisers had become increasingly concerned that the UK had become out of step with other countries because of political resistance from ministers to measures that would hit the economy. The Observer has been told that at least two senior government advisers were on the brink of of quitting before Johnson switched his approach.</p> <p>The government has found itself unable to escape the consequences of a wider failure to prepare. As hospitals threatened to be overwhelmed before orders were given to massively expand capacity, ministers came under intense criticism over the lack of protective equipment for frontline NHS staff, over the lack of ventilators for patients in intensive care, and for a failure to test more widely for Covid-19, particularly among NHS workers.</p> <p>The lack of preparedness and instances of chaotic planning has shocked many in and outside the NHS.</p> <p>Last week, Dr Alison Pittard, the dean of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, the professional body for intensive care practitioners, said the minimum specifications for the government\u2019s own homegrown ventilator scheme would produce machines that would only treat patients \u201cfor a few hours\u201d. \u201cIf we had been told that that was the case\u2026 we\u2019d have said: \u2018Don\u2019t bother, you\u2019re wasting your time. That\u2019s of no use\u2019,\u201d she told the <em>Financial Times</em>.</p> <p>Last month the government missed an EU procurement deadline for ventilators because, minister said, an email went unnoticed. The NHS had said 30,000 more would be needed, Hancock reduced this to 18,000. Pittard said her faculty had been warning for years about a shortage of intensive care capacity and intensive care nurses in hospitals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"791815c54c476190b88004cd04d9024ea7189758\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/791815c54c476190b88004cd04d9024ea7189758/0_0_3920_2751/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson and partner Carrie Symonds with the England captain Owen Farrell at Twickenham on 7 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"702\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson and partner Carrie Symonds with the England captain Owen Farrell at Twickenham on 7 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Normally each intensive care patient would have one intensive care nurse in attendance all the time, she said. Now there was one nurse to six patients, although other staff had been redeployed to intensive care units to plug the gaps and the new system was working because of heroic efforts. Although she was reluctant to criticise the government, she said that if the faculty had been listened to, \u201cwe wouldn\u2019t be starting from this place\u201d. Germany, she pointed out, has 29 intensive care beds per 100,000 people, compared with six in the UK.</p> <p>The Tory MP and former health minister Dan Poulter, who works part-time in the NHS, said that given the enormity of the challenge facing government \u201cit almost seems wrong to be critical\u201d.</p> <p>But he believes part of the problem is that insufficient advice has been sought from experienced NHS clinicians who would have warned of problems with PPE early on, of the shortage of ventilators and would have told ministers of the urgent need to test NHS staff.</p> <p>\u201cAn early over-reliance on academic modelling also resulted in a lack of experienced frontline NHS clinicians \u2013 in other words, the people who really understand the day-to-day challenges our hospitals and health service face \u2013 from feeding into the initial Covid-19 action plan,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has manifested itself amongst other things in the slowness of providing adequate PPE for frontline NHS staff and in the lack of virus testing for healthcare staff in the earlier part of the outbreak.\u201d</p> <h2>How the scientists reacted</h2> <p>When the investigations into the UK\u2019s response to Covid-19 come to be written, there is widespread recognition among experts that this lack of long-term strategic planning will be at the centre of it. So too should be the need to ensure that the views of experts are fed into government more efficiently and widely. The prospect of a previously unknown disease spreading catastrophically around the globe and infecting millions is, after all, not a new one.</p> <p>Indeed, many warnings have been given in the past about the viral dangers facing humanity. \u201cGiven the continual emergence of new pathogens ... and the ever-increasing connectedness of our world, there is a significant probability that a large and lethal pandemic will occur in our lifetime,\u201d Bill Gates predicted several years ago. \u201cAnd it will have the impact of a nuclear war,\u201d he warned, while urging nations to start stockpiling antiviral drugs and therapies. If only.</p> <p>For its part, the WHO prepared \u2013 several years ago \u2013 a list of viruses with no known treatments or vaccines, illnesses that could one day trigger that pandemic and kill hundreds of thousands. Prospective killers included nipah disease and lassa fever as well as an ailment it simply called \u201cdisease X\u201d \u2013 \u201ca serious international epidemic caused by a pathogen currently unknown\u201d.</p> <p>As to the most likely nature of that mysterious virus, most modelling assumed that disease X would be flu-like in behaviour, says Dr Josie Golding, the epidemics lead at the Wellcome Trust. After all, influenza had caused so many deadly global outbreaks in the past. As a result, a lot of investment went into making influenza vaccines in preparation, she says. \u201cBut have we been thinking about diseases other than influenza that might become pandemics? I don\u2019t think we have. There has been a real gap in our thinking.\u201d</p> <p>Then came the appearance of Covid-19 \u2013 caused not by a strain of influenza but by a coronavirus \u2013 in November. Initially, only a few cases were highlighted, a trend that began to change early this year with a rise in numbers of infected ill people.</p> <p>\u201cThe report that really grabbed my attention came out in mid-January,\u201d says epidemiologist Professor Mark Woolhouse at Edinburgh University. \u201cIt said 41 cases of this new respiratory illness had now been diagnosed in one small area of China, around Wuhan. And that set the alarm bells ringing for me.\u201d</p> <p>For Woolhouse, the cluster of cases in one place showed this was not a matter of a few people scattered around China picking up an occasional infection from an animal such as a bat or a chicken. \u201cForty-one cases in one small area at the same time could not be explained that way. People are not picking this up from animals, I realised. They are actually spreading it to each other. It was already heading out of control.\u201d</p> <p>Ewan Birney, head of the Cambridgeshire-based European Bioinformatics Institute, part of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory network, also noted the significance of the new disease at the time. \u201cI presumed, at first, that this one would also burn itself out, probably somewhere in Asia,\u201d he says.</p> <p>His reasoning was straightforward. The outbreak of Sars that appeared in 2003 in China was caused by a coronavirus and killed more than 10% of those it infected. \u201cIn fact, it killed or hospitalised so many of those it infected the chain of transmission from one person to others was cut. It was too lethal for its own good. So I thought this might happen with this new disease. But it turns out Covid-19 is much milder and incapacitates fewer individuals, so there is no cut in its transmission. When that became apparent \u2013 around mid-January \u2013 I became very worried.\u201d</p> <p>Then there was the infectiousness of the new virus. A person with Sars generally starts to display symptoms before they infect other people. That makes it much easier to contain. But this was not the case with Covid-19. Early data from China \u2013 again released in January \u2013 showed the virus was being spread from people who were displaying only the mildest symptoms, or in some cases no symptoms. This was making the condition very difficult to track, says virologist Professor Jonathan Ball of Nottingham University.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25977647596285090437cf9f7a40c96f7d171dab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25977647596285090437cf9f7a40c96f7d171dab/0_0_6048_4024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The County Oak Medical Centre in Brighton was closed on February 10 after a member of staff was infected with coronavirus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The County Oak Medical Centre in Brighton was closed on 10 February after a member of staff was infected with coronavirus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAt that point I realised this outbreak was going to be very serious,\u201d he added. \u201cI sent a tweet to a colleague in Australia. It simply said: \u2018This one is out of the bag properly\u2019. He sent one back agreeing with me.\u201d</p> <p>Around this time, Paul Nurse, Nobel laureate and head of the Francis Crick Institute, recalls attending a conference where he met Mark Walport, head of UK Research and Innovation, the organisation that funds a vast slice of British scientific research.</p> <p>\u201cHe had just received a text message from a colleague about the outbreak and we started to discuss the implications,\u201d Nurse recalls. \u201cIt did not take us long for us both to realise this was going to be very significant. It took another two or three weeks to confirm these worst fears \u2013 by mid-February.\u201d</p> <p>By this time, Birney had realised the virus had a real sting in its tail and could cause serious illness among the elderly and those with other underlying serious ailments. \u201cIt was half-term and I was on holiday with my parents. All I wanted to do was to get the holiday over and then get them back to their house in the country where they could keep themselves isolated.\u201d</p> <p>In February, sporadic cases of Covid-19 were appearing round the country, recalls Tom Wingfield, a clinician and infectious disease expert based at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. \u201cThese were cases that had been brought into the country, mainly from China or Italy. Then there was an outbreak in Brighton [and a number of other cases without foreign travel] and I realised that the virus had established itself in a community there. It was a turning point.\u201d</p> <p>Britain was still doing quite well in containing the disease by testing, tracing contact and setting up quarantine for those suspected of being infected with Covid-19 at this time. \u201cThen, in March, the government decided to abandon this approach and shift from containing the disease to delaying its progress,\u201d says Wingfield. \u201cI would really like to know why the decision to give up testing and contact tracing was taken.\u201d</p> <p>Many other researchers also question why the government took so long to react to their warnings. \u201cPart of the trouble was there were other virologists who were saying this was going to be like Sars or flu and there was not too much to worry about,\u201d says Ball. \u201cBut Sars happened in 2003. The world is much more connected now than it was then. More to the point, Covid-19 was also much more infectious than Sars. And so it started appearing in lots of other countries.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Perhaps some of us should have got up in front of BBC News and said you lot ought to be petrified because this is going to be a pandemic that will kill hundreds of thousands of people</p> <footer> <cite>Professor Jonathan Ball</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cPerhaps some of us should have got up in front of BBC News and said you lot ought to be petrified because this is going to be a pandemic that will kill hundreds of thousands of people,\u201d adds Ball. \u201cNone of us thought this was a particularly constructive thing to do, but maybe with hindsight we should have.

As a result, we were caught out.\u201d</p> <p>He and many others say an inquiry into Britain\u2019s Covid-19 preparedness will have to be held at some point but stress that this should not be started until the crisis has been dealt with in the UK.</p> <p>Professor Ian Boyd, a former chief scientific adviser at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, agrees. \u201cThere is a great danger there will be a lot of looking back with the benefits of hindsight and poking fingers of blame,\u201d warns Boyd. \u201cBut when you are in the middle of things you have to make a lot of very hard 50-50 decisions, and sometimes you make the wrong call. On the other hand, there is no harm in making sure that we learn as many lessons as we can.\u201d</p> <h2>The lessons from the rest of the world \u2026</h2> <p>Boris Johnson, after his own brush with death at the hands of Covid-19, will presumably no longer take the gung-ho attitude to illness that he has always has. A former Tory minister said: \u201cIf Boris had any sense he would take control of the inquiry and lead it.\u201d</p> <p>One conclusion that experts are already drawing is that it was those countries close to China, with memories of Sars, or cultural ties to their neighbour, which were much faster to act in response to Covid-19. Perhaps most notable in its success was Taiwan. Closely linked by economic and cultural ties to mainland China, Taiwan could have been at high risk of a major Covid-19 epidemic. Tourists and business people travelled regularly back and forth.</p> <p>But helped perhaps by having an epidemiologist as vice-president, the government set up a gold standard regime of testing and contact tracing that means that nearly three months on from its first confirmed infection, it has registered fewer than 400 cases and six deaths.</p> <p>Taiwan\u2019s extensive testing and thorough contact tracing are precisely the kind of action that the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt is demanding before the UK lockdown is lifted. Hunt points out that it is one of the essential conditions set by the WHO to avoid a second wave resulting from an easing of restrictions.</p> <p>Hong Kong, which also suffered from the Sars crisis, also moved early to enforce quarantine and social distancing, as well as widespread mask wearing, and today has registered just over 1,000 cases and only four deaths.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f289aa48517f17149a8041ae814acba0d3acdc0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f289aa48517f17149a8041ae814acba0d3acdc0/0_0_2677_1785/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man in Wuhan on February 10, the 19th day of the transport lockdown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man in Wuhan on 10 February, the 19th day of the transport lockdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In late February, South Korea looked like it was on a trajectory to disaster, with the highest number of confirmed cases outside China, and numbers rising rapidly. But after the country\u2019s first infection, the government met medical companies and urged them to start developing coronavirus test kits on a massive scale.</p> <p>The results were impressive. When the epidemic hit, it was ready to deploy largescale testing. Its measures allowed South Korea to become <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/world/asia/coronavirus-south-korea-flatten-curve.html\">the second country to flatten its coronavirus curve</a>, without the sweeping shutdowns of society and economic activity that China had pioneered and the west would be forced to adopt.</p> <p>China\u2019s experience should have provided a grim template for western countries to use to prepare. The speed with which Wuhan\u2019s crisis had intensified showed that a relatively advanced medical system could be swamped. Within three weeks there were over 64,000 people infected and 1,000 dead.</p> <p>The pleas for help from Wuhan\u2019s residents and doctors were to be echoed by those from Italy a few weeks later, and soon after the UK.</p> <p>Look back three months, and in China there were not enough tests to work out who had coronavirus, there was not enough protective equipment for medical staff treating patients, and then, soon, tragically there were not enough hospital beds and ventilators for sick patients. These are exactly the challenges faced by authorities from New York to Rome, London to Madrid.</p> <h2>\u2026 and the other country that didn\u2019t listen</h2> <p>If the UK has serious questions to answer, the country that so far has seen the worst of the outbreak, the United States, was slowest of all to act. Trump for months ignored, played down or lied about the threat posed by coronavirus, leaving individual states to act unilaterally as it became clear it had already taken hold on US soil.</p> <p>On 17 March parts of California issued \u201cshelter in place\u201d orders, effectively a lockdown. By the end of that week New York City had also shut down, along with a dozen states, and the majority of the rest of the country had put <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-state-by-state-guide-to-coronavirus-lockdowns-11584749351?mod=theme_coronavirus-ribbon\">some restrictions in place</a>. Only five states had few or no controls.</p> <p>There have now been nearly 700,000 confirmed cases in the US and over 33,000 deaths; actual numbers are likely to be higher for both. The economy has also been devastated, with more than 22 million out of work as businesses collapse or shrink under the strain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"69e38a47cdc18de7145f38e0be39c788201f5258\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/69e38a47cdc18de7145f38e0be39c788201f5258/0_0_3708_2472/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The US was slowest of all to act, but Donald Trump is ready to lift restrictions already.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The US was slowest of all to act, but Donald Trump is preparing to lift restrictions already.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Brandon/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trump insists the US is turning a corner, and has tried to blame \u2013 among other targets \u2013 the WHO for failing to fully raise the alarm, and has stripped it of its US funding.</p> <p>There have certainly been questions about the organisation\u2019s strong praise for China and the exclusion of Taiwan, which may have contributed to the delay in recognising human-to-human transmission was occurring.

      "bodyText": "By late December last year, doctors in the central Chinese city of Wuhan were starting to worry about patients quarantined in their hospitals suffering from an unusual type of pneumonia. As the mystery illness spread in one of China\u2019s major industrial hubs, some tried to warn their colleagues to take extra care at work, because the disease resembled Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome), the deadly respiratory disease that had killed hundreds of people across the region in 2002-03 after a government cover-up. One of those who tried to raise the alarm, though only among a few medical school classmates, was a 33-year-old Chinese ophthalmologist, Li Wenliang. Seven people were in isolation at his hospital, he said, and the disease appeared to be a coronavirus, from the same family as Sars. In early January he was called in by police, reprimanded for \u201cspreading rumours online\u201d, and forced to sign a paper acknowledging his \u201cmisdemeanour\u201d and promising not to repeat it. Many early cases were linked to the city\u2019s Huanan seafood and fresh produce market, which also sold wildlife, suggesting that the first cases were contracted there. Scientists would discover the disease had probably originated in bats and had then passed through a second species \u2013 in all likelihood, but not certainly, pangolins, a type of scaly anteater \u2013 before infecting humans. But the infections were soon spreading directly between patients, so fast that on 23 January the government announced an unprecedented lockdown of Wuhan city and the surrounding Hubei province. Two weeks later, on 7 February, Li, who had contracted coronavirus himself, died in hospital from the condition about which he had tried to raise the alarm. He had no known underlying conditions and left behind a wife and young child. Li became the face of the mysterious new disease. The story of his death and pictures of him in a hospital bed wearing an oxygen mask made media headlines across the globe, including in the UK. The world, it seemed, was slowly becoming more aware of how lethal coronavirus could be, that it was not just another form of flu with fairly mild symptoms. But while UK scientists and medical researchers were becoming more concerned, and studying the evidence from China, those among them who were most worried were not getting their messages through to high places. Distracted by Brexit and reshuffles The Conservative government of Boris Johnson had other more immediate preoccupations at the start of this year. Johnson was still basking in his general election success last December. After he returned from a celebratory Caribbean holiday with his fiancee, Carrie Symonds, the political weather for the prime minister seemed to be set fair. It was honeymoon time. Three and a half years on from the Brexit referendum, the UK was finally about to leave the EU on 31 January. The fireworks and parties for the big night were being planned, the celebratory 50p coins minted. Minds were certainly not on a developing health emergency far away, as Johnson prepared to exploit the moment of the UK\u2019s departure from the European Union for all it was worth. \u201cI think there was some over-confidence,\u201d admitted one very senior Tory last week. The prime minister and his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, wanted to make an early impression at home in other ways too, as domestic reformers. Cummings was waging a war on civil servants in Whitehall, throwing his weight around and deliberately upsetting the Westminster applecart. While he made the headlines, briefing about his iconoclastic ambitions, Johnson was preparing a big Cabinet reshuffle to assert his own authority in other areas now Brexit was done and dusted. With Labour effectively leaderless after its fourth consecutive election defeat, there was little opposition to trouble Johnson on any front at all \u2013 and certainly no-one of note asking tough questions about coronavirus. The prime minister duly recast his cabinet team on 13 February \u2013 five days after Li\u2019s death in Wuhan. He made big changes but unsurprisingly retained the hitherto safe pair of hands of Matt Hancock as his health secretary. In a sign of where priorities lay \u2013 and the lack of concern that a potential crisis might be heading our way from the east \u2013 Hancock wasted no time recording a video of himself grinning with delight on reshuffle day. He smacked his right fist into his left palm saying he could not wait to \u201cget cracking\u201d and that he relished the chance to deliver the Tories\u2019 manifesto promises, reform social care and improve life sciences. And lastly, in a more sombre voice, he spoke of \u201cdealing with coronavirus and keeping the public safe\u201d before adding, as the grin returned: \u201cNow let\u2019s get back to work!\u201d It is perhaps too early to conclude for sure that Johnson, Hancock and the government\u2019s entire team of scientific and medical advisers were caught asleep at the wheel. But the fact that Johnson and Hancock themselves, in common with much of the Downing Street staff, would go on to contract the virus or suffer symptoms, further suggests that people at the top had not been sufficiently on their guard. Now, 11 weeks on from the first cases being confirmed in the UK on 31 January \u2013 a period during which more than 14,000 people (and probably several thousands more once care home fatalities are counted) in the UK have died from Covid-19 \u2013 and with the country in lockdown, the economy facing prolonged recession as a result, schools closed, and no sign of an end in sight \u2013 hard questions have to be asked. We already know with some certainty that other countries, such as Germany, South Korea, Taiwan and New Zealand, will emerge from this crisis having performed far better than the UK. A few weeks ago the government\u2019s advisers crassly said that fewer than 20,000 deaths would be \u201ca very good result\u201d for the UK. As we fast approach that grim tally, many experts now believe the UK may come out of this crisis, whenever that may be, with one of the worst records on fighting coronavirus of any European nation. Once the full tally is counted, few expect the number of deaths to be below 20,000. By contrast, on Friday, Germany was saying it thought it had brought coronavirus largely under control. It had had 3,868 deaths, less a third of the total in the UK (and Germany\u2019s population, at 83 million, is far higher), having conducted widespread testing for Covid-19 from early on, precisely as the UK has failed to do. How, then, did it come to this? How did coronavirus spread across the globe, prompting different responses in different countries? Did the UK simply fail to heed the warnings? Or did it just decide to take different decisions, while others settled on alternative actions to save lives? The warnings grow louder David Nabarro, professor of global health at Imperial College, London, and an envoy for the World Health Organization on Covid-19, says one thing is for sure. All governments were warned how serious the situation was likely to become as early as the end of January. Ignorance of the danger that was coming can be no excuse. Yet it would not be until late March \u2013 later than many other countries \u2013 that Johnson would announce a complete lockdown. \u201cWHO had been following the outbreak since the end of December and within a few weeks it called a meeting of its emergency committee to decide if this outbreak was a \u2018public health emergency of international concern\u2019,\u201d said Nabarro. \u201cThat is the highest level of alert that WHO can issue, and it issued it on January 30. It made it very clear then \u2013 to every country in the world \u2013 that we were facing something very serious indeed.\u201d Well before the end of January, the WHO had been tracking the growing threat minutely: 14 January was a key day in the spread of the disease that would become known as Covid-19. The first case was confirmed outside China, with a woman hospitalised in Thailand. A WHO official warned then that it was possible that human-to-human transmission had occurred in families of victims \u2013 a sign that the disease had potential to spread far and fast \u2013 and, inside China, officials were quietly told to prepare for a pandemic. There was little international attention on the day, though, because Beijing\u2019s dire warnings about a pandemic were made in secret, and a WHO spokesman rowed back from his colleague\u2019s claim. Officially, China had not seen a new case of the coronavirus for over a week; the outbreak appeared to be fading. It took another six days for China to publicly acknowledge the gravity of the threat, time that scientists believed meant a further 3,000 people were infected. But on 20 January, officials announced more than 100 new cases and admitted the virus was spreading between humans, a red flag for concern to anyone who works on infectious diseases. The virus could no longer be contained by finding the animal source of the infection and destroying it. Two days later, the scale of the challenge was made clear to the general public when Beijing locked down millions of people. All transport into and out of the metropolis of Wuhan was cut off, an unprecedented modern quarantine that would come at huge human and economic cost. On 29 January, the UK would have its first two confirmed cases of the disease. There was little sense that China\u2019s dilemma and its approach \u2013 shut down life as we know it or watch the death toll spiral out of control \u2013 might have to be our nightmare within weeks. In early February, Donald Trump announced a ban on travellers who had passed through China in the previous 14 days. Europe began focused testing of people with symptoms and travel histories that linked them to the disease, but little else. Johnson, it seemed, still had Brexit and free trade much more on his mind. Any hint of draconian action to fight coronavirus that might hurt the economy was the last thing he was entertaining. In a speech on Brexit in Greenwich on 3 February, he made clear his views on Wuhan-style lockdowns. \u201cWe are starting to hear some bizarre autarkic rhetoric,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen barriers are going up, and when there is a risk that new diseases such as coronavirus will trigger a panic and a desire for market segregation that go beyond what is medically rational to the point of doing real and unnecessary economic damage. \u201cThen, at that moment, humanity needs some government somewhere that is willing at least to make the case powerfully for freedom of exchange, some country ready to take off its Clark Kent spectacles and leap into the phone booth and emerge with its cloak flowing as the supercharged champion of the right of the populations of the Earth to buy and sell freely among each other.\u201d \u2018Herd immunity\u2019: UK goes it alone By early March it was abundantly clear to many academics and scientists that the approach being adopted by the UK was markedly different from those followed by other countries. From South Korea to Germany, governments had invested heavily in expanding testing capacity from the first weeks of the epidemic. Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore had brought in controls on travellers from infected regions and strict contact tracing to help understand who could have been exposed, inform them and require self isolation. Face masks became widespread in east Asia, long before it was recommended elsewhere. Testing and contact tracing has been at the heart of the approach advocated by the WHO, so that countries can establish how transmission chains were occurring, in order to break them. Many also brought in some social distancing measures, banning large gatherings, closing schools or extending holidays, and encouraged those who could do to work from home. None were as extreme as China\u2019s shutdown, or the European and American lockdowns that would follow. Writing in the Observer last month, Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Ediburgh, noted the distinct UK approach. \u201cRather than learning from other countries and following the WHO advice, which comes from experts with decades of experience in tackling outbreaks across the world, the UK has decided to follow its own path. This seems to accept that the virus is unstoppable and will probably become an annual, seasonal infection. \u201cThe plan, as explained by the chief science adviser, is to work towards \u2018herd immunity\u2019, which is to have the majority of the population contract the virus, develop antibodies and then become immune to it. This theory has been widely used to advocate for mass vaccination for measles, mumps and rubella. The thinking is that, if most of the population is vaccinated, a small percentage can go unvaccinated without cases emerging.\u201d It was not just the UK whose politicians and scientific advisers were, arguably, slow to act in the early stages. Others countries, including Spain and France, were caught out too, but it was Italy\u2019s tragedy that alerted Europe to the scale of the threat it faced. European governments and citizens were forced to reckon with the reality that in an age of global travel, the thousands of miles separating them from China meant almost nothing at all. Thousands of Britons were holidaying in Italy the week that it shut down. They were advised to go into self-quarantine on return, but were not registered by the health authorities, nor were their contacts tracked. Italy and the UK had both had had their first case a day apart at the end of January, but cases rose faster in Italy. The country may just have been unlucky that carriers of the disease flew to its northern cities and ski resorts rather than to other European capitals. Whatever the reason, cases and then deaths started climbing sharply in northern Italy in late February. Dozens of towns were locked down from the 21st, but in the rest of the country life carried on as normal. It was soon clear that the problem had not been contained. On 8 March, the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, quarantined 16 million people across the north of the country, and the next day extended the lockdown to all of Italy. The measures saved lives, but came too late for thousands of Italians. The death toll outstripped China, and the world looked on horrified as hospitals were overwhelmed, doctors forced to choose who should have a chance on a ventilator and who should die. On 11 March, the WHO declared a global pandemic. On 14 March, Spain went into lockdown, and three days later France did the same. But in the UK there appeared to be greater reluctance to act decisively with lockdowns: the banning of mass gatherings and the closure of pubs and restaurants. The government\u2019s scientific and behavioural science advisers were warning ministers that the public might react badly to draconian measures and would not tolerate them for long. In an apparent show of defiance against the lockdowners, Johnson and Symonds attended the England v Wales rugby match at Twickenham on 7 March. The Cheltenham Festival, attended over three days to 13 March by 250,000 racegoers, was allowed to go ahead. Shutdown: Johnson changes tack The tone was about to change. In a Downing Street press conference on 12 March, Johnson, who had said a few days before the first UK death that the disease was \u201clikely to spread a bit more\u201d suddenly became the deliverer of grave warnings. Previous talk by his advisers of avoiding lockdowns and developing \u201cherd immunity\u201d had been banished and replaced by a brutal honesty. \u201cI must level with you,\u201d Johnson told reporters. \u201cMore families, many more families, are going to lose loved ones before their time.\u201d On 18 March \u2013 just days after Downing Street had suggested it was not on the cards \u2013 the government announced the closure of all schools until further noticed. Pubs and restaurants were ordered to shut on 20 March. The UK had come late into line. One former cabinet minister last week described the change of approach as a \u201cscreeching U-turn\u201d. Johnson and his ministers were now, even more than before, taking cover behind, and advice from, their scientific and medical advisers. Many of these advisers had become increasingly concerned that the UK had become out of step with other countries because of political resistance from ministers to measures that would hit the economy. The Observer has been told that at least two senior government advisers were on the brink of of quitting before Johnson switched his approach. The government has found itself unable to escape the consequences of a wider failure to prepare. As hospitals threatened to be overwhelmed before orders were given to massively expand capacity, ministers came under intense criticism over the lack of protective equipment for frontline NHS staff, over the lack of ventilators for patients in intensive care, and for a failure to test more widely for Covid-19, particularly among NHS workers. The lack of preparedness and instances of chaotic planning has shocked many in and outside the NHS. Last week, Dr Alison Pittard, the dean of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, the professional body for intensive care practitioners, said the minimum specifications for the government\u2019s own homegrown ventilator scheme would produce machines that would only treat patients \u201cfor a few hours\u201d. \u201cIf we had been told that that was the case\u2026 we\u2019d have said: \u2018Don\u2019t bother, you\u2019re wasting your time. That\u2019s of no use\u2019,\u201d she told the Financial Times. Last month the government missed an EU procurement deadline for ventilators because, minister said, an email went unnoticed. The NHS had said 30,000 more would be needed, Hancock reduced this to 18,000. Pittard said her faculty had been warning for years about a shortage of intensive care capacity and intensive care nurses in hospitals. Normally each intensive care patient would have one intensive care nurse in attendance all the time, she said. Now there was one nurse to six patients, although other staff had been redeployed to intensive care units to plug the gaps and the new system was working because of heroic efforts. Although she was reluctant to criticise the government, she said that if the faculty had been listened to, \u201cwe wouldn\u2019t be starting from this place\u201d. Germany, she pointed out, has 29 intensive care beds per 100,000 people, compared with six in the UK. The Tory MP and former health minister Dan Poulter, who works part-time in the NHS, said that given the enormity of the challenge facing government \u201cit almost seems wrong to be critical\u201d. But he believes part of the problem is that insufficient advice has been sought from experienced NHS clinicians who would have warned of problems with PPE early on, of the shortage of ventilators and would have told ministers of the urgent need to test NHS staff. \u201cAn early over-reliance on academic modelling also resulted in a lack of experienced frontline NHS clinicians \u2013 in other words, the people who really understand the day-to-day challenges our hospitals and health service face \u2013 from feeding into the initial Covid-19 action plan,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has manifested itself amongst other things in the slowness of providing adequate PPE for frontline NHS staff and in the lack of virus testing for healthcare staff in the earlier part of the outbreak.\u201d How the scientists reacted When the investigations into the UK\u2019s response to Covid-19 come to be written, there is widespread recognition among experts that this lack of long-term strategic planning will be at the centre of it. So too should be the need to ensure that the views of experts are fed into government more efficiently and widely. The prospect of a previously unknown disease spreading catastrophically around the globe and infecting millions is, after all, not a new one. Indeed, many warnings have been given in the past about the viral dangers facing humanity. \u201cGiven the continual emergence of new pathogens ... and the ever-increasing connectedness of our world, there is a significant probability that a large and lethal pandemic will occur in our lifetime,\u201d Bill Gates predicted several years ago. \u201cAnd it will have the impact of a nuclear war,\u201d he warned, while urging nations to start stockpiling antiviral drugs and therapies. If only. For its part, the WHO prepared \u2013 several years ago \u2013 a list of viruses with no known treatments or vaccines, illnesses that could one day trigger that pandemic and kill hundreds of thousands. Prospective killers included nipah disease and lassa fever as well as an ailment it simply called \u201cdisease X\u201d \u2013 \u201ca serious international epidemic caused by a pathogen currently unknown\u201d. As to the most likely nature of that mysterious virus, most modelling assumed that disease X would be flu-like in behaviour, says Dr Josie Golding, the epidemics lead at the Wellcome Trust. After all, influenza had caused so many deadly global outbreaks in the past. As a result, a lot of investment went into making influenza vaccines in preparation, she says. \u201cBut have we been thinking about diseases other than influenza that might become pandemics? I don\u2019t think we have. There has been a real gap in our thinking.\u201d Then came the appearance of Covid-19 \u2013 caused not by a strain of influenza but by a coronavirus \u2013 in November. Initially, only a few cases were highlighted, a trend that began to change early this year with a rise in numbers of infected ill people. \u201cThe report that really grabbed my attention came out in mid-January,\u201d says epidemiologist Professor Mark Woolhouse at Edinburgh University. \u201cIt said 41 cases of this new respiratory illness had now been diagnosed in one small area of China, around Wuhan. And that set the alarm bells ringing for me.\u201d For Woolhouse, the cluster of cases in one place showed this was not a matter of a few people scattered around China picking up an occasional infection from an animal such as a bat or a chicken. \u201cForty-one cases in one small area at the same time could not be explained that way. People are not picking this up from animals, I realised. They are actually spreading it to each other. It was already heading out of control.\u201d Ewan Birney, head of the Cambridgeshire-based European Bioinformatics Institute, part of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory network, also noted the significance of the new disease at the time. \u201cI presumed, at first, that this one would also burn itself out, probably somewhere in Asia,\u201d he says. His reasoning was straightforward. The outbreak of Sars that appeared in 2003 in China was caused by a coronavirus and killed more than 10% of those it infected. \u201cIn fact, it killed or hospitalised so many of those it infected the chain of transmission from one person to others was cut. It was too lethal for its own good. So I thought this might happen with this new disease. But it turns out Covid-19 is much milder and incapacitates fewer individuals, so there is no cut in its transmission. When that became apparent \u2013 around mid-January \u2013 I became very worried.\u201d Then there was the infectiousness of the new virus. A person with Sars generally starts to display symptoms before they infect other people. That makes it much easier to contain. But this was not the case with Covid-19. Early data from China \u2013 again released in January \u2013 showed the virus was being spread from people who were displaying only the mildest symptoms, or in some cases no symptoms. This was making the condition very difficult to track, says virologist Professor Jonathan Ball of Nottingham University. \u201cAt that point I realised this outbreak was going to be very serious,\u201d he added. \u201cI sent a tweet to a colleague in Australia. It simply said: \u2018This one is out of the bag properly\u2019. He sent one back agreeing with me.\u201d Around this time, Paul Nurse, Nobel laureate and head of the Francis Crick Institute, recalls attending a conference where he met Mark Walport, head of UK Research and Innovation, the organisation that funds a vast slice of British scientific research. \u201cHe had just received a text message from a colleague about the outbreak and we started to discuss the implications,\u201d Nurse recalls. \u201cIt did not take us long for us both to realise this was going to be very significant. It took another two or three weeks to confirm these worst fears \u2013 by mid-February.\u201d By this time, Birney had realised the virus had a real sting in its tail and could cause serious illness among the elderly and those with other underlying serious ailments. \u201cIt was half-term and I was on holiday with my parents. All I wanted to do was to get the holiday over and then get them back to their house in the country where they could keep themselves isolated.\u201d In February, sporadic cases of Covid-19 were appearing round the country, recalls Tom Wingfield, a clinician and infectious disease expert based at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. \u201cThese were cases that had been brought into the country, mainly from China or Italy. Then there was an outbreak in Brighton [and a number of other cases without foreign travel] and I realised that the virus had established itself in a community there. It was a turning point.\u201d Britain was still doing quite well in containing the disease by testing, tracing contact and setting up quarantine for those suspected of being infected with Covid-19 at this time. \u201cThen, in March, the government decided to abandon this approach and shift from containing the disease to delaying its progress,\u201d says Wingfield. \u201cI would really like to know why the decision to give up testing and contact tracing was taken.\u201d Many other researchers also question why the government took so long to react to their warnings. \u201cPart of the trouble was there were other virologists who were saying this was going to be like Sars or flu and there was not too much to worry about,\u201d says Ball. \u201cBut Sars happened in 2003. The world is much more connected now than it was then. More to the point, Covid-19 was also much more infectious than Sars. And so it started appearing in lots of other countries. \u201cPerhaps some of us should have got up in front of BBC News and said you lot ought to be petrified because this is going to be a pandemic that will kill hundreds of thousands of people,\u201d adds Ball. \u201cNone of us thought this was a particularly constructive thing to do, but maybe with hindsight we should have. If there had been more voices, maybe politicians would have taken this a bit more seriously.\u201d \u201cThere is no question that we were insufficiently prepared,\u201d Nurse says. \u201cWe had been warned a few years ago when reports made it clear that the UK was not ready to combat a major flu pandemic and we did not take up that warning. As a result, we were caught out.\u201d He and many others say an inquiry into Britain\u2019s Covid-19 preparedness will have to be held at some point but stress that this should not be started until the crisis has been dealt with in the UK. Professor Ian Boyd, a former chief scientific adviser at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, agrees. \u201cThere is a great danger there will be a lot of looking back with the benefits of hindsight and poking fingers of blame,\u201d warns Boyd. \u201cBut when you are in the middle of things you have to make a lot of very hard 50-50 decisions, and sometimes you make the wrong call. On the other hand, there is no harm in making sure that we learn as many lessons as we can.\u201d The lessons from the rest of the world \u2026 Boris Johnson, after his own brush with death at the hands of Covid-19, will presumably no longer take the gung-ho attitude to illness that he has always has. A former Tory minister said: \u201cIf Boris had any sense he would take control of the inquiry and lead it.\u201d One conclusion that experts are already drawing is that it was those countries close to China, with memories of Sars, or cultural ties to their neighbour, which were much faster to act in response to Covid-19. Perhaps most notable in its success was Taiwan. Closely linked by economic and cultural ties to mainland China, Taiwan could have been at high risk of a major Covid-19 epidemic. Tourists and business people travelled regularly back and forth. But helped perhaps by having an epidemiologist as vice-president, the government set up a gold standard regime of testing and contact tracing that means that nearly three months on from its first confirmed infection, it has registered fewer than 400 cases and six deaths. Taiwan\u2019s extensive testing and thorough contact tracing are precisely the kind of action that the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt is demanding before the UK lockdown is lifted. Hunt points out that it is one of the essential conditions set by the WHO to avoid a second wave resulting from an easing of restrictions. Hong Kong, which also suffered from the Sars crisis, also moved early to enforce quarantine and social distancing, as well as widespread mask wearing, and today has registered just over 1,000 cases and only four deaths. In late February, South Korea looked like it was on a trajectory to disaster, with the highest number of confirmed cases outside China, and numbers rising rapidly. But after the country\u2019s first infection, the government met medical companies and urged them to start developing coronavirus test kits on a massive scale. The results were impressive. When the epidemic hit, it was ready to deploy largescale testing. Its measures allowed South Korea to become the second country to flatten its coronavirus curve, without the sweeping shutdowns of society and economic activity that China had pioneered and the west would be forced to adopt. China\u2019s experience should have provided a grim template for western countries to use to prepare. The speed with which Wuhan\u2019s crisis had intensified showed that a relatively advanced medical system could be swamped. Within three weeks there were over 64,000 people infected and 1,000 dead. The pleas for help from Wuhan\u2019s residents and doctors were to be echoed by those from Italy a few weeks later, and soon after the UK. Look back three months, and in China there were not enough tests to work out who had coronavirus, there was not enough protective equipment for medical staff treating patients, and then, soon, tragically there were not enough hospital beds and ventilators for sick patients. These are exactly the challenges faced by authorities from New York to Rome, London to Madrid. \u2026 and the other country that didn\u2019t listen If the UK has serious questions to answer, the country that so far has seen the worst of the outbreak, the United States, was slowest of all to act. Trump for months ignored, played down or lied about the threat posed by coronavirus, leaving individual states to act unilaterally as it became clear it had already taken hold on US soil. On 17 March parts of California issued \u201cshelter in place\u201d orders, effectively a lockdown. By the end of that week New York City had also shut down, along with a dozen states, and the majority of the rest of the country had put some restrictions in place. Only five states had few or no controls. There have now been nearly 700,000 confirmed cases in the US and over 33,000 deaths; actual numbers are likely to be higher for both. The economy has also been devastated, with more than 22 million out of work as businesses collapse or shrink under the strain. Trump insists the US is turning a corner, and has tried to blame \u2013 among other targets \u2013 the WHO for failing to fully raise the alarm, and has stripped it of its US funding. There have certainly been questions about the organisation\u2019s strong praise for China and the exclusion of Taiwan, which may have contributed to the delay in recognising human-to-human transmission was occurring. But it began daily briefings on 22 January and had declared a global health emergency by the end of that month. While initially sceptical about China\u2019s distancing measures, it urged other countries to adopt them once there was evidence they were working. It warned about shortages of PPE over a month ago, and since the beginning of the outbreak has urged countries, including the UK, to \u201ctest, test, test\u201d to contain the virus \u2013 a strategy followed by almost all countries that have managed to suppress it. A senior Whitehall source with detailed knowledge of the UK\u2019s response and those of other countries said: \u201cThe fact is that those countries who knew a lot about Sars quickly saw the danger. But in the UK the attitude among politicians and also scientists was that it was really just some form of a flu. All the government\u2019s pandemic planning was based on a flu scenario. And then it turned out to be something different and far, far worse and the response was completely inadequate.\u201d And we are going to be living with the consequences for a long time. Don\u2019t expect a vaccine to come to the rescue in the short term, says Nabarro. \u201cFor the foreseeable future, we are going to have to find ways to go about our lives with this virus as a constant threat to our lives. That means isolating those who show signs of the disease and also their contacts. Older people will have to be protected. That is going to be the new normal for us all.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 19 April 2020 to restore a section of a quote from Boris Johnson\u2019s 3 February speech that had been lost during the editing process. A correction was also made regarding the rugby match attended by the prime minister on 7 March (England v Wales; not England v Ireland) and to the spelling of Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte\u2019s name. Further amendments were made to give the full description of the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) and to add a clarification to a comment provided by Tom Wingfield about the Brighton outbreak. An additional amendment was made on 20 April 2020 to correct the spelling of the surname of Mark Walport.",

      "bodyText": "Glaswegian comedians haven\u2019t always been complimentary about their home city. \u201cThe great thing about Glasgow is that if there\u2019s a nuclear attack it\u2019ll look exactly the same afterwards,\u201d said Billy Connolly. According to Frankie Boyle: \u201cSwearing is different in Scotland. In Glasgow the word \u2018fucking\u2019 is just a warning that a noun is on its way.\u201d Like Connolly and Boyle, many world-class comedians started out here and found the city rich in material, from Susan Calman, Kevin Bridges and Limmy to, more recently, Amna Saleem and Larry Dean. Janey Godley, who carried the infamous \u201cTrump is a cunt\u201d sign in a 2016 protest at Turnberry golf course, has been performing standup in Glasgow for more than 25 years. Glaswegians are, she says, \u201cobservational storytellers\u201d. Godley has often used humour to tackle tough subjects \u2013 the murder of her mother, sexual abuse, her ties with gangsters \u2013 and her new show covers online run-ins with the far right. \u201cWe tend to be gritty, tell-it-like-it-is comics,\u201d she says. \u201cWe laugh at dark things.\u201d Growing up in Glasgow in the 60s and 70s, standup Lubna Kerr witnessed this inclination for people to face issues such as sectarianism with humour. \u201cIt\u2019s important to be able to laugh about things like that \u2026 it lessens it,\u201d she says. Kerr talks about sectarianism on stage and also tackles racism. A question she\u2019s been asked too many times \u2013 \u201cWhere are you really from?\u201d \u2013 became the title for her last show. Born in Pakistan, Kerr came to standup in her 50s and initially performed character comedy, exploring stereotypes of Asian women. Now she performs as herself and, like Godley, embraces storytelling: \u201cEvery Glaswegian tells stories in such a wonderful, descriptive manner.\u201d There\u2019s always been an array of comedy nights to nurture Glaswegian talent, including a couple run by Godley, although her favourite spots to play nowadays are the Stand (which opened in 2000) and a new arrival, the Glee Club. \u201cIt\u2019s a very open city for comedy,\u201d she says. \u201cEvery time you put a gig on people were like, \u2018Comedy, yes!\u2019\u201d Yet there\u2019s more to Glasgow\u2019s comedy scene than standup. Chunks, a monthly alternative night, grew out of a \u201cweird\u201d open mic at the now-shuttered Halt Bar. Since 2014, Chunks has challenged comics to experiment within three-minute slots. Standup is banned. \u201cIt\u2019s high-energy, very quick, very silly,\u201d says co-founder Eamonn Jones, who performs as Donny Vostok. The audience has been treated to Chris Thorburn\u2019s imagined theme tune for There Will Be Blood and Richard Brown as a robot programmed to spout standup cliches. Jones has appeared as \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s favourite observational comedian\u201d, with quips such as: \u201cHey guys, have you ever noticed how everything\u2019s fine?\u201d In that routine: \u201cWe played the whole North Korean national anthem and made everybody stand.\u201d Chunks\u2019 experiments are often the starting point for something bigger.

      "body": "<p>Many of the foreign doctors, nurses and care workers on the NHS frontline <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/nhs-staff-protection-doctor-ppe-coronavirus\">without adequate protection</a> are secretly struggling on another front, too. They cannot afford to pay the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/28/scrap-625-pound-surcharge-for-nhs-ovserseas-staff\">fees levied by the Home Office</a> to enable them to remain in the UK and continue their work. </p> <p>Often they fall into debt to pay the charges. Some of them simply leave the country once their permits are up for renewal, unable to find the money. The highest single fee they face is the immigration health surcharge, which must be paid in advance. So you have the spectacle of NHS staff <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/20/calls-scrap-plans-nhs-fee-foreign-staff-health-surcharge\">paying to use the NHS</a>, even though they already pay tax and national insurance contributions.</p> <p>British citizens unfamiliar with the Home Office\u2019s fee framework struggle to understand this when they hear of it for the first time. They\u2019re unable to grasp that there are NHS staff who are taxed twice to use the NHS. Surely I must mean people on visitor visas who don\u2019t work in the UK, they say? Surely the NHS surcharge is directed at them, to disincentivise health tourism?</p> <p>No. I do not mean <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/feb/07/health-tourism-claims-distraction-from-nhs-real-problems\">\u201chealth tourists\u201d</a>. I mean NHS doctors, nurses and care workers from outside the EU who spend the years between visa renewals fretting, saving and borrowing to pay for the cost of their next permit. The sums are crippling, particularly for junior doctors in training and nurses whose salaries start at about \u00a323,000 and \u00a318,000 a year respectively. The NHS surcharge at the moment is <a href=\"https://www.freemovement.org.uk/what-is-the-immigration-health-surcharge/\">\u00a3400 a year</a>. There is no right of deferral, or ability to pay annually. It has to be paid in advance for the entire duration of an applicant\u2019s visa or residency permit.</p> <p>If an NHS worker has any family included on the residency permit, such as a spouse and children, the applicant has to pay the surcharge for them as well, again for the entire duration of the visa.

      "bodyText": "Many of the foreign doctors, nurses and care workers on the NHS frontline without adequate protection are secretly struggling on another front, too. They cannot afford to pay the fees levied by the Home Office to enable them to remain in the UK and continue their work. Often they fall into debt to pay the charges. Some of them simply leave the country once their permits are up for renewal, unable to find the money. The highest single fee they face is the immigration health surcharge, which must be paid in advance. So you have the spectacle of NHS staff paying to use the NHS, even though they already pay tax and national insurance contributions. British citizens unfamiliar with the Home Office\u2019s fee framework struggle to understand this when they hear of it for the first time. They\u2019re unable to grasp that there are NHS staff who are taxed twice to use the NHS. Surely I must mean people on visitor visas who don\u2019t work in the UK, they say? Surely the NHS surcharge is directed at them, to disincentivise health tourism? No. I do not mean \u201chealth tourists\u201d. I mean NHS doctors, nurses and care workers from outside the EU who spend the years between visa renewals fretting, saving and borrowing to pay for the cost of their next permit. The sums are crippling, particularly for junior doctors in training and nurses whose salaries start at about \u00a323,000 and \u00a318,000 a year respectively. The NHS surcharge at the moment is \u00a3400 a year. There is no right of deferral, or ability to pay annually. It has to be paid in advance for the entire duration of an applicant\u2019s visa or residency permit. If an NHS worker has any family included on the residency permit, such as a spouse and children, the applicant has to pay the surcharge for them as well, again for the entire duration of the visa. So a family of four on a five-year work permit or limited leave to remain visa has to pay \u00a38000. The fee is to go up this October, from \u00a3400 to \u00a3624. That same family of four will then have to pay \u00a312,480. I don\u2019t know if there are many people in the UK, let alone junior doctors, nurses and care workers, who have that kind of money lying around. The surcharge was introduced, like many of the more cynical and punitive features of the hostile environment, by the coalition government in 2015. The sums are set arbitrarily and rise randomly, and we are assured the yield is ploughed back into the NHS, although it\u2019s hard to find evidence of what it is actually used for.

This is at odds with the rest of the UK, where public funding has remained stable or increased.</p> <p>When it opened in 1982, four years after the first test tube baby, Louise Brown, was born in nearby Oldham, St Mary\u2019s was the UK\u2019s first fully NHS funded IVF unit. It now performs over 2,000 fertility treatments every year, including around 1,200 IVF cycles, and offers highly specialised fertility preservation for cancer patients. It is also a top research centre, which led on the use of ovarian reserve tests to guide ovarian stimulation, the development of stem cell lines from human embryos, and the effects of IVF on baby birth weights.</p> <p>The Manchester University NHS foundation trust (MFT) said no decisions had been made over the unit\u2019s future. But staff were briefed last month that the HFEA and local clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) had been told that all licensed treatment and research on the site may end by April 2021 if an alternative solution cannot be found.</p> <p>MFT, which runs the hospital, is also exploring options including redeploying services and some of its 107 staff \u2013 including many highly specialised roles \u2013 but confirmed to staff that closure was a possibility.</p> <p>The Guardian spoke to 10 members of staff at St Mary\u2019s aware of the mooted closure. One said they understood the matter to be settled: \u201cSt Mary\u2019s have taken a proposal to the MFT group board to discontinue the IVF service and the group board have said, \u2018Yes, OK.\u2019 How they discontinue it is what they need to decide next,\u201d they said.</p> <p>If the change goes ahead, CCGs, which fund fertility treatment, will have to pay private clinics to carry out IVF and other fertility services. But staff at St Mary\u2019s warn that the private sector will not be able to carry out some of the most specialised services currently offered by the NHS.</p> <p>\u201cWe offer highly specialised procedures in the NHS which private providers won\u2019t touch because they don\u2019t make money and are too difficult. For example, we aim to see women diagnosed with cancer within a week who want to freeze their eggs before they start chemotherapy. Many of these women are already very poorly and need really high quality anaesthetic care during egg collection, and that is just not available in the private sector because of the medical complications,\u201d said one source.</p> <p>They added: \u201cPrivate clinics are also unlikely to help patients with kidney problems or heart problems. But when they come to us, we can address these issues before they begin IVF: a huge advantage of being part of a multi-disciplinary NHS Trust. Those patients will be disadvantaged if this happens.\u201d</p> <p>They also expressed concerns about screening procedures in the private sector. In the NHS, anyone applying for fertility treatment undergoes a series of stringent checks, including an assessment of the welfare of the child: \u201cOur checks and ethics advisory committee often flag issues including prison sentences, a serious history of domestic violence, even people on the sex offender register. At private clinics they don\u2019t do anything like the same background checks.\u201d</p> <p>A number of separate proposals were put to MFT to try to save some or all of the clinic, including turning the service into a social enterprise and forming a partnership with a private provider, as is being proposed in Leeds.</p> <p>The deadline to apply to run the Leeds service was 23 March, the day the government announced the coronavirus lockdown in the UK. Shortly afterwards, clinics stopped all new treatments and the HFEA ordered private and NHS clinics to stop treating patients in the middle of an IVF cycle by 15 April.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the MFT, which runs St Mary\u2019s hospital, said no decision had been taken to shut the clinic permanently.</p> <p>They said: \u201cServices provided by the department of reproductive medicine at St Mary\u2019s hospital are regularly reviewed as part of a usual cycle to ensure that we continue to provide the best possible care and treatments for all our service users. No decisions have been made, therefore it would be inappropriate to provide any further detail before the outcome of any review has been finalised.\u201d</p> <p>The HFEA said it could not disclose informal discussions between clinics and inspectors.</p> <p>Many St Mary\u2019s staff are worried not just about their patients and their jobs, but the logistics of closing down the clinic. Moving thousands of sperm samples and embryos held in freezers, for use in both treatment and research, was a \u201cmind-boggling\u201d challenge, said one.</p> <p>One staff member said: \u201cAlthough possible relocation was mentioned, the fact that no viable alternative has been identified and that the cost was described as being too high left us thinking that this is not being explored and that closing the unit is the direction of travel. We are worried for our jobs but our biggest concern is for our patients, particularly those with the most complex needs who cannot be served elsewhere without high costs.\u201d</p> <p>IVF provision has been put under pressure, nationally, by NHS funding cuts over the past decade leading to a \u201cpostcode lottery\u201d of provision.

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s oldest NHS fertility clinic is at risk of closure and another has been put out to private tender, as IVF provision is increasingly privatised and rationed. Hospital bosses want to close the internationally renowned department of reproductive medicine at St Mary\u2019s hospital, Manchester, saying they cannot afford to fund a \u00a310m upgrade of the unit, the Guardian has learned. In Leeds, the entire NHS provision of fertility and other gynaecology services was put out to tender earlier this year, with private clinics invited to bid for a 10-year contract estimated at \u00a370m to provide reproductive care. Two years ago North Bristol NHS trust sold off its IVF clinic to a private provider, saying it was no longer feasible because of a reduction in NHS-funded patients. In England, the proportion of fertility treatment funded by the NHS dropped from 39% in 2012 to 35% in 2017, according to figures published last year by the regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). This is at odds with the rest of the UK, where public funding has remained stable or increased. When it opened in 1982, four years after the first test tube baby, Louise Brown, was born in nearby Oldham, St Mary\u2019s was the UK\u2019s first fully NHS funded IVF unit. It now performs over 2,000 fertility treatments every year, including around 1,200 IVF cycles, and offers highly specialised fertility preservation for cancer patients. It is also a top research centre, which led on the use of ovarian reserve tests to guide ovarian stimulation, the development of stem cell lines from human embryos, and the effects of IVF on baby birth weights. The Manchester University NHS foundation trust (MFT) said no decisions had been made over the unit\u2019s future. But staff were briefed last month that the HFEA and local clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) had been told that all licensed treatment and research on the site may end by April 2021 if an alternative solution cannot be found. MFT, which runs the hospital, is also exploring options including redeploying services and some of its 107 staff \u2013 including many highly specialised roles \u2013 but confirmed to staff that closure was a possibility. The Guardian spoke to 10 members of staff at St Mary\u2019s aware of the mooted closure. One said they understood the matter to be settled: \u201cSt Mary\u2019s have taken a proposal to the MFT group board to discontinue the IVF service and the group board have said, \u2018Yes, OK.\u2019 How they discontinue it is what they need to decide next,\u201d they said. If the change goes ahead, CCGs, which fund fertility treatment, will have to pay private clinics to carry out IVF and other fertility services. But staff at St Mary\u2019s warn that the private sector will not be able to carry out some of the most specialised services currently offered by the NHS. \u201cWe offer highly specialised procedures in the NHS which private providers won\u2019t touch because they don\u2019t make money and are too difficult. For example, we aim to see women diagnosed with cancer within a week who want to freeze their eggs before they start chemotherapy. Many of these women are already very poorly and need really high quality anaesthetic care during egg collection, and that is just not available in the private sector because of the medical complications,\u201d said one source. They added: \u201cPrivate clinics are also unlikely to help patients with kidney problems or heart problems. But when they come to us, we can address these issues before they begin IVF: a huge advantage of being part of a multi-disciplinary NHS Trust. Those patients will be disadvantaged if this happens.\u201d They also expressed concerns about screening procedures in the private sector. In the NHS, anyone applying for fertility treatment undergoes a series of stringent checks, including an assessment of the welfare of the child: \u201cOur checks and ethics advisory committee often flag issues including prison sentences, a serious history of domestic violence, even people on the sex offender register. At private clinics they don\u2019t do anything like the same background checks.\u201d A number of separate proposals were put to MFT to try to save some or all of the clinic, including turning the service into a social enterprise and forming a partnership with a private provider, as is being proposed in Leeds. The deadline to apply to run the Leeds service was 23 March, the day the government announced the coronavirus lockdown in the UK. Shortly afterwards, clinics stopped all new treatments and the HFEA ordered private and NHS clinics to stop treating patients in the middle of an IVF cycle by 15 April. A spokesperson for the MFT, which runs St Mary\u2019s hospital, said no decision had been taken to shut the clinic permanently. They said: \u201cServices provided by the department of reproductive medicine at St Mary\u2019s hospital are regularly reviewed as part of a usual cycle to ensure that we continue to provide the best possible care and treatments for all our service users. No decisions have been made, therefore it would be inappropriate to provide any further detail before the outcome of any review has been finalised.\u201d The HFEA said it could not disclose informal discussions between clinics and inspectors. Many St Mary\u2019s staff are worried not just about their patients and their jobs, but the logistics of closing down the clinic. Moving thousands of sperm samples and embryos held in freezers, for use in both treatment and research, was a \u201cmind-boggling\u201d challenge, said one. One staff member said: \u201cAlthough possible relocation was mentioned, the fact that no viable alternative has been identified and that the cost was described as being too high left us thinking that this is not being explored and that closing the unit is the direction of travel. We are worried for our jobs but our biggest concern is for our patients, particularly those with the most complex needs who cannot be served elsewhere without high costs.\u201d IVF provision has been put under pressure, nationally, by NHS funding cuts over the past decade leading to a \u201cpostcode lottery\u201d of provision. Now only a minority of English CCGs offer the recommended three funded IVF cycles, with some refusing to fund any NHS fertility treatment at all.",

Of course we are working on plans for what and how there could be gradual reopenings, and I discussed this with international counterparts on Thursday. \u201cThe government in England has already today corrected the story that was briefed out regarding an early reopening for their schools. We will base our decisions here on evidence, consultation and right timing.\u201d In Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: \u201cDecisions need to be solidly based and not premature. We don\u2019t yet know what will be possible and when.\u201d The National Education Union\u2019s petition to delay reopening schools until safe to do so has gained more than 160,000 signatures. Its joint general secretary Kevin Courtney said: \u201cThese stories apparently placed by ministers are completely irresponsible.\u201d Courtney accused the government of \u201ctalking about different opening dates with no hint that the science will lead the decision\u201d. Since 23 March only vulnerable children and the children of key workers have been attending school in person, while teachers have remained working on distance learning and support for pupils at home. Suggestions of an immediate reopening were also contradicted by the Department for Education\u2019s ambitious plan to distribute laptops and broadband routers to disadvantaged year 10 pupils in England who lack the devices. Williamson said: \u201cBy providing young people with these laptops and tablets and enabling schools to access high-quality support, we will enable all children to continue learning now and in the years to come.\u201d The DfE said schools would be able to request the equipment from next week, although it did not say how many it expected to provide. About one in eight secondary school pupils are eligible for free school meals, and when combined with those previously in care or with social care orders, about 90,000 children could be eligible. Some teachers were sceptical about the DfE\u2019s ability to quickly distribute laptops, arguing that its effort to provide \u00a315 food vouchers to pupils on free school meals was still plagued by delays. Williamson was also asked if staff working in schools needed protective equipment such as masks, and said the government has asked Public Health England to work directly with unions. \u201cTheir safety is absolutely paramount as it is for children and we have issued guidance,\u201d Williamson said.",

      "bodyText": "Disabled people are being left without food after being missed off the government\u2019s list of those vulnerable to coronavirus, the Guardian has learned. The government set up an online register billed as a way to reach \u201cextremely vulnerable\u201d households in England who have been told to shield for 12 weeks \u2013 either offering them food parcels via their local authority or liaising with major supermarkets to give priority for online delivery. But it has emerged that large numbers of disabled and older people are being excluded from the scheme due to the highly selective criteria. One hundred people with severe disabilities and chronic illness say they have been rejected for the government\u2019s register and thereby left without any support to access food without leaving their home, despite being particularly vulnerable to coronavirus. Their conditions include cancer being treated with chemotherapy, heart disease, tetraplegia, motor neurone disease (MND), myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) and muscular dystrophy. Some disabled people reported sleeping to avoid hunger pains, or living off fruit. At least one rejected for assistance has gone on to contract coronavirus. \u201cI\u2019ve had four letters to say I should be shielding yet the Gov.uk site doesn\u2019t recognise me to be put on the online vulnerable list,\u201d said 40-year-old Vicky McDermott in Northumberland, who has the immune disorder rheumatoid arthritis and a daughter with a life-limiting condition who has also been told to shield. \u201cI tried registering last night for the fifth time. The supermarkets won\u2019t put us on the priority list as we\u2019re not registered with the government.\u201d McDermott has resorted to buying food from \u201conline corner shops\u201d with a large markup. \u201cA tin of beans is \u00a32,\u201d she said. Deborah Bhatti, 50, from Bury in Greater Manchester, is on 40 medications a day including for asthma and autoimmune disease, but has not made the list. It means she is not eligible for her local council\u2019s scheme to collect prescriptions or give out food parcels. \u201cI had to share a tin of tuna with my cat,\u201d Bhatti said. \u201cI feel desperate and fearful and have bad dreams every night.\u201d The Department for Health and Social Care said there was a short delay between people being identified as clinically extremely vulnerable by their GP, and receiving the NHS letter from their clinician, and their identity being pulled from GP records to enable them to register for support. It added it was updating the patient list that enables people to register for support from GP records on a weekly basis. But both doctors and patients report confusion over how this is being handled. When Denise Stephens, 41, who has multiple sclerosis and is immunocompromised, was rejected, she followed instructions to call her GP but hit a brick wall. \u201cMy GP said they couldn\u2019t help me and they didn\u2019t know why the government is directing people to them about this,\u201d she said. Last month, Stephens contracted coronavirus. She has had to call an ambulance twice to her London home but is still not eligible for help with food or medication. In recent days, the government\u2019s website has begun to allow some people to add their details even if they do not meet the criteria, but charities say this is not enough to stop people missing out. \u201cWe\u2019re hearing from people that their GP won\u2019t put them on the list after they tried to self-register as MND isn\u2019t listed,\u201d said Susie Rabin, the head of policy and campaigns for the MND Association. \u201cI\u2019ve seen responses from MPs to people saying that not everyone with MND needs to be in the list as \u2018some may have a mild form\u2019.

There are also concerns the government is excluding people whose disability means they cannot physically distance safely at supermarkets, such as those with sight loss or autism. One woman with autism and mental health problems, who is self-isolating, said she had lost her carer who helps her shop but still did not make the vulnerable list. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely terrified I\u2019ll be dying of starvation in the coming weeks,\u201d she said. A government spokesperson said that officials were \u201cworking to support people who do not fall into the category of being clinically extremely vulnerable, but still need help getting essential food supplies. \u201cThis could include those who are elderly, disabled or have health conditions that make it difficult for them to get the food they need.\u201d The spokesperson said that those who could rely on friends, family and community support should do so but said local councils may be able to help with emergency supplies where necessary.",

      "bodyText": "After the relative peace of the two-week Easter break, millions of parents this week will return \u2013 some heavy-hearted, others eager \u2013 to their kitchen tables and home computers to resume their children\u2019s DIY lockdown education. With schools remaining closed for the foreseeable future, home school is back and fresh help is at hand. On Monday the BBC will launch an education service for children locked out of school by the Covid-19 pandemic, complete with a starry array of talented tutors. On the summer term timetable will be Spanish lessons from the footballer Sergio Ag\u00fcero, history taught by the actor Danny Dyer and music with the Brit award-winning singer Mabel. Other tutors offering their services for the 14-week programme include Doctor Who\u2019s Jodie Whittaker, Oti Mabuse of Strictly Come Dancing and the former One Direction star Liam Payne. The corporation has recruited the celebrities as part of its biggest ever education offer, BBC Bitesize Daily, which aims to help fulfil its public service role during a time of national crisis and liven up lessons for families stuck at home. Ag\u00fcero will teach children to count in Spanish; Dyer, a descendant of King Edward III, will teach key stage one pupils (aged five to seven) about Henry VIII; and Mabel will bring music and reading together as part of a week-long \u201cmusical big read\u201d. The physicist Brian Cox will deliver science lessons covering topics including the solar system, force and gravity; David Attenborough will teach about oceans, mapping the world, and why animals look the way they do; and Mabuse and the TV presenter Anita Rani will read books aimed at primary and secondary pupils. The lineup may be starry but the intent is serious: to provide a comprehensive package for school pupils of all ages, in support of the online lessons that schools are already providing to their students. The celebrities will be supported in their efforts by 200 \u201creal\u201d teachers, both on and off screen. The entire programme has been developed over the last four weeks with education professionals.

On Saturday, only 21,626 tests were carried out.</p> \n<p>Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said he viewed the target as impossible. \u201cI cannot see that being achieved,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was always designed to be a headline grabber rather than anything else.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"28f9c4c8-d8b6-4f17-bdd6-1264330215a7\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/akiXEfWW-V0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Others said a relentless focus on the number of tests performed each day had led to basic data reporting standards falling by the wayside.

      "bodyText": "The government\u2019s target of carrying out 100,000 Covid-19 tests each day by the end of the month has come under criticism from senior scientists, who say it will be impossible to reach. Experts told the Guardian that a \u201cmacho\u201d focus on headline-grabbing figures had been pursued at the expense of rigorous science. The Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, said on Sunday that the government was confident that the goal of 100,000 tests daily by the end of April would be met. However, scepticism is building. On Saturday, only 21,626 tests were carried out. Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said he viewed the target as impossible. \u201cI cannot see that being achieved,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was always designed to be a headline grabber rather than anything else.\u201d Others said a relentless focus on the number of tests performed each day had led to basic data reporting standards falling by the wayside. Prof Sheila Bird, formerly of the Medical Research Council\u2019s biostatistics unit at the University of Cambridge, said: \u201cThe level of incompetence in reporting these tests is outrageous.\u201d Gove acknowledged on Sunday that the target referred to tests carried out. In the past fortnight the government has placed a growing emphasis on \u201ctesting capacity\u201d. It said that although fewer than 22,000 tests were performed on Saturday, labs now had the capacity to carry out 38,000 tests daily, and this had not been fully taken up by hospitals. Scientists said the distinction was misleading as the logistics of having enough doctors and nurses on the ground to perform swab tests and send off samples continued to be a challenge. \u201cHaving the capacity is just the first step,\u201d said Bill Hanage, a British epidemiologist based at Harvard. Bird said the failure to give breakdowns of how many tests were being carried out on patients in hospital, critical workers and family members of critical workers made it impossible to extract prevalence rates of infection in these different groups and other crucial information that would allow scientists to more accurately assess the status of the outbreak in the UK. \u201cThis macho thing about the number of tests done each day is leading to a reporting standard that makes the data almost uninterpretable,\u201d she said. Ideally, she said, tests would be reported separately for these different groups and would take into account the fact that hospitalised patients typically have a sequence of three tests over several weeks \u2013 an initial positive test followed by two negative tests (the second negative for assurance that the recovering patient is no longer infectious and can be transferred home or to a general ward). \u201cReporting the number of tests performed each day is a political requirement, not a scientific requirement,\u201d she added. Hanage said that even if the 100,000 target were met, this figure was not a relevant measure of the adequacy of the UK\u2019s testing operation. \u201cAiming for a large number that sounds good is not the way you should be doing this,\u201d he said. That around a third of those tested in the UK this week had positive results suggests that, while useful for guiding medical treatment, current testing is far below the levels that would be needed for population surveillance. \u201cThe data I\u2019ve been seeing suggests there\u2019s not anywhere near enough testing,\u201d Hanage said. \u201cThe way you should be doing it is to build the capacity and ability to run large numbers of tests \u2013 enough that only 10% are coming back positive.\u201d The World Health Organization has repeatedly urged governments to pursue testing and tracing, and some countries, including Singapore and South Korea, have successfully used this approach to contain their outbreaks, while Germany has also continued to carry out contact tracing.

      "body": "<p>The Czech Republic is to take the first steps towards easing its coronavirus restrictions on Monday, after officials declared that the Covid-19 outbreak there had been brought under control.</p> <p>The country\u2019s coronavirus numbers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/lack-of-testing-raises-fears-of-coronavirus-surge-in-eastern-europe\">like those in most </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/lack-of-testing-raises-fears-of-coronavirus-surge-in-eastern-europe\">of central Europe</a>, are much lower than those further west, partly because of the early implementation of strict lockdown measures.</p> <p>Now the burning question for many central and eastern European countries is how fast to loosen the restrictions. Some policymakers believe that extreme caution is required to avoid undoing the positive work and provoking a fresh outbreak. Others point to the increasing economic costs of lockdown measures and say the low number of cases and deaths should allow a swift reopening, perhaps combined with continued closed borders to prevent the virus arriving from outside.</p> <p>\u201cThe numbers look good so far, but even the governments are not sure if there could be a surge ahead,\u201d said Milan Ni\u010d, an expert with the Berlin-based German Council for Foreign Relations.</p> <p>The Czech health minister, Adam Vojt\u011bch, announced last week that the country\u2019s tough approach had prevented the uncontrolled spread of the disease and justified a cautious lifting of restrictions. The five-stage plan will begin on Monday with farmers\u2019 markets, car dealerships and some other small businesses allowed to reopen for the first time since one of the earliest lockdowns in Europe was introduced on 12 March.</p> <p>In the final stage, tentatively scheduled for 8 June, all businesses would be allowed to reopen, including bars, cafes, restaurants and hotels. However, Vojt\u011bch warned people against being lulled into a sense of false security and said officials would reimpose restrictions if there was a sudden surge in cases.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/deaths-zip/giv-3902btA462ecNO6Z/\" data-alt=\"Czech and Slovak graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/deaths-zip/giv-3902btA462ecNO6Z/\">Czech and Slovak graphic</a> </figure>  <p>As of Sunday morning, the country had recorded 6,657 cases and 181 deaths. Neighbouring Slovakia had just 1,161 cases and 12 deaths, making it one of the least affected countries in Europe.</p> <p>There may be several reasons for the low numbers, but the decisive one seems to be a speedy move to enforce lockdown measures. Border closures and restrictions on movement and gatherings were introduced much earlier than in countries further west. A concerted effort to persuade citizens in both the Czech Republic and Slovakia to wear face masks may also have helped.</p> <p>There has been criticism of the slow pace of moves to ease the lockdown, particularly among those in the service and tourism sector.</p> <p>\u201cThe number of cases has dropped significantly, but still the government is talking about opening most stores only in June, with quite a few restrictions remaining through the summer, including travel bans and significant limits on tourism activity,\u201d said Tom\u00e1\u0161 Prouza, a former secretary for European affairs who now heads the Czech Confederation of Commerce and Tourism.</p> <p>In Slovakia, the prime minister, Igor Matovi\u010d, has faced criticism from within his government for the continued lockdown. Richard Sul\u00edk, the economy minister and leader of the pro-business junior coalition partner in the government, complained on Facebook, \u201cWe don\u2019t destroy our economy for the 800 people who die of flu every year\u201d, and questioned why the country was doing so over the much lower numbers for coronavirus.</p> <p>Matovi\u010d has promised to release a plan and timetable on Monday, but insisted that he would base it on the recommendations of epidemiologists, not economists.</p> <p>Ni\u010d said: \u201cAs countries with much higher infection rates start to discuss gradual relaxations, the paradox is that in central Europe, where the numbers are lower, we\u2019re likely to see a much more cautious exit from lockdown.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/lockdownexit-zip/giv-39027CibXYYhk7Gg/\" data-alt=\"lockdown graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/lockdownexit-zip/giv-39027CibXYYhk7Gg/\">lockdown graphic</a> </figure>  <p>Many countries in the region have imposed severe border restrictions and closed airports, and this may continue even after internal measures are relaxed.</p> <p>The Czech prime minister, Andrej Babi\u0161, said last week that reopening the country\u2019s borders was not a priority. This suggests there is little realistic hope of respite for the country\u2019s beleaguered tourism industry, which until the coronavirus crisis was preoccupied with mitigating the effects of an excess of foreign visitors to Prague. Babi\u0161 said the industry\u2019s focus should now switch to domestic tourism.</p> <p>Another part of the exit strategy is likely to involve masks. In both the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens have been obliged to wear masks for more than a month, with politicians leading by example. The newly elected Matovi\u010d gave one of his first press briefings in a mask in mid-March, and advised others to follow his lead. \u201cEven a home-sewn mask made from old bedsheets or a T-shirt is much better than not wearing any,\u201d he said. Television anchors have read the news in masks, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/czechs-get-to-work-making-masks-after-government-decree-coronavirus\">thousands of volunteers have sewn homemade masks</a> to distribute for free.</p> <p>Roman Prymula, the Czech deputy health minister and an epidemiologist, has warned that the face mask requirement is likely to remain in force throughout the warm summer months.</p> <p>Other countries have since followed suit: Poland, where there is talk of a gradual easing out of lockdown measures in the coming weeks, made mask-wearing outdoors compulsory last week. Austria and some regions of Germany have also ordered the wearing of masks in public places.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Czech Republic is to take the first steps towards easing its coronavirus restrictions on Monday, after officials declared that the Covid-19 outbreak there had been brought under control. The country\u2019s coronavirus numbers, like those in most of central Europe, are much lower than those further west, partly because of the early implementation of strict lockdown measures. Now the burning question for many central and eastern European countries is how fast to loosen the restrictions. Some policymakers believe that extreme caution is required to avoid undoing the positive work and provoking a fresh outbreak. Others point to the increasing economic costs of lockdown measures and say the low number of cases and deaths should allow a swift reopening, perhaps combined with continued closed borders to prevent the virus arriving from outside. \u201cThe numbers look good so far, but even the governments are not sure if there could be a surge ahead,\u201d said Milan Ni\u010d, an expert with the Berlin-based German Council for Foreign Relations. The Czech health minister, Adam Vojt\u011bch, announced last week that the country\u2019s tough approach had prevented the uncontrolled spread of the disease and justified a cautious lifting of restrictions. The five-stage plan will begin on Monday with farmers\u2019 markets, car dealerships and some other small businesses allowed to reopen for the first time since one of the earliest lockdowns in Europe was introduced on 12 March. In the final stage, tentatively scheduled for 8 June, all businesses would be allowed to reopen, including bars, cafes, restaurants and hotels. However, Vojt\u011bch warned people against being lulled into a sense of false security and said officials would reimpose restrictions if there was a sudden surge in cases. As of Sunday morning, the country had recorded 6,657 cases and 181 deaths. Neighbouring Slovakia had just 1,161 cases and 12 deaths, making it one of the least affected countries in Europe. There may be several reasons for the low numbers, but the decisive one seems to be a speedy move to enforce lockdown measures. Border closures and restrictions on movement and gatherings were introduced much earlier than in countries further west. A concerted effort to persuade citizens in both the Czech Republic and Slovakia to wear face masks may also have helped. There has been criticism of the slow pace of moves to ease the lockdown, particularly among those in the service and tourism sector. \u201cThe number of cases has dropped significantly, but still the government is talking about opening most stores only in June, with quite a few restrictions remaining through the summer, including travel bans and significant limits on tourism activity,\u201d said Tom\u00e1\u0161 Prouza, a former secretary for European affairs who now heads the Czech Confederation of Commerce and Tourism. In Slovakia, the prime minister, Igor Matovi\u010d, has faced criticism from within his government for the continued lockdown. Richard Sul\u00edk, the economy minister and leader of the pro-business junior coalition partner in the government, complained on Facebook, \u201cWe don\u2019t destroy our economy for the 800 people who die of flu every year\u201d, and questioned why the country was doing so over the much lower numbers for coronavirus. Matovi\u010d has promised to release a plan and timetable on Monday, but insisted that he would base it on the recommendations of epidemiologists, not economists. Ni\u010d said: \u201cAs countries with much higher infection rates start to discuss gradual relaxations, the paradox is that in central Europe, where the numbers are lower, we\u2019re likely to see a much more cautious exit from lockdown.\u201d Many countries in the region have imposed severe border restrictions and closed airports, and this may continue even after internal measures are relaxed. The Czech prime minister, Andrej Babi\u0161, said last week that reopening the country\u2019s borders was not a priority. This suggests there is little realistic hope of respite for the country\u2019s beleaguered tourism industry, which until the coronavirus crisis was preoccupied with mitigating the effects of an excess of foreign visitors to Prague. Babi\u0161 said the industry\u2019s focus should now switch to domestic tourism. Another part of the exit strategy is likely to involve masks. In both the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens have been obliged to wear masks for more than a month, with politicians leading by example. The newly elected Matovi\u010d gave one of his first press briefings in a mask in mid-March, and advised others to follow his lead. \u201cEven a home-sewn mask made from old bedsheets or a T-shirt is much better than not wearing any,\u201d he said. Television anchors have read the news in masks, and thousands of volunteers have sewn homemade masks to distribute for free. Roman Prymula, the Czech deputy health minister and an epidemiologist, has warned that the face mask requirement is likely to remain in force throughout the warm summer months. Other countries have since followed suit: Poland, where there is talk of a gradual easing out of lockdown measures in the coming weeks, made mask-wearing outdoors compulsory last week. Austria and some regions of Germany have also ordered the wearing of masks in public places.",

      "body": "<p>Only one in four patients is now seeing a GP face to face, with the vast majority getting care through telephone and video consultations, research shows.</p> <p>The \u201crevolution\u201d in how patients access family doctors \u2013 a direct result of the coronavirus \u2013 is revealed in figures collected by the Royal College of GPs.</p> <p>In the four weeks to 12 April, GPs in England undertook 25% less clinical activity than in the same period in 2019. That was due to a combination of factors including many patients staying at home and not seeking GP care at all and also family doctors either being ill themselves or self-isolating because someone in their household was displaying symptoms of the virus.</p> <p>Among patients who sought GP care in that time, only 26% came in to a surgery for an appointment while 71% had their consultation over the phone. That was an almost exact reversal of the patient access patterns seen a year earlier, when 71% attended and just 25% were dealt with remotely.</p> <p>The figures covering around 500 GP practices in England have been collected and shared with the Guardian by the college\u2019s research surveillance centre.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a very rapid and necessary revolution in the way care is delivered in general practice and the way GPs, our teams and our patients have adapted to this has been remarkable\u201d, said Prof Martin Marshall, the college\u2019s chair.</p> <p>Marshall hopes significant numbers of patients will continue to receive remote care once the coronavirus crisis is over, though he stressed that anyone wanting an in-person appointment or needing to receive one for a vaccination, for example, would continue to have one.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/were-clearing-the-decks-a-gp-on-watching-the-coronavirus-pandemic-unfold\">'We're clearing the decks': a GP on watching the coronavirus pandemic unfold</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He also stressed that GP surgeries\u2019 recent dramatic expansion of telephone and video consultations may also encourage patients who are ill with non-Covid ailments to seek help that way rather than shun NHS services altogether. </p> <p>Doctors are increasingly concerned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/15/sharp-rise-in-ill-patients-dying-at-home-since-coronavirus-outbreak\">by patients risking their health</a> and even their lives by not seeing a GP, going to A&amp;E or dialling 999 when they develop symptoms such as pain or shortness of breath because they do not want to risk contracting coronavirus or add to NHS staff\u2019s burden.</p> <p>Marshall said too few GPs had secure access to patient records from home, which meant some who self-isolated because of the virus were unable to keep on working.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe are still facing barriers. Many GPs, for example, are telling us they are having technological difficulties with working remotely from home due to a lack of adequate hardware and software. This means that they can\u2019t undertake patient consultations if they are having to self-isolate but still well enough to work, and affects capacity across the rest of the service,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s also imperative that we safeguard the technological advances we have made during the pandemic, so that we can continue to work in different ways in the best interests of patients when we eventually get Covid-19 under control. Having the technological capability to offer remote consultations, where appropriate, will be beneficial for general practice, the wider NHS and most importantly our patients.\u201d</p> <p>He wants ministers and NHS leaders to cover the cost of GP surgeries buying thousands of laptops for doctors and practice nurses so that they can talk to patients on the phone while using a VPN link to look at their medical records.</p> <p>Of the 50% of GPs who have not been working from home recently, 44% were unable to do so because they did not have a laptop, research for the college found.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Only one in four patients is now seeing a GP face to face, with the vast majority getting care through telephone and video consultations, research shows. The \u201crevolution\u201d in how patients access family doctors \u2013 a direct result of the coronavirus \u2013 is revealed in figures collected by the Royal College of GPs. In the four weeks to 12 April, GPs in England undertook 25% less clinical activity than in the same period in 2019. That was due to a combination of factors including many patients staying at home and not seeking GP care at all and also family doctors either being ill themselves or self-isolating because someone in their household was displaying symptoms of the virus. Among patients who sought GP care in that time, only 26% came in to a surgery for an appointment while 71% had their consultation over the phone. That was an almost exact reversal of the patient access patterns seen a year earlier, when 71% attended and just 25% were dealt with remotely. The figures covering around 500 GP practices in England have been collected and shared with the Guardian by the college\u2019s research surveillance centre. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a very rapid and necessary revolution in the way care is delivered in general practice and the way GPs, our teams and our patients have adapted to this has been remarkable\u201d, said Prof Martin Marshall, the college\u2019s chair. Marshall hopes significant numbers of patients will continue to receive remote care once the coronavirus crisis is over, though he stressed that anyone wanting an in-person appointment or needing to receive one for a vaccination, for example, would continue to have one. He also stressed that GP surgeries\u2019 recent dramatic expansion of telephone and video consultations may also encourage patients who are ill with non-Covid ailments to seek help that way rather than shun NHS services altogether. Doctors are increasingly concerned by patients risking their health and even their lives by not seeing a GP, going to A&amp;E or dialling 999 when they develop symptoms such as pain or shortness of breath because they do not want to risk contracting coronavirus or add to NHS staff\u2019s burden. Marshall said too few GPs had secure access to patient records from home, which meant some who self-isolated because of the virus were unable to keep on working. \u201cWe are still facing barriers. Many GPs, for example, are telling us they are having technological difficulties with working remotely from home due to a lack of adequate hardware and software. This means that they can\u2019t undertake patient consultations if they are having to self-isolate but still well enough to work, and affects capacity across the rest of the service,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s also imperative that we safeguard the technological advances we have made during the pandemic, so that we can continue to work in different ways in the best interests of patients when we eventually get Covid-19 under control. Having the technological capability to offer remote consultations, where appropriate, will be beneficial for general practice, the wider NHS and most importantly our patients.\u201d He wants ministers and NHS leaders to cover the cost of GP surgeries buying thousands of laptops for doctors and practice nurses so that they can talk to patients on the phone while using a VPN link to look at their medical records. Of the 50% of GPs who have not been working from home recently, 44% were unable to do so because they did not have a laptop, research for the college found.",

My 78-year-old husband is in a local care home with late-stage Alzheimer\u2019s. The staff are heroic, having moved on-site, sleeping in a borrowed caravan and a tent two weeks at a time, 24/7, to minimise risk of the virus entering the care home. Despite this, the home now has two potential cases of Covid-19, but testing was only available when there were five or more suspected cases. There are 16 residents, so this meant that one-third had to show symptoms before this happens, if then. (Matt Hancock has since said testing will be made available for all care home staff and residents, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/16/social-care-an-afterthought-in-uk-coronavirus-response-says-leaked-letter\" title=\"\">no deadline has been given</a> for this to be implemented.)</p> <p>In addition, staff are wearing homemade face shields kindly produced by a local primary school on its 3D printer.

We are told that this consignment is still stuck in Turkey with no certainty, at the time this comment was issued, on how many gowns, if any, will leave for the UK, when.</p> <p>\u201cBitter experience over the last few weeks has shown that until a consignment of gowns has landed, the boxes have been checked and the equipment tested, the NHS can\u2019t count on the gowns being available for use at the frontline.</p> <p>\u201cWe understand, for example, that a consignment of 200,000 gowns that arrived from China last week actually contained only 20,000 gowns. This follows previous instances of consignments of gowns being mislabelled and failing safety tests.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone is keen to move to a sustainable supply of gowns as soon as possible but NHS trusts need certainty. Given the current uncertainties over gown manufacture and supply, due to global shortages, we suggest that any future announcements on what gowns might be available for delivery, when, just focus on what we can be certain of.</p> <p>\u201cOn the current position in trusts, it is important to understand what \u2018running out of gowns\u2019 means. Usually it doesn\u2019t mean that no member of staff in that trust has access to a fluid repellent gown or higher levels of protection than a basic apron.</p> <p>\u201cTrusts tell us that they are adopting a number of different approaches to address current shortages. These include concentrating the use of fluid repellent gowns in areas of highest risk such as intensive and critical care and using fluid resistant, as opposed to fluid repellent, coveralls with an additional apron, in line with the advice issued on Friday.</p> <p>\u201cTrust leaders have asked us to publicly thank the fire and police services, vets, local councils, DIY stores, builders\u2019 merchants and others who have donated their supply of gowns and coveralls, many of them fluid repellent, over the last few days. For example one trust we spoke to this afternoon had secured 2,000 fluid repellent gowns from a local vet supply firm and another had secured 3,000 washable gowns from a local business that they were looking to adapt for NHS use.</p> <p>\u201cIn the words of one chief executive on Twitter: \u2018I cannot even begin to describe how hard NHS CEOs are working to organise, share and best use each piece of PPE we have. We are only sorry we can\u2019t do more to protect our amazing people.\u2019\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-19T16:40:14.410Z\">at 5.40pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e9c76928f080ee110447cd2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-19T16:06:13.465Z\">5.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The government\u2019s daily press briefing has now concluded. </p> <p>The main points to note are the PPE equipment should be arriving in the UK tomorrow, there is no date for schools to reopen and schools will not be open over the summer holidays.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-19T16:31:47.562Z\">at 5.31pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e9c75778f08bade1f296197\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-19T16:00:20.853Z\">5.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Dr Harries declined to say whether the UK had \u201cpassed the peak\u201d of the virus. </p> <p>Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said earlier today he thought the UK was past the peak of the \u201cfirst wave\u201d of the virus. </p> <p>Harries said: \u201cI would be very tempted to offer a comment on that today but I\u2019m not going to be, for a number of reasons.\u201d</p> <p>She identified that the low number of deaths recorded today was \u201cpositive\u201d but cautioned against reading too much into the figures, which are often retrospectively revised.</p> <p>Harries said: \u201cWe could jump to all sorts of positive conclusions about that, but we shouldn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cI do think it is fair to say that we do know from the hospital data that we are starting to plateau across.\u201d</p> <p>But she added: \u201cIf we don\u2019t keep doing the social distancing, we will create a second peak and we definitely won\u2019t be past it, so this is no reason to consider that we have managed this.</p> <p>\u201cBut I do think things look to be heading in the right direction.\u201d</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-19T16:31:26.576Z\">at 5.31pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e9c75158f080ee110447cc4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-19T15:58:31.797Z\">4.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On measures taken in schools in other countries such as Denmark to get them to open sooner, such as reducing class sizes, Williamson said: \u201cAre we looking at other countries and learning from them?

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it from me, Nadeem Badshah. To continue following our coronavirus coverage, you can check out our global blog -https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/19/coronavirus-live-news-europe-deaths-approach-100000-as-us-looks-to-lift-restrictions The UK death toll from Covid-19 has risen to 16,060. As of 9am today, 372,967 people have been tested of which 120,067 tested positive. As of 5pm yesterday, of those hospitalised in the UK who tested positive for coronavirus, 16,060 have died. The Department of Health and Social Care added that 482,063 tests have concluded, with 21,626 tests undertaken on 18 April. NHS England said 482 people with Covid-19 have died, which is the lowest daily number since 6 April. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, said there are \u201ccurrently no plans to have schools open over the summer period\u201d. He added that he cannot give a date for schools to reopen following reports suggesting they could reopen in three weeks. A delivery of 84 tonnes of personal protective equipment destined for frontline NHS staff has been delayed. The shipment \u2013 including 400,000 gowns \u2013 was due to arrive in the UK from Turkey on Sunday afternoon. Williamson said the shipment should be arriving tomorrow and manufacturers willing to produce PPE would be contacted in the next 24 hours. Williamson listed a number of measures the government was introducing for disadvantaged children trying to learn at home, including buying laptops for those preparing for exams and giving 4G routers for those without internet. Michael Gove conceded that Boris Johnson missed five consecutive emergency meetings in the buildup to the coronavirus crisis and that the UK shipped protective equipment to China in February. The family of Ruben Mu\u00f1oz, a nursing assistant at Surrey and Sussex NHS trust who died after contracting coronavirus, have described him as a \u201cbeloved husband and amazing father\u201d. The family of a nursing assistant who died after contracting coronavirus have described him as a \u201cbeloved husband and amazing father\u201d. Ruben Mu\u00f1oz, a father of two and healthcare worker at Surrey and Sussex NHS trust, died on Friday, the trust said today. His family said in a statement: \u201cRuben is a good son, a beloved husband and an amazing father to his two children. \u201cHe was so proud of his NHS and Woodland Ward family.\u201d Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s friends have set up a fundraiser for his family - https://www.gofundme.com/f/in-loving-memory-of-ruben-munoz-a-nhs-hero The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, said PPE equipment should be arriving in the UK from Turkey tomorrow. On the PPE shortages, Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said: No one in the NHS wanted to be where we now are on gowns, with a significant number of trusts reporting critically low stocks. \u201cWe have, over the last 24 hours, seen an unhelpful focus on one individual consignment coming from Turkey. We are told that this consignment is still stuck in Turkey with no certainty, at the time this comment was issued, on how many gowns, if any, will leave for the UK, when. \u201cBitter experience over the last few weeks has shown that until a consignment of gowns has landed, the boxes have been checked and the equipment tested, the NHS can\u2019t count on the gowns being available for use at the frontline. \u201cWe understand, for example, that a consignment of 200,000 gowns that arrived from China last week actually contained only 20,000 gowns. This follows previous instances of consignments of gowns being mislabelled and failing safety tests. \u201cEveryone is keen to move to a sustainable supply of gowns as soon as possible but NHS trusts need certainty. Given the current uncertainties over gown manufacture and supply, due to global shortages, we suggest that any future announcements on what gowns might be available for delivery, when, just focus on what we can be certain of. \u201cOn the current position in trusts, it is important to understand what \u2018running out of gowns\u2019 means. Usually it doesn\u2019t mean that no member of staff in that trust has access to a fluid repellent gown or higher levels of protection than a basic apron. \u201cTrusts tell us that they are adopting a number of different approaches to address current shortages. These include concentrating the use of fluid repellent gowns in areas of highest risk such as intensive and critical care and using fluid resistant, as opposed to fluid repellent, coveralls with an additional apron, in line with the advice issued on Friday. \u201cTrust leaders have asked us to publicly thank the fire and police services, vets, local councils, DIY stores, builders\u2019 merchants and others who have donated their supply of gowns and coveralls, many of them fluid repellent, over the last few days. For example one trust we spoke to this afternoon had secured 2,000 fluid repellent gowns from a local vet supply firm and another had secured 3,000 washable gowns from a local business that they were looking to adapt for NHS use. \u201cIn the words of one chief executive on Twitter: \u2018I cannot even begin to describe how hard NHS CEOs are working to organise, share and best use each piece of PPE we have. We are only sorry we can\u2019t do more to protect our amazing people.\u2019\u201d The government\u2019s daily press briefing has now concluded. The main points to note are the PPE equipment should be arriving in the UK tomorrow, there is no date for schools to reopen and schools will not be open over the summer holidays. Dr Harries declined to say whether the UK had \u201cpassed the peak\u201d of the virus. Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said earlier today he thought the UK was past the peak of the \u201cfirst wave\u201d of the virus. Harries said: \u201cI would be very tempted to offer a comment on that today but I\u2019m not going to be, for a number of reasons.\u201d She identified that the low number of deaths recorded today was \u201cpositive\u201d but cautioned against reading too much into the figures, which are often retrospectively revised. Harries said: \u201cWe could jump to all sorts of positive conclusions about that, but we shouldn\u2019t. \u201cI do think it is fair to say that we do know from the hospital data that we are starting to plateau across.\u201d But she added: \u201cIf we don\u2019t keep doing the social distancing, we will create a second peak and we definitely won\u2019t be past it, so this is no reason to consider that we have managed this. \u201cBut I do think things look to be heading in the right direction.\u201d On measures taken in schools in other countries such as Denmark to get them to open sooner, such as reducing class sizes, Williamson said: \u201cAre we looking at other countries and learning from them? Absolutely. \u201cAnd we\u2019re seeing a few examples of countries opening up their schooling system and we\u2019ll look closely as to how that works, how that goes, and what lessons can be learnt from it so we can benefit from that.\u201d Williamson\u2019s response in full on schools being open over the summer and whether he thinks social distancing is feasible in classrooms: I think we recognise the challenges that anyone who\u2019s a parent of trying to instil social distancing in small children, and we have to understand really that sort of broad context. \u201cWe are in a stage in terms of dealing with this pandemic where there are an awful lot of questions that sadly, people would love to have answers to, but in terms of how the virus develops we have to see that. \u201cThere are currently no plans to have schools open over the summer period and we haven\u2019t been working on plans to have them open over the summer period.\u201d Dr Harries cautioned against comparing UK figures with Germany, adding: \u201cWe are at different phases of the pandemic.\u201d She also defended the country\u2019s approach to managing the spread of the virus: We had and we still have a very clear plan - we had a containment phase and it was very successful. We had very strict quarantine regimes from high-risk areas, we followed up individual cases and families wherever that was possible. But once you end up with seeding and cases across the community, our focus has to be on managing the clinical conditions of those individuals.\u201d Dr Harries added it was \u201cvery easy to make a throwaway comment about single-use PPE\u201d but the situation was \u201cactually quite complex\u201d. \u201cIt is the fact we are in a global shortage \u2026 we all need to use this PPE carefully. \u201cSome sessional use is entirely appropriate. For example wearing a gown for sessional use with a disposable plastic apron on top of it is an entirely appropriate use of PPE. \u201cIn that example you can see there is one element of what some people may call re-use and one element of what some may call single use.\u201d Asked if she would be comfortable treating Covid-19 patients by reusing single-use PPE, Dr Harries said: \u201cIf I happened to be working on the frontline today I have a responsibility to look after patients to the best of my ability, to protect my colleagues and my staff and to manage my practice safely. \u201cAll of those in the current climate will mean that I need to understand the agreed guidance on PPE ... and to implement that whenever I can.\u201d Gavin Williamson said there are \u201ccurrently no plans to have schools open over the summer period\u201d. Williamson has defended Boris Johnson after reports today said he missed five Cobra meetings on coronavirus. Williamson said: \u201cThe prime minister from the moment that it became clear that there were challenges in terms of coronavirus developing in China has absolutely been leading our nation\u2019s effort to combat the coronavirus, making sure that resources or money is not a concern for any department, especially the health service.\u201d When asked why the government has not responded to manufacturers who are willing to produce PPE, Williamson said they would be contacted in the next 24 hours. He said a billion extra PPE have been brought into the country while the government was doing \u201cimmense work\u201d in trying to find British suppliers. He encouraged those suppliers who have been in contact with the government and have \u201cslipped through the net\u201d to get in touch again. Williamson said the government will ensure they are contacted \u201cin the next 24 hours\u201d. He added: \u201cWe recognise this is a national endeavour and we are so incredibly grateful for so many people who are willing to step forward to make a real difference, and we certainly don\u2019t want to miss out on those opportunities.\u201d On situations where 30%-40% of students have no computer at home and a difficult environment to learn at home, Williamson said he is \u201cworried about it immensely\u201d: Many families are learning about the challenges of home education for their child. That\u2019s why we have announced these package of measures to help children from a disadvantaged background. It it worrying for me, those children are going to fall behind and struggle to catch up. I don\u2019t want to see children falling behind and will do everything I can do.\u201d Williamson\u2019s answer in full on the depleted stocks of PPE and why more was not done to get hold of more PPE in March and February. What we\u2019ve seen over the last few months is an enormous effort, it\u2019s a national effort, but it\u2019s also an international effort to secure PPE from right around the globe, but we\u2019ve seen so many brilliant British businesses repurpose themselves in order to be able to provide it. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve seen many educational settings also being able to do it. \u201cBut you know, the government, from the first moment that we were in a situation where the scientific advice was highlighting to us that we were facing a real challenge in terms of coronavirus, and this could potentially evolve into a pandemic, every resource of government has been deployed to not just expanding what we need in terms of PPE, but also ventilators, and we\u2019ve seen a massive growth in the number of ventilators that we have available in our hospitals. \u201cAnd keep adding and building to the stock of what we\u2019ve got.\u201d Reaction to Williamson\u2019s responses to the questions about PPE. The daily briefing continues to be dominated by the shortages of protective equipment. Williamson said the government \u201crecognises the enormous strain being placed on the system\u201d. He added the RAF is on standby to deliver PPE from Turkey that has been delayed. Williamson said he hopes this will take place tomorrow. On reports that stocks of PPE such as gowns and masks were run down ahead of the coronavirus outbreak, Williamson responded that the government has been working hard \u201cfrom the first moment\u201d. Dr Harries said there needed to be \u201can adult conversation\u201d about PPE. \u201cThe UK has been an international exemplar in preparedness,\u201d she said. Harries says there has been a \u201chuge demand on our supply\u201d. \u201cRather than lumping all of the PPE together, we just need to think carefully through what has been achieved and the challenges.\u201d On reports today that Boris Johnson missed five Cobra meetings about Covid-19, Williamson said: \u201cMany Cobra meetings take place where it is actually led by a departmental minister. \u201cThis is a whole governmental effort, making sure we do everything required and protect the NHS and save lives.\u201d Williamson earlier spoke about the list of online educational resources. He said: \u201cSome of our leading state schools have collaborated to open the Oak National Academy, which will be launched online tomorrow. \u201cThis is a totally new initiative led by 40 brilliant teachers who have assembled video lessons and resources for any teacher in the country to make use of if they wish to do so. \u201c180 video lessons will be provided each week across a broad range of subjects for every year group from reception through to year 10.\u201d Asked about concerns surrounding the shortage of personal protective equipment after the delay in the shipment arriving in the UK, Williamson appears to evade the question and says the government has been engaged in an \u201cenormous effort\u201d to secure supplies from \u201cright around the globe\u201d. Deputy chief medical officer, Dr Jenny Harries, said the public should congratulate themselves on maintaining social distancing measures by not using public transport. Tube travel is down by 95%. She said there was a \u201clittle blip\u201d over Easter but added we now back to \u201cnormal pandemic level\u201d. Williamson also heaped praise on parents for dealing with home-schooling children during the lockdown. He said: \u201cI recognise all the challenges that families will be facing at the moment. \u201cWe are determined to support parents who are helping their children learn from home. \u201cI think we all know how difficult that can be.\u201d Williamson insisted the government\u2019s \u201cfirst priority has always been protecting the children and young people, but particularly vulnerable people\u201d. He confirms no one will have to leave care \u201cduring this difficult time\u201d and ministers are working with Childline and NSPCC for help. The education secretary said he \u201cknows how hard it must be\u201d for children who have had their education disrupted. He added: \u201cYou\u2019re such an important part of this fight too and I cannot thank you enough for what you\u2019re doing.\u201d Williamson added for schools without internet connection, the government would provide free 4G routers while schools were closed and exempt \u201ccertain education resources from data charges so this does not add to household expenses\u201d. Williamson said the government was ordering laptops for disadvantaged young people, and laptops and tablets for children with social workers and care leavers. The education secretary added: \u201cOn any normal Sunday afternoon, many of you would have been out with family and friends enjoying the sunshine. \u201cAnd tomorrow, many children would be going to school after a two-week break. \u201cBut these are not normal times and we are asking you to stay at home.\u201d Williamson also thanked Britons for the \u201csacrifices you have made and are continuing to make\u201d. Williamson says the government is \u201cenormously grateful\u201d to the teachers and staff in nurseries who have continued working to care for vulnerable children and look after the children of key workers. He adds that \u201cI can\u2019t give you a date\u201d when schools will reopen fully. It comes after press reports today suggested that schools could reopen in three weeks. The five tests are: the NHS\u2019s ability to cope daily death rates decreasing reliability of data on rate of infection falling testing capacity and PPE being managed, with supply meeting demand any changes the government makes will not risk a second peak of infections The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, says the government needs to meet five tests before setting deadline for reopening of schools. Patrick Vallance, the UK government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, has written for the Guardian about the promise of a coronavirus vaccine: Ideally, we would have one ready to take off the shelf and roll out yesterday. One that could be delivered at scale. But this is a new disease that didn\u2019t exist before December and we have a lot to learn about the virus and how the body responds to it. All new vaccines that come into development are long shots; only some end up being successful, and the whole process requires experimentation. Coronavirus will be no different and presents new challenges for vaccine development. This will take time, and we should be clear it is not a certainty. You can read the full piece here: The UK government will give its daily briefing at 4pm BST led by the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, while Boris Johnson continues to recover from coronavirus. Williamson will be joined by deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe faces another \u201cdeeply unsettling\u201d couple of days as the wait continues to find out whether her temporary release from a prison in Iran has been extended, according to her husband. The British-Iranian woman was temporarily freed from Evin prison in Tehran in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s furlough was extended by two weeks in late March, and she was scheduled to return to prison on Saturday. When her family had not received a decision by Saturday on whether or not her furlough is to be extended, they were told to return to the Prosecutors Office in Iran on Sunday - but have now been told to come back on Tuesday. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, said: \u201cNazanin\u2019s father and lawyer were separately told to come back on Tuesday. No news on clemency, no news on furlough extension. \u201cThe president announced today that non-dangerous prisoners on furlough have it extended for another month. \u201cAccording to her lawyer, this means furlough has been automatically extended for non-political prisoners. \u201cFor political prisoners like Nazanin, the extension needs to be confirmed by the Prosecutors Office in co-ordination with the prison - and will be allowed for those only with a record of good behaviour, not speaking out in the media etc. \u201cFor the cases of most of the political prisoners that we are aware of, people have been told to come back on Tuesday for another update.\u201d Scotland\u2019s health secretary, Jeane Freeman, has addressed reports in the media that schools could reopen in three weeks. Speaking at a briefing at the Scottish government\u2019s headquarters in Edinburgh, she said: \u201cThese are not plans that the Scottish government has seen, and not ones we endorse.\u201d Freeman added: \u201cWe have committed to publishing later this week our initial thinking on how Scotland plots our way forward. \u201cThis will focus on the issues that have to be weighed up and the changes that will be required for society to adapt as safely as possible to the presence of the virus. \u201cWe confirmed only three days ago that the current lockdown remains in place for another three weeks. We will use that time to assess the evidence and the options before we make any further decisions.\u201d Freeman also announced an emergency hospital based at Glasgow\u2019s Scottish Events Campus (SEC) would be ready to receive patients from Monday. She said the number of cases of Covid-19 would be monitored in Scotland before the hospital would be brought into use. Freeman added: \u201cThe decision on whether patients need to be admitted to the Louisa Jordan will be reviewed on a regular basis as the data on case numbers continues to come forward. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said before, I hope that this facility will not be needed, but it is valuable to have this extra capacity and I\u2019m grateful to everyone who has delivered this hospital at such speed.\u201d A group representing care home providers has estimated that more than 4,000 residents have died during the coronavirus pandemic. One person in Northern Ireland has died in a hospital setting with coronavirus in the past day, the Public Health Agency has said. This brings the total number of confirmed deaths in hospital settings in the region to 194. A further 159 people were diagnosed with Covid-19 in Northern Ireland, the PHA added. It brings the total number of people who have tested positive in the region thus far to 2,645. A total of 903 people who tested positive for coronavirus in Scotland have died, a rise of 10 on Saturday\u2019s figure, according to the Scottish government. Across the country, 39,612 people have been tested for Covid-19 with 8,187 testing positive. As of Saturday night, 1,797 patients were in hospital with either confirmed or suspected coronavirus, an increase of four. Of those, 174 were being treated in intensive care units, down eight from the previous tally. Of the 482 new deaths announced in England today: 118 occurred on 18 April 243 occurred on 17 April 62 occurred on 16 April The figures also show 56 of the deaths took place between 1 April and 15 April, and the remaining three deaths occurred in March, with the earliest new death taking place on 20 March, NHS England said. The figures published today show 8 April currently has the highest total for the most hospital deaths occurring on a single day \u2013 801 \u2013 although this could change in future updates. As of 9am today,372,967 people have been tested of which 120,067 tested positive. As of 5pm on yesterday, of those hospitalised in the UK who tested positive for coronavirus, 16,060 have died. The Department of Health and Social Care added that 482,063 tests have concluded, with 21,626 tests undertaken on 18 April. NHS England says a further 482 people with Covid-19 have died, which is the lowest daily number since 6 April. Public Health Wales has announced another 41 deaths of people who tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of confirmed fatalities in Wales to 575. There have been a total of 7,270 confirmed cases in Wales, a rise of 334, while 25,170 tests have been carried out on 21,717 individuals, officials said. Conservative former party leader Iain Duncan Smith has backed the government\u2019s record on preparing for coronavirus. He told Sky News: \u201cThe reality about this is that the world did not realise the extent of the pandemic in China because it is quite clear now that China suppressed and hid information, for whatever reasons we may yet discover. \u201cAnd that the World Health Organization, which has serious questions to answer, did not tell the rest of the world that this was a pandemic that was more than likely to spread.\u201d He added: \u201cThere are questions, yes, that will be asked, but later on, not now. \u201cWe have no idea who is leaking this information, whether they are disgruntled or not, we don\u2019t know. \u201cBut the reality is, questions will be asked, but it is right to ask them once we have completed this process, got on top of this and then managed to get the country back up and running.\u201d The Welsh government has announced plans to rapidly increase testing for coronavirus. The health minister, Vaughan Gething, set out plans to \u201cremove the bureaucracy\u201d from the coronavirus testing system in the country. The plans would result in more critical workers being tested so they can return to work more quickly and include the military looking at operational processes to make the system quicker and more efficient, as well as an online booking system. The cap on referrals of social workers per local authority will also be removed, and the referral process will be reviewed. \u201cWe are increasing our capacity for testing in Wales through our community testing units, the introduction of regional drive-in testing centres and, within weeks, an online home testing service,\u201d Gething said. The Welsh government had set a target of 5,000 tests per day by the second or third week of April but this has not been reached. Daily capacity is currently at 1,300 per day, with documents setting out the new plan admitting the 5,000 figure would not be achieved by the third week of April. It said it had \u201cexperienced a range of delays in securing some of the equipment and reagents for processing and running swab tests\u201d. Data published by Public Health Wales shows the number of daily tests are often well below the 1,300 capacity, with 783 carried out on Friday. The prime minister spent nearly two weeks at a country mansion with his partner, Carrie Symonds, as ministers held emergency meetings on the coronavirus crisis. It has emerged that during this time Johnson did not attend five Cobra meetings at the start of the coronavirus crisis. Johnson instead reportedly remained at Chevening, a 115-room lakeside mansion set in 3,500 acres in the Kent countryside. The Grade I-listed, 17th-century mansion is traditionally the country residence of the foreign secretary but Johnson stayed there as his official country retreat, Chequers, was being renovated. A union boss has criticised \u201cirresponsible\u201d claims from \u201cprivate briefings\u201d claiming schools could be set to reopen within weeks. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders\u2019 union NAHT, said: \u201cPrivate briefings about senior ministers\u2019 responses to coronavirus simply must stop. It is irresponsible and is causing confusion and fear. \u201cI am pleased that the secretary of state for education has moved to set the record straight immediately.\u201d Whiteman said any reopening of schools must be led \u201cby the best scientific and medical advice available\u201d amid reports children could return to schools in three weeks\u2019 time. \u201cAny return to school must be planned in dialogue with the profession and be accompanied by robust safety measures for pupils, parents, school staff and the wider community,\u201d he said. \u201cSchools stepped up immediately alongside other public services in response to this crisis. Not through compulsion but through a determination to play their part. \u201cInstructing school leaders and their teams to return without including them in the planning stages or sharing proper safety arrangements would be extremely reckless.\u201d The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, said on Sunday morning that no decision had been made on when the government would reopen schools. A homeless former British paratrooper who set off on a mission to walk around the coast of the UK is isolating on an uninhabited Shetland island after lockdown measures were introduced part way through his challenge. Chris Lewis, 39, has walked 12,000 miles since setting off from Llangennith beach on the Gower peninsula, near his home city of Swansea, south Wales, in August 2017. He was sleeping in a tent on mainland Shetland when the UK government announced lockdown restrictions on 23 March to limit the spread of coronavirus. Lewis and his dog Jet were taken to Hildasay, a 108-hectare island off the west coast of the Shetland mainland, by boat and have remained there ever since. They have been given permission to live in the one house on Hildasay, a former shepherd\u2019s hut without running water, heating or electricity. After lockdown restrictions are lifted, Lewis and Jet will continue their journey around the UK coastline to raise money for SSAFA, the Armed Forces charity, with donations already reaching almost \u00a398,000. He said: \u201cI thought it would be better if I wasn\u2019t on the mainland - I didn\u2019t want to be in the way. \u201cThere is one house on the island and the family of the man that used to live there heard I was camping and offered me the keys. \u201cEverybody is in isolation at the moment - it\u2019s the one thing I can do. This will be over for me when it\u2019s over for everyone else.\u201d Lewis collects driftwood, forages and fishes for his food, and always makes sure he has a three-week supply of dog food for Jet. Hildasay has been uninhabited since the late nineteenth century, with Lewis and Jet joined only by 15 sheep and thousands of birds. Fundraising page: https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/chriswalks Labour has warned against the repeat of \u201cmistakes\u201d made in the financial crisis of a decade ago in the response to the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. The shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, said her party and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development had been calling for the most vulnerable people and businesses to be protected. She told BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show: \u201cI would say the critical thing there is that we learn from the lessons particularly of the very slow recovery that we had in the UK after the global financial crisis, make sure that we don\u2019t repeat the same mistakes again and that we have a much more sustainable economic recovery this time.\u201d Dodds warned of a \u201cripple effect right across our economy if large numbers of people and businesses become severely indebted and, of course, if many businesses go bust\u201d, adding: \u201cOf course we are seeing now record numbers of people struggling, trying to access universal credit. \u201cWe had the longest squeeze on living standards in our country since Napoleonic times from 2010 until the current day. That can\u2019t happen again. \u201cSo that means not having a strategy where services are cut back so radically that you pull demand out of the economy, that\u2019s what happened in the UK in the 2010s, not having an approach which cuts taxes for the very best-off people but actually ensures that the burden is falling on the shoulders of everybody else.\u201d An indie musician has almost completed an album about the coronavirus pandemic, written while he was recovering from the disease. Singer-songwriter Momus told the BBC the outbreak \u201cputs us all in the same state of existential anguish\u201d. Nick Currie, who has made music under the alias Momus for more than 30 years, had just finished the first track from his forthcoming album when he started experiencing symptoms of coronavirus. \u201cHaving heard accounts of people who have been through very mild cases, they have had the same symptoms as me - the chills, the fever, the lack of appetite, the raging thirst,\u201d he said. \u201cAt that moment, I was very scared. I really thought \u2013 this is it \u2013 and started anticipating all the RIP Momus messages people would be posting.\u201d But, when he started feeling better, Momus began work on a whole album charting his own and the world\u2019s progress since the day his illness struck on 17 March. \u201cThis is an amazingly intense moment for the whole of mankind and, for a marginal artist like me, it is an extraordinary opportunity to be on the same page as everyone else, to experience what everyone else is experiencing,\u201d he added. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has appointed a \u201cpersonal protective equipment (PPE) tsar\u201d to take on the shortage of supplies across NHS trusts in the UK. Paul Deighton, 64, the chief executive of the London 2012 Olympics, has been appointed to get a grip on the situation, as thousands of doctors and nurses across the country are being forced to work without the correct PPE. Hancock said: \u201cJust as Lord Beaverbrook spearheaded the wartime efforts on aircraft production, the appointment of Lord Deighton will bring renewed drive and focus to coordinate this unprecedented peacetime challenge. \u201cLord Deighton led the delivery of the Olympics. Now he will lead a singular and relentless focus on PPE as the country\u2019s top manufacturing priority, with the full weight of the government behind him.\u201d The government has been under fire for weeks over the distribution of PPE, with some frontline staff warning that they have had to work in situations where they feel unsafe. At least 50 NHS workers have now died after contracting coronavirus. The UK\u2019s death toll from coronavirus is thought to be far higher than official figures, a new study has suggested. The data from the National Care Forum estimated that more than 4,000 elderly and disabled people have died across all residential and nursing homes. This is significantly higher than the official weekly figures released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which recorded 217 care home deaths connected to the virus up until April 3. The NCF collected data from 47 care homes which support more than 30,000 people across the UK, accounting for 7.4% of the care sector population. It found 299 confirmed or suspected coronavirus deaths across those specific homes in one week between April 7 to April 13, which is almost three times the number of deaths in the preceding month, when they found 102 deaths between March 6 and April 7. When scaled up to reflect the UK\u2019s care home population, the NCF estimated that 4,040 people may have died of a coronavirus-related illness before April 13. Just a reminder that we\u2019ll be bringing you all the latest UK coronavirus developments as the day unfolds. As ever, if you\u2019d like to get in touch with a story, comments, tips or suggestions, please feel free to email me at nazia.parveen@theguardian.com or follow me to send me a message on Twitter, I am on @NParveenG Support for businesses during the coronavirus pandemic must come faster if people\u2019s livelihoods are to be saved, the Government has been warned. The government\u2019s furlough scheme, which allows employees to get 80% of their salaries up to a maximum of 2,500 a month, was extended on Friday for at least another month, as many employees are forced to stay at home to help slow the spread of coronavirus. Adam Marshall, director general at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said the situation for so many firms is \u201cextremely difficult\u201d. He was asked about the consequences of support not coming through fast enough, and told Sky News\u2019s Sophy Ridge On Sunday: \u201cWell, the cost here is in terms of people\u2019s livelihoods. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing for example about 66%, two-thirds of businesses, telling us that they\u2019re going to use the furlough scheme in order to try to get some support for their employees so that they don\u2019t have to make them redundant or lay them off. \u201cThat\u2019s a really big number, and unless some of that cash flows through from the furlough scheme quickly when applications open tomorrow, a lot of businesses are going to face difficulty paying wages and paying suppliers. \u201cSo the human cost as well as the economic cost could be big if we don\u2019t see support moving more quickly to the frontline.\u201d Bit more from Sarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology at Oxford University, who has said that nobody can be \u201ccompletely certain\u201d that it is possible to find a coronavirus vaccine but the prospects are \u201cvery good\u201d. Gilbert said they hope to begin clinical trials towards the end of next week. In the meantime, permission has been given to recruit volunteers, take blood tests, explain the process and check their health status, she said. Gilbert said: \u201cBy the time we have all the approvals for the vaccine ready, we should have a good pool of volunteers to draw from and we should be able to get going quite quickly.\u201d It is difficult to know when a vaccine might be ready, Gilbert said, as there are many complex stages in vaccine development. These start with immunising healthy 18 to 55-year-olds, before moving into older age groups, looking at the safety and immune response to the vaccine. \u201cThat\u2019s important because it\u2019s the older population that we really need to protect with the vaccine,\u201d she said. She added that her team has gone through stages of vaccine development that usually take five years in just four months. A delivery of 84 tonnes of personal protective equipment destined for front line NHS staff has been delayed, according to reports. The shipment - including 400,000 gowns - was due to arrive in the UK from Turkey on Sunday afternoon. It is not currently known when the supplies described as \u201ccritical\u201d will arrive instead. This morning during an interview on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show Michael Gove was asked if it was correct that the UK had sent 273,000 pieces of personnel protection equipment (PPE) to China in February. Gove, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said: \u201cWe did send protective equipment to China. \u201cBut, I think it\u2019s important to stress two things there as well. The first thing is that the personal protection equipment that we sent to China was to help with the most extreme outbreak in Wuhan. \u201cThat personal protection equipment was not from our pandemic stock. \u201cAnd, also we have received far more from China in personal protective equipment than we have given.\u201d Scotland\u2019s first minister Nicola Sturgeon has responded to overnight reports of UK ministers planning to reopen schools before the end of may by cautioning that \u201cdecisions must be based on evidence and careful judgment, not on the demands of the Sunday newspaper briefing cycle\u201d. She tweeted that: \u201cDecisions need to be solidly based &amp; not premature. We don\u2019t yet know what will be possible &amp; when. The Scottish government will set out asap the factors that will guide decisions, but as/when we lift restrictions, we must be able to suppress virus in different ways eg test, trace, isolate\u201d. This comes after Sturgeon suggested on Friday that it would be \u201clogical and sensible\u201d for Scotland to diverge from the rest of the UK in terms of an exit strategy from lockdown where the scientific evidence directed it. In what appeared to be an indirect criticism of the UK government\u2019s warning that discussing an exit strategy at this stage would confuse critical health guidance, she promised to treat the Scottish public \u201cas the grown-ups that you are\u201d, and share \u201cas much detail\u201d as she could on her plans for an eventual emergence from lockdown. In a video shared online shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has demanded \u201cclear answers\u201d from the government about why Boris Johnson missed five emergency meetings about the coronavirus crisis. He said \u201cThe public deserve clear answers as to why the Prime Minister skipped five vital Cobra meetings. \u201cWe knew in February how serious this virus was. Yet today our NHS and care staff (are) still lacking adequate PPE, testing is not at levels needed and hospitals (were) delivered wrong ventilators.\u201d This comes after The Sunday Times published an investigation claiming the Government was slow to order PPE and ignored scientists\u2019 warnings. On a slightly more cheery note these photographs show the seaside resort of Whitley Bay, Northumberland, where people on their daily walk have been adding pebbles to make large tower sculptures Defending the government\u2019s initial response to the coronavirus outbreak amid claims it missed chances to lessen impact during February and March, Michael Gove has admitted that \u201cprofound lessons\u201d would be learnt. During an interview on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show Gove confirmed the prime minister did not attend five Cobra meetings at start of coronavirus crisis. However, he added that PMs don\u2019t attend most of these meetings. \u201cHe didn\u2019t. But then he wouldn\u2019t.....because most Cobra meetings don\u2019t have the Prime Minister attending them,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cAll governments make mistakes, including our own. We seek to learn and to improve every day. \u201cIt is the case, I\u2019m sure, at some point in the future, that there will be an opportunity for us to look back, to reflect and to learn some profound lessons.\u201d In an earlier interview today Gove had declined to deny that Johnson missed five consecutive emergency meetings in the build-up to the coronavirus crisis. Pressed on a series of allegations about delays and failings as the virus started to spread from China, detailed in the Sunday Times, Gove said that some elements of the story were \u201cslightly off-beam\u201d, but repeatedly declined to say which. Farrar said he was \u201coptimistic\u201d about finding a vaccine for coronavirus with advances in science, but acknowledged \u201cthe truth is we don\u2019t have another vaccine for any other human coronavirus\u201d. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a given that we will make a vaccine. If we did have a vaccine, let\u2019s say late in 2020 or into 2021, we would then need to manufacture it in billions of doses and make those billions of doses available to the world. \u201cSo just having a vaccine that is safe and effective, proven, is not enough. If there is any country vulnerable, if there is any country where there is still transmission of this virus, then in fact every country is vulnerable. \u201cI hope we would have a vaccine towards the end of this year \u2013 but that\u2019s a vaccine in a vial, it\u2019s a vaccine that we believe to be safe, a vaccine we think might be effective. That\u2019s not having a vaccine for the world.\u201d Sir Jeremy Farrar, who is a member of the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), added that he thought that the UK was past the peak of the \u201cfirst wave\u201d of the virus. \u201cWe should not see this as a discrete episode. I think the probability of what we must be planning for is that there would be further waves of this in the future. \u201cBut for this first wave I think the number of new infections stabilised maybe a week or two ago, the number of hospitalisations maybe a week or so ago \u2026 we\u2019re probably just past the peak in many parts of this country, as is true in many parts of the world.\u201d But he cautioned: \u201cIf we were to release those lockdowns too soon whilst the infection rates are still high \u2026 then the epidemic would come back again, it would come back very quickly. \u201cIt would rebound within a few weeks or a couple of months.\u201d Expert warns that if lockdown is lifted too soon, the epidemic could return \u201cvery quickly\u201d Sarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology at Oxford University, who is leading a team to develop a coronavirus vaccine, said nobody can be sure that it is possible to find a workable vaccine. She told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show: \u201cThat\u2019s why we have to do trials to find out. The prospects are very good, but it is clearly not completely certain.\u201d Gilbert said her team has not immunised anyone yet, but they hope to start clinical trials towards the end of next week. \u201cWe are waiting for the final safety tests to be done on the vaccine and the final approvals to be given.\u201d In the meantime, permission has been given to recruit volunteers, take blood tests, explain the process and check their health status, she said. \u201cBy the time we have all the approvals for the vaccine ready, we should have a good pool of volunteers to draw from and we should be able to get going quite quickly.\u201d The Nato general leading the group\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak in Europe has conceded all key figures were caught \u201coff-guard\u201d by the coronavirus outbreak. Defending Nato\u2019s work in reaction to the virus, including co-ordinating the distribution of personal protective equipment (PPE) through various European countries, Lieutenant-General Olivier Rittiman said \u201cno one\u201d fully understood the depth of the crisis that lay ahead in the early days of the outbreak. \u201cI think that everybody was taken a little bit off-guard by this crisis,\u201d Lt Gen Rittiman, the commander of Nato\u2019s Europe Covid-19 taskforce, told Sky News\u2019 Sophy Ridge. Rittiman gave a guarded response to reports the United States had hijacked PPE in China that was meant to be shipped to Europe, saying nations had had to take \u201call appropriate measures to make the best choices\u201d in the early days of the outbreak. He added that when choices were made, \u201cyou are always able to be criticised afterwards\u201d. Earlier this month German media reported on allegations from the interior minister for Berlin state, Andreas Geisel, that 200,000 N95 masks destined for Europe were instead diverted to the US as they were being transferred between planes in Thailand. The government was warned of \u201ccritically low\u201d shortages of protective equipment, according to a health chief. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the British Medical Association council, said doctors are \u201cextremely worried\u201d that they are not adequately protected. Speaking to Sky News, he said: \u201cBut even more stressful now is that doctors and other healthcare workers are treating their own colleagues in intensive care on ventilators and tragically see some of them not survive. \u201cThis is extremely emotionally taxing and it\u2019s showing its toll on the healthcare workforce.\u201d He said the government was warned last weekend that there were \u201ccritically low shortages of full length gowns\u201d. He added: \u201cAt the beginning of the pandemic we were assured that we had sufficient stockpiles... and we believed that we were well catered for.\u201d \u201cWe then heard that the issues were about operational deliveries,\u201d he added, stating that deliveries had been the cause of lack of supplies to the front line. \u201cWe\u2019re not being given clear information,\u201d he said. The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, argued that Gove\u2019s defence that one or two aspects of the Sunday Times story were off beam is \u201cpossibly the weakest rebuttal of a detailed expose in British political history\u201d. Ashworth said the government would need to address \u201cserious questions\u201d about the claims that the prime minister skipped five Cobra meetings. He added: \u201cAnd we know that serious mistakes have been made, we know that our frontline NHS staff don\u2019t have the PPE, that they\u2019ve been told this weekend that they won\u2019t necessarily have the gowns which are vital to keep them safe. We know that our testing capacity is not at the level that is needed. \u201cWe know that the ventilators that many hospitals have received are the wrong types of ventilators and there are big questions as to whether we went into this lockdown too slowly, and now we hear the prime minister missed five meetings at the start of this outbreak. It suggests that early on he was missing in action.\u201d In his defence of the prime minister, Michael Gove said Johnson had been part of all the major decision-making. Describing the claims made in the Sunday Times as \u201cgrotesque\u201d he added: \u201cNobody can say that the prime minister wasn\u2019t throwing heart and soul into fighting this virus. His leadership has been clear. \u201cHe\u2019s been inspirational at times.\u201d There were mixed messages from government over PM\u2019s attendance at key meetings. The government missed a series of opportunities to lessen the impact of the coronavirus in February and March, it has been claimed. The claims came as the prime minister, who is recovering from coronavirus, was said to have been giving directions to ministers from the country retreat of Chequers, where he is recuperating. Reports in the Sunday Times that Johnson did not attend a raft of Cobra meetings, and that the government missed a series of opportunities to try and lessen the impact of the outbreak in February and March, drew a pointed response from Downing Street. A No 10 spokesman said: \u201cThe prime minister has been at the helm of the response to this, providing leadership during this hugely challenging period for the whole nation.\u201d The comments came as controversy continued to grow over the insufficient levels of personal protection equipment (PPE) for frontline NHS staff, and criticism that not enough people were being tested for the killer virus. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, accused the government of dragging its feet in dealing with the pandemic. Writing in the Mail on Sunday, Starmer said: The government was too slow to enter the lockdown. It has been too slow to increase the number of people being tested. It has been too slow in getting NHS staff the critical equipment they need to keep them safe. We need to make sure these mistakes are not repeated. Other countries have begun to set out a road map to lift restrictions in certain sectors of the economy and for certain services, especially social care, when the time is right. This of course must be done in a careful, considered way with public health, scientific evidence and the safety of workers and families at its heart. But the UK government should be doing likewise.\u201d Michael Gove has denied reports that the government has drawn up a three-stage plan on ending the coronavirus lockdown. During an interview with Sophy Ridge on Sky News, Gove said: \u201cWe should not be thinking of lifting these restrictions yet.\u201d Downing Street has previously rejected claims by Sir Keir Starmer that plans on how to scale back the coronavirus lockdown are in limbo amid the continued absence of Boris Johnson, insisting that proposals were being worked on. The new Labour leader raised the idea in an interview with the BBC, saying that with the prime minister still recovering from his serious bout of the virus at Chequers, his official country retreat, Dominic Raab, who is standing in, was wary of making decisions.

      "body": "<p>In the aftermath of the 2016 US presidential election, the American artist and writer Jenny Odell found herself drawn almost every day to a local public garden. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t exactly a conscious decision,\u201d she writes in her book How to Do Nothing. \u201cIt was more of an innate movement, like a deer going to a salt lick, or a goat going to the top of a hill.\u201d</p> <p>In the book, a treatise on slowing down amid a rapidly changing world and news cycle that felt increasingly chaotic and scary, she describes how just existing in a small patch of urban wilderness each day, and redirecting her attention to the birds and plants around her, became more than an escape \u2013 it became something akin to a survival tactic.</p> <p>\u201cIt turns out that groundedness requires actual <em>ground</em>,\u201d she writes.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been thinking about her words this week, as we head towards a second month of pandemic era self-isolation, spending more time than ever confined indoors, watching on as confusing, scary and uncertain events unfold across our devices.</p> <p>Like Odell, this period is giving me a whole new appreciation, even reverence, for whatever small patches of green or wide open spaces I can find.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/15/the-guardian-view-on-natures-return-humans-making-way\">The Guardian view on nature\u2019s return: humans making way | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Though almost all my time is spent in my house, every day I\u2019m seeking small, socially distanced and legally sanctioned moments outside: standing in the sun in my tiny, concreted inner-city courtyard among my pot plants, wandering under the grand paperbark trees lining my street to watch confused ibises loiter near empty bins or, best of all, walking or running through my local parks (always moving \u2013 since we are no longer allowed to just sit, even alone).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In parks there is still a degree of normalcy, tenderness even</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Exercising with your household or in pairs is the last form of allowable in-person socialising we have \u2013 so the park is the new pub for some of us. Chatting over beers is replaced by sessions sharing whatever crumbs of gossip still exist, while panting three metres apart to the sounds of the Nike Training app (god, I miss the pub). On the weekends, with more time, I have gravitated towards the coast \u2013 to walk along Sydney\u2019s dramatic cliffs, seeking a blast of wind to the face and a faraway ocean horizon to stare at.</p> <p>Parks feel like the last communal place we can encounter other people, strangers, in ways that don\u2019t feel stressful or threatening. Unlike the grocery store, where people eye each other off as they move hurriedly to the toilet paper aisle, in parks there is still a degree of normalcy, tenderness even. Provided paths aren\u2019t crowded, people can literally breathe deeply.</p> <p>One effect of this crisis has been to underscore the importance of public infrastructure we may have previously taken for granted. Where we once watched on as governments neglected or imperilled our robust social safety net and public healthcare system, we now better understand what is at stake. I would add accessible green space in our cities to that list.</p> <p> </p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t take it for granted any more,\u201d one Manhattan resident <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/nyregion/nyc-parks-coronavirus.html\">told the New York Times recently as he walked under trees in Central Park</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/15/australias-parks-tell-us-what-you-love-and-what-makes-you-despair-about-urban-green-space\">Australia's parks: tell us what you love and what makes you despair about urban green space</a> </p> </aside>  <p> I now feel so lucky to have a couple of parks within easy distance. But having a decent-sized, safe park, wilderness area or patch of coast close by is a luxury in many cities. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/10/coronavirus-park-closures-hit-bame-and-poor-londoners-most\">A recent Guardian report</a> found a third of all land in the wealthiest 10% of London wards was taken up by private gardens, while in the poorest 10%, just over a fifth was found to be taken up by garden space.</p> <p>Similarly, a <a href=\"https://www.planning.nsw.gov.au/-/media/Files/DPE/Reports/report-findings-greater-sydney-outdoors-study-2019-06-06.pdf\">study by the New South Wales government</a> last year found that residents of western Sydney reported they had less access to outdoor recreation space than those in other districts, and the majority spent on average 30 minutes driving just to get to such an area. The quality of your lockdown period is likely to vary pretty wildly depending on your access to such spaces for respite.</p> <p>Last week in Victoria, <a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/jogger-sent-home-as-confusion-over-lockdown-laws-leaves-victorians-in-breach-20200412-p54j66.html\">a woman who drove to a park to run was cautioned by police</a>.

      "bodyText": "In the aftermath of the 2016 US presidential election, the American artist and writer Jenny Odell found herself drawn almost every day to a local public garden. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t exactly a conscious decision,\u201d she writes in her book How to Do Nothing. \u201cIt was more of an innate movement, like a deer going to a salt lick, or a goat going to the top of a hill.\u201d In the book, a treatise on slowing down amid a rapidly changing world and news cycle that felt increasingly chaotic and scary, she describes how just existing in a small patch of urban wilderness each day, and redirecting her attention to the birds and plants around her, became more than an escape \u2013 it became something akin to a survival tactic. \u201cIt turns out that groundedness requires actual ground,\u201d she writes. I\u2019ve been thinking about her words this week, as we head towards a second month of pandemic era self-isolation, spending more time than ever confined indoors, watching on as confusing, scary and uncertain events unfold across our devices. Like Odell, this period is giving me a whole new appreciation, even reverence, for whatever small patches of green or wide open spaces I can find. Though almost all my time is spent in my house, every day I\u2019m seeking small, socially distanced and legally sanctioned moments outside: standing in the sun in my tiny, concreted inner-city courtyard among my pot plants, wandering under the grand paperbark trees lining my street to watch confused ibises loiter near empty bins or, best of all, walking or running through my local parks (always moving \u2013 since we are no longer allowed to just sit, even alone). Exercising with your household or in pairs is the last form of allowable in-person socialising we have \u2013 so the park is the new pub for some of us. Chatting over beers is replaced by sessions sharing whatever crumbs of gossip still exist, while panting three metres apart to the sounds of the Nike Training app (god, I miss the pub). On the weekends, with more time, I have gravitated towards the coast \u2013 to walk along Sydney\u2019s dramatic cliffs, seeking a blast of wind to the face and a faraway ocean horizon to stare at. Parks feel like the last communal place we can encounter other people, strangers, in ways that don\u2019t feel stressful or threatening. Unlike the grocery store, where people eye each other off as they move hurriedly to the toilet paper aisle, in parks there is still a degree of normalcy, tenderness even. Provided paths aren\u2019t crowded, people can literally breathe deeply. One effect of this crisis has been to underscore the importance of public infrastructure we may have previously taken for granted. Where we once watched on as governments neglected or imperilled our robust social safety net and public healthcare system, we now better understand what is at stake. I would add accessible green space in our cities to that list. \u201cWe don\u2019t take it for granted any more,\u201d one Manhattan resident told the New York Times recently as he walked under trees in Central Park. I now feel so lucky to have a couple of parks within easy distance. But having a decent-sized, safe park, wilderness area or patch of coast close by is a luxury in many cities. A recent Guardian report found a third of all land in the wealthiest 10% of London wards was taken up by private gardens, while in the poorest 10%, just over a fifth was found to be taken up by garden space. Similarly, a study by the New South Wales government last year found that residents of western Sydney reported they had less access to outdoor recreation space than those in other districts, and the majority spent on average 30 minutes driving just to get to such an area. The quality of your lockdown period is likely to vary pretty wildly depending on your access to such spaces for respite. Last week in Victoria, a woman who drove to a park to run was cautioned by police. Like with most of the new laws ruling our lives, there\u2019s significant confusion over whether driving to a park to exercise is allowed \u2013 the state\u2019s chief medical officer has said it\u2019s OK if there is nowhere closer to home, but premier Daniel Andrews has discouraged it. I understand the critical importance of the lockdown at the moment, but given their unequal distribution, some leeway here to allow people access to parks is a worthwhile goal. Parks have always served an important public health function in cities \u2013 giving us space to exercise and be out in the sun, nurturing our physical and mental health. These functions are all the more critical now. City of Sydney councillor Jess Miller suggested last week state governments consider opening locked-up green spaces \u2013 such as racing tracks and golf courses \u2013 for socially distanced exercise in congested urban areas. In some foreign cities, streets are being closed to traffic to allow more space for walking. We should think carefully now about how we can improve everyone\u2019s access to nature, both during this period and beyond it. Moments in nature, as Odell chronicled in her book, also offer us space to refocus our attention in a time of anxiety. Once she started noticing birds in the public garden, she writes, she started seeing them everywhere. \u201cI remember specifically feeling comforted by the presence of these strange birds [a pair of night herons], like I could look up from the horrifying maelstrom of that day\u2019s Twitter and they\u2019d probably be there, unmoving.\u201d It\u2019s not just the exercise and sunshine and gossip my own moments outside are providing right now. It\u2019s not just a literally different perspective than the confines of my house. Sandstone and shale cliffs formed in the Triassic period, grand trees planted long before I was born, and the flocks of cockatoos that scream overhead unawares as I strain for one more sit-up \u2013 all offer a bit of much-needed perspective on a crisis that will, eventually, pass.",

      "body": "<p>The government is facing increasingly rigorous scrutiny of its actions in several areas over its preparations for and response to coronavirus. Here are the main areas of criticism:</p> <h2>Death rates</h2> <p>The most obvious and tragic crisis of all. The UK has now recorded more than 16,000 coronavirus-related deaths in hospitals, and thousands more are believed to have occurred in care homes and elsewhere. This puts the UK on an apparent course to match the very high death rate of places like Italy. The government is, however, urging caution over direct comparisons given the different ways in which statistics are collected across nations, time lags in terms of the outbreak, and demographic differences. At Sunday\u2019s Downing Street briefing, the deputy chief medical officer for England, Jenny Harries, said a meaningful comparison might not be possible until some months after the pandemic had eased.</p> <h2>Testing</h2> <p>The UK remains very low down the international league table for the proportion of the national population tested for the virus, a measure seen as crucial to tracking its spread and thus laying the ground for a gradual end to the lockdown. The government has already missed its target of 25,000 tests a day by mid-April, and remains some way short of its end-of-April goal of 100,000 a day; 21,626 were carried out on Saturday. There is also no sign of the promised millions of simpler antibody tests, as their accuracy remains dubious, even though the government bought 3.5m of one type.</p> <h2>Personal protective equipment (PPE)</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/how-close-is-the-nhs-to-getting-the-18000-ventilators-it-needs-coronavirus\">How close is the NHS to getting the 18,000 ventilators it needs?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This has proved of the most regularly difficult tasks for the government \u2013 getting enough PPE to not just hospitals, but also care homes and other settings like prisons and local authorities. On Friday, it emerged that guidance had changed to say NHS staff should use smaller, less effective aprons if, as seemed imminent, stocks of full gowns ran out \u2013 troubling news for hospital workers amid growing numbers of staff deaths.</p> <p>A consignment of gowns was due to arrive as part of a shipment of PPE from Turkey on Sunday, but has been delayed. Ministers have pointedly declined to guarantee supplies as needed, saying the situation is very challenging given the massive global demand for supplies. In the meantime, staff have to decide whether to agree to work without proper protection.</p> <h2>Ventilators</h2> <p>On the one hand, despite initial fears, there has not yet been a massive shortage of the complex machines used to help people breathe as their lungs recover from the virus, but even after the UK\u2019s target to secure 30,000 was downgraded to 18,000, that figure has still not been met. However, there has been political fallout over the apparent confusion about a plan to get private companies to design and build new models. A <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5f393d77-8e5b-4a85-b647-416efbc575ec\">Financial Times story</a> talked of companies being confused as to the brief, and of little progress being made. On Sunday the UK <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/response-to-ft-article-and-twitter-thread-by-peter-foster\">government published a</a> highly unusual rebuttal of these claims.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2>Hospital capacity</h2> <p>As with ventilators, while there was initial panic at the idea of critical care beds being quickly overwhelmed, this has not been the case. The temporary acquisition of private spaces and the rapid construction of new sites has seen the number of these beds rise from about 4,100 in February to more than 5,500 now, with the occupancy rate falling from 81% to 58%. However, the overall numbers remain below what was pledged.</p> <h2>Political leadership</h2> <p>This might be the big one in terms of future focus. While Boris Johnson\u2019s long absence due to coronavirus is bad luck, the news that he missed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/michael-gove-fails-to-deny-pm-missed-five-coronavirus-cobra-meetings\">five meetings of the government\u2019s emergency committee</a> while taking a break from No 10 when the virus was first emerging in the UK has prompted condemnation. His ministers insist that Johnson remained in charge.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The government is facing increasingly rigorous scrutiny of its actions in several areas over its preparations for and response to coronavirus. Here are the main areas of criticism: Death rates The most obvious and tragic crisis of all. The UK has now recorded more than 16,000 coronavirus-related deaths in hospitals, and thousands more are believed to have occurred in care homes and elsewhere. This puts the UK on an apparent course to match the very high death rate of places like Italy. The government is, however, urging caution over direct comparisons given the different ways in which statistics are collected across nations, time lags in terms of the outbreak, and demographic differences. At Sunday\u2019s Downing Street briefing, the deputy chief medical officer for England, Jenny Harries, said a meaningful comparison might not be possible until some months after the pandemic had eased. Testing The UK remains very low down the international league table for the proportion of the national population tested for the virus, a measure seen as crucial to tracking its spread and thus laying the ground for a gradual end to the lockdown. The government has already missed its target of 25,000 tests a day by mid-April, and remains some way short of its end-of-April goal of 100,000 a day; 21,626 were carried out on Saturday. There is also no sign of the promised millions of simpler antibody tests, as their accuracy remains dubious, even though the government bought 3.5m of one type. Personal protective equipment (PPE) This has proved of the most regularly difficult tasks for the government \u2013 getting enough PPE to not just hospitals, but also care homes and other settings like prisons and local authorities. On Friday, it emerged that guidance had changed to say NHS staff should use smaller, less effective aprons if, as seemed imminent, stocks of full gowns ran out \u2013 troubling news for hospital workers amid growing numbers of staff deaths. A consignment of gowns was due to arrive as part of a shipment of PPE from Turkey on Sunday, but has been delayed. Ministers have pointedly declined to guarantee supplies as needed, saying the situation is very challenging given the massive global demand for supplies. In the meantime, staff have to decide whether to agree to work without proper protection. Ventilators On the one hand, despite initial fears, there has not yet been a massive shortage of the complex machines used to help people breathe as their lungs recover from the virus, but even after the UK\u2019s target to secure 30,000 was downgraded to 18,000, that figure has still not been met. However, there has been political fallout over the apparent confusion about a plan to get private companies to design and build new models. A Financial Times story talked of companies being confused as to the brief, and of little progress being made. On Sunday the UK government published a highly unusual rebuttal of these claims. Hospital capacity As with ventilators, while there was initial panic at the idea of critical care beds being quickly overwhelmed, this has not been the case. The temporary acquisition of private spaces and the rapid construction of new sites has seen the number of these beds rise from about 4,100 in February to more than 5,500 now, with the occupancy rate falling from 81% to 58%. However, the overall numbers remain below what was pledged. Political leadership This might be the big one in terms of future focus. While Boris Johnson\u2019s long absence due to coronavirus is bad luck, the news that he missed five meetings of the government\u2019s emergency committee while taking a break from No 10 when the virus was first emerging in the UK has prompted condemnation. His ministers insist that Johnson remained in charge.",

It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers \u2013 not the public.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>\u201cWearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,\u201d the WHO has stated.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>There is no robust scientific evidence \u2013 in the form of trials \u2013 that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.</p>\n    <p>Also underlying the WHO\u2019s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play, especially on crowded public transport as people return to work..</p>\n    <p><b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\">Sarah Boseley</a></b>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But after that shipment <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/vital-ppe-equipment-including-400000-gowns-en-route-to-uk-delayed-nhs-coronavirus\">was delayed without explanation</a>, hospital chiefs\u2019 frustrations boiled over. \u201cTens\u201d of trusts are now at risk of running out of gowns over the next few days unless fresh supplies can be found, a well-placed NHS source said.</p> \n<p>After previous examples of promises of shipments that either did not arrive or contained the wrong items, NHS Providers \u2013 the representative body for hospital trusts \u2013 wants ministers including the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to stop talking about expected deliveries in public and only announce them once they have arrived. </p> \n<p>Shipments trailed in advance that do not arrive increase anxiety among frontline staff and make it harder for hospitals to plan how best to keep their doctors and nurses from getting infected, bosses said.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have, over the last 24 hours, seen an unhelpful focus on one individual consignment coming from Turkey. We are told that this consignment is still stuck in Turkey with no certainty, at the time this comment was issued, on how many gowns, if any, will leave for the UK, [and] when,\u201d said Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers.</p> \n<p>\u201cGiven the current uncertainties over gown manufacture and supply, due to global shortages, we suggest that any future announcements on what gowns might be available for delivery, when, just focus on what we can be certain of.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cBitter experience in recent weeks has shown that promised consignments of gowns cannot be relied on until they come, are checked and found to contain the right kit,\u201d he added. \u201cFor example, a consignment of 200,000 gowns that arrived from China last week actually contained only 20,000 gowns. This follows previous instances of consignments of gowns being mislabelled and failing safety tests.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"87b2a06cee9f54f22ab968e9ae94f6e841a05ac7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/87b2a06cee9f54f22ab968e9ae94f6e841a05ac7/0_79_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Unloading plane\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A consignment of PPE from Turkey is unloaded at RAF Brize Norton on 10 April</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ministry of Defence/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Trust leaders privately admit that they are desperate to acquire more full-length waterproof surgical gowns. Hospitals have expressed gratitude to local vets, fire brigades, police forces, councils, DIY shops and builders\u2019 merchants after being forced to ask them to hand over their stocks of gowns.

      "bodyText": "Hospital leaders have directly attacked the government for the first time during the coronavirus crisis over the shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) after a desperately needed consignment of surgical gowns that had been announced by ministers failed to arrive. In an unprecedented intervention, which hospital leaders privately say is the result of \u201cintense frustration and exasperation\u201d, the organisations representing NHS trusts in England urged ministers to \u201cjust focus on what we can be certain of\u201d after weeks of \u201cbitter experience\u201d with failed deliveries. The NHS Confederation and NHS Providers spoke out amid continuing alarm that shortages of equipment will soon have disastrous effects on the frontline, with representatives of intensive care staff warning on Sunday that the critical shortage of PPE could lead to some people refusing to continue working there. After the Guardian revealed on Friday that doctors and nurses had been asked to work without protective full-length coverings and to instead resort to aprons, cabinet minister Robert Jenrick promised that 84 tonnes of PPE, including 400,000 much needed surgical gowns, would arrive from Turkey on Sunday. But after that shipment was delayed without explanation, hospital chiefs\u2019 frustrations boiled over. \u201cTens\u201d of trusts are now at risk of running out of gowns over the next few days unless fresh supplies can be found, a well-placed NHS source said. After previous examples of promises of shipments that either did not arrive or contained the wrong items, NHS Providers \u2013 the representative body for hospital trusts \u2013 wants ministers including the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to stop talking about expected deliveries in public and only announce them once they have arrived. Shipments trailed in advance that do not arrive increase anxiety among frontline staff and make it harder for hospitals to plan how best to keep their doctors and nurses from getting infected, bosses said. \u201cWe have, over the last 24 hours, seen an unhelpful focus on one individual consignment coming from Turkey. We are told that this consignment is still stuck in Turkey with no certainty, at the time this comment was issued, on how many gowns, if any, will leave for the UK, [and] when,\u201d said Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers. \u201cGiven the current uncertainties over gown manufacture and supply, due to global shortages, we suggest that any future announcements on what gowns might be available for delivery, when, just focus on what we can be certain of.\u201d \u201cBitter experience in recent weeks has shown that promised consignments of gowns cannot be relied on until they come, are checked and found to contain the right kit,\u201d he added. \u201cFor example, a consignment of 200,000 gowns that arrived from China last week actually contained only 20,000 gowns. This follows previous instances of consignments of gowns being mislabelled and failing safety tests.\u201d Trust leaders privately admit that they are desperate to acquire more full-length waterproof surgical gowns. Hospitals have expressed gratitude to local vets, fire brigades, police forces, councils, DIY shops and builders\u2019 merchants after being forced to ask them to hand over their stocks of gowns. One received 2,000 from a nearby veterinary supply firm. On Friday Hancock told MPs on the Commons health and social care select committee that 55,000 more gowns were due that day. They arrived as expected and were distributed to hospitals over the weekend. However, NHS officials pointed out that, with hospital staff in England using 150,000 gowns a day, they constituted barely eight hours\u2019 supply. London hospitals are getting through 30,000 to 40,000 a day and major teaching hospital trusts, such as Addenbrooke\u2019s in Cambridge and University Hospitals Birmingham need to use 3,000 to 4,000 each day, such is the demand caused by the pandemic.

It will not be restored until we have a stable supply chain and certainty that staff will be given what they need when they need it. At the moment we are a long way from that point.\u201d As the number of NHS staff who have died from coronavirus rose to 77, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, leader of the British Medical Association, said: \u201cThis really is a matter of life and death.

You can take a single fact, wrench it out of context, whip it up in order to create a <em>j\u2019accuse</em> narrative. But that is not fair reporting.\u201d</p> \n<p>Addressing the daily No 10 press conference later, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, reiterated this point, insisting that Johnson had, throughout, \u201cbeen leading our nation\u2019s effort to combat the coronavirus\u201d.</p> \n<p>While it is correct that the Cobra meetings are often chaired by others, in times of national crisis prime ministers have generally been ever present.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s government has come under pressure to defend its handling of the coronavirus pandemic after Michael Gove was forced to admit that the prime minister had missed five key emergency meetings when the crisis first hit. With ministers warning that shortages of protective medical gear could continue, test rates remaining stubbornly low and the hospital death toll rising on Sunday to 16,060, some Conservative MPs have expressed private concern that Downing Street does not have a strong grip on the crisis. Johnson\u2019s role in the decision-making over crucial weeks before the UK-wide lockdown now risks becoming a symbol of that perceived inattention, with Labour saying the prime minister appeared to have been \u201cmissing in action\u201d at the time. His de facto deputy, Gove, sent out on a broadcast round, initially refused to comment on a report in the Sunday Times \u2013 which also claims that 279,000 of the UK\u2019s shrinking PPE stockpile was sent to China \u2013 saying Johnson had missed five meetings of the government\u2019s Cobra emergency committee in late January and February while he was taking a break at a government country retreat. \u201cI won\u2019t go through, here, a point-by-point rebuttal of all the things in the Sunday Times story that are a little bit off beam,\u201d Gove told Sky News. But about 90 minutes later, he told the BBC that Johnson had, indeed, missed all five meetings, saying instead that this was normal. \u201cMost Cobra meetings don\u2019t have the prime minister attending them,\u201d said Gove, whose cabinet title is chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster. \u201cThat is the whole point.\u201d Cobra meetings were \u201cled by the relevant secretary of state in the relevant area\u201d, he argued. \u201cThe prime minister is aware of all of these decisions and takes some of those decisions. You can take a single fact, wrench it out of context, whip it up in order to create a j\u2019accuse narrative. But that is not fair reporting.\u201d Addressing the daily No 10 press conference later, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, reiterated this point, insisting that Johnson had, throughout, \u201cbeen leading our nation\u2019s effort to combat the coronavirus\u201d. While it is correct that the Cobra meetings are often chaired by others, in times of national crisis prime ministers have generally been ever present. Gordon Brown\u2019s former press secretary Damian McBride tweeted that Brown, when PM, had chaired every Cobra meeting during the 2007 foot-and-mouth outbreak. The sense of the government being forced on to the defensive was reinforced by two hugely detailed rebuttals it published on Sunday. One said the Sunday Times article contained \u201ca series of falsehoods and errors\u201d, while another condemned a Financial Times story about supposed confusion in efforts to source privately designed ventilators. The acknowledgement of Johnson\u2019s absences, some of which took place during a 12-day period in February during which he retreated into privacy at the government\u2019s Chevening country estate in Kent, risks reinforcing a sense of official drift, with the PM still absent as he recovers from coronavirus. Conservative MPs are barred from speaking to the media about the pandemic without No 10 clearance, but some are known to be worried about the apparent lack of preparation, the continued significant daily rises in deaths, and the lack of a publicly discussed exit strategy from lockdown. The latest daily deaths figure from the virus in hospitals announced on Sunday was 596, well down on the previous day\u2019s 888. However, Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer speaking alongside Williamson at the press conference, said this could be in part due to lower reporting rates over the weekend. Asked to predict whether the UK might have passed the peak of the crisis, she declined to \u201cjump to all sorts of positive conclusions\u201d, but said the data connected to hospital admissions looked as if it was \u201cstarting to plateau\u201d. With the number of hospital victims virus now above 16,000, the country is on a similar trajectory to Italy, according to a government-produced chart estimating total deaths including those outside hospital settings. Harries warned against comparisons with other European countries such as Germany, which has seen just over 4,500 deaths, saying the countries were \u201cat different phases of the pandemic\u201d, while differences in areas such as data and demographics made the area even more complex. She also defended official preparations for the virus, saying: \u201cWe had and we still have a very clear plan \u2013 we had a containment phase and it was very successful.\u201d Ministers spent much of the day trying to quash reports about possible ways the economy and society could gradually emerge from lockdown once the number of Covid-19 cases begins to drop. Gove rejected reports of a supposed \u201ctraffic light\u201d phased return to normality over May and June, starting with schools, nurseries and more shops beginning to open, then moving on to smaller companies, restaurants and then other venues, with distancing measures in place. This was not the plan, Gove told Sky: \u201cIt is the case that we are looking at all of the evidence, but we\u2019ve set some tests which need to be passed before we can think of easing restrictions in this lockdown.\u201d Williamson reiterated the point at the press conference, declining to give a date as to when pupils might return to school. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, told the Ridge show that Gove had given \u201cpossibly the weakest rebuttal of a detailed expos\u00e9 in British political history\u201d. There were, he added, \u201cserious questions as to why the prime minister skipped five Cobra meetings throughout February, when the whole world could see how serious this was becoming\u201d. In this context, he added, the knowledge Johnson had missed key meetings \u201csuggests that early on he was missing in action\u201d. Johnson remains at his official country retreat of Chequers. Gove said the PM was \u201cin cheerful spirits\u201d and had talked on Friday to Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, who is standing in for him.",

      "body": "<p>At the exact moment the International Tennis Federation announced the immediate cancellation of all events in March, Panna Udvardy was deep in battle, breaking serve at a lowly ITF World Tennis Tour event in Ol\u00edmpia, Brazil. While the sport\u2019s commentariat descended into a collective state of shock, Udvardy was pumping her fist and peering towards her coach. She quickly realised he was not staring back.</p> <p>\u201cI looked at my coach and he was talking to the supervisor. I was like: \u2018Come on, why are you talking to him? Watch the match!\u2019 And then I won, I played like three hours, I came off court. My coach told me that at 3-1 the supervisor had talked to him and cancelled the tournament.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A lot of players are waking up and saying, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m gonna stop. I\u2019m already minus and I don\u2019t think I can make it'</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What happened next was a reflection of tennis\u2019s great weakness. Udvardy, a 21-year-old Hungarian ranked 347 by the WTA, had spent thousands of dollars to fly herself and her coach to Ol\u00edmpia with the goal of minimising costs by entering a series of tournaments in Brazil. While hundreds of players at Indian Wells, the fifth biggest tournament in the world, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/09/indian-wells-tennis-tournament-cancelled-as-coronavirus-fears-spread\" title=\"\">were offered first-round prize money</a> to cover costs after its cancellation, she was forced to immediately purchase two tickets out of Brazil that she could not afford.</p> <p>The faulty financial model of tennis has long been problematic as prize money has disproportionately risen at the top over the past decades, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/19/coronavirus-live-news-europe-deaths-approach-100000-as-us-looks-to-lift-restrictions\" title=\"\">the coronavirus pandemic</a> is a transformative moment that requires a sweeping response. Tennis players are private contractors who earn money only when they compete, or if they are lucky enough to encounter sponsorships. Now they earn nothing.</p> <p>For Udvardy, the $4,000 (\u00a33,150) she made before taxes in the first three months of this year was supplemented with sporadic coaching and small sponsorships from helpful companies. Those companies are now at risk and social distancing regulations forbid her from coaching.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83aedb75d41d8b8e66b9917e8a2470cd2ed062df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83aedb75d41d8b8e66b9917e8a2470cd2ed062df/0_0_4255_2553/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Panna Udvardy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Panna Udvardy\u2019s strategy for earning a living from tennis took a major dent when the coronavirus crisis hit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Panther Media GmbH/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m going to do if it\u2019s going to be much longer,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I can do anything else. I can\u2019t even go away and give lessons. It\u2019s just really hard. I think everyone is in the same situation as I am and we all need help from the ITF and WTA.\u201d</p> <p>In the same breath, she is quick to point out that her situation is better than most. She has received some assistance from the Hungarian federation and she is young \u2013 her desperation to fulfil her potential means that, no matter where she is financially whenever normality resumes, she will return to the foot of the mountain to climb again if she must. Instead, she is more concerned about those who may be pushed out of the sport for good.</p> <p>Udvardy is not alone in her reservations. \u201cI know a lot of players who are waking up and saying: \u2018Hey, I\u2019m gonna stop. I\u2019m already minus [in debt] and I don\u2019t think I can make it,\u2019\u201d says Valentini Grammatikopoulou of Greece. \u201cWhen I was [ranked] 400, four years ago, I was winning \u20ac1,000 and then travelling with this money to go to another tournament, even not thinking of going back home. That was the circle, that\u2019s how you build and get out of these small tournaments. People will now have nothing and they cannot even go to the tournaments.\u201d</p> <p>Although Greece possesses more top-20 players than Great Britain and France combined, Grammatikopoulou, ranked 297, has not received a penny of support. Greece\u2019s national federation is insignificant and she does not qualify for government financial help. For the first time in a decade she has returned to her small hometown of Axioupoli for more than just a couple of weeks. Her father sells curtains and pillows in the local market and the family is living off his government furlough.</p> <p>By all indications, tennis\u2019s stakeholders are finally appropriately recognising their forgotten classes. After hours of discussions with his fellow members Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, the ATP player council president, Novak Djokovic, last week sent an email to players detailing his proposed relief fund for those ranked between 250 and 700.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/18/once-tennis-is-done-ill-be-just-fine-murray-and-djokovic-ponder-future\">'Once tennis is done, I\u2019ll be just fine': Murray and Djokovic ponder future</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The fund would include a sliding scale of contributions from top-100 players based on ranking groups, ranging from $30,000 contributed by top-five players to $5,000 by those ranked between 50 and 100.

      "bodyText": "At the exact moment the International Tennis Federation announced the immediate cancellation of all events in March, Panna Udvardy was deep in battle, breaking serve at a lowly ITF World Tennis Tour event in Ol\u00edmpia, Brazil. While the sport\u2019s commentariat descended into a collective state of shock, Udvardy was pumping her fist and peering towards her coach. She quickly realised he was not staring back. \u201cI looked at my coach and he was talking to the supervisor. I was like: \u2018Come on, why are you talking to him? Watch the match!\u2019 And then I won, I played like three hours, I came off court. My coach told me that at 3-1 the supervisor had talked to him and cancelled the tournament.\u201d What happened next was a reflection of tennis\u2019s great weakness. Udvardy, a 21-year-old Hungarian ranked 347 by the WTA, had spent thousands of dollars to fly herself and her coach to Ol\u00edmpia with the goal of minimising costs by entering a series of tournaments in Brazil. While hundreds of players at Indian Wells, the fifth biggest tournament in the world, were offered first-round prize money to cover costs after its cancellation, she was forced to immediately purchase two tickets out of Brazil that she could not afford. The faulty financial model of tennis has long been problematic as prize money has disproportionately risen at the top over the past decades, but the coronavirus pandemic is a transformative moment that requires a sweeping response. Tennis players are private contractors who earn money only when they compete, or if they are lucky enough to encounter sponsorships. Now they earn nothing. For Udvardy, the $4,000 (\u00a33,150) she made before taxes in the first three months of this year was supplemented with sporadic coaching and small sponsorships from helpful companies. Those companies are now at risk and social distancing regulations forbid her from coaching. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m going to do if it\u2019s going to be much longer,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I can do anything else. I can\u2019t even go away and give lessons. It\u2019s just really hard. I think everyone is in the same situation as I am and we all need help from the ITF and WTA.\u201d In the same breath, she is quick to point out that her situation is better than most. She has received some assistance from the Hungarian federation and she is young \u2013 her desperation to fulfil her potential means that, no matter where she is financially whenever normality resumes, she will return to the foot of the mountain to climb again if she must. Instead, she is more concerned about those who may be pushed out of the sport for good. Udvardy is not alone in her reservations. \u201cI know a lot of players who are waking up and saying: \u2018Hey, I\u2019m gonna stop. I\u2019m already minus [in debt] and I don\u2019t think I can make it,\u2019\u201d says Valentini Grammatikopoulou of Greece. \u201cWhen I was [ranked] 400, four years ago, I was winning \u20ac1,000 and then travelling with this money to go to another tournament, even not thinking of going back home. That was the circle, that\u2019s how you build and get out of these small tournaments. People will now have nothing and they cannot even go to the tournaments.\u201d Although Greece possesses more top-20 players than Great Britain and France combined, Grammatikopoulou, ranked 297, has not received a penny of support. Greece\u2019s national federation is insignificant and she does not qualify for government financial help. For the first time in a decade she has returned to her small hometown of Axioupoli for more than just a couple of weeks. Her father sells curtains and pillows in the local market and the family is living off his government furlough. By all indications, tennis\u2019s stakeholders are finally appropriately recognising their forgotten classes. After hours of discussions with his fellow members Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, the ATP player council president, Novak Djokovic, last week sent an email to players detailing his proposed relief fund for those ranked between 250 and 700. The fund would include a sliding scale of contributions from top-100 players based on ranking groups, ranging from $30,000 contributed by top-five players to $5,000 by those ranked between 50 and 100. Along with $500,000 contributions from grand slam tournaments and money sourced from future events, the hope is for a pot of between $4m and $4.5m, with $10k for each player. The WTA is said to be in similar discussions on behalf of its players. The proposal requires the votes of Djokovic\u2019s fellow players, some of whom may have qualms about contributing a far greater percentage of their earnings than the top players. Regardless, it represents an unprecedented period in the history of the sport, which was underlined by Djokovic\u2019s comments during his recent Instagram live chat with Stan Wawrinka. If the world No 1 has his way, this is a tipping point, an opportunity to change the lower levels of men\u2019s and women\u2019s tennis for ever. \u201cThese guys that are ranked 250 onwards, they are the ones that make the grassroots of tennis, that make the future of tennis and I feel we have to be united,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cWe have to support them. We have to show them that they are not forgotten, that we are there for them. But also I feel we have to send a message to the younger generations that are taking in consideration to be professional players, to show them that they can live out of tennis.\u201d",

And it is dangerous because it can inspire people to ignore things that actually can save their lives.</p> <p>\u201cIt is doubly frustrating to us governors because this is such a schizophrenia. The president is basically asking people, \u2018Please ignore Dr Fauci and Dr Birx [White House taskforce medical advisers], please ignore <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/03.16.20_coronavirus-guidance_8.5x11_315PM.pdf\">my own guidelines that I set forth</a>,\u2019 because those guidelines made very clear\u2026 that you cannot open up Michigan today, or Virginia, under those guidelines. You need to see a decline in the infections and fatalities. And that simply has not happened yet.\u201d</p> <p>Pence insisted in an interview aired on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday that the country had \u201csufficient capacity\u201d for any state to go to the phase one level.</p> <p>But Hogan and others said the issue was not as straightforward as Pence presented it.</p> <p>\u201cEvery governor in America has been pushing and fighting and clawing to get more tests, not only from the federal government, but from every private lab in America and from all across the world. It\u2019s not accurate to say there\u2019s plenty of testing out there, and the governors should just get it done.\u201d</p> <p>Hogan said he was sympathetic to the protesters. \u201cI\u2019m frustrated also,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful to encourage demonstrations. To encourage people to go protest the plan that you just made recommendations on, it just doesn\u2019t make any sense. We\u2019re sending completely conflicting messages out to the governors and to the people, as if we should ignore federal policy and federal recommendations.\u201d</p> <p>Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic governor of Michigan, where some of the earliest protests took place last week, once again strongly defended strict lockdown restrictions in her state, the 10th largest by population but third highest in the nation in terms of Covid-19 deaths.</p> <p>\u201cMy stay-home order is one of the nation\u2019s more conservative but the fact of the matter is it\u2019s working. We are seeing the curve start to flatten and that means we\u2019re saving lives,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201c[But] I can tell you, we could double or even triple the number of tests if we had the swabs and reagents. That\u2019s precisely why it would really be incredibly helpful if the federal government would use the Defense Production Act to start making these swabs and reagents, so we can improve testing.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",

And it is dangerous because it can inspire people to ignore things that actually can save their lives. \u201cIt is doubly frustrating to us governors because this is such a schizophrenia. The president is basically asking people, \u2018Please ignore Dr Fauci and Dr Birx [White House taskforce medical advisers], please ignore my own guidelines that I set forth,\u2019 because those guidelines made very clear\u2026 that you cannot open up Michigan today, or Virginia, under those guidelines. You need to see a decline in the infections and fatalities. And that simply has not happened yet.\u201d Pence insisted in an interview aired on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday that the country had \u201csufficient capacity\u201d for any state to go to the phase one level. But Hogan and others said the issue was not as straightforward as Pence presented it. \u201cEvery governor in America has been pushing and fighting and clawing to get more tests, not only from the federal government, but from every private lab in America and from all across the world. It\u2019s not accurate to say there\u2019s plenty of testing out there, and the governors should just get it done.\u201d Hogan said he was sympathetic to the protesters. \u201cI\u2019m frustrated also,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful to encourage demonstrations. To encourage people to go protest the plan that you just made recommendations on, it just doesn\u2019t make any sense. We\u2019re sending completely conflicting messages out to the governors and to the people, as if we should ignore federal policy and federal recommendations.\u201d Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic governor of Michigan, where some of the earliest protests took place last week, once again strongly defended strict lockdown restrictions in her state, the 10th largest by population but third highest in the nation in terms of Covid-19 deaths. \u201cMy stay-home order is one of the nation\u2019s more conservative but the fact of the matter is it\u2019s working. We are seeing the curve start to flatten and that means we\u2019re saving lives,\u201d she said. \u201c[But] I can tell you, we could double or even triple the number of tests if we had the swabs and reagents. That\u2019s precisely why it would really be incredibly helpful if the federal government would use the Defense Production Act to start making these swabs and reagents, so we can improve testing.\u201d",

It will allow the partial reopening of hardware, electronic and office supply stores, and group prayer outdoors \u2013 for up to 19 people, standing two metres apart \u2013 and extend the perimeter for exercise to 500 metres from a person\u2019s home.</p> \n<p>Preschools, schools, hairdressers and shopping malls will remain closed, and people will continue having to wear a mask in public spaces, with fines for non-compliance.</p> \n<p>The country of 9 million has had 158 casualties and about 13,000 cases.

In Spain, with nearly 200,000 confirmed cases and more than 20,000 deaths, authorities said at the weekend they would hold off on lifting one of Europe\u2019s tightest lockdowns. \u201cWe have done the most difficult things and we have left the most extreme moments of the crisis behind with sacrifice and resilience, but these results are still not enough and still fragile,\u201d said the prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, in a televised address on Saturday evening. \u201cDespite the enormous progress that we have made, it is not possible for us to lift the confinement and move to a phase of scaling down [the restrictions].\u201d He said the restrictions would be loosened slightly to allow children time outside from 27 April. Spain\u2019s Covid-19 death toll rose by 410 on Sunday, the lowest daily increase since 22 March. French officials said on Sunday that although the virus appeared to be under control there, the country\u2019s strict lockdown would continue for at least another three weeks. \u201cIt is an epidemic unique in France in modern history and it is not finished,\u201d said the prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe. \u201cWe are making progress against this epidemic. The situation is improving slowly but surely \u2026 but we are not out of the health crisis. To think the epidemic is behind us would be an error.\u201d He added: \u201cOur lives after 11 May will not be exactly the same as before the lockdown. Not at once and probably not for a long time.\u201d More than 150,000 French people have tested positive for the virus and nearly 20,000 have died. Philippe said isolating positive cases, some degree of social distancing, an emphasis on washing hands, as well as \u201cmassive and quick testing\u201d of those showing symptoms of the virus and their contacts was likely to persist even if restrictions were eased in May. \u201cWe have to learn to live with the virus,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see the population is not immunised \u2013 it may be one day, but today it is not, the circulation of the virus has been restrained. Nor will we have a vaccine before 2021 \u2026 and at this stage there is no treatment that has been shown to work. That leaves us one instrument: prevention.\u201d President Emmanuel Macron announced last week that schools would begin to open from 11 May, but Philippe said on Sunday they would do so gradually. He said the government was considering various options, including having half a class in rotation, or opening schools in areas where there have been few or no Covid-19 cases before others. After a week of slowing infection rates in Israel, the government there announced on Sunday it was easing the stringent quarantine measures in place for the past five weeks. It will allow the partial reopening of hardware, electronic and office supply stores, and group prayer outdoors \u2013 for up to 19 people, standing two metres apart \u2013 and extend the perimeter for exercise to 500 metres from a person\u2019s home. Preschools, schools, hairdressers and shopping malls will remain closed, and people will continue having to wear a mask in public spaces, with fines for non-compliance. The country of 9 million has had 158 casualties and about 13,000 cases. The relaxed measures will be trialled for a fortnight and tougher restrictions reinstated if the infection rate grows again. Maharashtra, India\u2019s worst-hit state with more than 3,600 confirmed cases among its population of 114 million, said some activity would be permitted in its least-affected areas while maintaining a strict lockdown in zones that have the most infections. South Korea reported only eight new coronavirus cases on Sunday and said it would loosen some of its social distancing restrictions. The prime minister, Chung Sye-kyun, said the government would consider opening public outdoor facilities and would relax guidelines on the circumstances in which sports facilities and restaurants can open. Other measures that were due to expire on Sunday were extended until 5 May. South Korea has recorded 10,661 infections and 234 deaths. \u201cWe must not let down our guard until the last confirmed patient is recovered,\u201d the president, Moon Jae-in, said on Sunday. The UK, which is still in the middle of its outbreak, has said it is too soon to give dates on easing its lockdown. Pushbacks against lockdown measures continue elsewhere, including in Brazil. In Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo and the capital, Brasilia, people took to the streets calling for the resignation of politicians who had decided to implement strict controls. The president, Jair Bolsonaro, has been fiercely critical of the measures and on Thursday he fired his health minister, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, who had defended physical distancing. Agencies contributed to this report \u2022 This article was amended on 21 April 2020 to more accurately describe the measures in South Korea as \u201csocial distancing restrictions\u201d rather than \u201clockdown restrictions\u201d.",

Top stories People on lower incomes are twice as likely to lose their jobs due to coronavirus restrictions in Australia, according to new research. The Grattan Institute has warned higher earners are safer than lower earners, with restrictions impacting a range of service industries that mainly employ women and young people. Two more people died from Covid-19 on Sunday, including a 94-year-old man from the aged care facility in western Sydney that has recorded 39 cases. The health minister, Greg Hunt, said elective surgery and IVF could resume within days thanks to an increase in personal protective equipment equipment available to Australia\u2019s healthcare system. Covid-19 fatalities in Europe have now exceeded 100,000, though the rate of death in Spain is slowing. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, who is facing mounting criticism over his handling of the pandemic, missed five consecutive emergency meetings in the buildup to the coronavirus crisis. Now a vital shipment of protective medical equipment for the UK has been delayed on its way from Turkey. A group representing aged care homes in the UK has estimated 4,000 residents have died and are calling on the UK government to do more to protect vulnerable people. And a medical union wants NHS staff protected with legal immunity. Elsewhere in Europe, Portugal\u2019s government says its swift action on closures and restrictions has helped it avoid the worst of the crisis. Germany, Israel and South Korea are among the countries beginning to lift restrictions. A senior adviser to Scott Morrison has apologised for sending unauthorised copies of Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s memoir to 59 friends. On Sunday, lawyers for Turnbull and his publisher Hardie Grant said they believed unauthorised digital copies of the book had been widely distributed and sent a letter of complaint, which, according to Turnbull, resulted in a late Sunday acknowledgement. The book, officially published today, discusses the leadership spill that saw Turnbull lose the top job and has piqued intrigue in Canberra and beyond. You can read an extract of the chapter that covers Turnbull\u2019s relationship with the mercurial Donald Trump. Australia The federal government has ordered the ACCC to develop a mandatory code of conduct for digital giants, which would force Facebook and Google to share advertising revenue with Australian media companies. The code is a response to a digital platforms inquiry, and would require digital platforms to negotiate how to pay news media for the use of their content, among other requirements. Two people have been charged after police seized a yacht allegedly packed with drugs off the New South Wales coast. The two men face potential life sentences after being charged with importing a commercial quantity of drugs. The world A Canadian police officer was killed and another injured after a gunman went on a 12-hour shooting rampage in Nova Scotia leaving \u201cmultiple victims\u201d in his wake, police have said. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said the incident occurred in the small Atlantic coastal town of Portapique, about 130km north of the provincial capital Halifax. Donald Trump has warned that China should face consequences if it was \u201cknowingly responsible\u201d for the coronavirus pandemic. US cases have topped 730,000 and fatalities in the country approached 39,000. The Trump administration and Russia are blocking efforts to win binding UN security council backing for a global ceasefire to help fight the coronavirus pandemic. It has been almost one month since UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, called for an immediate end to fighting in all conflict areas. A prominent Chinese human rights lawyer has been prohibited from reuniting with his family after a 14-day quarantine period following his release from prison. Rights groups and his family fear authorities are using the coronavirus pandemic as a pretext to hold Wang Quanzhang indefinitely. Hackers are exploiting the thirst for content during coronavirus lockdowns, creating more than 700 fake streaming websites. Cybersecurity firm Mimecast has identified scam websites impersonating services such as Netflix and Disney+ that seek to harvest personal information from users.

Mosques and holy sites would be kept closed at least until 4 May, but he urged Iranians to pray at home. The holy month of Ramadan starts on 23 April.</p> \n  <p>Tehran was gridlocked with traffic on Saturday when office employees were asked to return to work. Public transport, seen as a major transmitter of the virus, is unable to cope with the passenger traffic, making government commitments to implement smart distancing largely ineffectual. Traffic into Tehran was up 70% from traffic on the same day last year, Tehran police chief Mohammad Reza Mehmandar said.</p> \n  <p>Rouhani acknowledged the dilemma, but said the solution was for councils to purchase more buses, or bring back into use those that had broken down. Crowds also gathered outside banks on Saturday to purchase a SIM card required to access a government grant of 1m Iranian toman ($23). Pictures of the crowds were emblazoned on Iranian newspapers with reporters questioning government policy. As many as 600,000 made unemployed due to the lockdown had registered for the government grant, but living standards of the middle class are also sliding. </p> \n  <p>Health ministry figures on Saturday showed the number of new deaths had fallen to a record low of 73. The number of new infections was 1,374, part of a steady downward trend. But Tehran\u2019s mayor pointed to an Iranian parliament report saying the official figures undercounted the number of deaths caused by the virus due to the lack of effective testing in hospitals. Opposition sources produce figures for deaths that are as high as 30,000, more than six times the official figures.

He\u2019s just told the next reporter that she is \u201cone of the most inaccurate reporters\u201d. This anger at the press is sadly so common at these press conferences. Trump is now getting a question about why he didn\u2019t warn Americans about the virus earlier. Trump responds by asking the reporter which network she is from (CBS). She follows up her question and he tells her to \u201crelax\u201d. He doesn\u2019t answer and goes to his stock answer that he put a ban on flights from China in the end of January. He\u2019s getting quite angry now. In a back and forth with the reporter, Trump tells her to \u201ckeep your voice down\u201d. Now he is shouting at her and telling her she should say to him \u201cthank you very much for (my) good judgement\u201d. Another female reporter is asking a question now. He talks over her and it\u2019s hard to hear her question. Trump is asked what advice he would give to the many protestors who are against the government\u2019s restrictions. \u201cYou\u2019re allowed to protest,\u201d he says, adding that \u201csome governors have gone too far\u201d. He says he watched footage of the protests and was happy they were all practicing social distancing, which is very much not true. You can follow our detailed coverage of the press conference on our US live blog. Trump is asked about Iran and if he would help them in the pandemic. Trump says he would be happy to consider it. \u201cThey have been hit very hard,\u201d he says. Trump has gone off script and appears to be in full stream-of-consciousness mode ... very much in the spirit of his campaign rallies. He says the coronavirus has taught the nation and important less about the \u201csupply chain\u201d and the need to not have to rely on other countries in times of crisis. He then spends a few minutes criticising trade policies with hard words for Nafta and the World Trade Organization. \u201cI want to read something I saw on television,\u201d he says, before reading his own tweet from 19 Feburary off a large printed page. Hello, this is Alison Rourke picking up our live coverage of coronavirus as Donald Trump gives his daily White House briefing. The president began the briefing by saying a deal with the Democrats is \u201cclose\u201d on the latest relief bill for small businesses and workers ... and could be resolved as soon as tomorrow. He says 4.18 million Americans have been tested for the coronavirus. \u201cThat\u2019s a record anywhere in the world,\u201d Trump says. \u201cMore total tests than all the following nations combined: France, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, India, Austria, Australia, Sweden and Canada.\u201d Trump says there is a \u201ctremendous capacity\u201d for testing before showing off a medical swab, likening it to a Q-tip. \u201cWe have ordered a lot of them,\u201d he said, but notes that some states \u201cdon\u2019t know where they are\u201d. Then a return to what\u2019s become a recurring motif over the past few days: \u201cWe are now the king of ventilators,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have so many ventilators.\u201d That\u2019s all from me for now - I\u2019m handing over to my colleague Alison Rourke to take you through the next few hours. Thanks for reading and writing in. Here\u2019s a quick summary of the latest: The global death toll has reached 164,938, according to Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. The total number of infections worldwide is at 2,394,291. Turkey\u2019s death toll has passed 2,000, with the announcement of 127 new deaths bringing the official death toll to 2,017. Poland recorded its biggest spike in coronavirus cases on Sunday with 545 new infections registered, a day before the country plans to ease some of its restrictions. Turkey\u2019s president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and US president Donald Trump have agreed on a phone call to cooperate in protecting healthcare and economies from the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic. The British government will charter flights to repatriate the most vulnerable Britons stranded in New Zealand this week. France has doubled its production of face masks from 4m to 8m a week and there are now enough for essential healthcare and frontline staff. Peru has reported over 15,000 cases of coronavirus, the second-highest tally in Latin America after Brazil. The country has reported a total of 15,628 cases and 400 deaths, according to the health ministry. US governors have accused Donald Trump of making \u201cdelusional\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d statements amid mounting tensions between the president and state leaders over coronavirus testing and pressure to roll back stay-at-home measures. Tunisia is extending its lockdown to 4 May, then it will ease restrictions gradually on some economic activities, prime minister Elyes Fakhfakh has said. Thousands of Israelis have demonstrated against prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu while maintaining social distancing measures, calling on Gantz\u2019s Blue and White party not to join in a coalition led by a premier charged with corruption. Lockdowns across Europe have had a dramatic impact on air traffic, with 90% fewer flights taking off from the continent\u2019s largest airports compared to a year ago Wearing face masks, waving black flags and keeping two yards apart, thousands of Israelis demonstrated against prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu under strict coronavirus restrictions on Sunday. Netanyahu, who denies any wrongdoing, is under criminal indictment in three corruption cases. He is also negotiating a power-sharing deal with his rival Benny Gantz to form a coalition government that would end a year of political deadlock after three inconclusive elections. Demonstrations are allowed under Israel\u2019s coronavirus restrictions, as long as participants maintain distance from each other and wear face masks. Under the banner of \u201cSave the Democracy,\u201d protesters called on Gantz\u2019s Blue and White party not to join in a coalition led by a premier charged with corruption. Ten Britons and a UK resident who had been stranded by the coronavirus lockdown in the Peruvian city of Cusco for more than a month have left Lima on a Lufthansa flight to Frankfurt after successfully being transferred from the Andean city to the capital. The group, which included UK citizens who had tested positive for Covid-19, were among more than 30 travellers who boarded the German Boeing-747 to Frankfurt on Sunday afternoon. Among the UK nationals Chris Ramsay, 29, an engineer from Salisbury, and Ian Lindsay, 68, a retired general practitioner living in Dublin, had both been diagnosed with Covid-19 but Peruvian authorities allowed them to leave as they had completed the quarantine and were no longer considered to be infectious. \u201cIt was a great relief,\u201d said Lindsay\u2019s sister, Patricia Pacheco, who had been travelling with him along with their partners. \u201cI honestly thought the Peruvian authorities would block it again.\u201d The group had been turned away from a military flight sent to transfer them to Lima for the last UK repatriation flight on Wednesday following health screening. The acting UK ambassador in Peru, Andrew Soper tweeted : \u201cPleased we were able to help another group of British travellers start their journey home today, including those who had been stranded in Cusco.\u201d \u201cThanks to our German partners for organising the flights. We will continue to do everything we can to support those UK nationals who remain in Peru.\u201d Other travellers who were on the flight to Frankfurt included citizens from Canada, Sweden, Norway, Austria, the Netherlands and Germany. Tunisia is extending its lockdown to 4 May, then it will ease restrictions gradually on some economic activities, prime minister Elyes Fakhfakh has said. The government has said it expected Tunisia\u2019s economy would shrink by up to 4.3%, the steepest drop since independence in 1956, because of the impacts of the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cThe situation is relatively under control, but more caution is required,\u201d Fakhfakh told state-run TV. He added that the pace of normal life will not return quickly even after 4 May. Tunisia\u2019s vital tourism sector could lose $1.4 billion and 400,000 jobs this year, an official letter sent to the IMF showed. The North African country has confirmed 866 cases of the coronavirus and 37 people have died, according to Reuters. US governors have accused Donald Trump of making \u201cdelusional\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d statements amid mounting tensions between the president and state leaders over coronavirus testing and pressure to roll back stay-at-home measures.

Get in touch with me on Twitter @cleaskopeliti. Peru has reported over 15,000 cases of coronavirus, the second-highest tally in Latin America after Brazil. Peru has reported a total of 15,628 cases and 400 deaths, the health ministry said. The crisis has paralysed Peru and left millions without jobs. Peru recorded its first coronavirus case on March 6 and took 25 days to reach 1,000 cases. It took only 14 more days to reach 10,000 cases on April 14, according to a Reuters tally. The British government will charter flights to repatriate the most vulnerable Britons stranded in New Zealand this week, with three flights from Auckland and two from Christchurch. People most at risk from of coronavirus will be prioritised for the flights, which will bring back over 1,500 people in total. This includes people over 70, those under 70 with an underlying serious or complex health condition and those who are pregnant. The first flight is expected to depart on Friday 24th April and flights will continue to run every second day, with alternating departures from Auckland and Christchurch. This follows the government having previously stated it would be unable to repatriate Britons in New Zealand due to the country\u2019s strict lockdown. After a phone call between Dominic Raab and the New Zealand\u2019s foreign minister Winston Peters at the end of March, the British high commissioner Laura Clarke had said there would be no \u201cimmediate fixes\u201d because New Zealand\u2019s strict lockdown and the closure of international flights made it almost impossible. \u201cThe New Zealand government\u2019s level-four Covid guidance is now absolutely clear in limiting domestic flights and transport to essential works only. That means if you are not close to your departure airport you are going to struggle to get on an international flight home,\u201d Clarke had said in a video statement on 30 March. Tickets for the charter flights will cost \u00a3800. Travellers able to prove financial hardship may be able to get an emergency loan from public funds. 2,600 Britons have already returned home via commercial means since the outbreak of the coronavirus, with some being quoted over \u00a340,000 for a ticket. In the UK, hospital leaders have directly attacked the government for the first time during the coronavirus crisis over the shortage of personal protective equipment after a desperately needed consignment of surgical gowns that had been announced by ministers failed to arrive, Denis Campbell reports. As Poland prepares to relax some restrictions, take a look at which other European countries are easing lockdown measures this week: Poland saw its biggest spike in coronavirus cases on Sunday with 545 new infections recorded, according to health ministry data, a day before the country plans to ease some of its restrictions. Reuters reports that the daily rise in new cases has held roughly steady in April after a jump in March, with a dip over Easter. Until Sunday, Poland had not reported more than 500 new cases in one day. As of Sunday, Poland had 9,287 confirmed cases and 360 deaths. The health ministry said it had carried out around 11,200 tests over the course of the last day. A spokesman for the health ministry told Polish state news agency PAP that the spike was associated with the discovery of three new coronavirus outbreaks across the country - two in care homes and the other in a hospital. Greeks haven\u2019t allowed the country\u2019s strict lockdown rules to ruin their Easter celebrations, enjoying traditional spit-roasted lamb and dancing despite being unable to visit their loved ones and home towns. As thousands of Greeks travel from Athens to their family homes for the Easter every year, the government was worried people would relax social distancing measures and banned unnecessary movement from Holy Saturday night to Easter Monday midnight, doubling the fines for offenders. Greeks stuck to the restrictions and spent the day with their close families and roasted lamb on verandas and balconies for the traditional Easter meal, Reuters reports. \u201cWe had ordered and sent lambs to Corfu in order to go and celebrate Easter with relatives, but coronavirus came along and we are stuck here,\u201d Vassilis Kourtelis, 62, told Reuters from his porch of his house in Athens while roasting lamb. \u201cBut we are not going to let it ruin our mood, (we are celebrating) here with the family, as if we were there with our relatives. We send them video calls, they see us as we sing and dance.\u201d Greece has a relatively low rate of infections, with 2,235 reported on Saturday, including 110 fatalities. \u201cWe have pushed aside the first waves with discipline and solidarity,\u201d prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said in his Easter address. \u201cStaying on the same course, we will soon be starting a gradually transition to a new era\u201d. Athens has said it would unwind its plan to ease the lockdown which ends 27 April after Easter but cautioned this will be a slow process. Here\u2019s a graphic that showing the confirmed number of deaths of a few selected countries: Sirens wailed and Jewish prayers were said for the heroes of the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto uprising, but the annual memorial observances were scaled down on Sunday and moved online owing to the coronavirus pandemic. The Associated Press reports that Poland\u2019s chief rabbi, Michael Schudrich, said prayers at the monument to the ghetto fighters in downtown Warsaw. The Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, and representatives of Jewish and Polish organisations laid wreaths while wearing face masks and maintaining social distancing. President Andrzej Duda and Warsaw\u2019s mayor, Rafal Trzaskowski, also sent wreaths. History lectures and virtual visits to ghetto sites were offered on the internet, mainly by the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews. Commemorative concerts were broadcast on Radio POLIN and on Poland\u2019s state radio. The museum\u2019s director, Zygmunt St\u0119pi\u0144ski, said that the coronavirus pandemic had \u201cforced us to change the formula\u201d of the commemorations on the 77th anniversary. Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and Donald Trump have agreed on a phone call to cooperate in protecting healthcare and economies from the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic. The two leaders \u201cagreed to continue their close cooperation against the threats that the coronavirus pandemic poses to public health and our economies\u201d, the Turkish presidency announced on Twitter. Turkey has announced 127 new deaths from the coronavirus, bringing the official death toll to 2,017. The health minister, Fahrettin Koca, shared an image showing there were 3,977 new cases of Covid-19 infection in the past 24 hours, bringing total reported infections to 86,306. Turkey is the worst affected country in the Middle East, ahead of Iran, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Turkish authorities have carried out nearly 635,000 tests while almost 12,000 people have recovered from the virus, the minister said. From the Guardian Paris correspondent Kim Willsher: France has doubled its production of masks from 4m to 8m a week and there are now sufficient for essential healthcare and frontline staff. The French prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, has said there are still not enough for everyone and asked people to be patient. Following Emmanuel Macron\u2019s announcement last week that nurseries, primary and secondary schools would begin to open on 11 May, Philippe said: \u201cOur aim is to find a good method and that method will be progressive. They will not open everywhere on 11 May ... but we have to start opening schools for the continuity of the nation that I evoked before.\u201d Philippe said the government was considering various options, including having half a class in rotation, or opening schools in areas where there have been few or no Covid-19 cases before others. More on the relaxation of Iran\u2019s lockdown from the Guardian\u2019s diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour: More shops and markets will be reopened across Iran in the coming fortnight, but mosques and holy places will remain shut at least through the opening part of Ramadan the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, said today following a meeting of his coronavirus taskforce. The step by step opening of the Iranian economy in the face of many Iranians desperately needing to return to work, comes despite a warning from the mayor of Tehran, Mohsen Hashemi, that the coronavirus crisis is spreading and the true number of deaths is far higher than official statistics show. Rouhani also said that furloughed political prisoners will not be required to return to prison for at least a another month, a ruling that would on the surface apply to the Iranian dual national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. Furloughed inmates had been due to return to prison at the end of April. Rouhani announced that stores and bazaars deemed as \u201cmedium and low-risk\u201d would be allowed to open until 6pm. Low-risk shops had been allowed to open in the provinces on 11 April, and in Tehran on Saturday. Restaurants will be allowed to provide take-aways. Schools, colleges and gyms would remain closed. Mosques and holy sites would be kept closed at least until 4 May, but he urged Iranians to pray at home. The holy month of Ramadan starts on 23 April. Tehran was gridlocked with traffic on Saturday when office employees were asked to return to work. Public transport, seen as a major transmitter of the virus, is unable to cope with the passenger traffic, making government commitments to implement smart distancing largely ineffectual. Traffic into Tehran was up 70% from traffic on the same day last year, Tehran police chief Mohammad Reza Mehmandar said. Rouhani acknowledged the dilemma, but said the solution was for councils to purchase more buses, or bring back into use those that had broken down. Crowds also gathered outside banks on Saturday to purchase a SIM card required to access a government grant of 1m Iranian toman ($23). Pictures of the crowds were emblazoned on Iranian newspapers with reporters questioning government policy. As many as 600,000 made unemployed due to the lockdown had registered for the government grant, but living standards of the middle class are also sliding. Health ministry figures on Saturday showed the number of new deaths had fallen to a record low of 73. The number of new infections was 1,374, part of a steady downward trend. But Tehran\u2019s mayor pointed to an Iranian parliament report saying the official figures undercounted the number of deaths caused by the virus due to the lack of effective testing in hospitals. Opposition sources produce figures for deaths that are as high as 30,000, more than six times the official figures. New reporting instructions have just been sent to the regions by the health ministry. Iran\u2019s own coronavirus headquarters\u2019 epidemiology group has warned that in the six provinces of Tehran, East Azerbaijan, Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad, Khuzestan, Gilan and Mazandaran, a new wave of epidemics seems to have begun. A reversal of the downward trend in the official infection figures would be a severe blow, and provide ammunition to charges that Iran\u2019s dire economic state is forcing the government to lift restrictions prematurely. Here\u2019s a summary of the key events over the last few hours: Europe\u2019s death toll has passed 100,000, excluding Russia. The global death toll has reached 162,070, while the total number of infections worldwide is at 2,356,475, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. Hospitalisations in New York continue to fall, with governor Andrew Cuomo announcing that the total number of Covid-19 hospitalisations is down to 16,213, marking the sixth consecutive day that number has dropped. Italy\u2019s infection curve appears to have begun to decline, as the number of fatalities from coronavirus rose by 433 on Sunday, 49 less than on Saturday, taking the death toll to 23,660. The number of people currently infected has risen by 486 in a day, representing a drop of 323 on Saturday. Hospitalisations have declined in France for the the fifth consecutive day, while the number of people in ICUs fell for the 11th consecutive day. Chile has passed 10,000 coronavirus cases, making it the third-highest tally in Latin America after Brazil and Peru. Pakistan has started repatriating citizens from the United Arab Emirates, which had threatened to review labour ties with countries refusing to take back their nationals during the pandemic. Zimbabwe has extended its lockdown by two weeks after the president said the country had not yet met conditions set by the WHO to lift the measures. The UK\u2019s death toll has risen to 16,060, the Department of Health and Social Care has said. The number represents those who have died in hospital after testing positive for coronavirus. The Netherlands has reported its smallest daily death toll in over three weeks, with the number of deaths rising by 83, the lowest daily increase since 26 March. Switzerland\u2019s coronavirus death toll has reached 1,135, rising from 1,111 on Saturday. New York governor Andrew Cuomo has announced that the total number of Covid-19 hospitalisations is down to 16,213, marking the sixth consecutive day that number has dropped. Speaking during his daily coronavirus briefing, Cuomo said: \u201cIf the data holds, we are past the high point and all indications ... at this point are that we are on a descent. Whether or not that descent continues depends on what we do.\u201d Follow the New York governor\u2019s briefing on the US liveblog: The number of fatalities from coronavirus in Italy rose by 433 on Sunday, 49 fewer than on Saturday, taking the total number of deaths to 23,660. The infection curve appears to have started its decline, with the number of people currently infected rising by 486 in a day, a drop of 323 since Saturday. Italy\u2019s civil protection authority said the number of intensive care beds in use continues to fall. To date, there have been 178,972 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Italy and 47,055 survivors. France\u2019s prime minister has said the country\u2019s coronavirus situation is improving \u201cslowly but surely\u201d, but that the health crisis is not over. The country\u2019s total death toll in hospitals and nursing homes has risen to 19,718, from 19,323 on Saturday. The number of people in hospitals with coronavirus is down to 30,610, from 30,639 on Saturday, marking the fifth consecutive day of decline, France\u2019s health authority announced. The number of people in ICU units has fallen from 5,833 on Saturday to 5,744 on Sunday - the country\u2019s 11th consecutive day of decline. Chile reported on Sunday that the number of coronavirus cases in the country had passed 10,000, the third-highest tally in Latin America after Brazil and Peru. Chile has registered 133 deaths, according to its health ministry. The country recorded its first coronavirus case on 3 March. Pakistan has started repatriating some of its citizens from the United Arab Emirates, which had threatened to review labour ties with countries refusing to take back their nationals during the pandemic, according to Reuters. The first Pakistan International Airlines flight carrying 227 \u201cstranded passengers\u201d from Dubai and other emirates left for Islamabad on Saturday evening, Pakistan\u2019s consulate general in Dubai said in a Twitter post. It was not clear when other flights would depart. More than 40,000 Pakistanis in the Gulf state have registered with the consulate to return home, two UAE newspapers reported. The UAE and other Gulf states have reported increased infections among low-income migrant workers who live in overcrowded quarters. Some have moved to rehouse them in shuttered schools or dedicated centres, and are trying to arrange flights to repatriate them. On Sunday the UAE announced 479 new cases of coronavirus and four more deaths, bringing its total to 6,781 cases and 41 deaths so far. The UAE last week said it would review labour relations with states refusing to evacuate citizens, including those who have lost jobs or been put on leave, after the ambassadors of India and Pakistan said their countries were not yet ready to do so. Head over to the UK live blog to follow Downing Street\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing: Zimbabwe\u2019s president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, has extended the country\u2019s lockdown by two weeks, saying the country had not yet met conditions set by the World Health Organization to lift the measures. Reuters reports that three people have died from the virus out of the 25 confirmed infected in the southern African nation, but health experts expect the figures to rise once authorities ramp up testing. \u201cIt has been a very hard decision that my government has had to take reluctantly,\u201d Mnangagwa said in a live television broadcast. Hello, I\u2019m taking over the blog from my colleague Jedidajah Otte. Spot a story you think I\u2019ve missed? Please get in touch via Twitter @cleaskopeliti. Thanks in advance. The city of Dresden in east Germany will distribute 200,000 face masks to its citizens on Monday, the Bild newspaper reports. Residents who haven\u2019t been able to obtain masks can pick a maximum of two per person up at the gates of the town hall from 11am. As of Monday, mouth protection is mandatory in the state of Saxony in shops and on local public transport. People have been advised that a scarf would also suffice, as long as mouth and nose are covered. That\u2019s it from me, I\u2019m handing over to my colleague Clea Skopeliti now. The US house speaker, Nancy Pelosi, has condemned Donald Trump\u2019s support for anti-lockdown demonstrations, which took place in various US states this week, as \u201ca distraction\u201d from failures in the White House response to the coronavirus pandemic, my colleague Enjoli Liston reports. On Saturday, further rallies were held in state capitals in Maryland, Texas and Ohio, after Trump had encouraged Americans to protest against strict public health measures aimed at limiting the spread of coronavirus. Scotland\u2019s health secretary, Jeane Freeman, has addressed reports in the media that schools could reopen in three weeks. Speaking at a briefing at the Scottish government\u2019s headquarters in Edinburgh, she said: \u201cThese are not plans that the Scottish Government has seen, and not ones we endorse.\u201d Freeman added: \u201cWe have committed to publishing later this week our initial thinking on how Scotland plots our way forward. \u201cThis will focus on the issues that have to be weighed up and the changes that will be required for society to adapt as safely as possible to the presence of the virus. \u201cWe confirmed only three days ago that the current lockdown remains in place for another three weeks. We will use that time to assess the evidence and the options before we make any further decisions\u201d. The Sampaloc district of Manila will be placed on lockdown owing to the rising number of coronavirus infections cases in the area, the city\u2019s mayor, Francisco \u201cIsko Moreno\u201d Domagoso, confirmed. He said the schedule of the lockdown was yet to be announced, as authorities are \u201cstill planning it carefully\u201d, according to CNN Philippines. On Sunday, the news outlet shared an image of the president, Rodrigo Duterte, while on a phone call to Donald Trump, along reports that US president had called his Filipino counterpart \u201cto discuss bilateral cooperation on Covid-19 response\u201d. Manila\u2019s Sampaloc district has the most number of confirmed cases in the city, with 98 confirmed Covid-19 patients and 158 suspected cases found in the area. As of Sunday, there are 445 confirmed cases in the city. The Portuguese government has attributed the country\u2019s low coronavirus infection and death rates to a swift, flexible \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d response and to the early closure of schools and universities on 16 March, my colleague Sam Jones reports. Despite the fact that around 22% of Portugal\u2019s 10.3 million people are aged 65 or over, making them particularly vulnerable to the virus, the country has so far registered just over 20,000 cases and 714 deaths \u2013 far fewer than its neighbours, he writes. Read the full story below. New York\u2019s daily Covid-19 death toll has hit its lowest point in more than two weeks, but officials still warn that New York City and the rest of the state aren\u2019t ready to ease up on shutdowns of schools, businesses and gatherings. The daily number of new coronavirus deaths dropped under 550 for the first time in overa fortnight as hospitalisations continue to decline, the Associated Press reports. But the state\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, emphasised the crisis was far from over, and said hospitals were still reporting nearly 2,000 new Covid-19 cases a day, while nursing homes remain dangerous infection hotspots. Cuomo took to Twitter to reiterate that New Yorkers must keep adhering to social distancing guidelines and stay at home. New York State is the country\u2019s worst affected area, and worldwide the place with the 6th highest death toll. Experts in Hungary expect the national coronavirus epidemic to peak on 3 May, the prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, said in a video posted on his official Facebook page on Sunday. Orb\u00e1n, who was visiting a hospital in the town of Ajka, west of Budapest, said that by then Hungary would have 5,000 ventilators, up from just over 2,000, Reuters reports. \u201cThe number [of ventilators] will go up to 8,000 and then anything can happen. That is enough, even at a time of war,\u201d he told a doctor in the video. On Sunday, Hungary had 1,916 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and 189 deaths. The updated death toll from the UK, the smallest increase in nearly two weeks, brings the total number of officially recorded deaths from Covid-19 in Europe to more than 100,000. The figures from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center record 100,316 deaths in total in European countries, excluding Russia. Italy still has the highest number of deaths in Europe with 23,227 fatalities, followed by Spain with 20,453 and France with 19,323. As of 5pm Saturday, of those hospitalised in the UK who tested positive for coronavirus, 16,060 have died, the Department of Health and Social Care said. As of 9am on Sunday, 372,967 people in the UK have been tested, of which 120,067 tested positive. Of the 482 new deaths announced on Sunday, 118 occurred on 18 April, 243 occurred on 17 April and 62 occurred on 16 April. Lady Gaga, the Rolling Stones and Paul McCartney were among the headline acts in a virtual concert celebrating frontline workers across the world. Taiwan has quarantined 700 navy officers, service personnel and cadets for testing after 24 members tested positive for Covid-19, the government said. Chen Shih-chung, the country\u2019s health hinister, said 22 new daily cases had been confirmed including those in the military. The cases were found on one of three ships in a fleet that visited the small Pacific island of Palau last month. The latest confirmed cases bring the total on the island to 420 with six deaths. Iran has become the latest country to ease restrictions by allowing bazaars and shopping malls to reopen from Monday. Some shops and businesses were allowed to open again on Saturday but Monday\u2019s openings will apply to \u201cmedium-risk\u201d businesses. Germany will also allow shops of up to 800 sq metres (8,611 sq ft) in addition to car dealers and bike shops while Poland is progressively its lifting lockdown measures from Sunday, with shops among the businesses allowed to reopen. Vladimir Putin has said Russian authorities have the coronavirus crisis under \u201cfull control\u201d and everything would work out with God\u2019s help, despite registering a record daily rise in cases. Russia reported 6,060 new cases in the previous 24 hours, bringing its nationwide tally to 42,853, although the official death toll of 361 remains relatively low compared with other countries with a similar number of cases. In a video message to congratulate Christians on the Orthodox Easter, Putin said the religious festival would strengthen Russians\u2019 hope and faith because the resurrection of Christ was a powerful symbol of rebirth and a reminder that life goes on. The Russian president said: \u201cAll levels of power are working in an organised, responsible and timely way. The situation is under full control. All of our society is united in front of the common threat.\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted by the RIA news agency as saying there was hope that signs miay start appearing next week of the number of cases, which has risen relentlessly, beginning to plateau. The Netherlands has reported the lowest daily coronavirus death rate in more than three weeks. The number of deaths has risen by 83, Dutch health authorities said on Sunday. This was the smallest reported daily increase since 26 March. The total number of deaths among people known to have been infected increased to 3,684, while the number of confirmed infections rose by 1,066 to 32,655. Denmark\u2019s ambassador to the UK, Lars Thuesen, has said it helps to be honest with the public about lockdown exit strategies. \u201cIt does work,\u201d Thuesen said on the Sophy Ridge on Sunday TV programme. \u201cBefore Easter, the prime minister told the Danes that it would be possible to ease some of the restrictions if they behaved during Easter time, during these wonderful summer temperatures, if they behaved responsibly, if they continued what they had done the first weeks, then we would be able to open up again so it was sort of a pact between the government and the population.\u201d He said Denmark had been able to lift some lockdown restrictions as the numbers for people in hospital, the numbers for people in intensive care, and the numbers for people on ventilators had been stable or have been coming down over the last two weeks. \u201cWe are definitely not out of the woods yet but we are moving in the right direction and we can\u2019t stay in a lockdown forever, so this decision about the schools, the primary schools and the kindergartens [which reopened this week] is based on scientific advice to the government as such.\u201d \u201cIt might sound strange but the children in this country is not a vulnerable group and that is probably the reason why they chose to open the schools. It is vital for our economy,\u201d he added. He revealed Denmark was about to widen its testing strategy from only testing people with symptoms. \u201cWe are going to test a large proportion of the population in the future, in the days to come, and right now we are building more testing facilities,\u201d Thuesen said. The Parisian mayor, Anne Hidalgo, had said that she plans to distribute 2.2m face masks to the citizens of the French capital, free of charge. Around half a million reusable masks will initially be available by the end of April, Hidalgo told the newspaper Journal du Dimanche. By mid-May, all residents of the Paris are supposed to have been provided with a mask. According to Hidalgo, the measure will cost \u20ac3m. \u201cMasks and tests are our priority,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cAll Parisians can be equipped.\u201d Outlining her vision for the next phase of the pandemic, post-confinement, the proposals also include providing people who have tested positive with hotel rooms for a fortnight if they cannot remain confined to their homes without contaminating others, and provisionally creating cycle lanes above the most popular metro lines. Pope Francis has called for global solidarity after the pandemic, and said that moving on while excluding sectors of society from the recovery would result in \u201can even worse virus\u201d. The pope left the Vatican for the first time in more than a month to say Mass in an almost empty church a few blocks away to mark Divine Mercy Sunday, Reuters reports. In his homily at the Mass, as well as in his traditional Sunday message afterwards, Francis said the recovery could not leave anyone behind and that now was the time to heal injustice around the world because it undermined the health of the entire human family. \u201cNow, while we are looking forward to a slow and arduous recovery from the pandemic, there is a danger that we will forget those who are left behind,\u201d Francis said. \u201cThe risk is that we may then be struck by an even worse virus, that of selfish indifference. A virus spread by the thought that life is better if it is better for me, and that everything will be fine if it is fine for me.\u201d The Swiss Covid-19 death toll has reached 1,135 people, the country\u2019s public health agency said on Sunday, rising from 1,111 on Saturday. The number of confirmed infections increased to 27,740, it said, up from 27,404. The New York Times has run into a buzz-saw of indignation after trying to get residents of an Irish village to spill some beans about Matt Damon, who is living there under lockdown. Heather Tal Murphy, a reporter, triggered a backlash by asking people in Dalkey what it\u2019s like to have the actor as a neighbour during the pandemic. \u201cAnyone living in Dalkey has a right to their privacy. Leave him alone, jesus, he\u2019s only human,\u201d said one response on the Facebook forum she contacted. \u201cHow about just leaving him be?\u201d said another. \u201cIts one of the reasons celebs love Ireland, they get left alone and treated like a normal human.\u201d Damon was in Ireland to film The Last Duel, to be directed by Ridley Scott, and has ended up staying in Dalkey, a wealthy seaside enclave south of Dublin that is home to Bono and Enya. The Bourne Identity star is reportedly staying with his wife and children at a property advertised on Airbnb for \u20ac7,000 a week. Sightings have been reported on social media, including a picture of Damon clutching a local supermarket bag, purportedly with his togs, after a swim in the sea. However residents bristled when the NYT reporter sought more details. \u201cLeave him be, he belongs to us now,\u201d said one. \u201cDon\u2019t forget social distancing, leave the man alone,\u201d said another. A few voices defended the journalist for just doing her job and faulted residents for having posted about their famous neighour in the first place. Murphy, who did not respond to a request for comment, appears to have abandoned the project: \u201cI have gotten the message that people don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to ask about Matt Damon,\u201d she wrote on the forum. \u201cI think he would appreciate how protective you\u2019re all being.\u201d Here the latest global developments relating to the coronavirus pandemic at a glance: Spain\u2019s death toll slows to a one-month low, as the country reported 410 further deaths on Sunday, down from 565 on Saturday, the lowest daily increase since March 22. Saudi Arabia\u2019s highest religious body, the Council of Senior Scholars, has urged Muslims worldwide to pray at home during Ramadan if their countries require social distancing to combat coronavirus. At least 6.5m jobs in the UK economy are at risk if the lockdown continues for an extended period, a new study suggests. The government is under intense pressure after being accused of a series of failings in their response to the pandemic. India\u2019s Maharashtra state, the country\u2019s largest regional economy, will partially reopen business activity on Monday, after a weeks-long shutdown to slow the spread of coronavirus left millions out of work. Israel, South Korea and Albania are also loosening lockdown restrictions, and New Zealand is likely to announce a lockdown overhaul on Monday, after more than a week of low new infections. Protesters in Brazil are demanding laxer social distancing measures, after president Jair Bolsonaro reiterated his aversion to the measures on Saturday, hinting he would relax restrictions soon. Hundreds of people have taken to the streets across large cities in Brazil, bringing traffic to a standstill and protesting against the country\u2019s social distancing measures. Drivers in the streets of Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and the capital Brasilia honked their horns, calling for resignations of politicians who decided to implement a strict economic and social lockdown, forcing most businesses to close for weeks. President Jair Bolsonaro has been fiercely criticising the measures and fired his health minister, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, who had defended physical distancing, on Thursday. On Saturday, Bolsonaro gave further hints that he planned to reopen the economy soon. \u201cPeople want a return to normality,\u201d the president said in a Facebook Live session. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start adding more flexibility.\u201d Brazil is South America\u2019s worst affected country with 36,925 confirmed infections and 2,372 reported deaths. Spain\u2019s Covid-19 death toll rose by 410 on Sunday, down from 565 on Saturday, the Health Ministry said, the lowest daily increase since March 22. Spain is still one of the world\u2019s hardest hit countries, with its overall death toll standing at 20,639, globally the third highest after the US and Italy. Spain\u2019s daily death rate peaked at 950 on April 2. The country had imposed Europe\u2019s strictest lockdown in mid-March. The overall number of coronavirus cases rose to 195,944 on Sunday from 191,726 on Saturday, the Health Ministry added. India\u2019s Maharashtra state, the country\u2019s largest regional economy, will allow a limited number of sectors to resume business on Monday, after a weeks-long shutdown to slow the spread of coronavirus left millions out of work, Reuters reports. Maharashtra, home to financial centre Mumbai, has the biggest share of India\u2019s 16,365 infections, including a large number in its densely-packed slums. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray told a news conference on Sunday that some activity would be permitted in the least-affected parts of the state while observing a strict lockdown in the red zones that have the maximum number of cases. \u201cWe need to start the economic wheels again. We are giving selective permissions from tomorrow, especially in orange zones and green zones,\u201d he said, referring to areas with lower levels of infection. In uplifting news, a Spanish taxi driver who had been taking patients to hospital free of charge received a standing ovation from hospital staff. Figures from France\u2019s military leadership reveal that more than half the sailors aboard the country\u2019s flagship aircraft carrier contracted coronavirus as the ship traveled through the Mediterranean Sea, the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. A navy official says 1,046 of the 1,760 people aboard the Charles de Gaulle tested positive for the virus, according to the Associated Press. Navy chief of staff Christophe Prazuck attributed the quick spread to the \u201cgreat population density aboard the ship.\u201d Speaking Saturday evening to Europe-1 radio, Prazuck said virus protection measures weren\u2019t followed properly, which \u201cdid not allow us to detect the beginning of the epidemic, and therefore to contain it.\u201d The ship is undergoing a lengthy disinfection process since returning to its home base in Toulon last week. One person who served aboard is in intensive care and more than 20 others are hospitalized. Among those infected are two U.S. sailors serving as part of an exchange program. Albania\u2019s government plans to allow its mining and oil industries to reopen on Monday, along with hundreds of businesses including small retailers, food and fish processing, farming and fishing. In late March, the country had imposed a 40 hour curfew at the weekend and limited shopping to just one family member, who had to seek permission via an app to leave their home. The country\u2019s reported death toll stands at 26. Oliver Holmes in Jerusalem As we reported, Israel has begun gradually lifting some of its virus restrictions following a stringent five-week lockdown. Overnight, the cabinet approved the below measures: Increase office workers from 15% to 30% employment. Reopen the hi-tech sector with restrictions. The partial reopening of shops, including hardware, electrical, and office supplies. Only two customers allowed in at a time. Allow children from three families to share one caregiver. Allow group prayer \u2013 a Jewish custom \u2013 of up to 19 people, but outside and with people standing two metres apart Allow weddings and circumcision ceremonies for up to 10 people, also outside and two metres apart Allow people to venture 500 metres from their homes for exercise (previously 100m). Pre-schools, schools, hairdressers and malls will remain closed. People will also have to continue to wear a mask in public spaces, subject to a fine. Israel, a country of 9 million people, responded relatively fast to the pandemic and has registered around 13,000 cases of the illness, with 158 fatalities. The past week has seen a slowdown in the number of new confirmed cases. The new measures will be in place for two weeks and reassessed in case infection rates begin to climb again. If that happens, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned he would reinstate a clampdown. South Korea has reported only eight new coronavirus cases for the first time in two months, and will loosen some of its lockdown restrictions, prime minister Chung Sye-Kyun said on Sunday. It is the first time new infections fell to single digits since the country\u2019s outbreak escalated in mid-February. The prime minister said the government would consider opening public outdoor facilities, and would relax the guidelines under which sports facilities and restaurants could open in particular circumstances. Other social distancing measures that were set to expire today were extended until May 5. Sye-Kyun had urged South Koreans on Saturday to minimise outdoor activities and adhere to social distancing rules during the upcoming holidays. In total, South Korea has recorded 10,661 infections, including 234 deaths. 8,042 were reported to have recovered from Covid-19. \u201cWe must not let down our guard until the last confirmed patient is recovered\u201d, president Moon Jae-in said on Sunday. The British government is under fire after it emerged that it ignored key recommendations made three years ago after a major simulation exercise found that Britain\u2019s National Health Service would not cope in the face of a flu pandemic, my colleague Jamie Doward reports. It is the latest in a series of scandals the government is embroiled in over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak, including its delayed efforts to procure ventilators and personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare staff. The Sunday Times newspaper revealed in an investigation today that prime minister Boris Johnson had missed five emergency cabinet office meetings between late January and early March, causing Britain to \u201csleepwalk into disaster\u201d, as the reporters wrote. Iran has extended furloughs for prisoners for another month, Iranian president Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday, as the Middle East\u2019s worst-hit country tries to prevent the virus from spreading in its crowded jails, Reuters reports. Iran\u2019s reported temporary release of 100,000 prisoners since February - including prisoners of conscience and dual and foreign nationals - was welcomed by the United Nations on Friday as a good step, but one that must be expanded. \u201cFurloughs of those prisoners, who pose no threat to the society, have been extended until May 20,\u201d Rouhani said in a televised cabinet meeting. However, a letter by U.N. human rights experts, including Special Rapporteur on Iran Javaid Rehman, said \u201cmost prisoners of conscience, human rights defenders, conservationists and dual and foreign nationals\u201d remained imprisoned in Iran. Rouhani said mosques and holy sites in Iran would remain closed until at least May 4. Iran allowed so-called low-risk businesses - including many shops, factories and workshops - to resume operations in Tehran on Saturday, a week after re-opening in the rest of the country. Schools and universities, as well as theatres, gyms, saunas, beauty salons and shopping centres remain closed, and a ban on cultural, religious and sports gatherings has been imposed. Iran has reported 80,868 confirmed cases of infection and more than 5,000 officially recorded deaths. Saudi Arabia\u2019s highest religious body, the Council of Senior Scholars, urged Muslims worldwide to pray at home during Ramadan if their countries require social distancing to combat coronavirus, the state news agency SPA reported on Sunday. \u201cMuslims shall avoid gatherings, because they are the main cause of the spread of infection \u2026 and shall remember that preserving the lives of people is a great act that brings them closer to God,\u201d it said in a statement. Ireland is highly unlikely to allow large gatherings this year and the \u201ccocooning\u201d of people over 70 years old in their homes may persist for quite a while, health minister Simon Harris said on Sunday. \u201cWhat\u2019s not going to come back quickly are scenarios in which we can\u2019t safely socially distance,\u201d Harris told the Sunday Independent newspaper. \u201cI can\u2019t see how people can be in packed pubs again as long as this virus is still with us and we don\u2019t have a vaccine or an effective treatment,\u201d he added. Ireland\u2019s chief medical officer declared on Thursday that the first wave of the coronavirus outbreak had been contained in the population at large, raising hopes that stay-at-home restrictions could begin to be rolled back from May 5, Reuters reports. But Harris cautioned that any easing back of the most severe constraints will be done on a slow and phased basis. \u201cI\u2019d like to see a situation where you could expand somewhat the areas in which people can go beyond their home,\u201d he said. Currently people can only go out to shop for groceries or for brief physical exercise within a 2 kilometre radius of their homes. Over 70s have been told not to leave their homes. Harris said he would like to see a situation where schools could reopen or at least partially reopen. Allowing students back just one day a week \u201cwould provide breathing space for families and information and I think that would help,\u201d Harris said. Last week, a comparison of the lower death rates in Ireland with the death rates in Britain provoked a debate on differences between two countries, dividing experts. Russia has reported 6,060 new coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours, compared to 4,785 on the previous day. So far, 313 people in the country are confirmed to have died from Covid-19. My colleague Richard Orange reports that anger is growing in Sweden as the elderly are paying the price for the governments\u2019 coronavirus strategy, which is much more relaxed than in other countries. A third of the 1,511 recorded fatalities in Sweden have been people living in care homes. Last week, the Swedish prime minister Stefan L\u00f6fven said that the country faced a \u201cserious situation\u201d in its old people\u2019s homes, announced efforts to step up protections, and ordered the country\u2019s health inspectorate to investigate. In Afghanistan, the health ministry has warned that difficult days are yet to come in the war-torn country as the number of confirmed cases reached 993, triggered by an increase of infections in the capital Kabul. Wahidullah Mayar, spokesman for the ministry of health, warned that the number of coronavirus cases will continue to surge in the country. Of the 63 new coronavirus cases reported in the last 24 hours, 31 were recorded in Kabul, Mayar said, which has so far recorded 307. Kabul is close to overtake Herat which had up until now been the country\u2019s worst affected city with 332 confirmed coronavirus cases, four recorded in the last 24 hours. Herat in under lockdown but experts warn that as streets are packed with vehicles and people walking freely around, fighting the virus will be challenging. The province\u2019s governor had recently warned the public to take the virus serious and said he was \u201cdigging graves\u201d in Herat. In a bid to contain the spread of the virus, the government has recently extended Kabul\u2019s lockdown for a further three weeks and warned that more severe restrictions on movements might be introduced. The lockdown will also be implemented in provincial districts, and roads that connect Kabul with other provinces will also remain closed. Ferozuddin Feroz, the country\u2019s health minister, said that Afghanistan, a country of around 30m, has around 50,000 testing kits \u201cbut RNA extraction kits are not enough\u201d. He added that talks are being held with Chinese and Japanese officials about the issue. Afghanistan has so far recorded 33 deaths of Covid-19 and 131 recoveries. The Israeli government has announced a series of relaxations of some of the country\u2019s lockdown restrictions, including partially reopening the economy, the Haaratz newspaper reports. All stores that operate outside shopping centers will be allowed to open, praying in groups of up to 19 will be permitted in an open space and special education is to resume activity in classes of up to three childre. The measures will come into effect today and will last until May 3. An additional 596 cases of coronavirus infections were confirmed in Singapore today, the Straits Times newspaper reports. This brings the total number of cases in Singapore to 6,588. The majority of these cases are work permit holders residing in foreign worker dormitories. So far, 11 people have died from Covid-19 related complications in Singapore. My colleague Ben Doherty reports that wild animals are being spotted in Australian cities as they reclaim an increasingly deserted world. First Llandudno in Wales being noisily browsed by a herd of goats, then deer venturing into Nara, Japan. Here is a video of a kangaroo checking out the streets of Adelaide. Hello, I\u2019m taking over from my colleague Helen Sullivan. Please feel free to get in touch via email or get me on Twitter @JedySays. That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan for today. My colleague Jedidajah Otte is taking the live blog reins. More than half of the jobs in some sectors of the UK economy are at risk if the lockdown continues for an extended period, a new study suggests. Estimates produced by the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) at the University of Essex suggest the lockdown threatens to temporarily take at least 6.5 million jobs out of the economy \u2013 around a fifth of the national total. The institute\u2019s modelling factors in the ability of employees to work from home, which means some sectors are less affected than others. It also estimates how the reduction in demand for goods and services is having an impact on jobs. India has not yet taken a decision on when to lift or ease restrictions on domestic and international flights and urged airlines to take travel bookings only after a final decision is made, a government minister said. The government announced a halt to domestic flights on 23 March, ordering commercial airlines to shut down domestic operations on top of an existing ban on international flights to try and contain the spread of the coronavirus. \u201cThe Ministry of Civil Aviation clarifies that so far no decision has been taken to open domestic or international operations,\u201d civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri said in a tweet late on Saturday. \u201cAirlines are advised to open their bookings only after a decision in this regard has been taken by the Government\u201d, he added. India has agreed to send hydroxychloroquine tablets to the United Arab Emirates to be used for treating Covid-19 patients, the Gulf Arab state\u2019s embassy in New Delhi said. India last month put a ban on exports as sales soared to secure supplies for itself as US President Donald Trump touted the drug as a potential effective treatment for the deadly virus. It said this month it would send supplies to some countries, Reuters reports. \u201cThe first shipment of medicine, currently on its way to the UAE, includes 5.5 million pills for treatment of patients with Covid-19,\u201d the embassy tweeted late on Saturday. For sick US coal miners Covid-19 is a death sentence While miners with black lung struggle during the pandemic, the coal industry is seeking to use the crisis to its advantage, cutting payouts to the federal black lung funds. Last month the National Mining Association asked Congress to decrease the excise tax that coal companies pay toward the fund by 55%. The federal black lung program, which pays out benefits to former coal miners diagnosed with the condition , has already faced financial problems in recent years in part due to coal companies filing for bankruptcy and shifting millions of dollars in liabilities onto taxpayers. Coronavirus latest: at a glance A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreak. Pressure intensifies for 100% government-backed business loans Philip Inman reports for the Guardian: Pressure was mounting this weekend on chancellor Rishi Sunak to offer 100% government-backed loans as part of the Covid-19 business lifeboat scheme to prevent thousands of small and medium-sized firms from going bust. Business groups said commercial lenders, which must currently cover 20% of loan losses under the Cbils government scheme, were turning down requests to borrow rescue funds that could allow firms to remain solvent through the coronavirus lockdown. Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said it was a matter of urgency that the Treasury simplify the system to allow more businesses to access the one-year, interest-free loans. A major British city should be used to trial mass testing as a way out of the coronavirus lockdown, according to a group of leading epidemiologists and public health experts. They warn that simply using periods of mass lockdowns and relaxations to control the virus could lead to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people before a vaccine becomes available \u201cwith the most disadvantaged groups experiencing the greatest suffering\u201d. Instead, the group states that one or more cities with a population of 200,000 to 300,000 \u2013 about a dozen ranging in size from Aberdeen to Bradford \u2013 should be used to trial a mass-testing programme. The group includes Julian Peto, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, David Hunter, professor of epidemiology at the University of Oxford, and Nisreen A Alwan, an associate professor in public health at Southampton University. A look at the UK papers for Sunday, 19 April: New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has also asked Kiwis to keep a diary of their daily movements, AAP reports. Ms Ardern believes the homespun idea could help the country\u2019s contact-tracers with their work. \u201cI would ask New Zealanders to think about doing that. Just keeping a quick note of where you\u2019ve been, and who you\u2019ve been with,\u201d Ms Ardern said. \u201cIt will not only help them, it will help us. \u201cIf you imagine, even asking someone six days later to account every movement over a period of time, it\u2019s an incredibly hard task. \u201cSo I would ask New Zealanders to have new practises, new things that they do at the end of the day. \u201cThe better that we are able to do ... the sooner we can move through the down the alert levels and the sooner life feels more normal.\u201d More on New Zealand now, which looks likely to announce a lockdown overhaul on Monday, after more than a week of low Covid-19 new cases. On Monday, the Cabinet will meet to decide whether to end four weeks of level four restrictions and downscale to a level three lockdown, which mirrors many of Australia\u2019s restrictions. That will include re-opening schools, allowing more businesses - including the construction and forestry industries - to get back to work and let restaurants operate for delivery orders only. On Sunday, health officials announced just nine new cases across the country, the eighth straight day in which new cases have been no higher than 20. The country\u2019s death toll stands at 12. In keeping with the country\u2019s health-first approach, Ms Ardern announced four criteria that would decide whether the country would relax its restrictions - with none related to the economy: The satisfaction of health professionals that undetected community transmission is unlikely Strong contact tracing capacity The strength of border controls The health system\u2019s ability to stand up Get in touch with me on Twitter @helenrsullivan. The US, UK and the International Bar Association have criticised the arrest of 15 Hong Kong democracy activists on charges of organising and participating in anti-government protests last year. The arrests on Saturday were the biggest crackdown on the city\u2019s pro-democracy movement since the outbreak of mass protests last year. The International Bar Association said Hong Kong authorities should not encroach on human rights and the legal system must guard against any abuses of power while the world was preoccupied with the coronavirus pandemic. The association condemned the arrests of Lee and Ng, who have been active human rights and rule of law campaigners during their careers. It was vital that justice was applied transparently in Hong Kong, especially while the world was gripped by the coronavirus pandemic, it said. CEOs, not the unemployed, are America\u2019s real \u2018moral hazard\u2019, writes Robert Reich, professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley and former US secretary of labour. The coronavirus relief enacted by Congress is barely reaching Americans in need. This week, checks of up to $1,200 are being delivered through direct-deposit filings with the Internal Revenue Service. But low-income people who have not directly deposited their taxes won\u2019t get them for weeks or months. Worse yet, the US treasury is allowing banks to seize payments to satisfy outstanding debts. Meanwhile, most of the promised $600 weekly extra unemployment benefits remain stuck in offices now overwhelmed with claims. None of this seems to bother conservative Republicans, who believe all such relief creates what\u2019s called \u201cmoral hazard\u201d \u2013 the risk that government benefits will allow people to slack off. Thirty-two Guatemalan migrants on a deportation flight from the United States earlier this week have now tested positive for the coronavirus, according to the Central American nation\u2019s health ministry. \u201cOne of them tested positive on Monday, 12 yesterday and 19 today,\u201d health ministry spokeswoman Ana Lucia Gudiel told Reuters. Four deportees on a flight in March also tested positive for the virus. The Trump administration has pressured Guatemala to keep receiving deported migrants despite growing concerns returnees are bringing the virus with them and could infect remote communities. Guatemala\u2019s migration institute could not confirm which of two deportation flights that arrived on Monday carried the infected passengers. Guatemala temporarily suspended flights deporting migrants from the United States on Thursday after reports of the mass infection. Germany\u2019s confirmed coronavirus cases have risen by 2,458 to 139,897, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Sunday. That was lower than a 3,609 increase reported on Saturday, but this may be due to the \u201cweekend effect\u201d, with fewer people being tested. During the week, cases increased for four days in a row. The reported death toll has risen by 184 to 4,294, the Sunday tally showed. That was down from a day-on-day increase shown on Saturday of 242, and 299 on Friday. Australia on Sunday called for an independent investigation into the global response to the coronavirus pandemic, including the World Health Organization\u2019s handling of the crisis. Foreign Minister Marise Payne said the country would \u201cinsist\u201d on a review that would probe, in part, China\u2019s early response to the outbreak in Wuhan, the city where Covid-19 emerged late last year. Payne said Australia shared similar concerns to the United States, whose President Donald Trump has accused the WHO of \u201cmismanaging\u201d the crisis and covering up the seriousness of China\u2019s outbreak before it spread. Trump has also announced that Washington will halt payments to the UN body that amounted to $400 million last year. Payne added she believed the fallout from the pandemic was set to change the relationship between Australia and China \u201cin some ways\u201d, with her concern around Beijing\u2019s transparency now \u201cat a very high point\u201d. Health Minister Greg Hunt backed the call for an independent review, saying Australia had achieved success in limiting the spread of the virus in part by going against WHO advice. Deaths so far in the global coronavirus pandemic have passed 160,000, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. The toll is currently at 160,717. This news comes as the total number of deaths in Europe approaches 100,000. The US has the highest toll globally, with 38,910 fatalities. China reports lowest new cases since 17 March. China\u2019s National Health Commission reported 16 new confirmed coronavirus cases on April 18, the lowest number since March 17 and down from 27 a day earlier, according to data published on Sunday. Restrictions to be lifted in some US states. Texas and Vermont will allow certain businesses to reopen on Monday while still observing coronavirus-related precautions and Montana will begin lifting restrictions on Friday. Donald Trump warned that China should face consequences if it was \u201cknowingly responsible\u201d for the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cIf they were knowingly responsible, yeah, I mean, then sure there should be consequences,\u201d Trump said in his daily White House briefing. Canada and the United States have agreed to extend border restrictions for another 30 days to help control the spread of coronavirus, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Saturday. New Yorkers will be able to get marriage licenses online and wed via video during the crisis, Governor Andrew Cuomo said, waiving a provision that requires the betrothed to complete their application in person. Ireland has successfully \u201cflattened the curve\u201d of coronavirus transmission and no longer expects a peak in infections, chief medical officer Tony Holohan said. South Korea on Sunday reported single digit new coronavirus cases for the first time in two months with eight new daily cases, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The nation\u2019s total tally is 10,661 cases and 234 deaths. Israel eases some Coronavirus restrictions. Israel on Saturday approved some easing to its tight coronavirus restrictions while pointedly avoiding announcing the first stage of an exit from lockdown. Spain\u2019s PM to ask for extension of lockdown to 9 May. Spain\u2019s prime minister Pedro Sanchez said on Saturday he would ask parliament for a third 15-day extension of the lockdown imposed to curb one of the world\u2019s worst outbreaks of the new coronavirus, taking the restrictions up to 9 May. Turkey\u2019s coronavirus cases overtake Iran to become highest in Middle East. Turkey\u2019s confirmed coronavirus cases have risen to 82,329, overtaking neighbouring Iran for the first time to register the highest total in the Middle East. Morocco has extended its lockdown measures by another month. Morocco will extend lockdown measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus for another month until May 20, the government said on Saturday. France reports 642 more coronavirus deaths as country\u2019s toll hits 19,323. France registered 642 more deaths from coronavirus infections on Saturday, bringing the total to 19,323, the fourth-highest tally in the world, although the number of people in hospital declined for a fourth day running. UK\u2019s Covid-19 hospital death toll surpasses 15,000. In the UK, the official Covid-19 death toll has passed 15,000 \u2013 with 888 new fatalities recorded in the last 24 hours. It means as of 5pm on Friday, of those hospitalised in the UK who have tested positive for coronavirus, 15,464 people have died. New York daily death toll at two-week low. Deaths in New York State rose by 540 on Friday, the lowest daily death tally since the beginning of April. Croatia extends its lockdown for another 15 days. Croatia is extending its coronavirus lockdown for another 15 days, but a minister says the country is exploring the possibility of gradually easing restrictions. The number of people who have lost their lives so far in the global coronavirus pandemic has passed the sombre milestone of 160,000 according to Johns Hopkins University figures. The toll is currently at 160,717. This news comes as the total number of deaths in Europe approaches 100,000. The US has the highest toll globally, with 38,910 fatalities. Thailand on Sunday reported 32 new coronavirus cases, bringing its total to 2,765, a senior official said. Of the new cases, 28 were in the capital, Bangkok, said Taweesin Wisanuyothin, a spokesman for the government\u2019s Centre for Covid-19 Situation Administration. No new fatalities were reported. Thailand has had 47 deaths from the coronavirus. In the US, the coronavirus pandemic is leading to a spike in demand for food pantries, AP reports. Food pantries stay busy even in the best of economic times; the coronavirus pandemic has prompted a spike in demand as millions of people find themselves furloughed, laid off or with businesses that have suffered huge financial blows. Just as demand is skyrocketing, however, many of the food banks sources are drying up. Restaurants, hotels and resorts many of which are shuttered or sharply limiting their operations are no longer supplying them with food, while other suppliers are busy restocking grocery shelves. Farmers have switched from shipping vegetables and meats in bulk to individual packaging for grocery stores. Feeding America, a nationwide association of 200 food banks and 60,000 food pantries, has seen an increase in demand from 98% of its member banks, according to a recent survey. \u201cIt is a perfect storm scenario,\u201d Katie Fitzgerald, the organisation\u2019s chief operating officer told the AP. Congress included a significant boost for emergency food assistance in its coronavirus relief legislation, but Fitzgerald warned that funding may take months to reach localities while food banks contend with a flood of need in the near term. Trump warns China over Covid-19 outbreak as Europe approaches 100,000 deaths Donald Trump has warned that China should face consequences if it was \u201cknowingly responsible\u201d for the coronavirus pandemic, as deaths in Europe from Covid-19 approached 100,000 \u201cIt could have been stopped in China before it started and it wasn\u2019t, and the whole world is suffering because of it,\u201d Trump said in his daily White House briefing, as US cases topped 730,000 and fatalities in the country approached 39,000. \u201cIf it was a mistake, a mistake is a mistake. But if they were knowingly responsible, yeah, I mean, then sure there should be consequences,\u201d Trump said. He did not elaborate on what form that might take. He said the Chinese were \u201cembarrassed\u201d and the question now was whether what happened with the coronavirus was \u201ca mistake that got out of control, or was it done deliberately?\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a big difference between those two,\u201d he said. On Sunday China reported just 16 new confirmed coronavirus cases, its lowest number since 17 March and down from 27 a day earlier. No new deaths were reported. Britain\u2019s government, which has been sharply criticised by healthcare workers over a shortage of personal protective equipment, has turned to the investment banker who led the country\u2019s 2012 Olympic planning to boost domestic production. Reuters reports that Paul Deighton, who was chief executive of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, was appointed by health secretary Matt Hancock on Sunday to \u201clead a singular and relentless focus on PPE as the country\u2019s top manufacturing priority, with the full weight of the government behind him\u201d. Deighton\u2019s unpaid role will be to scale up domestic production of equipment such as masks and gowns. Brands like Barbour and Burberry have already switched factory lines from high-end fashion to PPE. In New Zealand, a twelfth coronavirus death has been confirmed, Stuff.nz reports, and the country has reported nine new cases, bringing the country\u2019s total to 1431. On Monday, the New Zealand cabinet is set to decide whether the country\u2019s strict level 4 lockdown \u2013 in place for almost four weeks \u2013 can be lifted. Now for a video filmed round the corner from my mother\u2019s house in Simon\u2019s Town, South Africa (and before you #natureishealing, take it from her \u2013 penguins have been very much In Control of this area for a long time): \u2018Together at home\u2019: Lady Gaga and Rolling Stones headline tribute to frontline workers Lady Gaga, Paul McCartney, The Rolling Stones and Beyonce headlined a global special of music, comedy and personal stories in what Gaga called a \u201clove letter\u201d to frontline workers battling the coronavirus pandemic. The One World: Together at Home, broadcast across multiple television and streaming channels around the world, featured a who\u2019s who of pop culture. Filmed from their homes, contributors included Elton John, Stevie Wonder, David Beckham and former US first ladies Michelle Obama and Laura Bush. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful for the healthcare workers, the medical workers, all the grocery store workers and delivery people, the postal workers, all the other nonprofits that are working so hard,\u201d Gaga said. In much of the wider Orthodox region, churches will not be open to the public. The Istanbul-based Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople has announced that services will be closed to the public and broadcast online. The same decision has been taken in Cyprus, Greece, Serbia and North Macedonia as well as in Egypt, where Orthodox Coptic Christians comprise 10-15 percent of the population. Jerusalem\u2019s Old City is normally packed for Orthodox Easter but was almost deserted at the weekend due to Israel\u2019s strict lockdown measures. The annual Holy Fire ceremony took place behind closed doors in the city\u2019s Church of the Holy Sepulchre. The flame is then taken to Orthodox countries worldwide. According to tradition, the Holy Sepulchre stands on the site of Jesus\u2019 crucifixion and burial. In Romania, while churches have closed their doors, volunteers and priests will go to people\u2019s homes handing out loaves of consecrated bread and sharing the holy flame. More than 260 million Orthodox Christians celebrated Easter Sunday, with church leaders asking worshippers to stay at home to avoid spreading the novel coronavirus. Orthodox Christians, the world\u2019s third largest group of Christian believers, this year celebrate Easter a week after Catholics and Protestants because they follow a different calendar. Most Orthodox Christians will also skip traditional midnight services, even though Eastern Europe and the ex-Soviet Union where most live have relatively low numbers of confirmed cases of the virus so far. Moscow Patriarch Kirill, who leads 150 million believers, has urged the faithful to pray at home and not go to church until he gives his blessing. Russian President Vladimir Putin is dropping his usual attendance at an Easter service and will go to a chapel in the grounds of his residence outside Moscow. In Moscow and the surrounding region, where most Russian COVID-19 cases are concentrated, churches will hold services behind closed doors with broadcasts online or on television. However churches will remain open in many regions of the country, which has reported around 36,800 cases of coronavirus and more than 300 deaths. China\u2019s National Health Commission reported 16 new confirmed coronavirus cases on April 18, the lowest number since March 17 and down from 27 a day earlier, according to data published on Sunday. Of the new cases, 9 were imported infections, the lowest since March 13 and down from 17 a day earlier. The remaining 7 confirmed cases were locally transmitted, down from 10 the previous day. Newly discovered asymptomatic cases were at 44, down from 54 a day earlier. Three of the new cases were imported, according to the health commission. No new deaths were reported, it said. The total number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country reached 82,735 as of April 18, while the total death toll from the virus stood at 4,632, it said. The NATO general leading the group\u2019s response to the coronavirus in Europe has conceded all key figures were caught \u201coff-guard\u201d by the outbreak, PA media reports. Defending NATO\u2019s work in reaction to the virus, including coordinating the distribution of personal protective equipment (PPE) through various European countries, Lieutenant-General Olivier Rittiman said \u201cno one\u201d fully understood the depth of the crisis that lay ahead in the early days of the outbreak. \u201cI think that everybody was taken a little bit off-guard by this crisis,\u201d Lt Gen Rittiman, the Commander of NATO\u2019s Europe Covid-19 Task Force, told Sky News\u2019 Sophy Ridge on Sunday. The general said the organisation had so far deployed 4,000 medics and 250 field hospitals - amounting to some 25,000 beds - across various nations. Lt Gen Rittiman conceded there was a global shortage of PPE, but said NATO was appropriately managing the delivery of equipment to different nations, after which domestic distribution was \u201ca national decision\u201d. The general gave a guarded response to reports the United States had hijacked PPE in China that was meant to be shipped to Europe, saying nations had had to take \u201call appropriate measures to make the best choices\u201d in the early days of the outbreak. Earlier this month German media reported on allegations from the interior minister for Berlin state, Andreas Geisel, that 200,000 N95 masks destined for Europe were instead diverted to the US as they were being transferred between planes in Thailand. Hundreds of Bulgarian Christians flocked to the Orthodox temples for outdoor services on a surreal Saturday night with the Balkan state one of the few countries where churches remained open over the Easter holidays amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Easter holiday is the most significant date on the calendar for the world\u2019s 300 million Orthodox Christians with thousands of Bulgarians usually packing the churches and their ancestral homes all around the country to celebrate Christ\u2019s resurrection. This year many Bulgarians opted to watch services live on TV instead after the government urged people to celebrate and pray from home. The restrictions, imposed due to the coronavirus outbreak, have meant observing an Easter Sunday unlike any Bulgarians have lived through before. But while most worshippers maintained social distancing between each other to stem transmission of the virus, clergymen largely failed to observe it during the services. The Bulgarian Orthodox Church has been criticised on social media for keeping its houses of worship open in spite of the coronavirus crisis. Many Bulgarians also pointed fingers at the church for keeping the practices of people kissing icons in churches, and using shared spoons during communion services. Here\u2019s our full story on the protests in the US: A day after Donald Trump encouraged Americans to protest against strict public health measures aimed at limiting the spread of coronavirus, rallies were held in state capitals in Maryland, Texas and Ohio, with more planned for next week in other states. Hundreds of people stood shoulder-to-shoulder at the Texas Capitol on Saturday, chanting \u201cFire Fauci!\u201d as part of a protest organized by the conspiracy theory site InfoWars. Anthony Fauci is the top public health expert on the White House coronavirus taskforce. In Maryland, protesters stayed inside their cars and honked their horns as they drove around the capital, Annapolis, to demand that Governor Larry Hogan \u201creopen Maryland\u201d. In Columbus, Ohio, hundreds of protesters gathered, some chanting \u201cWe are not sheep\u201d. Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei said on Saturday that 19 more Guatemalans deported from the United States to the Central American nation have tested positive for coronavirus. On Friday, Giammattei said 12 randomly selected migrants who took the flight from the US tested positive for coronavirus when examined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US health protection agency. Flights deporting Guatemalan migrants from the United States have been once again temporarily suspended after reports of the infections South Korea on Sunday reported single digit new coronavirus cases for the first time in two months with eight new daily cases, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said. The nation\u2019s total tally is 10,661 cases and 234 deaths. News from Australia now, where the health minister has taken a swipe at the World Health Organization, saying the WHO\u2019s coronavirus response \u2018didn\u2019t help the world\u2019. Health minister Greg Hunt has backed foreign affairs minister Marise Payne\u2019s call for an independent review of the global response to Covid-19, including the role of the World Health Organisation. He also takes a swipe at the WHO\u2019s handling of the crisis in the process. What we have seen is Australia has been able to have, by global standards, just a profoundly important and successful human outcome, but we have done that by following the course that our medical experts here in Australia set out. We do know there was very considerable criticism when we imposed on the 1 February the China ban from some of the officials and the WHO in Geneva. The regional body has done well in terms of polio, measles, malaria, but what we saw from some officials in Geneva, we think was a response which didn\u2019t help the world. We have done well because we made our own decisions as a country. Hundreds of people denouncing pandemic lockdown measures opposed by President Jair Bolsonaro snarled traffic in major Brazilian cities on Saturday, AP reports. Protesters in trucks, cars and motorcycles, some wrapped in the country\u2019s green and yellow flag, honked horns in the streets of Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and the capital of Brasilia, calling for governors to resign over measures that have forced most businesses to close for weeks. Bolsonaro has been a fierce critic of the states\u2019 stay-at-home measures, arguing that the economic harm could be more damaging than the illness. The protests took place a day after Bolsonaro fired his health minister, who had been promoting isolation measures. In Rio de Janeiro, about 100 vehicles took part in the gridlock, cruising down Atlantica Avenue, along the iconic and temporarily shut-down Copacabana beach. In Brasilia, Bolsonaro reiterated his intention to start reopening the economy. The fear was excessive, he said Saturday, denouncing the greed of politicians who have shut down everything and created panic. Brazil has the most confirmed Covid-19 cases in Latin America more than 36,500 and at least 2,347 deaths. That is a relatively low number in relation to the country\u2019s population of 211 million, but the outbreak is expected to peak in May. Mexican Deputy Health Minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell said on Saturday that Mexico has registered 7,497 confirmed coronavirus cases and 650 deaths. That is up from 6,875 cases and 546 deaths on Friday. Lopez-Gatell said on Thursday the country might have nearly 56,000 people infected with the fast-spreading coronavirus. US governors eager to rescue their economies and feeling heat from President Donald Trump are moving to ease restrictions meant to control the spread of the coronavirus, even as new hot spots emerge and experts warn that moving too fast could prove disastrous. Adding to the pressure are protests against stay-at-home orders organised by small-government groups and Trump supporters. They staged demonstrations Saturday in several cities after the president urged them to liberate three states led by Democratic governors. Protests happened in Republican-led states, too, including at the Texas Capitol and in front of the Indiana governor\u2019s home. Texas Governor Greg Abbott already said that restrictions will begin easing next week. Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb who signed an agreement with six other Midwestern states to coordinate reopening said he would extend his stay-at-home order until 1 May. Trump, whose administration waited months to bolster stockpiles of key medical supplies and equipment, appeared to back protesters. LIBERATE MINNESOTA! LIBERATE MICHIGAN! LIBERATE VIRGINIA, Trump said in a tweet-storm in which he also lashed out at New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, for criticising the federal response. Cuomo should spend more time doing and less time complaining, the president said. US President Donald Trump warned on Saturday that China could face consequences if it was \u201cknowingly responsible\u201d for the coronavirus pandemic, in a press briefing at the White House that felt more like a rally, writes the Guardian\u2019s Washington Correspondent, David Smith: He bashed \u2018Sleepy Joe\u2019 Biden. He railed against the Russia investigation and \u2018fake people\u2019 in the media. He predicted that had he not been elected, the world might have ended. And somewhere along the way, he talked about the coronavirus. The past few weeks have seen a battle between Donald Trump, the president, and Donald Trump, the candidate. He has always been more comfortable in campaign mode and, slowly but surely, Trump the candidate is winning the struggle. Saturday was one of those days. New York\u2019s daily toll of coronavirus deaths hit its lowest point in more than two weeks, but Governor Andrew Cuomo warned Saturday that the state isn\u2019t ready to ease up on shutdowns of schools, businesses and gatherings. For those looking for something to celebrate, however, the state is untangling some red tape around tying the knot: New Yorkers will be able to get marriage licenses online and wed via video during the crisis. Many marriage bureaus have been closed because of the health emergency, leaving couples unable to get licenses because the state requires the betrothed to complete their application in person. But Cuomo is going to order that provision waived to let couples apply remotely, his office said Saturday. The state will also enable town and city clerks to conduct weddings by video. \u201cThere is now no excuse when the question comes up for marriage. No excuse. You can do it by Zoom. Yes or no,\u201d the governor said with a chuckle. Earlier this week, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio was asked at a news briefing about the possibility of online marriage applications, particularly for any couples seeking to wed so they could share health insurance after a job loss. Officials have said an estimated half-million city residents are out of work or likely to lose their jobs soon. Canada and the United States have agreed to extend border restrictions for another 30 days to help control the spread of coronavirus, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Saturday. Washington and Ottawa agreed last month to clamp down on non-essential travel while allowing trade to continue across their long shared frontier during the coronavirus outbreak. The agreement was due to expire this week. Trudeau says it will keep people on both sides of the border safe amid the pandemic. US President Donald Trump said Wednesday the US-Canada border will be among the first borders to open. Nearly 200,000 people normally cross the border daily. Paris\u2019 bus stops and metro entrances will be equipped with hand gel dispensers and commuters will likely be obliged to wear face masks to use public transport once coronavirus confinement measures are lifted, according to the city\u2019s mayor. France is due to start exiting its strict lockdown from 11 May, with schools set to reopen then, but the government has yet to spell out when businesses like cafes and cinemas can restart and to what extent people will be allowed to move around. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo told the Journal Du Dimanche (JDD) newspaper in an interview published on Sunday that hand gel would be made widely available as the French capital tries to keep the virus spread under control. This will include free dispensers at swimming pools, sports stadiums and nurseries, but also in the street and at bus stops, she said, adding that JCDecaux, a company known for making advertising billboards, was working on the scheme. Asked whether authorities in the broader Paris region should make it compulsory to wear face masks in metros and on commuter trains, Hidalgo said discussions on that were under way. Israel on Saturday approved some easing to its tight coronavirus restrictions while pointedly avoiding announcing the first stage of an exit from lockdown. In a televised address, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu outlined \u201ca responsible and gradual\u201d plan which would allow the return of some workers to offices and industry. He also promised to reopen some high street shops and allow a return to school for children with special educational needs, in groups of up to three. The measures are to take effect from Sunday, the first day of the Israeli week. By Saturday Istrael had registered 13,107 cases of the illness, with 158 fatalities. The past few days have seen a slowdown in new confirmed cases, but Netanyahu warned that if infection rates started climbing again there would be a fresh clampdown. More now on Spain, where Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Saturday announced the nationwide coronavirus lockdown would be extended two weeks to 9 May, hours after the official death toll passed 20,000. \u201cWe have done the hardest part through responsibility and social discipline... we are putting the most extreme moments behind us,\u201d Sanchez said. But Spaniards must not jeopardise the fragile gains made so far with hasty decisions. The restrictions currently in place would however be loosened slightly to allow children time outside from 27 April, said Sanchez. Until now only adults have been able to leave the house for specific reasons: to go to work, to go shopping for food or medicine, for a medical appointment or to work the dog. But there were growing calls to let children outside, as is permitted in most other countries observing a lockdown. Spain, which has been under confinement since March 14, has recorded 20,043 deaths from the virus, the latest health ministry figures showed - the third-highest official toll after the United States and Italy. We\u2019ll have Washington correspondent David Smith\u2019s story on the latest US developments shortly, but in the meantime, in case you missed it \u2013 US President Donald Trump warned on Saturday that China could face consequences if it was \u201cknowingly responsible\u201d for the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cIt could have been stopped in China before it started and it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Trump told reporters at a White House briefing. \u201cAnd now the whole world is suffering because of it.\u201d The Trump administration has said it doesn\u2019t rule out that the novel coronavirus was spread - accidentally - from a laboratory researching bats in Wuhan. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian - who previously alleged that the US military may have brought the virus into China - has rejected US media reports on the subject and said there is \u201cno scientific basis.\u201d Trump also cast doubt on official Chinese figures showing the country has suffered just 0.33 deaths per 100,000 people. \u201cThe number\u2019s impossible,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an impossible number to hit.\u201d The United States, according to a chart displayed at the briefing, has had 11.24 deaths per 100,000 people while France has had 27.92 and Spain 42.81. Ireland has successfully \u201cflattened the curve\u201d of coronavirus transmission and no longer expects a peak in infections, chief medical officer Tony Holohan said. \u201cWe think we\u2019ve flattened that [...] curve so much that there is no peak,\u201d he said on RTE\u2019s Late Late show on Friday. \u201cWe think we can go along at a low level and reduce it even further.\u201d He said nationwide adherence to a lockdown - imposed until 5 May - had \u201calready saved hundreds of lives and admissions to intensive care\u201d. There have been 530 Covid-19 related deaths and 13,980 confirmed cases of the virus in Ireland according to department of health figures released Friday. Ireland, like many other countries, had been bracing for a surge in cases, where transmission would peak and hospitals become overrun with patients. But Holohan said analysis shows the reproductive rate of the virus - the number of people a confirmed case typically spreads to - is now below one. \u201cThat means that on average a person who\u2019s infected is passing it down to less than one person,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you continue on that path, the rate of infection in the population will continue to drop.\u201d Concerns remain over the high number of cases and mortality in residential care homes across the republic. Around 60% of those who die from the virus come from long term residential care homes, Ireland\u2019s Health Service Executive reported Friday. British Muslims find new ways to be together for Ramadan under lockdown The world\u2019s 1.8bn Muslims are facing the most important period of the Islamic year, the holy month of Ramadan, which starts this week, under lockdown because of the global coronavirus pandemic. Mosques in most countries are shut and gatherings forbidden. The holy sites of Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia are under curfew. The al-Aqsa mosque and Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City are closed and prayers suspended. In the UK, the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) called for the suspension of all congregational activities at mosques and Islamic centres on 16 March, a week before the government announced all places of worship must close under the lockdown order. Hello and welcome to a new coronavirus live blog with me, Helen Sullivan. Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. As the number of people in Europe who have lost their lives in this pandemic so far approaches 100,000, Spain is planning to extend its lockdown. But in Italy, a church in Bergamo that served as a temporary morgue at the height of Italy\u2019s coronavirus epidemic \u201cis finally empty\u201d, the mayor said Saturday. Meanwhile in the US, Donald Trump has announced that some states will start reopening: Texas and Vermont will allow certain businesses to reopen on Monday while still observing coronavirus-related precautions and Montana will begin lifting restrictions on Friday. Several dozen protesters gathered in the Texas capital of Austin on Saturday, chanting \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d and \u201cLet us work!\u201d. Spain\u2019s PM to ask for extension of lockdown to 9 May. Spain\u2019s prime minister Pedro Sanchez said on Saturday he would ask parliament for a third 15-day extension of the lockdown imposed to curb one of the world\u2019s worst outbreaks of the new coronavirus, taking the restrictions up to 9 May. Restrictions to be lifted in some US states. Texas and Vermont will allow certain businesses to reopen on Monday while still observing coronavirus-related precautions and Montana will begin lifting restrictions on Friday. Some state governors have warned that they will not act prematurely to reopen their economies until there is more testing for the virus, however. Business leaders have also told Trump the country needs to have widespread testing in place before their companies can return to normal operations. Turkey\u2019s coronavirus cases overtake Iran to become highest in Middle East. Turkey\u2019s confirmed coronavirus cases have risen to 82,329, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said on Saturday, overtaking neighbouring Iran for the first time to register the highest total in the Middle East. Morocco has extended its lockdown measures by another month. Morocco will extend lockdown measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus for another month until May 20, the government said on Saturday. France reports 642 more coronavirus deaths as country\u2019s toll hits 19,323. France registered 642 more deaths from coronavirus infections on Saturday, bringing the total to 19,323, the fourth-highest tally in the world, although the number of people in hospital declined for a fourth day running. UK\u2019s Covid-19 hospital death toll surpasses 15,000. In the UK, the official Covid-19 death toll has passed 15,000 \u2013 with 888 new fatalities recorded in the last 24 hours. It means as of 5pm on Friday, of those hospitalised in the UK who have tested positive for coronavirus, 15,464 people have died. Bangladesh garment workers pack streets to demand wages during coronavirus lockdown. Hundreds of workers in Bangladesh have taken to the streets in defiance of physical distancing rules to demand unpaid wages during the Covid-19 shutdown. New York daily death toll at two-week low. Deaths in New York State rose by 540 on Friday, the lowest daily death tally since the beginning of April.Andrew Cuomo, the state\u2019s governor, said new hospital admissions stayed around the 2,000-patient mark, which he said was still an \u201coverwhelming number\u201d. Some shops in Iran have reopened as country\u2019s daily death toll fell to 73. Iran allowed some businesses in the capital Tehran to reopen on Saturday as the country\u2019s daily death toll from coronavirus fell to 73, its lowest in more than a month. Croatia extends its lockdown for another 15 days. Croatia is extending its coronavirus lockdown for another 15 days, but a minister says the country is exploring the possibility of gradually easing restrictions.",
