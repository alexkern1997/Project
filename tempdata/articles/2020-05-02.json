Here\u2019s a rundown of the day\u2019s biggest news:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FDA has approved remdesivir for emergency use on hospitalized coronavirus patients. </strong>A drug trial of remdesivir showed a positive effect on coronavirus patients\u2019 recovery time and survival rate. Dr <strong>Anthony Fauci </strong>said earlier this week, \u201cThe data shows that remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery. ... What it has proven is that a drug can block this virus.\u201d</li> <li><strong>White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany held her first daily briefing. </strong>It was the first time in more than a year that a White House press secretary had held a formal briefing. McEnany promised to never lie from the White House podium, but she went on to share several false or misleading statements about sexual misconduct allegations against <strong>Trump </strong>and the FBI investigation of former national security adviser <strong>Michael Flynn, </strong>among other things.</li> <li><strong>Joe Biden denied Tara Reade\u2019s allegation of sexual assault. </strong>The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee said in an MSNBC interview, \u201cI\u2019m saying unequivocally, it never, never happened.\u201d</li> <li><strong>Donald Trump said he expects up to</strong><strong> 100,000 Americans will die</strong> of Covid-19. \u201cHopefully we\u2019re going to come in below that 100,000 lives lost, which is a horrible number nevertheless.\u201d The president had previously said he expected 60,000 - 70,000 fatalities in the US. </li> <li><strong>New York schools will remain closed for the rest of the academic year, </strong>governor <strong>Andrew Cuomo </strong>announced. The news was unsurprising considering the state reported another 1,000 new coronavirus hospitalizations yesterday, but the daily death toll has fallen slightly to 289.</li> <li><strong>Trump said Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer should \u201cmake a deal\u201d with anti-stay-at-home protesters. </strong>The president\u2019s suggestion came one day after demonstrators, some of them carrying assault rifles, swarmed the Michigan state capitol to protest Whitmer\u2019s stay-at-home order. Whitmer rejected the idea of making a deal during a public health emergency, but said some outdoor work will be allowed to resume next week. </li> <li><strong>The White House blocked Dr Anthony Fauci from testifying</strong> before a House subcommittee looking into the coronavirus response. Former CDC director <strong>Tom Frieden </strong>will testify instead. </li> <li><strong>California governor Gavin Newsom <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/01/california-coronavirus-protests-huntington-beach-sacramento\">promised \u201cmeaningful\u201d adjustments</a></strong> to stay-at-home orders in the coming days.

Trump\u2019s \u201cnavigable waters protection rule\u201d, which was published in January, narrows the definition of waterways to exclude ephemeral streams, wetlands, creeks and other headwaters which do not have visible water 365 days a year because they run intermittently or temporarily underground. For example, 90% of streams that connect to the Colorado river, which supplies water to seven western US states and two in northern Mexico, run only after rainfall or snowmelt.</p> <p>The rule, which has attracted widespread criticism from scientists, environmentalists, and the tourism sector, replaces an Obama era regulation that strengthened protection for about 60% of the nation\u2019s interconnected waterways. But it goes much further than just repealing Obama\u2019s 2015 rule, by allowing landowners and developers to dump directly into hundreds of thousands of waterways, and to destroy or fill in wetlands for construction projects.</p> <p>\u201cAccess to clean water is a fundamental right for all Americans. Trump\u2019s dirty water rule ignores the law and science and is a reckless rollback of clean water protections \u2026 which benefits industry polluters and harms countless Americans,\u201d said <strong>Letitia James</strong>, New York\u2019s attorney general, at a virtual press conference today.</p> <p>The lawsuit argues that the new rule will result in more pollution, flooding, and harm to fish and wildlife across the country \u2014 undermining decades of work to protect and enhance water resources - and will result in widespread economic losses.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going into this fight with our three most reliable allies: the facts, science and the law,\u201d said <strong>Xavier Becerra</strong>, California\u2019s attorney general. In California, more than 40% of streams and half of all wetlands have been stripped of protection under the new definition, said Becerra. \u201cEven during the coronavirus pandemic, the administration hasn\u2019t stopped.\u201d He added, \u201cThe latest actions come at a time when the nation\u2019s health and economy can least afford it.\u201d</p> <p>The lawsuit, co-led by New York and Califnronia, was filed today in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Also suing are the attorneys generals of Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, the District of Columbia and the City of New York.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/01/water-shutoffs-us-coronavirus-utilities-economy\">'It feels like nobody cares': the Americans living without running water amid Covid-19</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5eac76868f082b32fdd6bbf0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/martin-pengelly\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-01T19:39:01.134Z\">8.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Donald Trump has <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/01/trump-tells-biden-to-fight-tara-reade-sexual-assault-allegation.html\">passed further comment</a> on the <strong>allegation against Joe Biden</strong>, in an interview with Fox News commentator and podcast host Dan Bongino.</p> <p>\u201cI would just say to Joe Biden, \u2018Just go out and fight it,\u2019\u201d Trump said, adding in typically contradictory style: \u201cHe\u2019s gonna have to make his own decision, I\u2019m not going to be telling him what to do.

This never happened.'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Joe Biden has emphatically denied a sexual assault allegation against him, breaking weeks of silence to address the accusation that has roiled his campaign. </p> <p>\u201c<strong>They aren\u2019t true. This never happened</strong>,\u201d he said in a statement, released moments before his Friday appearance on Morning Joe. </p> <p>Tara Reade accused Biden of sexually assaulting her in the basement of an office building on Capitol Hill in 1993, when she was an aide in his Senate office. His campaign refuted the allegation in a statement, but this is Biden\u2019s first public comment on the accusation.</p> <p>He also calls on the National Archives to release any record of a complaint Reade said she filed. </p> <p>Here is the statement in its entirety: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>April was Sexual Assault Awareness Month. Every year, at this time, we talk about awareness, prevention, and the importance of women feeling they can step forward, say something, and be heard. That belief \u2013 that women should be heard \u2013 was the underpinning of a law I wrote over 25 years ago. To this day, I am most proud of the Violence Against Women Act. So, each April we are reminded not only of how far we have come in dealing with sexual assault in this country \u2013 but how far we still have to go.</p> <p>When I wrote the bill, few wanted to talk about the issue. It was considered a private matter, a personal matter, a family matter. I didn\u2019t see it that way. To me, freedom from fear, harm, and violence for women was a legal right, a civil right, and a human right. And I knew we had to change not only the law, but the culture. <br><br>So, we held hours of hearings and heard from the most incredibly brave women \u2013 and we opened the eyes of the Senate and the nation \u2013 and passed the law.<br><br>In the years that followed, I fought to continually strengthen the law. So, when we took office and President Obama asked me what I wanted, I told him I wanted oversight of the critical appointments in the Office on Violence Against Women at the Department of Justice and I wanted a senior White House Advisor appointing directly to me on the issue. Both of those things happened.<br><br>As Vice President, we started the \u201cIt\u2019s on Us\u201d campaign on college campuses to send the message loud and clear that dating violence is violence \u2013 and against the law. <br><br>We had to get men involved. They had to be part of the solution. That\u2019s why I made a point of telling young men this was their problem too \u2013 they couldn\u2019t turn a blind eye to what was happening around them \u2013 they had a responsibility to speak out. Silence is complicity. <br><br>In the 26 years since the law passed, the culture and perceptions have changed but we\u2019re not done yet.<br><br>It\u2019s on us, and it\u2019s on me as someone who wants to lead this country. I recognize my responsibility to be a voice, an advocate, and a leader for the change in culture that has begun but is nowhere near finished. So I want to address allegations by a former staffer that I engaged in misconduct 27 years ago.<br><br>They aren\u2019t true. This never happened.</p> <p>While the details of these allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault are complicated, two things are not complicated. One is that women deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and when they step forward they should be heard, not silenced. The second is that their stories should be subject to appropriate inquiry and scrutiny. <br><br>Responsible news organizations should examine and evaluate the full and growing record of inconsistencies in her story, which has changed repeatedly in both small and big ways. <br><br>But this much bears emphasizing.<br><br>She has said she raised some of these issues with her supervisor and senior staffers from my office at the time. They \u2013 both men and a woman \u2013 have said, unequivocally, that she never came to them and complained or raised issues. News organizations that have talked with literally dozens of former staffers have not found one \u2013 not one \u2013 who corroborated her allegations in any way. Indeed, many of them spoke to the culture of an office that would not have tolerated harassment in any way \u2013 as indeed I would not have.<br><br>There is a clear, critical part of this story that can be verified. The former staffer has said she filed a complaint back in 1993. But she does not have a record of this alleged complaint. The papers from my Senate years that I donated to the University of Delaware do not contain personnel files. It is the practice of Senators to establish a library of personal papers that document their public record: speeches, policy proposals, positions taken, and the writing of bills. <br><br>There is only one place a complaint of this kind could be \u2013 the National Archives. The National Archives is where the records are kept at what was then called the Office of Fair Employment Practices. I am requesting that the Secretary of the Senate ask the Archives to identify any record of the complaint she alleges she filed and make available to the press any such document. If there was ever any such complaint, the record will be there.<br><br>As a Presidential candidate, I\u2019m accountable to the American people. We have lived long enough with a President who doesn\u2019t think he is accountable to anyone, and takes responsibility for nothing. That\u2019s not me. I believe being accountable means having the difficult conversations, even when they are uncomfortable. People need to hear the truth.<br><br>I have spent my career learning from women the ways in which we as individuals and as policy makers need to step up to make their hard jobs easier, with equal pay, equal opportunity, and workplaces and homes free from violence and harassment. I know how critical women\u2019s health issues and basic women\u2019s rights are. That has been a constant through my career, and as President, that work will continue. And I will continue to learn from women, to listen to women, to support women, and yes, to make sure women\u2019s voices are heard.<br><br>We have a lot of work to do. From confronting online harassment, abuse, and stalking, to ending the rape kit backlog, to addressing the deadly combination of guns and domestic violence. <br><br>We need to protect and empower the most marginalized communities, including immigrant and indigenous women, trans women, and women of color. <br><br>We need to make putting an end to gender-based violence in both the United States and around the world a top priority. <br><br>I started my work over 25 years ago with the passage of the Violence Against Women Act. As president, I\u2019m committed to finishing the job.</p> </blockquote> <p>Read it <a href=\"https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-7a9593bd3012\">here</a>: </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-01T12:03:29.178Z\">at 1.03pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5eac004f8f08f76ffc19f64a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-01T11:59:37.376Z\">12.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Good morning \u2026</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>\u2026and welcome to another day of coverage of the coronavirus outbreak \u2013 and politics, both concerning the pandemic and tilted towards the election in November \u2013 in the US.</p> <p>The main news of the morning is that <strong>Joe Biden</strong>, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, will appear on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe to answer questions for the first time about <strong>an allegation of sexual assault against him</strong>. </p> <p>In advance of the interview, Biden issued a statement:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I recognize my responsibility to be a voice, an advocate, and a leader for the change in culture that has begun but is nowhere near finished.

Here\u2019s a rundown of the day\u2019s biggest news: The FDA has approved remdesivir for emergency use on hospitalized coronavirus patients. A drug trial of remdesivir showed a positive effect on coronavirus patients\u2019 recovery time and survival rate. Dr Anthony Fauci said earlier this week, \u201cThe data shows that remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery. ... What it has proven is that a drug can block this virus.\u201d White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany held her first daily briefing. It was the first time in more than a year that a White House press secretary had held a formal briefing. McEnany promised to never lie from the White House podium, but she went on to share several false or misleading statements about sexual misconduct allegations against Trump and the FBI investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn, among other things. Joe Biden denied Tara Reade\u2019s allegation of sexual assault. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee said in an MSNBC interview, \u201cI\u2019m saying unequivocally, it never, never happened.\u201d Donald Trump said he expects up to 100,000 Americans will die of Covid-19. \u201cHopefully we\u2019re going to come in below that 100,000 lives lost, which is a horrible number nevertheless.\u201d The president had previously said he expected 60,000 - 70,000 fatalities in the US. New York schools will remain closed for the rest of the academic year, governor Andrew Cuomo announced. The news was unsurprising considering the state reported another 1,000 new coronavirus hospitalizations yesterday, but the daily death toll has fallen slightly to 289. Trump said Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer should \u201cmake a deal\u201d with anti-stay-at-home protesters. The president\u2019s suggestion came one day after demonstrators, some of them carrying assault rifles, swarmed the Michigan state capitol to protest Whitmer\u2019s stay-at-home order. Whitmer rejected the idea of making a deal during a public health emergency, but said some outdoor work will be allowed to resume next week. The White House blocked Dr Anthony Fauci from testifying before a House subcommittee looking into the coronavirus response. Former CDC director Tom Frieden will testify instead. California governor Gavin Newsom promised \u201cmeaningful\u201d adjustments to stay-at-home orders in the coming days. Meanwhile, protesters gathered in the capital of Sacramento and in Orange county\u2019s Huntington Beach. Read our full reports on the day in Washington, the latest from California, and the emergency use authorization of the new coronavirus drug here. And stay up to date with all the latest news with our global live blog, which continues here: Fact check: voter fraud Donald Trump is back on Twitter, where he is misleadingly linking voting by mail to \u201crigged elections\u201d. There is no evidence of widespread voting fraud. The non-partisan Brennan Center for Justice found in 2017 that the risk of voting fraud is between 0.00004% and 0.0009%. Moreover, Trump\u2019s own voting integrity commission found no evidence to support claims of widespread fraud. Mail ballot fraud is also very rare. In North Carolina, an election was overturned in 2018 after a Republican political operative was alleged to have directed workers to collect and mail in other people\u2019s absentee ballots during the 2018 Republican congressional primary and during the 2016 general election. But states can avoid that sort of fraud by implementing ballot tracking, providing prepaid postage and setting ballot boxes and drop-off sites. Five states already conduct their elections entirely by mail, and have found ways to ensure the integrity of ballots. Although the president now says he opposes voting by mail due to fraud conerns, he previously said efforts to make it easier to vote would mean \u201cyou\u2019d never have a Republican elected in this country again\u201d. Read more: The House hearing on the coronavirus response will go on without Fauci, however. Dr Tom Frieden, who served as the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) during the Obama administration, will testify. Representatives Nina Lowey and Rosa DeLaura, chairs of the House appropriation committee and Labor-HHS-Education subcommittee, issued the following statement: Congress and the American public deserve a clear-eyed view of the path forward for responding to the Covid-19 pandemic. In the short-term, that entails what our federal government is doing on surveillance, testing, contact tracing, quarantining, social distancing, and the production and distribution of personal protective equipment. Over the medium-term, we need to understand the viability of therapeutics and vaccines in development, their dissemination, and how the influenza season could affect the ongoing pandemic in the Fall. And over the long-term, we need ensure lasting investments in our public health infrastructure are made instead of reacting to public health crises when they arise. The people of this country deserve a federal government that is up-to-date, modernized, and prepared to protect lives. We look forward to the hearing next week with Dr. Tom Frieden, former Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and one of the world\u2019s foremost public health experts. The White House is blocking Dr Anthony Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious disease doctor, from testifying before Congress next week. Evan Hollander, a spokesman for the House appropriations committee, told the Washington Post that the committee had asked Fauci to appear on 6 May, but was rebuffed by the White House. The White House confirmed the report to Reuters, saying in a statement: \u201cWhile the Trump administration continues its whole-of-government response to Covid-19, including safely opening up America again and expediting vaccine development, it is counter-productive to have the very individuals involved in those efforts appearing at congressional hearings. We are committed to working with Congress to offer testimony at the appropriate time.\u201d Fauci is the longtime director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. A respected and accomplished scientist, he has at times drawn the ire of Trump supporters for advocating for public health measures or contradicting Trump. Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer said Friday that Michigan will remain under stay-at-home orders through 15 May, despite Republican lawmaker in the states refusing to extend her emergency declaration, the AP reports. The order will allow for some outdoor work, such as forestry, power equipment maintenance and construction, to resume next Thursday. Earlier today, Donald Trump tweeted that Whitmer should \u201cgive a little\u201d and \u201cmake a deal\u201d with a small group of protesters, some of them armed, who have held demonstrations at the state capital urging a reopening of the state. \u201cThe governor of Michigan should give a little, and put out the fire,\u201d Trump said in a tweet on Friday morning. \u201cThese are very good people, but they are angry. They want their lives back again, safely! See them, talk to them, make a deal.\u201d Whitmer called the protests \u201cdisturbing\u201d and said that the presence of swastikas, Confederate flags, nooses and assault weapons \u201cdo not represent who we are as Michiganders\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re not in a political crisis where we should just negotiate and find some common ground here. We\u2019re in a public health crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the midst of a global pandemic that has already killed almost 4,000 people in our state.\u201d The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has released additional information about its emergency use authorization (EUA) for remdesivir, the anti-viral drug that has shown some promise as a treatment for patients with Covid-19. Donald Trump announced the EUA earlier today. Use of the drug will be authorized for adults or children who are hospitalized with suspected or confirmed Covid-19 and whose condition is \u201csevere\u201d, meaning they have low blood oxygen levels, need oxygen therapy, or are on a mechanical ventilator, the FDA said. \u201cBased on evaluation of the emergency use authorization criteria and the scientific evidence available, it was determined that it is reasonable to believe that remdesivir may be effective in treating COVID-19, and that, given there are no adequate, approved, or available alternative treatments, the known and potential benefits to treat this serious or life-threatening virus currently outweigh the known and potential risks of the drug\u2019s use,\u201d the FDA said in its statement. The EUA also includes information about possible side effects, which include \u201cincreased levels of liver enzymes, which may be a sign of inflammation or damage to cells in the liver; and infusion-related reactions, which may include low blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, sweating, and shivering\u201d. It also notes that there may be other serious side effects that have not been discovered yet. The EUA requires hospitals to monitor patients\u2019 liver enzymes through blood tests before the treatment is started and every day that treatment is ongoing. Patients who receive the drug will be provided with a fact sheet, which is available here. The drug is administered through an IV once a day for up to 10 days. Donald Trump appears to have revised upward to 100,000 his expectations for the number of Americans who will die of Covid-19. \u201cHopefully we\u2019re going to come in below that 100,000 lives lost, which is a horrible number nevertheless,\u201d Trump said at a White House event to honor people who are doing work related to the coronavirus pandemic, according to Reuters. On Monday, Trump had said that the death toll would likely be between 60,000 and 70,000. As of Friday, it stand at 64,198. Trump has changed his predictions over time. On Friday, he claimed that the White House\u2019s actions had saved \u201cmaybe millions of lives\u201d. The last patient has left the field hospital that was erected in New York City\u2019s Javits convention center, the AP reports. The emergency facility was erected by the members of the US military to alleviate strain on the city\u2019s hospital system at the height of the outbreak. It ultimately treated 1,095 patients, the last 8 of whom left the hospital today. The closure of the emergency hospital is another hopeful sign that conditions in New York are improving, though the crisis is by no means over. On Friday, New York governor Andrew Cuomo reported a daily death toll of 289. Hello everyone, this is Julia Carrie Wong in Oakland, California, picking up the blog for the rest of the day. As we head into the weekend, and with the weather improving around the country, the question of whether people should be allowed to go to beach is inspiring debate and protest. In California, where Governor Gavin Newsom ordered the closure of beaches in Orange County, hundreds of people staged a protest in Huntington Beach. Meanwhile, in Florida, the beaches have been opened, and not everyone is happy about it. This local lawyer, who dressed as the Grim Reaper, granted an interview to a local TV reporter, and argued that it is simply too soon for the beaches to be open. My colleague Sam Levin spoke to several experts about the potential risks and rewards of allowing people to go to beaches during this pandemic. You can read his full report here: That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Julia Carrie Wong, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The FDA has approved remdesivir for emergency use on hospitalized coronavirus patients. A drug trial of remdesivir showed a positive effect on coronavirus patients\u2019 recovery time and survival rate.

Julia will have more coming up, so stay tuned. FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn was careful to note that remdesivir has not received FDA approval as a coronavirus treatment and has only been approved for emergency use on severely ill coronavirus patients who have been hospitalized. FDA approval requires a much more lengthy review process, while an emergency use authorization is issued more quickly after the agency weighs the potential risks and potential benefits of a treatment option to help address an emergency situation. \u201cToday\u2019s action is an important step in our efforts to collaborate with innovators and researchers to provide sick patients timely access to new therapies where appropriate, while at the same time supporting research to further evaluate whether they are safe and effective,\u201d Hahn said in a statement. \u201cThere\u2019s tremendous interest among all parties to identify and arm ourselves with medicines to combat COVID-19, and through our Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program, the FDA is working around-the-clock and using every tool at our disposal to speed these efforts.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Lois Beckett reports on the latest from California: As many as 1000 people rallied against California governor Gavin Newsom\u2019s stay-at-home measures in Sacramento, the state\u2019s capitol, as hundreds more protested in conservative Huntington Beach. In his Friday news conference, Newsom said he empathized with the protesters\u2019 \u201cfrustration and concern and deeply understandable anxiety about the economy and the fate and future of their families.\u201d Asked about his response to protesters calling him a tyrant and a fasicst, Newsom was gentle. \u201cAll I ask for is: Take care of yourself,\u201d he said. \u201cWear a face covering. Do justice to physical distancing. You don\u2019t want to contract this disease.\u201d The governor said that law enforcement officials were responsible for deciding how to respond to protesters violating social distancing orders, and that he could not possibly monitor every protest happening across the state. \u201cI have confidence in local law enforcement, incredible confidence,\u201d Newsom said, passing on responsibility for the fraught question of whether people violating social distancing guidelines at protests should be arrested. In Sacramento, where many protesters were flouting social distancing guidelines, at least one person had been arrested, according to a Sacramento Bee reporter. The Guardian\u2019s Lois Beckett reports on the latest from California: California governor Gavin Newsom promised \u201cmeaningful\u201d adjustments to the state\u2019s stay-at-home order in \u201cmany days, not weeks,\u201d as small rallies to reopen the economy attracted hundreds of people in the state\u2019s capital and in Huntington Beach, a more conservative city south of Los Angeles. Newsom said that the state was \u201cgetting very close\u201d to making changes that would affect how businesses, including restaurants, could operate, and urged residents to be patient. More than 2,000 people have died of coronavirus in California so far, including 91 people in the previous day, but the number of patients in intensive care units stayed flat, and the total number of hospitalizations had fallen slightly, both signs of progress, Newsom said in his Friday press conference. But, Newsom said, \u201cWe can screw all that up and set all that back by making bad decisions.\u201d The positive signs in the number of hospitalizations and ICU patients was only possible \u201cbecause people have done an incredible job in their physical distancing.\u201d \u201cThousands of people congregating together, not practicing social distancing or physical distancing,\u201d could undermine the current progress in preventing the spread of the virus, Newsom said. \u201cIf we can avoid that, we can get to the other side with modifications a lot quicker,\u201d the governor added. Gilead, the company that makes remdesivir, said it would donate 1.5 million doses of the drug to the US now that it has been approved for emergency use on hospitalized coronavirus patients. FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn said the drug\u2019s approval for emergency use represented \u201can important clinical advance\u201d in the fight against coronavirus. Gilead CEO Daniel O\u2019Day said earlier today that his company has already ramped up production of the drug and hopes to make millions of treatment courses available by the end of the year. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to note that this is a medicine for the most severe patients,\u201d O\u2019Day told the \u201cToday\u201d show. \u201cWhat we see here is really, of course, not a cure but a very, very significant and important treatment for patients.\u201d Trump told reporters that the drug remedesivir has been approved for emergency use to treat coronavirus patients. FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn clarified that the drug had specifically been cleared for emergency use on hospitalized coronavirus patients. The president said the approval represented a \u201cvery promising situation\u201d in the country\u2019s fight against coronavirus, and Dr Deborah Birx added, \u201cI think this really illustrates what can happen in such a short time.\u201d The emergency approval comes days after Dr Anthony Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious disease expert, expressed cautious optimism about the results of a remdesivir drug trial. \u201cThe data shows that remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery,\u201d Fauci said earlier this week. \u201cWhat it has proven is that a drug can block this virus.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Nina Lakhani reports on a multi-state lawsuit to protect the country\u2019s waterways: A coalition of states is suing the Trump administration\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) over its so-called \u201cdirty water rule,\u201d which eliminates legal protections for hundreds of thousands of streams, creeks and wetlands across the country. The lawsuit claims that the Trump administration\u2019s new rule contradicts the 1972 Clean Water Act, supreme court precedent and the EPA\u2019s own scientific findings. Trump\u2019s \u201cnavigable waters protection rule\u201d, which was published in January, narrows the definition of waterways to exclude ephemeral streams, wetlands, creeks and other headwaters which do not have visible water 365 days a year because they run intermittently or temporarily underground. For example, 90% of streams that connect to the Colorado river, which supplies water to seven western US states and two in northern Mexico, run only after rainfall or snowmelt. The rule, which has attracted widespread criticism from scientists, environmentalists, and the tourism sector, replaces an Obama era regulation that strengthened protection for about 60% of the nation\u2019s interconnected waterways. But it goes much further than just repealing Obama\u2019s 2015 rule, by allowing landowners and developers to dump directly into hundreds of thousands of waterways, and to destroy or fill in wetlands for construction projects. \u201cAccess to clean water is a fundamental right for all Americans. Trump\u2019s dirty water rule ignores the law and science and is a reckless rollback of clean water protections \u2026 which benefits industry polluters and harms countless Americans,\u201d said Letitia James, New York\u2019s attorney general, at a virtual press conference today. The lawsuit argues that the new rule will result in more pollution, flooding, and harm to fish and wildlife across the country \u2014 undermining decades of work to protect and enhance water resources - and will result in widespread economic losses. \u201cWe\u2019re going into this fight with our three most reliable allies: the facts, science and the law,\u201d said Xavier Becerra, California\u2019s attorney general. In California, more than 40% of streams and half of all wetlands have been stripped of protection under the new definition, said Becerra. \u201cEven during the coronavirus pandemic, the administration hasn\u2019t stopped.\u201d He added, \u201cThe latest actions come at a time when the nation\u2019s health and economy can least afford it.\u201d The lawsuit, co-led by New York and Califnronia, was filed today in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Also suing are the attorneys generals of Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, the District of Columbia and the City of New York. Donald Trump has passed further comment on the allegation against Joe Biden, in an interview with Fox News commentator and podcast host Dan Bongino. \u201cI would just say to Joe Biden, \u2018Just go out and fight it,\u2019\u201d Trump said, adding in typically contradictory style: \u201cHe\u2019s gonna have to make his own decision, I\u2019m not going to be telling him what to do. Biden is gonna have to go out and fight his own battles.\u201d Trump also said he found Tara Reade\u2019s allegation of an assault in 1993 \u201ccredible\u201d and said that when he has to deal with such allegations, he likes \u201cto get in front of it and I just deny it.\u201d More than 20 women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct or assault, allegations he denies. At the White House on Friday, new press secretary Kayleigh McEnany was asked about the accusations against Trump. She responded by scolding the media, saying \u201cthe president has swiftly denied all of these allegations that were raised four years ago\u201d and claiming questions about the allegations were \u201casked and answered in the form of the vote of the American people\u201d. \u201cLeave it to the media to really take an issue about the former vice-president and turn it on the president,\u201d she said. In fact, accusations against Trump have surfaced since the 2016 election: the advice columnist E Jean Carroll said he raped her at a Manhattan department store in the mid-1990s: Carroll took Trump to court. So did Summer Zervos, a former contestant on The Apprentice. The National Archives has responded to Joe Biden\u2019s interview with MSNBC and lengthy statement denying the allegation of sexual assault against him, telling HuffPo\u2019s Amanda Terkel: \u201cAny records of Senate personnel complaints from 1993 would have remained under the control of the Senate. Accordingly, inquiries related to these records should be directed to the Senate.\u201d Biden said the National Archives would hold such records, if they existed. The following is from Lauren Gambino\u2019s report: Morning Joe co-host Mika Brzezinski repeatedly asked Biden if he would authorize a search of his Senate papers, as a matter of transparency. He declined, insisting the records \u201cdo not contain personnel files\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019re not there,\u201d he said. Asked if he was confident no such complaint existed, Biden offered a qualified response: \u201cI know of no one who was aware any complaint was made.\u201d He also said there were no non-disclosure agreements from his time in public office that would prevent women from speaking out. \u201cThere are no NDAs signed,\u201d he said. \u201cPeriod. None.\u201d Here\u2019s the full report: Another important note about the sexual misconduct allegations against Trump: it is not accurate to say the issue is years-old, as press secretary Kayleigh McEnany claimed. \u201cYou\u2019re bringing up issues ... from four years ago that were asked and answered, and the American people had their say in the matter,\u201d McEnany said. \u201cLeave it to the media to really take an issue about the former vice president and turn it on the president.\u201d But advice columnist E Jean Carroll said in June that Trump raped her in the mid-1990s, an allegation that the president has denied, and a defamation lawsuit from one of Trump\u2019s accusers is currently on hold in New York. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany has just concluded her first daily briefing, and she made a point to bring up the case of former national security adviser Michael Flynn. The president has signaled interest in a potential pardon for his former adviser, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in 2017. McEnany said the FBI\u2019s handling of Flynn\u2019s case \u201cshould scare every American,\u201d insisting there was an \u201cunfair target\u201d on the former official\u2019s back. But just to reiterate: Flynn himself pleaded guilty to lying to investigators about his contact with the former Russian ambassador to the US. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said of Joe Biden\u2019s interview this morning about Tara Reade\u2019s claim, \u201cWe are pleased that Joe Biden decided to go on the record.\u201d But when asked about the fact that Trump has been accused of sexual misconduct by dozens of women, McEnany accused the media of unnecessarily resurrecting a years-old issue. \u201cThe president has swiftly denied all of these allegations that were raised four years ago,\u201d McEnany said, going on to argue that questions about the allegations were \u201casked and answered in the form of the vote of the American people.\u201d More than a dozen women have accused the president of sexual misconduct, and the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape included audio of Trump describing grabbing women\u2019s genitals. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany reacted to Trump\u2019s claim that Tara Reade, who has accused Joe Biden of sexual assault, was more compelling than the women who accused now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct. McEnany responded by saying Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearings were a \u201cgrave miscarriage of justice,\u201d and she claimed that the allegations against him were \u201csalacious, awful and verifiably false.\u201d It is not accurate to say that the allegations against Kavanaugh were \u201cverifiably false.\u201d In her Senate testimony, Christine Blasey Ford extensively detailed an allegation of sexual assault against Kavanaugh, and it was not proven to be \u201cverifiably false.\u201d The Republican-led Senate confirmed Kavanaugh in the closest Supreme Court vote in history. Asked about possible retaliatory measures the US might take against China for its handling of coronavirus, press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said she did not want to get ahead of Trump on that. But McEnany added, \u201cIt is no secret that China mishandled this situation.\u201d The press secretary was also pressed on the president\u2019s claims of having seen evidence that coronavirus was created in a Chinese government lab. The office of the director of national intelligence said yesterday the intelligence community \u201cconcurs with the wide scientific consensus that the Covid-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified\u201d. \u201cIntelligence is just an estimate,\u201d McEnany said. This one is worth keeping for future reference: White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany pledged to never lie from the briefing room podium. \u201cI will never lie to you,\u201d McEnany told journalists after one reporter asked if she would make such a pledge. \u201cYou have my word on that.\u201d The promise is notable considering one of McEnany\u2019s predecessors, Sean Spicer, began his tenure by sharing false and outlandish claims about the size of the crowd at Trump\u2019s inauguration. Kayleigh McEnany, the president\u2019s new press secretary, is now holding her first White House daily briefing since assuming her role last month. This is also the first formal briefing held by a press secretary in more than a year. Trump and the White House coronavirus task force have held regular briefings since the start of the crisis, but the president\u2019s press secretary has not held a briefing since March 2019, when Sarah Huckabee Sanders suspended the practice. McEnany began by detailing the $12 billion being distributed to 395 hospitals as part of the most recent coronavirus relief bill. Senator Mitt Romney is intrdoucing legislation to give essential workers hazard pay, arguing those on the front lines of the pandemic deserve more financial assistance from the government. Romney proposed giving essential workers an additional $12 an hour for the months of May, June and July. The Utah Republican said employers would cover a quarter of the cost, while the federal government would cover the other three quarters. \u201cHealth care professionals, grocery store workers, food processors, and many others\u2014the unsung patriots on the frontline of this pandemic\u2014every day risk their safety for the health and well-being of our country, and they deserve our unwavering support,\u201d Romney said in a statement. \u201cPatriot Pay is a way for us to reward our essential workers as they continue to keep Americans safe, healthy, and fed.\u201d In an interview with the Washington Post, Romney noted that some essential workers, such as grocery store employees, may be making less money than those who are receiving unemployment benefits. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair, number one,\u201d Romney said. \u201cAnd number two, it would create an anomaly, of course, for people to be taking additional risk of their health and have someone else not working making more than they are.\u201d The executive director of the World Health Organization reiterated that the group believes coronavirus came about naturally, despite Trump\u2019s dubious claims that he has seen evidence it was created in a Chinese government lab. \u201cWe have listened again and again to numerous scientists who looked at the sequences and looked at this virus and we are assured that this virus is natural in origin,\u201d WHO executive director Michael J. Ryan said Friday. Just yesterday, Trump claimed he had seen evidence that coronavirus was made in a lab in China\u2019s Wuhan region, which saw the first outbreak of the virus. Asked what evidence he had seen, Trump said, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you that. I\u2019m not allowed to tell you that.\u201d The president\u2019s comments came hours after the office of the director of national intelligence said in a statement that the intelligence community \u201cconcurs with the wide scientific consensus that the Covid-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified\u201d. Michael Cohen was also separately told yesterday that he must cease writing a tell-all book about his time working for Trump, according to ABC News. ABC News reports: Cohen received a letter from lawyers representing the Trump Organization demanding Cohen halt writing a \u2018tell-all book\u2019 about his time working for the president, according to sources familiar with the matter. Charles Harder, the attorney representing the company, writes that Cohen signed a non-disclosure agreement when he joined the Trump Organization and thus it would prohibit him from disclosing certain information about the president, his family and the company. Cohen worked for Trump as a lawyer and fixer, and he was deeply involved in a scheme to pay hush money to women who alleged they had extramarital affairs with the president before he ran for office. Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former lawyer and fixer, has reportedly had his approval for early release from prison reversed. ABC News reports: Two weeks ago, the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) had notified Cohen that he would be released early from prison due to the COVID-19 outbreak, Cohen\u2019s attorney Roger Adler told ABC News at the time. Cohen is serving a 3-year sentence at the federal prison camp in Otisville, New York, where several staff and inmates have tested positive for the novel coronavirus. ... It appears that all of the prisoners at Otisville who were granted home confinement have lost those privileges, according to the sources. The BOP has not responded to requests for comment from ABC News. Cohen, who pleaded guilty in 2018 to tax fraud, campaign finance violations and lying to Congress, was originally scheduled for release in November 2021. The Trump campaign accused Joe Biden of applying a double standard after the presumptive Democratic nominee denied Tara Reade\u2019s sexual assault allegation. Erin Perrine, the Trump camapign\u2019s principal deputy communications director, said in a statement, \u201cThe only thing Joe Biden did today was dig himself a deeper hole.\u201d Perrine noted Biden previously demanded that former Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg release women from non-disclosure agreements about claims of sexual harassment at his company. \u201cBiden has a different definition of transparency than he sets for others.\u201d Perrine said. \u201cThe double standard exhibited by Biden, prominent liberal women\u2019s groups, and Democrat elected officials \u2013 some of whom want to be Biden\u2019s running mate \u2013 is glaring and cannot be allowed to stand.\u201d A number of anti-sexual assault groups have called for a full investigation of Reade\u2019s claim, while applauding Biden for directly addressing the allegation, unlike the president. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Joe Biden denied Tara Reade\u2019s allegation of sexual assault. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee told MSNBC, \u201cIt is not true. I\u2019m saying unequivocally, it did not happen and it didn\u2019t.\u201d Trump said Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer should \u201cmake a deal\u201d with anti- stay-at-home protesters. The president\u2019s comments came one day after protesters, some of them carrying assault rifles, swarmed the Michigan state capitol. New York schools will remain closed for the rest of the academic year, governor Andrew Cuomo announced. The news is unsurprising considering the state is still seeing 1,000 new coronavirus hospitalizations a day, and another 289 New Yorkers died of the virus yesterday. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Anti-stay-at-home protesters have gathered in front of New York\u2019s state capitol, where governor Andrew Cuomo just wrapped up his daily briefing on the state\u2019s coronavirus response. The demonstrators are protesting Cuomo\u2019s statewide stay-at-home order, which is currently in effect until May 15. The governor has declined to say when he will make a decision on whether to extend the order. Similar protests have been popping up across the country, even though polls show most Americans support the restrictions that local leaders have enforced to limit the spread of the virus. Trump said earlier today that Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer should \u201cgive a little\u201d and \u201cmake a deal\u201d with the protesters who swarmed the state capitol\u2019s yesterday, some of whom were carrying assault rifles. The Guardian\u2019s Kenya Evelyn has a recap of New York governor Andrew Cuomo\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing: In addition to announcing that schools across the state will remain closed for the rest of the academic school year, the governor confirmed New York state is still seeing roughly 1,000 new covid-19 hospitalizations per day. There were 289 deaths in the last 24 hours, the first time New York saw less than 300 daily deaths in weeks. \u201cNew Yorkers changed reality,\u201d Cuomo said, crediting changes in social behaviors for a decline in overall hospitalizations since the peak of the outbreak. When asked to assess his own performance amid the pandemic, Cuomo responded, \u201cI tried my best.\u201d He then pivoted to give credit to state residents for how they have followed social distancing guidelines. \u201cNew Yorkers did an extraordinary job,\u201d he said. Cuomo then announced he had directed insurers to waive co-pays, deductibles and other costs for mental health services for essential workers throughout the coronavirus crisis. The governor said he had spoken to too many families who said they would seek counseling but felt it was too expensive. \u201cJust wipe that reason away and get the help that you need,\u201d Cuomo said. The governor also shared that the state saw a 15% jump in domestic violence calls in March and a 30% increase in April, which Cuomo described as a \u201cdramatic\u201d and \u201cfrightening\u201d trend. Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said private schools with large endowments should return any loans they received from the Paycheck Protection Program. Some private schools with millions of dollars in their endowments received large loans from the program, even as small businesses with little capital at their disposal struggled to get their loan applications approved. Some of the private schools have already returned the loans, mirroring the actions of publicly traded companies like Shake Shack and Ruth\u2019s Chris Steak House, which have also said they would return the funds they received from the program. The New York Times has more details: The Latin School of Chicago, which has counted the Illinois governor\u2019s children among its students, returned the money. Sidwell Friends in Washington, the alma mater of President Obama\u2019s daughters, decided to keep it. So did others, like St. Andrew\u2019s Episcopal School in Potomac, Md., where President Trump\u2019s youngest son is a student. Across the country, dozens of elite private preparatory schools are facing a vexing decision: They qualified for federal funds for small businesses hit by the coronavirus pandemic, but administrators are considering whether the scrutiny of taking government assistance outweighs the benefits. New Yorks schools will remain closed for the rest of the academic year, and educators will continue to practice distance learning, governor Andrew Cuomo has just announced. The Democratic governor added that he would make a decision about whether summer school will be possible at the end of the month. Another 289 New Yorkers died of coronavirus yesterday, representing a slight decrease from the day before, but new hospitalizations appear to have plateaued at around 1,000, which Cuomo has described as alarmingly high. The maker of the drug remdesivir said his company, Gilead, is working closely with the FDA to get the drug authorized as a coronavirus treatment. Gilead CEO Daniel O\u2019Day said his company has already significantly expanded production capacity for the drug and hopes to make millions of treatment courses available by the end of the year. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to note that this is a medicine for the most severe patients,\u201d O\u2019Day told the \u201cToday\u201d show. \u201cWhat we see here is really, of course, not a cure but a very, very significant and important treatment for patients.\u201d O\u2019Day\u2019s comments come days after Dr Anthony Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious diseasee expert, said the results of a remdesivir drug trial, which showed a positive effect on patients\u2019 recovery time and survival rate, was \u201cquite good news.\u201d \u201cThe data shows that remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cWhat it has proven is that a drug can block this virus.\u201d Publicly traded companies have received more than $1 billion from the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses, according to a new analysis from the Washington Post. The Post reports: Nearly 300 public companies have reported receiving money from the fund, called the Paycheck Protection Program, according to the data compiled by The Post. Recipients include 43 companies with more than 500 workers, the maximum typically allowed by the program. Several other recipients were prosperous enough to pay executives $2 million or more. After the first pool of $349 billion ran dry, leaving more than 80 percent of applicants without funding, outrage over the millions of dollars that went to larger firms prompted some companies to return the money. As of Thursday, public companies had reported returning more than $125 million, according to a Post analysis of filings. Companies like Shake Shack and Ruth\u2019s Chris Steak House have been criticized for taking money from PPP as the program was rapidly running out of money, which eventually forced both companies to return the funds. The treasury department recently said in updated guidance about the program that publicly traded companies would likely not meet the financial burden requirement to obtain funds, and the government has encouraged large companies to return the money they received. Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin also said earlier this week that the department would be auditing any loan worth more than $2 million. Scientists working for the US military have designed a new Covid-19 test that could potentially identify carriers before they become infectious and spread the disease, the Guardian has learned. In what could be a significant breakthrough, project coordinators hope the blood-based test will be able to detect the virus\u2019s presence as early as 24 hours after infection \u2013 before people show symptoms and several days before a carrier is considered capable of spreading it to other people. That is also around four days before current tests can detect the virus. The test has emerged from a project set up by the US military\u2019s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) aimed at rapid diagnosis of germ or chemical warfare poisoning. It was hurriedly repurposed when the pandemic broke out and the new test is expected to be put forward for emergency use approval (EUA) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) within a week. \u201cThe concept fills a diagnostic gap worldwide,\u201d the head of Darpa\u2019s biological technologies office, Dr Brad Ringeisen, told the Guardian, since it should also fill in testing gaps at later stages of the infection. If given FDA approval, he said, it had the potential to be \u201cabsolutely a gamechanger\u201d. The nation\u2019s largest anti-sexual assault organization has also issued a statement about Tara Reade\u2019s allegation against Joe Biden. After the presumptive Democratic nominee denied sexually assaulting Reade 27 years ago, the group RAINN called for a \u201crigorous investigation\u201d of the allegation. \u201cWe appreciate Vice President Biden finally addressing Tara Reade\u2019s allegations,\u201d RAINN\u2019s vice president of communications said in the statement. \u201cThese allegations deserve a rigorous investigation, and we urge Vice President Biden to release any and all records that may be relevant, including those housed at the University of Delaware, in addition to any Senate records housed at the National Archives. We urge him, his campaign, and former staff to cooperate fully and provide complete transparency.\u201d But the University of Delaware has said officials are still curating the collection of Biden\u2019s papers and the documents will not be publicly available until next year, after the presidential election. The president and CEO of TIME\u2019S UP Now has issued a statement in response to Joe Biden\u2019s interview about Tara Reade\u2019s allegation of sexual assault. Tina Tchen, who leads the anti-sexual harassment group, applauded Biden for directly addressing the allegation, unlike Trump, and called for \u201ccomplete transparency\u201d into Reade\u2019s claim. \u201cToday, Vice President Joe Biden sat down and directly addressed the allegation against him with the seriousness it deserves, something that the current president has never done,\u201d Tchen said in the statement. \u201cVice President Joe Biden needed to address Tara Reade\u2019s allegation today. We call for complete transparency into this claim and the multiple claims against President Donald Trump. As we go forward, American voters are entitled to a full understanding of all allegations of this nature. Women should be heard, treated respectfully, and their allegations taken seriously.\u201d Tchen\u2019s statement underscores the difficult spot that Democratic women are in as they address Reade\u2019s allegation. The Democratic party has prided itself on taking allegations of sexual misconduct seriously since several women accused Trump of inappropriate touching. Now Reade is asking those same Democrats who rallied around Trump\u2019s accusers to grant her the same treatment. Senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway criticized Joe Biden\u2019s response to Tara Reade\u2019s sexual assault allegation. After Biden denied Reade\u2019s allegation in an interview this morning, Conway accused the presumptive Democratic nominee of applying a different standard to himself than he has to other politicians accused of sexual misconduct. \u201cBelieve all women means all women \u2014 you don\u2019t get to choose,\u201d Conway said. The White House adviser also called on Biden to unseal any records related to Reade\u2019s allegation. \u201cYou should unseal them anyway if you want to run for president,\u201d Conway said. Commentators were quick to point out that Trump has not released his tax returns, making him the first president not to do so, raising some questions about Conway\u2019s demand for transparency. There is a 2pm ET press briefing on the White House schedule \u2013 not from Donald Trump, who has other events today at which he may speak about the coronavirus pandemic, but by the new press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany. Although the White House coronavirus task force has regularly held briefings in recent weeks, it\u2019s been more than a year since the Trump\u2019s press secretary held such a formal briefing. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Trump\u2019s second press secretary, dropped the practice which made her predecessor Sean Spicer (in)famous and her successor, Stephanie Grisham, never held one. So that\u2019ll be something else to watch today\u2026 Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer extended her state\u2019s coronavirus emergency declaration yesterday after the Republican-led legislature moved to end the declaration. As anti-stay-at-home protesters swarmed the state capitol, Michigan\u2019s Republican legislators pushed to not only end the declaration but also empower the chambers\u2019 leaders to sue Whitmer if she extended the order. Despite those efforts, Whitmer chose to sign an executive order ending the original declaration and then issue another order that established a state of emergency until May 28. Those orders come a week after Whitmer extended the state\u2019s stay-at-home order until at least May 15. The clash between the Democratic governor and the Republican legislators could lead to an intense legal battle over how the state responds to the pandemic. Trump received criticism last month after he called to \u201cliberate\u201d three states that are currently under stay-at-home orders, including Michigan, echoing messaging from far-right protesters. In one tweet about the stay-at-home orders, Trump wrote, \u201cLIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege!\u201d Many of the president\u2019s critics accused the president of inciting violence against Democratic governors and lawmakers, and tweets about a potential armed conflict against the government skyrocketed in the hours after Trump\u2019s \u201cliberate\u201d tweets were sent. Now the president has weighed in on the protests again, suggesting Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer should \u201cmake a deal\u201d with the demonstrators, even though health experts have warned states could see a surge in coronavirus cases if stay-at-home orders are relaxed too quickly. Michigan has been particularly hard hit by the virus, which has already claimed more than 3,000 lives in the state. Trump is once again weighing in on the anti-stay-at-home protests that have been popping up across the country, suggesting Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer should \u201cmake a deal\u201d with the demonstrators. \u201cThe Governor of Michigan should give a little, and put out the fire,\u201d Trump wrote in a tweet. \u201cThese are very good people, but they are angry. They want their lives back again, safely! See them, talk to them, make a deal.\u201d The president\u2019s tweet comes one day after protesters descended on the Michigan capitol in Lansing to rail against Whitmer\u2019s stay-at-home order. A number of the demonstrators were photographed carrying assault rifles, causing alarm among the legislators who were at the Capitol. This is Joan Greve, taking over for Lauren Gambino and Martin Pengelly. The United States\u2019 coronavirus testing capacity is so low that even the Capitol\u2019s attending physician reportedly doesn\u2019t have enough tests for all US senators, who are scheduled to return to Washington on Monday. Politico reports: The Capitol\u2019s attending physician said Thursday that coronavirus tests will be available for staffers and senators who are ill, but not enough to proactively test all 100 senators as the chamber comes back in session, according to two people familiar with the matter. In a conference call with top GOP officials, Dr. Brian Monahan said there is not sufficient capacity to quickly test senators for coronavirus \u2014 a contrast with the White House, where any people meeting with President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence are tested for the disease. Monahan said test results in the Senate will take two or more days, while the White House has rapid testing. The inability to proactively test all senators will only intensify fears about the chamber returning to work on Monday, which has already caused alarm. About half of all US senators are over 65, putting them at a higher risk of becoming seriously ill from coronavirus, and a number of congressional staffers and other Capitol employees have expressed anxiety about reporting to work as the number of coronavirus cases in the Washington metropolitan region continues to rise. Here is what Biden has previously said about Christine Blasey Ford and women coming forward with sexual assault and harassment claims. \u201c[Ford] deserves to be treated with dignity. It takes enormous courage for a woman to come forward, under the bright lights of millions of people watching, and relive something that happened to her, assert that something happened to her. And she should be treated with respect ... [She] should be given the benefit of the doubt and not be, you know, abused again by the system. [Time Magazine] He also said: For a woman to come forward in the glaring lights of focus, nationally, you\u2019ve got to start off with the presumption that at least the essence of what she\u2019s talking about is real, whether or not she forgets facts, whether or not it\u2019s been made worse or better over time. But nobody fails to understand that this is like jumping into a cauldron.\u201d [Washington Post.] The Morning Joe interview ends with a request for Biden to address the nation\u2019s public health care workers, which he happily obliges before signing off. Biden was asked what he meant by his comments and a fundraiser on Thursday night, that he views himself as a \u201ctransition candidate\u201d. \u201cMy job is to ... bring the Mayor Petes of the world into this administration, bring it into the administration, and even if they don\u2019t come in, their ideas come into this administration,\u201d he said. \u201cYou got to get more people on the bench that are ready to go in, put me in coach, I\u2019m ready to play. Well, there\u2019s a lot of people that are ready to play, women and men.\u201d He said he wasn\u2019t implying anything specifically, for example, that it his intention to be a one-term president. But he said he views his job as the presumptive nominee to lift up young people in the party. \u201cWe have not given a bench to the younger people in the party.\u201d The portion of the interview about the sexual assault allegation has finished. Joe Scarborough has joined the panel \u2013 the tough questions were left to Brzezinski \u2013 and are asking Biden about Trump\u2019s coronavirus response. Again pressed on his comments supporting Blasey Ford and Reade, he said the facts in this case are different. \u201cThe facts of this case do not exist. There are so many inconsistencies in this case. I assure you it did not happen. Period. Period.\u201d Asked if he is \u201cabsolutely\u201d sure there is no record of a complaint, Biden qualifies his response. \u201cI know of no one who was aware of any complaint was made,\u201d he said. Why not approve a search of her name in the University of Delaware records? Biden is adamant personnel records would not be there. \u201cI don\u2019t understand the point you\u2019re trying to make. There are no personnel records by definition.\u201d He said they are not being made public because those records contain information about his personal, private conversations with world leaders and the president. Asked about his apparent discrepancy in his comments on Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault during his Supreme Court nomination hearing, and his denial of Reade\u2019s claims, Biden says women should be believed. \u201cWomen have a right to be heard,\u201d he said. \u201cIn any case the truth matters and in this case the truth is the claims are false.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not going to question her motive. I don\u2019t know why she is saying this. I don\u2019t know why after 27 years this is being raised. I don\u2019t understand it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy is it real for Dr. Ford and not for Tara Reade?\u201d Biden is asked. \u201cI\u2019m not saying she doesn\u2019t have the right to come forward. ... But only the truth matters,\u201d she said. He also says he has \u201cnever asked anybody to sign an NDA. There are no NDAs period in my case.\u201d Asked by Mika Brzezinski on Morning Joe whether the allegation is true, Biden replies: \u201cNo it is not true. I\u2019m saying unequivocally, it did not happen and it didn\u2019t.\u201d Biden says his campaign has not reached out to Reade. He does not answer a question about whether he remembers her. He also says he does not believe a complaint exists but asks the National Archives to look for any such document. \u201cThis is an open book. There\u2019s nothing for me to hide - nothing at all,\u201d he said. Joe Biden has emphatically denied a sexual assault allegation against him, breaking weeks of silence to address the accusation that has roiled his campaign. \u201cThey aren\u2019t true. This never happened,\u201d he said in a statement, released moments before his Friday appearance on Morning Joe. Tara Reade accused Biden of sexually assaulting her in the basement of an office building on Capitol Hill in 1993, when she was an aide in his Senate office. His campaign refuted the allegation in a statement, but this is Biden\u2019s first public comment on the accusation. He also calls on the National Archives to release any record of a complaint Reade said she filed. Here is the statement in its entirety: April was Sexual Assault Awareness Month. Every year, at this time, we talk about awareness, prevention, and the importance of women feeling they can step forward, say something, and be heard. That belief \u2013 that women should be heard \u2013 was the underpinning of a law I wrote over 25 years ago. To this day, I am most proud of the Violence Against Women Act. So, each April we are reminded not only of how far we have come in dealing with sexual assault in this country \u2013 but how far we still have to go. When I wrote the bill, few wanted to talk about the issue. It was considered a private matter, a personal matter, a family matter. I didn\u2019t see it that way. To me, freedom from fear, harm, and violence for women was a legal right, a civil right, and a human right. And I knew we had to change not only the law, but the culture. So, we held hours of hearings and heard from the most incredibly brave women \u2013 and we opened the eyes of the Senate and the nation \u2013 and passed the law. In the years that followed, I fought to continually strengthen the law. So, when we took office and President Obama asked me what I wanted, I told him I wanted oversight of the critical appointments in the Office on Violence Against Women at the Department of Justice and I wanted a senior White House Advisor appointing directly to me on the issue. Both of those things happened. As Vice President, we started the \u201cIt\u2019s on Us\u201d campaign on college campuses to send the message loud and clear that dating violence is violence \u2013 and against the law. We had to get men involved. They had to be part of the solution. That\u2019s why I made a point of telling young men this was their problem too \u2013 they couldn\u2019t turn a blind eye to what was happening around them \u2013 they had a responsibility to speak out. Silence is complicity. In the 26 years since the law passed, the culture and perceptions have changed but we\u2019re not done yet. It\u2019s on us, and it\u2019s on me as someone who wants to lead this country. I recognize my responsibility to be a voice, an advocate, and a leader for the change in culture that has begun but is nowhere near finished. So I want to address allegations by a former staffer that I engaged in misconduct 27 years ago. They aren\u2019t true. This never happened. While the details of these allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault are complicated, two things are not complicated. One is that women deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and when they step forward they should be heard, not silenced. The second is that their stories should be subject to appropriate inquiry and scrutiny. Responsible news organizations should examine and evaluate the full and growing record of inconsistencies in her story, which has changed repeatedly in both small and big ways. But this much bears emphasizing. She has said she raised some of these issues with her supervisor and senior staffers from my office at the time. They \u2013 both men and a woman \u2013 have said, unequivocally, that she never came to them and complained or raised issues. News organizations that have talked with literally dozens of former staffers have not found one \u2013 not one \u2013 who corroborated her allegations in any way. Indeed, many of them spoke to the culture of an office that would not have tolerated harassment in any way \u2013 as indeed I would not have. There is a clear, critical part of this story that can be verified. The former staffer has said she filed a complaint back in 1993. But she does not have a record of this alleged complaint. The papers from my Senate years that I donated to the University of Delaware do not contain personnel files. It is the practice of Senators to establish a library of personal papers that document their public record: speeches, policy proposals, positions taken, and the writing of bills. There is only one place a complaint of this kind could be \u2013 the National Archives. The National Archives is where the records are kept at what was then called the Office of Fair Employment Practices. I am requesting that the Secretary of the Senate ask the Archives to identify any record of the complaint she alleges she filed and make available to the press any such document. If there was ever any such complaint, the record will be there. As a Presidential candidate, I\u2019m accountable to the American people. We have lived long enough with a President who doesn\u2019t think he is accountable to anyone, and takes responsibility for nothing. That\u2019s not me. I believe being accountable means having the difficult conversations, even when they are uncomfortable. People need to hear the truth. I have spent my career learning from women the ways in which we as individuals and as policy makers need to step up to make their hard jobs easier, with equal pay, equal opportunity, and workplaces and homes free from violence and harassment. I know how critical women\u2019s health issues and basic women\u2019s rights are. That has been a constant through my career, and as President, that work will continue. And I will continue to learn from women, to listen to women, to support women, and yes, to make sure women\u2019s voices are heard. We have a lot of work to do. From confronting online harassment, abuse, and stalking, to ending the rape kit backlog, to addressing the deadly combination of guns and domestic violence. We need to protect and empower the most marginalized communities, including immigrant and indigenous women, trans women, and women of color. We need to make putting an end to gender-based violence in both the United States and around the world a top priority. I started my work over 25 years ago with the passage of the Violence Against Women Act. As president, I\u2019m committed to finishing the job. Read it here: \u2026and welcome to another day of coverage of the coronavirus outbreak \u2013 and politics, both concerning the pandemic and tilted towards the election in November \u2013 in the US. The main news of the morning is that Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, will appear on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe to answer questions for the first time about an allegation of sexual assault against him. In advance of the interview, Biden issued a statement: I recognize my responsibility to be a voice, an advocate, and a leader for the change in culture that has begun but is nowhere near finished. So I want to address allegations by a former staffer that I engaged in misconduct 27 years ago: They aren\u2019t true. This never happened. In the statement, Biden asks the National Archives to release and make public any record of a complaint that Reade says she filed at the time. Biden said the record of the document would be kept at the National Archives, and not at the University of Delaware, where his Senate papers are housed and not open to the public. Biden has faced mounting calls from some Democrats to make a public statement, even as the party\u2019s leadership stands behind him. Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, on Thursday stressed her support for Biden\u2019s nomination while Republicans seized the opportunity to attack Biden and his record ahead of a general election against Donald Trump, who has been accused of sexual assault and misconduct by more than a dozen women, all of which he has denied. \u201cWe need to make putting an end to gender-based violence in both the United States and around the world a top priority,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI started my work over 25 years ago with the passage of the Violence Against Women Act. As president, I\u2019m committed to finishing the job.\u201d In terms of the coronavirus outbreak, here are the latest figures from researchers at Johns Hopkins University: US cases: 1,069,866 US deaths: 63,014 New York cases: 304,372 New York deaths: 23,587 New York is of course the US hotspot but other states have been hit terribly hard too. More than 7,000 people have died in New Jersey, Michigan and Massachusetts are approaching 4,000 deaths. The total death toll passed that of Americans in the Vietnam war this week, a fact widely remarked, only for the White House to trumpet its success, attack China and continue to seek to prepare the country to open back up.

The state news agency KCNA released photographs purportedly showing Kim opening a fertilizer plant in Sunchon, north of the capital Pyongyang. KCNA said Kim, accompanied by other senior officials, including his influential younger sister, Kim Yo-jong, cut a ribbon at a ceremony on Friday. What appeared to be thousands of people attending the event, many of them wearing face masks, released balloons and \u201cbroke into thunderous cheers of \u2018hurrah!\u2019 for the Supreme Leader,\u201d the agency said. The images showed Kim smiling and talking to aides, as well as touring the plant. The authenticity of the photos, published on the website of the official Rodong Sinmun newspaper, could not be immediately verified. Donald Trump said on Twitter that he he was \u201cglad\u201d Kim had reappeared. \u201cI, for one, am glad to see he is back, and well!\u201d Trump tweeted on Saturday.

It was the first time the younger Kim had missed the event since becoming leader. A day earlier, he was not present at the launch of several short-range missiles, despite having personally overseen similar launches in the past. Rumours that Kim, who succeeded his father Kim Jong-il in late 2011, was seriously unwell began with a South Korean report claiming he had undergone a \u201ccardiovascular procedure\u201d at Hyangsan hospital near Pyongyang on 12 April and was recuperating at a villa in nearby Mount Myohyang.

North Korean media did not offer an explanation for Kim\u2019s absence in Saturday\u2019s report.

North Korea continues to claim it has not recorded a single case of Covid-19, despite sharing a border with China, where the outbreak is believed to have started.

It was exciting to start the day with a sense of purpose after five weeks of time melting into itself. It was a little discombobulating to dust off my clothes, boots and tool belt, and hunt out my bag and lunch box. It was so nice to be in my car, music turned up and travelling fast. I was nearly skipping when I got to work. It was exciting to see my work colleagues \u2013 we are a small team of three and we spend long hours working together, arguing and laughing. The first day was very physical \u2013 ripping out a wire fence, moving a cut-down tree \u2013 it\u2019s going to take at least two weeks for my body to get used to the work again. <strong>Kylie Toka, fencer, Marton, Rangetikei</strong></p> <h2>\u2018A juvenile humpback whale joined us in marking the special day\u2019</h2> <p>The sun had not even risen and my Kiwi husband was already down at the beach plunging into the cold water.

I dropped my line and after one minute the kayak lurched to the side \u2013 I\u2019d got something big. The rod buckled and snapped in two. I was about to cut the line but decided to try and pull it in by hand \u2013 a beautiful 4kg snapper emerged from the depths.

I was really enjoying the clean air, blissful silence and, for the first time, seeing the water in the estuaries reflecting other colours than dirty brown. But those enjoyments were short lived. People couldn\u2019t even wait until the end of lockdown to jump in their cars. On Friday there was so much traffic you could smell the pollution. Now in level 3, it seems that every man and his dog are in their cars, and you can hear the boy racers speeding on the roads, especially at night. I have already witnessed two incidents of road rage on my daily walk. In level 4 you could see whole families out cycling, but in just two days the motorists have intimidated them off the roads. <strong>Anonymous</strong></p> <h2>\u2018I hope we don\u2019t lose birdsong in a rush to return to normal\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df98b7f04e9923080581eb7cc26de792af31d3f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df98b7f04e9923080581eb7cc26de792af31d3f9/0_0_4032_2680/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hanmer Springs on New Zealand\u2019s South island during the coronavirus level 4 lockdown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hanmer Springs on New Zealand\u2019s South island during the coronavirus level 4 lockdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lorna Davies</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the lockdown was eased, it felt as though our town was waking up and stretching after a long sleep.

It was a little discombobulating to dust off my clothes, boots and tool belt, and hunt out my bag and lunch box. It was so nice to be in my car, music turned up and travelling fast. I was nearly skipping when I got to work. It was exciting to see my work colleagues \u2013 we are a small team of three and we spend long hours working together, arguing and laughing.

      "body": "<p>Over the past few weeks, we\u2019ve learned how to think a little more like epidemiologists. Each morning, we pore over statistical models that offer grim projections about how many people might get sick, when hospital beds will run short, how many might die within our age bracket. The coronavirus pandemic, in other words, has been a plague of statistics \u2013 and our expectations about the future have suddenly come to hinge on abstractions.</p> <p>In opposition stands the obituary. These brief features, a cross between a short story and a death notice, have long provided readers with a moment of particular connection within the impersonal headlines. In a crisis of this magnitude, finding the emotional space to care about a single death can feel purposeless, unnecessary. But for many obituary writers past and present, there is a belief that this unique and embattled form of journalism can help us stay in touch with our humanity.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a deluge of death at the moment,\u201d said Adam Bernstein, obituaries editor at the Washington Post. \u201cWhen you see a figure like \u201850,000 people have died\u2019, those are numbers that make the mind reel. But it\u2019s very hard to touch people\u2019s hearts with numbers \u2013 that\u2019s where we come in.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A good obituary, according to Bernstein, reveals surprising, intimate details about a life</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Bernstein has been working on the death beat at the Post since 1999, and for the past decade has led a team that prides itself on the obituary craft. A good obituary, according to Bernstein, reveals surprising, intimate details about a life. \u201cMaybe this person was most famous for being a criminal, but maybe they were also a roguish criminal with a terrific sense of humor,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cThose details are what connect us to other human beings and our task is to find them.\u201d</p> <p>Since writing his first obituary as an intern at a newspaper in Bakersfield, California, Bernstein has relished the task. \u201cIt\u2019s the hidden gem of the newsroom,\u201d he said. But in the past month, the work has become increasingly taxing as the list of deaths they confront each morning balloons. They have churned out obituaries for notable deaths, like John Prine and Lee Konitz, while some non-coronavirus-related deaths have been sidelined. </p> <p>There is also a sense of dread and suspense involved in monitoring those who have become ill. \u201cIf a well-known person is sick and it\u2019s looking dire we make sure we have a story ready to go,\u201d he said. \u201cIt feels like an endless game of Russian roulette and you just never know what the next day will bring.\u201d</p> <p>Janny Scott can relate to the experience of writing obituaries in a time of crisis. On 11 September 2001, Scott, then a young reporter on the New York Times metro desk, was assigned to cover, simply, \u201cthe dead\u201d. With the city in chaos and no official victim count forthcoming, she and her colleagues trawled the streets of Manhattan collecting missing persons flyers that had become the city\u2019s gloomy wallpaper.</p> <p>As days passed, it became clear that most of the missing had died. \u201cWe began calling families and contacts, trying to piece together who these people were,\u201d Scott told me. From these conversations, Scott and her colleagues began drawing up 250-word thumbnail sketches of those who had been lost, which were run at the back of the paper under the title \u201c<a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/pages/national/portraits/\">Portraits of Grief</a>\u201c.

      "bodyText": "Over the past few weeks, we\u2019ve learned how to think a little more like epidemiologists. Each morning, we pore over statistical models that offer grim projections about how many people might get sick, when hospital beds will run short, how many might die within our age bracket. The coronavirus pandemic, in other words, has been a plague of statistics \u2013 and our expectations about the future have suddenly come to hinge on abstractions. In opposition stands the obituary. These brief features, a cross between a short story and a death notice, have long provided readers with a moment of particular connection within the impersonal headlines. In a crisis of this magnitude, finding the emotional space to care about a single death can feel purposeless, unnecessary. But for many obituary writers past and present, there is a belief that this unique and embattled form of journalism can help us stay in touch with our humanity. \u201cIt\u2019s a deluge of death at the moment,\u201d said Adam Bernstein, obituaries editor at the Washington Post. \u201cWhen you see a figure like \u201850,000 people have died\u2019, those are numbers that make the mind reel. But it\u2019s very hard to touch people\u2019s hearts with numbers \u2013 that\u2019s where we come in.\u201d Bernstein has been working on the death beat at the Post since 1999, and for the past decade has led a team that prides itself on the obituary craft. A good obituary, according to Bernstein, reveals surprising, intimate details about a life. \u201cMaybe this person was most famous for being a criminal, but maybe they were also a roguish criminal with a terrific sense of humor,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cThose details are what connect us to other human beings and our task is to find them.\u201d Since writing his first obituary as an intern at a newspaper in Bakersfield, California, Bernstein has relished the task. \u201cIt\u2019s the hidden gem of the newsroom,\u201d he said. But in the past month, the work has become increasingly taxing as the list of deaths they confront each morning balloons. They have churned out obituaries for notable deaths, like John Prine and Lee Konitz, while some non-coronavirus-related deaths have been sidelined. There is also a sense of dread and suspense involved in monitoring those who have become ill. \u201cIf a well-known person is sick and it\u2019s looking dire we make sure we have a story ready to go,\u201d he said. \u201cIt feels like an endless game of Russian roulette and you just never know what the next day will bring.\u201d Janny Scott can relate to the experience of writing obituaries in a time of crisis. On 11 September 2001, Scott, then a young reporter on the New York Times metro desk, was assigned to cover, simply, \u201cthe dead\u201d. With the city in chaos and no official victim count forthcoming, she and her colleagues trawled the streets of Manhattan collecting missing persons flyers that had become the city\u2019s gloomy wallpaper. As days passed, it became clear that most of the missing had died. \u201cWe began calling families and contacts, trying to piece together who these people were,\u201d Scott told me. From these conversations, Scott and her colleagues began drawing up 250-word thumbnail sketches of those who had been lost, which were run at the back of the paper under the title \u201cPortraits of Grief\u201c. The paper ran almost 2,000 of these mini-obituaries in the coming months. \u201cIn New York, reading the portraits became some kind of religious ritual that helped us grieve together,\u201d Scott said. Obituaries and death notices can also serve an important political function during a crisis. In 1989, when obituaries at major newspapers still refused to cite Aids as a cause of death, the Bay Area Reporter published an eight-page section titled Aids Deaths, which listed all the people who had died from the illness during the previous year. Obituaries have similarly functioned as a form of advocacy around the opioid crisis, providing parents with a chance to publicly address the issue of addiction and connect with others in the community dealing with similar hardship. As local newspapers across the nation continue to fold, however, most obituaries are now published on memorial sites, such as legacy.com, which hosts notices for more than 70% of all US deaths. During the current pandemic, these sites provide an accessible way for families to memorialize those lost at a time when obituary writers are otherwise overwhelmed. \u201cBut the local news obituary is more than a death notice or a eulogy,\u201d Kay Powell said. \u201cIt really should be an objective news story about one person\u2019s life.\u201d Powell worked at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution from 1996 to 2009, where she wrote close to 2,000 obituaries about \u201cextraordinary ordinary people\u201d. The church choir singer who had a frontal lobotomy and donated his brain to science, the girl who sang at Martin Luther King Jr\u2019s funeral, the woman who was Flannery O\u2019Connor\u2019s secret pen pal for 30 years. Powell told me that she often fell in love with her recently deceased subjects and tried to impart this affection to her readers. But as a journalist, she also prided herself on accuracy and objectivity. She would never euphemize cause of death, believing that wider social truths about disease, mental health, addiction could be communicated more effectively through the experience of an individual. \u201cWhen it is the name of somebody right there in your community, these issues are no longer some arbitrary thing affecting some number of people somewhere else,\u201d she said. The psychologist Paul Slovic has referred to this greater concern for the one over the many as a product of \u201cpsychic numbing\u201d, a psychological glitch whereby, as the number in a tragedy increases, our empathy decreases. For many of us, this has intensified as the weeks pass. As the death count rises, cold-eyed statistical thinking that would have a few months ago seemed abhorrent becomes part of our daily news diet. Of course, thinking about the pandemic in numbers is crucial. Demographic analysis shines a light on systemic truths that the individual story cannot, like how this virus is disproportionately taking lives in communities of color. But Powell, who is in her 70s and sheltering in place alone, told me that engaging with the granularity of human suffering can shock people back into a sense of moral responsibility. \u201cThe emotion makes it harder to deny the reality of what\u2019s happening here,\u201d Powell said. \u201cIn the end, it keeps us better informed.\u201d",

The Berlin Wall fell when he was a teenager. He is now a professor at Johns Hopkins.</p> <p>So what are \u201cactive measures\u201d? Previously, Rid <a href=\"https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/os-trid-033017.pdf\">testified</a> they were \u201csemi-covert or covert intelligence operations to shape an adversary\u2019s political decisions\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAlmost always,\u201d he explained, \u201cactive measures conceal or falsify the source.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/18/us/politics/mueller-report-document.html\">The special counsel\u2019s report</a> framed them more narrowly as \u201coperations conducted by Russian security services aimed at influencing the course of international affairs\u201d. Add in technology and hacking, and an image of modern asymmetric warfare emerges.</p> <p>Rid travels back to the early years of communist Russia, recounting the efforts of the government to discredit the remnants of the ancien r\u00e9gime and squash attempts to restore the monarchy. The Cheka, the secret police, hatched a plot that involved forged correspondence, a fictitious organization, a fake counter-revolutionary council and a government-approved travelogue.</p> <p>Words and narratives morphed into readily transportable munitions. The \u00e9migr\u00e9 community was declawed and the multi-pronged combination deemed \u201cwildly successful\u201d. The project also \u201cserved as an inspiration for future active measures\u201d. A template had been set.</p> <p>Fast forward to the cold war and the aftermath of the US supreme court\u2019s landmark school desegregation case. The tension between reality and the text and aspirations of the Declaration of Independence was in the open again. Lunch-counter sit-ins and demands for the vote filled newspapers and TV screens. The fault lines were plainly visible \u2013 and the Soviet Union pounced.</p> <p>In 1960, the KGB embarked on a \u201cseries of race-baiting disinformation operations\u201d that included mailing Ku Klux Klan leaflets to African and Asian delegations to the United Nations on the eve of a debate on colonialism. At the same time, Russian \u201coperators posed as an African American organization agitating against the KKK\u201d.</p> <p>More than a half-century later, Russia ran an updated version of the play. Twitter came to host <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/the-russians-manipulated-our-elections-we-helped/2020/04/23/e44e9e76-5742-11ea-9000-f3cffee23036_story.html\">the fake accounts</a> of both \u201cJohn Davis\u201d, ostensibly a gun-toting Texas Christian and family man, and @BlacktoLive\u201d, along with hundreds of others.</p> <p>The Internet Research Agency (IRA), a Russian troll factory, organized pro-Confederate flag rallies. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/18/us/politics/mueller-report-document.html\">As detailed by Robert Mueller</a>, the IRA also claimed that the civil war was not \u201cabout slavery\u201d and instead was \u201call about money\u201d, a false trope that continues to gain resonance among Trump supporters and proponents of the \u201cliberate the states\u201d movement. According to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d7aee844-88a0-11ea-a109-483c62d17528\">Brian Westrate</a>, treasurer of the Wisconsin Republican party, \u201cthe Confederacy was more about states\u2019 rights than slavery.\u201d</p> <p>Depicting West Germany as Hitler\u2019s heir was another aim. At the time, \u201csome aging former Nazis still held positions of influence\u201d, Rid writes. In the late 1960s, \u201cencouraging \u2018anti-German tendencies in the West\u2019 was very much a priority\u201d.</p> <p>In 1964, with Russian assistance, Czech intelligence mounted <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/uncovering-operation-neptun-the-cold-wars-most-daring-disinformation-campaign/\">Operation Neptun</a>, sinking <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/stb-neptun-90039/page/n21/mode/2up\">Nazi wartime documents</a> to the bottom of the ominous sounding Black Lake, near the German border. The cache was then \u201cdiscovered\u201d \u2013 media pandemonium ensued. Four years later the mastermind of the scheme, Ladislav Bittman, defected to the US.</p> <p>Prior to 2016, Russia\u2019s most notable active measure using the US as a foil was the lie that Aids was \u201cmade in the USA\u201d. In retaliation for US reports of Soviet use of chemical weapons in Afghanistan, the KGB unfurled Operation Denver, a multi-platformed campaign that falsely claimed \u201c<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=lWltDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT352&amp;lpg=PT352&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=\">Aids was an American biological weapon developed at Fort Detrick, Maryland</a>\u201d. Central to the effort was the earlier publication of an anonymous letter with a New York byline by an Indian newspaper. The forged missive claimed \u201cAids may invade India: mystery disease caused by US lab experiments.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25191c7379baccd6c5a1e83204cd6954816642b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25191c7379baccd6c5a1e83204cd6954816642b9/0_0_3000_1798/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A picture taken in 1990 shows Soviet police officers standing in front of the KGB building in Moscow, which is now the headquarters of the FSB.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"599\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A picture taken in 1990 shows Soviet police officers standing in front of the KGB building in Moscow, now the headquarters of the FSB.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexander Nemenov/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rid writes that the letter was \u201ca masterfully executed disinformation operation\u201d, an amalgam of \u201c20% forgery and 80% fact\u201d. The reality was that the Pentagon and the CIA <em>had</em> tested \u201cnew types of biological weapons in densely populated areas of the US and Canada\u201d, and conducted research on disease and psychotropic drugs on an array of human guinea pigs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/05/front-row-at-the-trump-show-review-jonathan-karl\">Front Row at the Trump Show review: Jonathan Karl's pre-pandemic warning</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The KGB doubled down and published a reworked version of the story in an English-language Soviet publication. At the same time and without any apparent nexus to the Soviet campaign, the Amsterdam News, a paper with a readership base in New York\u2019s African American community, opined that Aids was a likely result of US bacteria warfare. Once again, social mistrust helped weaponize a concocted narrative.</p> <p>To be clear, Russian \u201cactive measures\u201d did not tip the 2016 election to the Republicans. On that score, the FBI and Comey had a greater impact. Instead, the Russians caused the US to stare into a mirror, red and blue Americans each seeing what they expected.</p> <p>Nor is an end in sight. According to the <a href=\"https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Report_Volume2.pdf\">Senate intelligence committee</a>, \u201cRussian disinformation efforts may be focused on gathering information and data points in support of an active measures campaign targeted at the 2020 US presidential election\u201d, with an emphasis upon \u201cgathering personal information\u201d from \u201cUS-based audiences sympathetic to Russian disinformation topics\u201d.</p> <p>America remains mired in a cold civil war.

      "bodyText": "The president-elect arrived in Washington under a cloud manufactured in Moscow and St Petersburg. Less than a month after Donald Trump took office, the national security adviser Michael Flynn was ousted for lying to the vice-president about a conversation with Russia\u2019s ambassador. All that, however, was a prelude to the firing of the FBI director James Comey and years of resulting turmoil. The Kremlin had succeeded beyond its wildest dreams. Under the subtitle The Secret History of Disinformation and Political Warfare, Thomas Rid helps remind us how we reached this morass, one with antecedents reaching back to Czarist Russia and the Bolshevik revolution. To be sure, the US can use all the help it can get as it navigates the current election cycle and the lies, rumours and uncertainty that shroud the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. Rid was born in West Germany amid the cold war. The Berlin Wall fell when he was a teenager. He is now a professor at Johns Hopkins. So what are \u201cactive measures\u201d? Previously, Rid testified they were \u201csemi-covert or covert intelligence operations to shape an adversary\u2019s political decisions\u201d. \u201cAlmost always,\u201d he explained, \u201cactive measures conceal or falsify the source.\u201d The special counsel\u2019s report framed them more narrowly as \u201coperations conducted by Russian security services aimed at influencing the course of international affairs\u201d. Add in technology and hacking, and an image of modern asymmetric warfare emerges. Rid travels back to the early years of communist Russia, recounting the efforts of the government to discredit the remnants of the ancien r\u00e9gime and squash attempts to restore the monarchy. The Cheka, the secret police, hatched a plot that involved forged correspondence, a fictitious organization, a fake counter-revolutionary council and a government-approved travelogue. Words and narratives morphed into readily transportable munitions. The \u00e9migr\u00e9 community was declawed and the multi-pronged combination deemed \u201cwildly successful\u201d. The project also \u201cserved as an inspiration for future active measures\u201d. A template had been set. Fast forward to the cold war and the aftermath of the US supreme court\u2019s landmark school desegregation case. The tension between reality and the text and aspirations of the Declaration of Independence was in the open again. Lunch-counter sit-ins and demands for the vote filled newspapers and TV screens. The fault lines were plainly visible \u2013 and the Soviet Union pounced. In 1960, the KGB embarked on a \u201cseries of race-baiting disinformation operations\u201d that included mailing Ku Klux Klan leaflets to African and Asian delegations to the United Nations on the eve of a debate on colonialism. At the same time, Russian \u201coperators posed as an African American organization agitating against the KKK\u201d. More than a half-century later, Russia ran an updated version of the play. Twitter came to host the fake accounts of both \u201cJohn Davis\u201d, ostensibly a gun-toting Texas Christian and family man, and @BlacktoLive\u201d, along with hundreds of others. The Internet Research Agency (IRA), a Russian troll factory, organized pro-Confederate flag rallies. As detailed by Robert Mueller, the IRA also claimed that the civil war was not \u201cabout slavery\u201d and instead was \u201call about money\u201d, a false trope that continues to gain resonance among Trump supporters and proponents of the \u201cliberate the states\u201d movement. According to Brian Westrate, treasurer of the Wisconsin Republican party, \u201cthe Confederacy was more about states\u2019 rights than slavery.\u201d Depicting West Germany as Hitler\u2019s heir was another aim. At the time, \u201csome aging former Nazis still held positions of influence\u201d, Rid writes. In the late 1960s, \u201cencouraging \u2018anti-German tendencies in the West\u2019 was very much a priority\u201d. In 1964, with Russian assistance, Czech intelligence mounted Operation Neptun, sinking Nazi wartime documents to the bottom of the ominous sounding Black Lake, near the German border. The cache was then \u201cdiscovered\u201d \u2013 media pandemonium ensued. Four years later the mastermind of the scheme, Ladislav Bittman, defected to the US. Prior to 2016, Russia\u2019s most notable active measure using the US as a foil was the lie that Aids was \u201cmade in the USA\u201d. In retaliation for US reports of Soviet use of chemical weapons in Afghanistan, the KGB unfurled Operation Denver, a multi-platformed campaign that falsely claimed \u201cAids was an American biological weapon developed at Fort Detrick, Maryland\u201d. Central to the effort was the earlier publication of an anonymous letter with a New York byline by an Indian newspaper. The forged missive claimed \u201cAids may invade India: mystery disease caused by US lab experiments.\u201d Rid writes that the letter was \u201ca masterfully executed disinformation operation\u201d, an amalgam of \u201c20% forgery and 80% fact\u201d. The reality was that the Pentagon and the CIA had tested \u201cnew types of biological weapons in densely populated areas of the US and Canada\u201d, and conducted research on disease and psychotropic drugs on an array of human guinea pigs. The KGB doubled down and published a reworked version of the story in an English-language Soviet publication. At the same time and without any apparent nexus to the Soviet campaign, the Amsterdam News, a paper with a readership base in New York\u2019s African American community, opined that Aids was a likely result of US bacteria warfare. Once again, social mistrust helped weaponize a concocted narrative. To be clear, Russian \u201cactive measures\u201d did not tip the 2016 election to the Republicans. On that score, the FBI and Comey had a greater impact. Instead, the Russians caused the US to stare into a mirror, red and blue Americans each seeing what they expected. Nor is an end in sight. According to the Senate intelligence committee, \u201cRussian disinformation efforts may be focused on gathering information and data points in support of an active measures campaign targeted at the 2020 US presidential election\u201d, with an emphasis upon \u201cgathering personal information\u201d from \u201cUS-based audiences sympathetic to Russian disinformation topics\u201d. America remains mired in a cold civil war. Active Measures is another book for such troubled times.",

High-profile scandals also rocked the industry, such as the Gabriel Grossman and Marissa Casey Fuchs \u201csurprise\u201d social-media proposal, which the Atlantic uncovered as having been pitched to brands, heavily staged and sponsored, and the now infamous Fyre festival which saw influencers being paid thousands of dollars to promote an event that had barely been organized and left attendees stranded on a beach in the Bahamas. 2020 should have been the year for influencers to get back to their followers\u2019 desire for \u201crealness\u201d. Instead, because of Covid-19, many influencers are being forced to focus on simply surviving 2020\u2019s economic downturn rather than taking the chance to grow their businesses. \u201cDue to the disruption in business operations a lot of companies are facing financial challenges,\u201d explains Shane Barker, a digital strategist who offers consultancy services for companies using social media to boost their brand, and influencers hoping to reach the right brands and monetize their follower count. \u201cIn light of that, they are cutting down on all unnecessary expenses. Some are barely able to pay their employees, let alone hire influencers.\u201d One of Shane\u2019s clients, Chris Ruden, is a bodybuilder and amputee who uses his platform to share content on overcoming adversity. As one of many influencers who relies on speaking engagements and events to make up some of his income, Ruden has already experienced disruption as a result of coronavirus measures. \u201cI had 28 events scheduled for the year; 95% of them had been postponed,\u201d he says. \u201cIt has made me hit the drawing board to find different ways to give me value that are \u2018pandemic proof\u2019. I\u2019ve resorted to funny content and eased up on motivational content \u2013 after all, you can\u2019t inspire someone and fire them up just to watch Netflix.\u201d While some popular influencers have attracted death threats after sharing images of glamorous trips despite social distancing measures, Barker believes that more sensitive content is crucial in order for influencers to future-proof their brand. \u201cInfluencers should create content that resonates with the current situation that people are in,\u201d he says. \u201cThis does not mean that influencers from all industries should just start writing and talking about the pandemic. What I mean is that they should create content relevant to their niche, but keeping in mind what people are going through.\u201d Although 69% of brands expect to decrease their advertising spend this year, the amount of time that we are all spending on our devices also means that social media engagement has increased. In a time of crisis, people are also looking online to feel less alone. Lifestyle influencer Em Sheldon recognizes that and has tailored her content accordingly. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved sharing workouts and healthy recipes, so for me it\u2019s been more of an adaption,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople want to see home content right now as it\u2019s relatable and we are all in the same boat. With more eyes now online, people are scrolling more than ever, so actually, as long as it\u2019s fitting, authentic and tasteful, now is a great time to work with influencers.\u201d Some even believe that this renewed awareness of authentic versus paid posts and the shift away from brand promotion is a good thing. \u201cBiased product reviews were threatening to poison the well as people started to become disenchanted with self-serving influencers who had lost their objectivity,\u201d says Michael Solomon, marketing professor and author of Social Media Marketing. \u201cWhere possible, influencers need to revert to a more altruistic message and find ways to help get through the crisis with constructive suggestions. In times of instability, people look to trusted sources and those that deliver will be remembered after the crisis is over.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The British government is quietly seeking access to the European Union\u2019s pandemic warning system, despite early reluctance to cooperate on health after Brexit, the Guardian has learned. The UK is seeking \u201csomething akin to membership\u201d of the EU\u2019s early warning and response system (EWRS), which has played a critical role in coordinating Europe\u2019s response to the coronavirus, as well as to earlier pandemics such as bird flu. According to an EU source, this would be \u201cpretty much the same\u201d as membership of the system. The government\u2019s enthusiasm in the privacy of the negotiating room contrasts with noncommittal public statements. Detailed negotiating objectives published in February merely stated that the UK was \u201copen to exploring cooperation between the UK and EU in other specific and narrowly defined areas where this is in the interest of both sides, for example on matters of health security\u201d. Health was not even mentioned in the government\u2019s written statement to Parliament, aside from a reference to pharmaceuticals. Meanwhile, the Daily Telegraph reported on 1 March that No 10 had blocked the Department of Health\u2019s request to be part of the EWRS. A government spokesperson did not respond to a question about whether the UK was seeking a form of membership or participation in the EWRS, but referred back to the February negotiating objectives. In private, the coronavirus, which had claimed at least 26,771 lives in the UK by Thursday, appears to have altered government thinking. \u201cThere was not much appetite from the UK at the beginning,\u201d said the EU source, referring to cooperation on health. \u201cThat\u2019s been corrected. They are keen and they are keen to be seen to be keen. Both sides want close cooperation.\u201d However, the EU is not prepared to offer the UK full membership of the EWRS, an online platform set up in 1998 where public authorities share information about health emergencies. Instead, EU officials propose to \u201cplug the UK into\u201d the system when a pandemic emerges, similar to arrangements for other non-EU countries. Health security does not feature in the UK negotiating text sent in private to the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, although EU officials have received a \u201cnon-paper\u201d outlining government aims on health. In another sign of rising British interest in European cooperation, the Guardian has established that the UK attended all five of the EU\u2019s health security committee meetings on the coronavirus pandemic in April, a perfect attendance record, compared with a 70% British presence between 17 January and 30 March. During the April meetings, officials discussed lockdown exit strategies and launching a joint procurement scheme on therapeutics in intensive care. No decision has been taken to launch this bulk-buying programme. The Guardian first reported in March that the UK was not taking part in any of the EU\u2019s four procurement schemes, missing bulk-buying efforts on personal protective equipment for medical workers, ventilators and testing kit \u2013 despite having attended relevant meetings. Meanwhile, among NHS senior managers there is anxiety that Brexit talks risk \u201csignificant elements of health being forgotten about\u201d, said Layla McCay, the international director of the NHS Confederation. \u201cNHS organisations have been stood up and stood down and stood up again for potentially a no-deal Brexit,\u201d she said. \u201cIf a quite thorough future relationship for health matters is not on track come June, then the NHS is going to have to start to prepare for specific disruption next year as a result of Brexit, and it will have to do so while also facing both winter and coronavirus challenges. It will be a significant extra ask.\u201d British membership of the EWRS and broader EU health network \u201cstrengthen our ability to respond as effectively as possible\u201d to health emergencies, McCay added. The UK government spokesperson said: \u201cThe safety and security of our citizens is a top priority. The UK is ready to discuss how our citizens can be kept safe and benefit from continued international cooperation on health security following the end of the transition period, where it is in our mutual interest. \u201cAny such arrangements must align with the fundamental principles of respecting the UK\u2019s political and economic independence, recognition of the UK and EU\u2019s status as sovereign equals, and ensuring the UK has control over its own laws.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>For fans of televised sport, there will always be that golden Sunday, in July last year, when the broadcast of a topsy-turvy Wimbledon final overlapped with a British Grand Prix <em>and</em> England\u2019s blockbuster victory in the Cricket World Cup. Oh my Djokovic: an unimprovable time to be an armchair spectator, an afternoon of channel-hopping and ad-dodging, hurrying wees and tea brews, juggling screens and streams and replays till we sweated like athletes ourselves.</p> <p>Unthinkable, then, that 10 months on, the sport schedules would be empty. Wimbledon 2020 is off. The cricket season has been picked apart. Everything from motorsport to football to darts has been put on hold while the world deals with coronavirus.</p> <p>What are we left with? How are fans, broadcasters and sportspeople themselves coping with the dearth of live competition on TV? On a recent Sunday evening, the hero of last summer\u2019s Cricket World Cup, Ben Stokes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/02/england-cricketer-ben-stokes-signs-up-to-race-in-virtual-f1-grand-prix\" title=\"\">agreed to take part in a virtual </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/02/england-cricketer-ben-stokes-signs-up-to-race-in-virtual-f1-grand-prix\" title=\"\">grand </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/02/england-cricketer-ben-stokes-signs-up-to-race-in-virtual-f1-grand-prix\" title=\"\">prix</a> that was broadcast at primetime on Sky. It was a kind of high-end Mario Kart that, with some squinting, looked almost as good as the real thing. But it was fatally devoid of risk. The seriousness of the contest never fully recovered after a restless Stokes started speeding backwards around the track, colliding with drivers coming the other way. One of the cars was piloted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/02/liam-payne-on-life-after-one-direction-it-was-touch-and-go-i-was-slowly-losing-the-plot\">Liam Payne</a>. I decided then that virtual sports were not going to cut it for me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"21e33be58446138d07dbc1a081817de76cf75497\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21e33be58446138d07dbc1a081817de76cf75497/37_0_1258_728/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Screen shot of cricketer Ben Stokes taking part in a virtual grand prix on Sky in April\" width=\"1000\" height=\"579\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben Stokes taking part in a virtual grand prix in April. Will he catch Jenson Button?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: F1 Esports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For a while I managed my cravings for sports programming \u2013 15 hours a week, pre-pandemic \u2013 by taking in a diet of football documentaries, season-in-review DVDs and YouTube clips of outrageous or obscure goals from years gone by. A striker for Brighton, I remembered, vaguely, had scored a last-minute <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/8370901/glenn-murrays-nods-in-winner-with-his-crotch-as-brighton-see-off-west-brom-in-fa-cup-replay/\">goal with his penis</a> in 2019. I watched the clip several times.</p> <p>The documentaries were more nourishing, especially the multi-hour Netflix series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/27/sunderlands-til-i-die-second-series-fans-stress-spanners-dismay\">Sunderland \u2019Til I Die</a> that charted, in immaculate turn-by-turn detail, the fortunes of the north-east club as it moved between the lower leagues. Viewers were introduced to fans for whom watching footie was more than just a diversion, it was a crutch. I was especially taken by a diehard called Michelle Barraclough who hadn\u2019t missed a Sunderland game in years.</p> <p>I called up Barraclough, one afternoon, to ask how she was coping. She\u2019d watched something like 20 hours of live sport a week, before the lockdown, and had now gone a fortnight without. The country\u2019s response to the coronavirus, she told me, had made her question her hero-worship of footballers in the past. \u201cFootball feels very small in the grand scheme of things,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople can\u2019t see their families. I haven\u2019t seen my five-year-old granddaughter since the lockdown started. If I told anyone, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m missing the football,\u2019 they\u2019d probably give me a slap.\u201d</p> <p>There was a pause. But are you missing the football, I asked? \u201cOh <em>God,</em> yeah,\u201d she said. \u201cMassively. Massively.\u201d</p> <p>I was, too. I\u2019d heard there were armchair fans out there who were looking east for their fix. Leagues had been suspended in England, Scotland, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. But not in Belarus, where the Premier League season kicked off in late March. A team from the outskirts of Minsk called Energetik (they\u2019d been rechristened to honour the Belarusian state energy company) won the opening game of the season 3-1. Energetik then went on to beat the incumbent league champions and had a chance to go top of the league, if they could beat their local rivals, Minsk.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b8549ba9cac95bd03328d1930326093a763b800b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8549ba9cac95bd03328d1930326093a763b800b/0_783_2362_1447/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of a table tennis bat with  a ball shaped like a cornovarius\" width=\"1000\" height=\"613\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018An afternoon of Ukrainian table tennis was like watching events from space.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Gym Class/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I watched the derby live. Energetik scored in the first half. They had a player sent off in the second. They won the game in injury time, their goalie running the length of the pitch to celebrate with his teammates while, at my end, in my bedroom in London, I gave my laptop a celebratory waggle and clicked to close the small pop-up window I\u2019d been watching in.

But we don\u2019t know we\u2019re going to get it.\u201d At the outbreak of the crisis, as sport wound down and stopped, Eurosport lost something like 2,500 hours of planned-for live footage for the spring. Georgiou and his team had to hustle to fill the gaps with archive material and virtual sports. \u201cI\u2019m looking at my calendar for the week,\u201d he said, \u201cand everything\u2019s planned. I know exactly what I\u2019m doing every minute of the week. Live sport allows you to escape from the predictability of [that] and get into untold drama\u2026 The very reason I watch sport is because of that massive unpredictability.\u201d</p> <p>I agreed, and I found myself drifting back to the Ukrainian table tennis. Smetenko had won three thrillers in a row. There was something about knowing he was out there, swearing, squeaking in his trainers, that made him a more compelling watch than all the confetti-showered basketballers and baseballers put together.</p> <p>Taiwanese baseball. Tajik football. The search continued. I had to ask myself the serious question: if the UFC was successful in staging a brutal ultimate fight on a private island, would I be desperate enough to pay to watch? Katherine Brunt, a World Cup-winning England cricketer and former devourer of TV sport (12 hours a week), told me she had been wondering the same thing. She had always been a fan of mixed martial arts in her former, sport-watching life. The prospect of a fresh, live bout would be hard to resist.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7bc2b0f8809156e60b0d7b8a2623da3a3474a2f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7bc2b0f8809156e60b0d7b8a2623da3a3474a2f1/0_153_4300_2579/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Katherine Brunt (c) and Anya Shrubsole (r) of England Women celebrate England men winning the Final of the ICC Cricket World Cup against New Zealand during Day Three of the International Friendly match between England Women and Australia A Women at Millfield School on July 14, 2019 in Glastonbury, England.

I heartily agreed. Like gourmands reminiscing over some old, closed-down restaurant, we traded memories about that golden Sunday of TV sport last summer. While Stokes led the England men\u2019s team to glory, Brunt said, she had been watching on a TV with her teammates, after a match of their own. \u201cWe\u2019d just played Australia. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/jul/31/womens-ashes-england-v-australia-third-final-t20-live-cricket\">Absolutely spanked them</a>.\u201d But do you know what, Brunt added? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/england-win-cricket-world-cup-and-for-once-the-nation-really-was-watching\">Watching the men\u2019s team win</a> on TV was almost better.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re playing, you can\u2019t let your emotions get the best of you. You have to almost turn your real feelings down a bit. When you\u2019re watching sport, though, you can let it <em>all</em> out.\u201d There happened to be a photographer on site that day, and he captured Brunt, in a moment of spectator-sport bliss, overturning the nearest chair. \u201cWatching sport, you can be irrational, or elated, or fuming angry, or goosebumpy,\u201d she told me. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why we need it.\u201d</p> <p>She said goodbye. Off, maybe, to watch some fight clips on YouTube. I had a choice to make myself, between Swedish horse racing and the next round of internet darts.

      "bodyText": "For fans of televised sport, there will always be that golden Sunday, in July last year, when the broadcast of a topsy-turvy Wimbledon final overlapped with a British Grand Prix and England\u2019s blockbuster victory in the Cricket World Cup. Oh my Djokovic: an unimprovable time to be an armchair spectator, an afternoon of channel-hopping and ad-dodging, hurrying wees and tea brews, juggling screens and streams and replays till we sweated like athletes ourselves. Unthinkable, then, that 10 months on, the sport schedules would be empty. Wimbledon 2020 is off. The cricket season has been picked apart. Everything from motorsport to football to darts has been put on hold while the world deals with coronavirus. What are we left with? How are fans, broadcasters and sportspeople themselves coping with the dearth of live competition on TV? On a recent Sunday evening, the hero of last summer\u2019s Cricket World Cup, Ben Stokes, agreed to take part in a virtual grand prix that was broadcast at primetime on Sky. It was a kind of high-end Mario Kart that, with some squinting, looked almost as good as the real thing. But it was fatally devoid of risk. The seriousness of the contest never fully recovered after a restless Stokes started speeding backwards around the track, colliding with drivers coming the other way. One of the cars was piloted by Liam Payne. I decided then that virtual sports were not going to cut it for me. For a while I managed my cravings for sports programming \u2013 15 hours a week, pre-pandemic \u2013 by taking in a diet of football documentaries, season-in-review DVDs and YouTube clips of outrageous or obscure goals from years gone by. A striker for Brighton, I remembered, vaguely, had scored a last-minute goal with his penis in 2019. I watched the clip several times. The documentaries were more nourishing, especially the multi-hour Netflix series Sunderland \u2019Til I Die that charted, in immaculate turn-by-turn detail, the fortunes of the north-east club as it moved between the lower leagues. Viewers were introduced to fans for whom watching footie was more than just a diversion, it was a crutch. I was especially taken by a diehard called Michelle Barraclough who hadn\u2019t missed a Sunderland game in years. I called up Barraclough, one afternoon, to ask how she was coping. She\u2019d watched something like 20 hours of live sport a week, before the lockdown, and had now gone a fortnight without. The country\u2019s response to the coronavirus, she told me, had made her question her hero-worship of footballers in the past. \u201cFootball feels very small in the grand scheme of things,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople can\u2019t see their families. I haven\u2019t seen my five-year-old granddaughter since the lockdown started. If I told anyone, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m missing the football,\u2019 they\u2019d probably give me a slap.\u201d There was a pause. But are you missing the football, I asked? \u201cOh God, yeah,\u201d she said. \u201cMassively. Massively.\u201d I was, too. I\u2019d heard there were armchair fans out there who were looking east for their fix. Leagues had been suspended in England, Scotland, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. But not in Belarus, where the Premier League season kicked off in late March. A team from the outskirts of Minsk called Energetik (they\u2019d been rechristened to honour the Belarusian state energy company) won the opening game of the season 3-1. Energetik then went on to beat the incumbent league champions and had a chance to go top of the league, if they could beat their local rivals, Minsk. I watched the derby live. Energetik scored in the first half. They had a player sent off in the second. They won the game in injury time, their goalie running the length of the pitch to celebrate with his teammates while, at my end, in my bedroom in London, I gave my laptop a celebratory waggle and clicked to close the small pop-up window I\u2019d been watching in. One of the gambling websites, Bet365, held streaming rights to the Belarusian league and this was the only way to watch along: a square of video the size of a couple of postage stamps, surrounded by flashing sports odds and gaudy ads for an Irish-themed casino game called Spin O\u2019Reely. Production-wise, it wasn\u2019t quite what I was used to: there was no commentary, only the sound of huffing players and (crystal clear) the Energetik coach screaming angry criticism at his players and the ref. Even so, I found myself looking forward to the next round of fixtures, in a week\u2019s time. \u201cYou\u2019re watching football from Belarus? Getting your hit wherever you can find it, eh? You\u2019re like someone who\u2019s run out of single malt whiskey and has started drinking hand sanitiser.\u201d This was James O\u2019Brien, the LBC radio presenter, who I\u2019d called up at home.

What else was still showing live on TV and online? There was Australian horse racing, but it didn\u2019t start till the middle of the night. Malaysian volleyball? Russian ice hockey? I settled, in the end, for an afternoon of Ukrainian table tennis, following the progress of a pale and furious young player called Vadim Smetenko, who happened to be on a winning streak that day. The physically distanced players squeaked around a leisure centre, footage of the matches shot using a fixed camera above the table, the sound coming in and out, and the feed occasionally rippling with distortion. It was all a little like watching events from space. Soon it was time to watch Energetik play their next fixture. It was a bleak affair, and not only because they were beaten 2-0 by a team called Torpedo. \u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d O\u2019Brien had said, \u201cthat Belarusian football is a market you want to be supporting at the moment.

The country\u2019s president, Alexander Lukashenko, made the questionable claim that sport should not only be allowed to continue but that it \u201cis the best anti-virus remedy\u201d. The chief of Fifpro, the world footballers\u2019 union, had described the situation as \u201cnot comprehendible\u201d. Wishing Energetik well, I decided to let the Belarusian Premier League carry on without me. A handful of other hold-out sports bodies had been refusing to bow to the pandemic. The Ultimate Fighting Championship, a mixed martial arts competition based in the US, was preparing to build a ring on a remote private island, in order to avoid stay-at-home orders and continue staging bouts. The pro-wrestling federation, WWE, had somehow secured \u201cessential\u201d business status from a sympathetic governor in Florida and would thus be able to continue some degree of live broadcasting. Other sports sought to push through the lockdown in a milder way, embracing the challenges posed by the moment and tweaking their rules and settings to become isolation-friendly. They were putting on internet darts, for instance. A group of top players had agreed to play from their homes, with a webcam pointed at their dartboards, earpieces telling them when to throw, a tablet showing the scores, and two referees watching along on Zoom.

Live sport allows you to escape from the predictability of [that] and get into untold drama\u2026 The very reason I watch sport is because of that massive unpredictability.\u201d I agreed, and I found myself drifting back to the Ukrainian table tennis. Smetenko had won three thrillers in a row. There was something about knowing he was out there, swearing, squeaking in his trainers, that made him a more compelling watch than all the confetti-showered basketballers and baseballers put together. Taiwanese baseball. Tajik football. The search continued. I had to ask myself the serious question: if the UFC was successful in staging a brutal ultimate fight on a private island, would I be desperate enough to pay to watch? Katherine Brunt, a World Cup-winning England cricketer and former devourer of TV sport (12 hours a week), told me she had been wondering the same thing. She had always been a fan of mixed martial arts in her former, sport-watching life. The prospect of a fresh, live bout would be hard to resist. Brunt was an armchair fan who favoured multiple screens, she said: a big TV and a couple of laptops was the ideal. I heartily agreed. Like gourmands reminiscing over some old, closed-down restaurant, we traded memories about that golden Sunday of TV sport last summer. While Stokes led the England men\u2019s team to glory, Brunt said, she had been watching on a TV with her teammates, after a match of their own. \u201cWe\u2019d just played Australia. Absolutely spanked them.\u201d But do you know what, Brunt added? Watching the men\u2019s team win on TV was almost better. \u201cWhen you\u2019re playing, you can\u2019t let your emotions get the best of you. You have to almost turn your real feelings down a bit. When you\u2019re watching sport, though, you can let it all out.\u201d There happened to be a photographer on site that day, and he captured Brunt, in a moment of spectator-sport bliss, overturning the nearest chair. \u201cWatching sport, you can be irrational, or elated, or fuming angry, or goosebumpy,\u201d she told me. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why we need it.\u201d She said goodbye. Off, maybe, to watch some fight clips on YouTube. I had a choice to make myself, between Swedish horse racing and the next round of internet darts. It\u2019s going to be a long summer. Howzat! Where to get your sporting fix American football There are full-game replays of big-match encounters at youtube.com/nfl.

Worldwide there are now 3.4 million cases of coronavirus and more than 238,000 deaths, although many countries that have passed the peak of their infections are now working on relaxing their lockdown restrictions. Singapore\u2019s health minister said on Saturday that it will start easing some curbs after a second wave of the coronavirus concentrated in the state\u2019s crowded migrant worker dormitories appeared to subside, with some students allowed back to school later this month.

In the US, Australia and the UK, there has been a focus on how and why residential facilities have become deadly incubators for the disease. A nursing home in New York has reported a \u201chorrifying\u201d death toll of 98 people from the coronavirus, one of the worst outbreaks in the country and a shock even in hard-hit New York. An official state tally of nursing home deaths had previously listed only 13 as of Friday. In the UK, the coronavirus death toll increased sharply this week after officials began counting fatalities from the country\u2019s nursing homes alongside deaths in hospitals. Britain now has the third highest number of deaths in the world, 27,510, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, behind only the US and Italy. In Australia, although the virus has been brought under control far more quickly, deaths also continued to mount at a care home in western Sydney. Thirteen residents account for over 10% of the total national death toll of only 93, and it is threatening to overtake the Ruby Princess cruise ship as the single biggest source of deaths in the country. Elsewhere around the world, key developments include: The US Federal Drug Administration has given approval for the experimental drug remdesivir to be used in an emergency on patients suffering from Covid-19. Also in the US, the White House has barred the administration\u2019s top pandemic expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, from giving evidence at a Congressional hearing. It said it was not appropriate for a member of the pandemic response team to testify. Europe\u2019s tourism industry, and its host economies such as Spain, Italy and Greece, face being ruined by the shutdown driven by the virus. The European Commission estimates that the EU\u2019s hotels and restaurants will lose half their income this year. The UK government has been urged to prioritise spending on the poorest areas of the country after official statistics revealed that those regions have borne the brunt of the deaths from Covid-19. Read our report on life in one of the nation\u2019s poorest boroughs, Newham in east London. The economic toll of the crisis has continued as stock markets fell sharply on Friday, largely thanks to the ongoing war of words between the US and China. In the UK, the Financial Times has reported that Rolls-Royce plans to shed 8,000 of its 52,000-strong workforce. California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, promised to make \u201cmeaningful\u201d changes to stay-at-home orders in the coming days as thousands of protesters gathered across the state to condemn the lockdown, and in defiance of its ordnances. Donald Trump has told Michigan\u2019s governor, Gretchen Whitmer, that she should \u201cmake a deal\u201d with anti-lockdown protesters after groups of heavily armed men swarmed the state capitol. Whitmer rejected making a deal during a public health emergency, but said some outdoor work will be allowed to resume next week.",

      "body": "<p>On a normal Saturday thousands of Brummies would be making plans for a night out with friends on Broad Street, the city\u2019s nightlife hotspot famous for its noisy pubs and nightclubs.</p> <p>By midnight the dancefloors of clubs like Pryzm \u2013 Birmingham\u2019s biggest \u2013 would be packed. \u201cPeople congregate on Broad Street and go through the bars and, every Saturday night without fail, we\u2019ll end up with 2,500 to 3,000 people coming through our doors,\u201d explains Peter Marks who runs Deltic, the UK\u2019s biggest nightclub operator, which is behind Pryzm.</p> <p>But the lockdown means there will be no queues outside Pryzm \u2013 or any of the UK\u2019s other 1,600 nightclubs tonight or, indeed, any time soon as crowds have become the nation\u2019s enemy.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris-johnson\">Boris Johnson</a> has promised to set out the government\u2019s plans to \u201cget our economy moving\u201d next week but with no vaccine there is no light at the end of the tunnel for the country\u2019s 106,000 bars, pubs, clubs and restaurants, which will be the last to reopen after the coronavirus crisis abates.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re about socialising, not social distancing,\u201d says Marks. \u201cIt is a low-margin business that relies on a lot of footfall. We get around about 7 million customers a year, but they spend \u00a315 or \u00a316 plus VAT each.\u201d</p> <p>This week the JD Wetherspoon pub chain floated the idea of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/29/jd-wetherspoon-plans-to-reopen-pubs-in-june\">reopening in June</a> but many within the hospitality trade see that as fanciful and are focused on how to survive the next few months of no, or very low, sales.</p> <p>One campaign gaining momentum is #NationalTimeOut which is being led by Jonathan Downey, the entrepreneur behind London street food business Street Feast and the Milk &amp; Honey cocktail bar in Soho.</p> <p>The proposal seeks a package of additional support, including an extension of the government\u2019s job retention scheme, a nine-month rent-free period for tenants and a matching debt repayment break for their landlords.</p> <p>Without help, Downey says, more than half of hospitality venues and as many as 2 million jobs will not survive the lockdown \u2013 and even that could be \u201clowballing it\u201d. </p> <p>The safety measures introduced by supermarkets and DIY stores, with people asked to stand 2 metres apart, are a non-starter in intimate venues and nobody wants to eat in an empty restaurant or dance on an empty dancefloor.</p> <p>\u201cWe were the first sector to be shut down by the government and therefore it stands to reason that we may be one of the last to reopen,\u201d says Rob Pitcher, chief executive of Manchester-based Revolution Bars, a nationwide chain aimed at 18- to 30-year-olds. \u201cOpening with any sort of social distancing is very problematic. We would rather stay closed for slightly longer and be able to open with far less restrictions.\u201d</p> <p>Eyal Winter, an economist who has been advising the government over how to ease the national lockdown, told the Guardian this week one solution could be for landlords to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/coronavirus-easing-uk-lockdown-require-tough-enforcement-rules\"> ration how much beer they serve</a>, to two or three pints, before asking customers to go home.</p> <p>Marks says that idea is \u201claughable\u201d and the only way venues can reopen is when social distancing is no longer necessary. </p> <p>\u201cThe idea of going to get a drink and being served by someone in a mask and then lifting your own mask to drink out of a single use straw is not a world that I recognise or one that I think is economically viable,\u201d adds Marks. \u201cPeople [club and bar operators] can sit it out, as long as they get help with rents.\u201d</p> <p>Other problems loom. With job losses mounting across the economy many people will just have less money to spend on shopping and nights out after the lockdown ends.

      "bodyText": "On a normal Saturday thousands of Brummies would be making plans for a night out with friends on Broad Street, the city\u2019s nightlife hotspot famous for its noisy pubs and nightclubs. By midnight the dancefloors of clubs like Pryzm \u2013 Birmingham\u2019s biggest \u2013 would be packed. \u201cPeople congregate on Broad Street and go through the bars and, every Saturday night without fail, we\u2019ll end up with 2,500 to 3,000 people coming through our doors,\u201d explains Peter Marks who runs Deltic, the UK\u2019s biggest nightclub operator, which is behind Pryzm. But the lockdown means there will be no queues outside Pryzm \u2013 or any of the UK\u2019s other 1,600 nightclubs tonight or, indeed, any time soon as crowds have become the nation\u2019s enemy. Boris Johnson has promised to set out the government\u2019s plans to \u201cget our economy moving\u201d next week but with no vaccine there is no light at the end of the tunnel for the country\u2019s 106,000 bars, pubs, clubs and restaurants, which will be the last to reopen after the coronavirus crisis abates. \u201cWe\u2019re about socialising, not social distancing,\u201d says Marks. \u201cIt is a low-margin business that relies on a lot of footfall. We get around about 7 million customers a year, but they spend \u00a315 or \u00a316 plus VAT each.\u201d This week the JD Wetherspoon pub chain floated the idea of reopening in June but many within the hospitality trade see that as fanciful and are focused on how to survive the next few months of no, or very low, sales. One campaign gaining momentum is #NationalTimeOut which is being led by Jonathan Downey, the entrepreneur behind London street food business Street Feast and the Milk &amp; Honey cocktail bar in Soho. The proposal seeks a package of additional support, including an extension of the government\u2019s job retention scheme, a nine-month rent-free period for tenants and a matching debt repayment break for their landlords. Without help, Downey says, more than half of hospitality venues and as many as 2 million jobs will not survive the lockdown \u2013 and even that could be \u201clowballing it\u201d. The safety measures introduced by supermarkets and DIY stores, with people asked to stand 2 metres apart, are a non-starter in intimate venues and nobody wants to eat in an empty restaurant or dance on an empty dancefloor. \u201cWe were the first sector to be shut down by the government and therefore it stands to reason that we may be one of the last to reopen,\u201d says Rob Pitcher, chief executive of Manchester-based Revolution Bars, a nationwide chain aimed at 18- to 30-year-olds. \u201cOpening with any sort of social distancing is very problematic. We would rather stay closed for slightly longer and be able to open with far less restrictions.\u201d Eyal Winter, an economist who has been advising the government over how to ease the national lockdown, told the Guardian this week one solution could be for landlords to ration how much beer they serve, to two or three pints, before asking customers to go home. Marks says that idea is \u201claughable\u201d and the only way venues can reopen is when social distancing is no longer necessary. \u201cThe idea of going to get a drink and being served by someone in a mask and then lifting your own mask to drink out of a single use straw is not a world that I recognise or one that I think is economically viable,\u201d adds Marks. \u201cPeople [club and bar operators] can sit it out, as long as they get help with rents.\u201d Other problems loom. With job losses mounting across the economy many people will just have less money to spend on shopping and nights out after the lockdown ends. Karl Chessell, the director for food and retail at consultancy group CGA, says there is a genuine fear that some venues have \u201cclosed their doors for good\u201d. Even if late-night operators can cope with a long shutdown, he says, they will find it difficult to ever return to profit if customer numbers are limited. \u201cAny social distancing will impact revenues and make it incredibly difficult when margins are already slim.\u201d The grim outlook has weighed heavily on Revolution. It\u2019s share price has collapsed nearly 80% to 20p since January. It has furloughed 98% of its staff but is still bleeding \u00a31.6m a month, mostly rent payments on its 74 bars. Deltic, which is also using the government\u2019s job support scheme, has similar monthly outgoings. Pitcher says the nine-month rent break proposed by the #NationalTimeOut campaign makes sense: \u201cThe burden is shared and shouldn\u2019t cost the government too much more money.\u201d Hospitality firms would not be in a position to find deferred rent anyway, he explains: \u201cWith zero income coming in that is money that is completely lost.

She had spent 35 years at the facility \u2013 five days a week, 10 hours a day, 100,000 slaughtered chickens a shift.</p> <p>Willis was the first Tyson employee to succumb to Covid-19 at the Camilla plant, but <a href=\"https://www.rwdsu.info/statement_on_tyson_covid_19_deaths_in_camilla_georgia\">two others</a> would follow in short succession, a marker of the precarity faced by thousands of meat processing workers pushed to toil, closely packed, on the frontlines throughout the pandemic in plants that have quickly become coronavirus hotspots. At least 20 meat packing workers have died from the virus nationwide and 5,000 have become infected, <a href=\"http://www.ufcw.org/2020/04/28/order/\">according to union officials</a>, as close to two dozen facilities closed \u2013 some temporarily \u2013 over the past few weeks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/28/trump-executive-order-meat-processing-plants-coronavirus\">Trump orders meat-processing plants to continue operating amid pandemic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In interviews with poultry workers in Georgia, Arkansas and Mississippi a similar pattern of alleged negligence, secrecy and mismanagement emerged at facilities operated by some of the largest food manufacturers in America.

      "bodyText": "News of the first Covid-19 death at the Tyson Foods poultry plant in Camilla, south-west Georgia, spread slowly. \u201cIt was like they were keeping a secret,\u201d said Tara Williams, a 47-year-old worker at the plant, as she described her account of management\u2019s response to the death of her colleague Elose Willis. \u201cIt took them about two weeks to just put a picture up, to acknowledge she had died.\u201d Williams had worked alongside Willis in the \u201cde-boning\u201d section of the plant until she died on 1 April, aged 56. She had spent 35 years at the facility \u2013 five days a week, 10 hours a day, 100,000 slaughtered chickens a shift. Willis was the first Tyson employee to succumb to Covid-19 at the Camilla plant, but two others would follow in short succession, a marker of the precarity faced by thousands of meat processing workers pushed to toil, closely packed, on the frontlines throughout the pandemic in plants that have quickly become coronavirus hotspots. At least 20 meat packing workers have died from the virus nationwide and 5,000 have become infected, according to union officials, as close to two dozen facilities closed \u2013 some temporarily \u2013 over the past few weeks. In interviews with poultry workers in Georgia, Arkansas and Mississippi a similar pattern of alleged negligence, secrecy and mismanagement emerged at facilities operated by some of the largest food manufacturers in America. The poultry industry, already the target of a sweeping civil lawsuit describing a systematic effort to depress wages among a workforce that is largely immigrants or people of color, found itself the beneficiary of an executive order issued by Donald Trump on Tuesday. The president invoked the Defense Production Act (DPA) to mandate meat processing plants stay open during the pandemic. The White House has been reluctant to use the wartime act, which allows the president to order companies to fulfill work it deems necessary to national security. The DPA was used to push General Motors to make ventilators but few other companies have received such orders. The move, which essentially labels meat production an essential service, also offers further measures to protect the industry from legal liability should more workers contract the virus. The order came within hours of Tyson, a $22bn company and the world\u2019s second-largest meat processor, taking out paid adverts in major US newspapers, including the New York Times, to warn that recent closures of a handful of plants due to the virus could lead to \u201climited supply of our products\u201d. For Tara Williams, who has worked at the Camilla plant on the overnight shift as a packing scanner for five years earning $13.55 an hour, Trump\u2019s executive order and her company\u2019s adverts were another blow in her fight for workers\u2019 rights. \u201cI was devastated and I was hurt. Because now, to be truthful \u2013 and excuse my language \u2013 Tyson really aren\u2019t going to give a fuck about us at all,\u201d she said. \u201cFor us employees that work in production, we are treated like modern-day slaves.\u201d A spokesman for Tyson disagreed with Williams\u2019 account of the response to Willis\u2019s death and said that managers held a moment of silence on \u201cthe day she passed away\u201d. The company declined to provide numbers of infected workers at the Camilla plant or elsewhere \u201csince this is an ever-changing situation\u201d but characterized the numbers of positive Covid-19 workers at Camilla as \u201climited\u201d. The spokesman added that the company relaxed its attendance policy in March to \u201creinforce the importance of staying home when sick\u201d and waived its waiting period to qualify for short-term disability and increased its coverage by 90% of normal pay until the end of June. Tyson poultry workers are now being offered a $500 bonus to continue working. These will be paid twice, once in May and once in July and are contingent on work attendance. Although the spate of deaths at Camilla led Tyson to deep clean the plant over a weekend, the facility did not close entirely, according to Edgar Fields, the vice-president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. The company is now measuring workers\u2019 temperatures as they report for work, and began supplying surgical facemasks, but, according to Fields and workers interviewed by the Guardian, Tyson continues to suppress information on employees who have tested positive for Covid-19. \u201cFor the last two months people have been dying from the coronavirus and we\u2019ve been asking the White House to put something in effect to protect workers. Now, all of a sudden, with employees getting sicker and sicker, and fed up of going to work, Trump found it necessary to support big business,\u201d Fields said. The infectious disease epidemiologist Michael Osterholm warned deep cleans and surgical masks in these plants would not be sufficient to stop the spread of Covid-19. \u201cIt\u2019s in the air. And until we really get an airborne control program in place in these settings, I think we\u2019re going to continue to see transmission\u201d, Osterholm said on his podcast. The situation was similar in Arkansas, where workers at a non-unionized Tyson poultry plant in Springdale have staged protests demanding full sick pay and compensated quarantine. One worker, a central American migrant who spoke on condition of anonymity to protect her job, told the Guardian that the company was not enforcing social distancing. The employee, who has worked at the plant inspecting chicken carcasses for 19 years earning $13.33 an hour, said she still felt unsafe going to work every day and worried about contracting the infection and giving it to her three children at home. \u201cWe are all given bathroom breaks at the same time and there are hundreds of us waiting to use them. There are only seven bathrooms,\u201d she said. \u201cThey [Tyson] don\u2019t care about the worker. They don\u2019t care if we get sick.\u201d A spokesman for Tyson said the company was taking \u201cseveral measures\u201d to allow social distancing but did not address the bathroom break allegations. \u2022\u2022\u2022 For more than a century, the meatpacking industry has been a symbol of how corporations are able to exploit workers in the name of efficiency. The Covid-19 outbreak has opened another chapter. After seven weeks in the slaughterhouses of Chicago, the journalist Upton Sinclair wrote The Jungle, a 1906 novel which described the grim conditions inside. \u201cThere were things that went into the sausage in comparison with which a poisoned rat was a tidbit,\u201d Sinclair wrote. The novel created a media frenzy and prompted the US government to investigate the industry. A wave of consumer protection laws followed. But these improvements masked the intent of Sinclair\u2019s novel: to highlight the exploitation of immigrant labor and unchecked greed. Sinclair famously declared: \u201cI aimed for the public\u2019s heart and by accident hit it in the stomach.\u201d Advanced industrialization and globalization after the second world war exacerbated the exploitation of workers. Instead of the Eastern European immigrants who staffed slaughterhouses at the turn of the century, by the 1970s these factories were filled with workers escaping conflict in South America and Asia. Production grew exponentially and labor unions lost power. Advances in worker safety could not keep up and today, working in a processing plant remains one of the most dangerous jobs in the country.

They arrested 680 undocumented workers but none of the companies, which included the multibillion dollar Koch Foods, faced any charges over employment practices.

      "body": "<p>The outset of the coronavirus pandemic in Northern Ireland was beset with political disputes. First Minister Arlene Foster, of the DUP, and Deputy First Minister Michelle O\u2019Neill, of Sinn F\u00e9in, held opposing views about the closure of schools, universities and childcare facilities. In the Republic, schools were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/ireland-school-closures-reveal-stark-contrast-to-uk-covid-19-response\">closed by 13 March</a>, but the UK planned to close schools a week later, on 20 March. As often happens, the situation in the North evoked the Irish saying <em>idir dh\u00e1 st\u00f3l</em>, a shorthand for falling between two stools, neither here nor there.</p> <p>While the Irish government offered grave clarity, the North remained caught up in the UK government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/19/six-points-of-criticism-uk-governments-flailing-coronavirus-response\">widely criticised</a> tactics.

      "bodyText": "The outset of the coronavirus pandemic in Northern Ireland was beset with political disputes. First Minister Arlene Foster, of the DUP, and Deputy First Minister Michelle O\u2019Neill, of Sinn F\u00e9in, held opposing views about the closure of schools, universities and childcare facilities. In the Republic, schools were closed by 13 March, but the UK planned to close schools a week later, on 20 March. As often happens, the situation in the North evoked the Irish saying idir dh\u00e1 st\u00f3l, a shorthand for falling between two stools, neither here nor there. While the Irish government offered grave clarity, the North remained caught up in the UK government\u2019s widely criticised tactics. These divergent responses to coronavirus established an accidental case study of two separate but overlapping approaches to the pandemic taking place on the same island \u2013 something researchers will no doubt pore over in the future.

Hang on, she says, looking away from her computer screen to the window with an alarmed expression. \u201cI\u2019m just going to go check that out. Stand by!\u201d</p> <p>If this were a horror movie, then the stylish woman disappearing into the distance would never come back. But it isn\u2019t a horror movie, it\u2019s a Zoom interview, and Ross, a Golden Globe-winning actor best known for her role in the US sitcom <a href=\"https://abc.com/shows/blackish\" title=\"\">Black-ish</a>, is talking to me from the sunny living room of her home. Or at least she was; right now, I\u2019m staring at a fiddle-leaf fig tree and a comfortable-looking couch.</p> <p>In a youth-obsessed Hollywood, many women find their careers decline with age, but at 47, Ross appears to be just hitting her stride. The actor, activist and entrepreneur has been in the public eye since her 20s, but started getting serious attention only in her early 40s, with Black-ish. Now on its sixth season, the show centres on an upper-middle-class African American family, living in a largely white LA neighbourhood, and stars Ross as the matriarch, anaesthetist Rainbow \u201cBow\u201d Johnson. Its unapologetic handling of race-related issues has turned the comedy into something of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/feb/25/series-creator-kenya-barris-on-abc-sitcom-black-ish\" title=\"\">cultural phenomenon</a>. Barack and Michelle Obama are fans; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/517293224831234048?s=20\" title=\"\">Donald Trump, who tweeted that the show was racism at the highest level, is not</a>.</p> <p>A few minutes after vanishing, Ross slides back in front of her computer and gives the all clear. There is no emergency except, you know, the one we\u2019re all living through. At the time of speaking, LA has been under lockdown for almost a month and, like the rest of us, Ross is still struggling to get to grips with it. \u201cI think we\u2019re all dealing with these waves of emotion where everything seems fine. And then it hits you. It\u2019s like the fear is just waiting right there.\u201d She gestures towards the window.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ff6de3ecc67a7d8a403fe5d1b029d7fa0695b59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ff6de3ecc67a7d8a403fe5d1b029d7fa0695b59/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tracee Ellis Ross in ABC\u2019s Black-ish Season Six, 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Black-ish season six this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Raymond Liu/ABC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The fear has not infiltrated her wardrobe. Ross\u2019s hair is styled into two Princess Leia-like space buns and she\u2019s wearing a floral, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jun/30/tate-modernist-how-georgia-okeeffe-shaped-feminist-style\" title=\"\">Georgia O\u2019Keeffe</a>-esque top. Even through the awkward interface of a Zoom call, her signature mix of goofiness and glamour comes through \u2013 a willingness to poke fun at herself that is a large part of her on-screen appeal. As Black-ish creator Kenya Barris once <a href=\"https://www.backstage.com/magazine/article/tracee-ellis-ross-loves-auditioning-8802/\" title=\"\">put it</a>, Ross \u201ccan do expressions and physical movement that take a joke from a five to a 10\u201d.</p> <p>But if Ross seems down to earth, her childhood was anything but. Her mother is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/diana-ross\" title=\"\">Diana Ross</a>, and her father, Robert Ellis Silberstein, is a successful music executive, who managed the likes of Ronnie Wood and Meat Loaf. As a child, she attended an elite school in Manhattan, and did a stint at the type of Swiss boarding school where a typical gym class means a skiing lesson. She did a photoshoot with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/andywarhol\" title=\"\">Andy Warhol</a> when she was 11, and modelled in her teens. How, I ask, did she avoid turning into a brat?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been taught that you work for the things you want,\u201d Ross says. \u201cMy mom always joked: \u2018I\u2019m not leaving you guys any of this money. I made this money for me! I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s a roof over your head. You can have health insurance and food. But other than that\u2026\u2019 I mean, I had a job in high school. I worked as a salesperson at Ralph Lauren. My mom was like, \u2018If you want to keep buying those clothes, you\u2019re going to have to figure out how to pay for them.\u2019 There was a commitment on her part to a normalcy that I have taken into my adult life.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d2246e50007eeddf3fec712ede1722db2f5afa6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d2246e50007eeddf3fec712ede1722db2f5afa6/0_875_2263_1711/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Diana Ross with her daughters backstage at the Palace Theater in New York June 14 1976.

Her parents split when she was five but remained on good terms, and the childhood she shared with her siblings (four of whom were Diana Ross\u2019s children, and three of whom were step-siblings from Ross\u2019s second marriage) sounds happy and wholesome.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Being the child of somebody famous might unlock the door, but the people on the other side have their arms crossed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cMy mom always put us in bed, then she\u2019d go to the recording studio while we were sleeping. She\u2019d sit with us for dinner and she never left for more than a week.\u201d Ross remembers her mother getting the kids to help her make the beds, and she remains a pro at hospital corners. Actually, she says, she still has some of those sheets. \u201cI nicked them out of the closet at home and Mom doesn\u2019t know I have them. They remind me of my childhood.\u201d</p> <p>But being her mother\u2019s daughter didn\u2019t necessarily help when it came to work. \u201cWhen I was starting in my career, being the child of somebody famous was not what it is today,\u201d Ross says. \u201cIt might unlock the door, but the people sitting on the other side have their arms crossed and are asking: \u2018OK, is she as good as her mom?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>She got her first big break as a comic on MTV\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0239178/\" title=\"\">The Lyricist Lounge Show</a> in 2000. The same year, she landed a lead role on the sitcom <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0247102/\" title=\"\">Girlfriends</a>, which ran for eight seasons, making it the longest-running live-action network sitcom at the time; but its predominantly black cast meant it was always pigeonholed as a \u201cblack show\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"806cf3aa15fc5a6f16ecd39a39e62037eb15785a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/806cf3aa15fc5a6f16ecd39a39e62037eb15785a/0_505_2250_2096/1000.jpg\" alt=\"JILL MARIE JONES, TRACEE ELLIS ROSS, PERSIA WHITE, GOLDEN BROOKS AND REGINALD C HAYES, IN GIRLFRIENDS, SEASON 3, 2002\" width=\"1000\" height=\"932\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Girlfriends in 2002.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AF archive/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe landscape of television was not the same as it is now,\u201d Ross says. \u201cIt was still very segregated. We go through waves in this country, around celebrating black narratives: the early 2000s were not that time.\u201d Despite the size of Girlfriends\u2019 audience, she didn\u2019t get invited on to the late-night TV shows, or the award shows, or the high-profile industry events. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a matter of how many eyeballs were watching the show,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a matter of <em>which</em> eyeballs were watching.\u201d</p> <p>Then, in 2014, Black-ish came along and \u201ceverything started to happen\u201d. In 2017 she won a Golden Globe for her role, making her the first black woman to pick up the award since 1983 (when <a href=\"https://www.goldenglobes.com/person/debbie-allen\" title=\"\">Debbie Allen won for Fame</a>). Her proud family had already taken out a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TraceeEllisRoss/status/765708111327866880/photo/1\" title=\"\">full-page ad</a> in the Hollywood Reporter to congratulate her on the nomination.</p> <p>Ross says one of the things that drew her to Black-ish was the way it disrupted conventional narratives. There is a warmth and respect between Bow and her on-screen husband, Andre \u201cDre\u201d Johnson, that isn\u2019t always evident in sitcoms. \u201cOften the comedy of married couples on television is about how they roll their eyes at each other, how they frustrate each other,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve never enjoyed that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d3764fa9e8a9afdf1543e663a42bbd5a3eb4c140\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3764fa9e8a9afdf1543e663a42bbd5a3eb4c140/60_27_2543_3973/640.jpg\" alt=\"Tracee Ellis Ross, winner of Outstanding Actress in a Comedy Series, attends the 50th NAACP Image Awards at Dolby Theatre on March 30, 2019 in Hollywood, California\" width=\"640\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With her NAACP award for Black-ish last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot that poked holes in the status quo, particularly as a woman of colour,\u201d she continues. \u201cWhile the story is told through the eyes of the man, I\u2019m not just the wife. I\u2019m not just a doctor. I\u2019m not just a mom. I\u2019m all of those things. And my point of view is not seen in relation to Dre\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s based in my experience and my life.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes, Ross says, Bow\u2019s autonomy was \u201cnaturally written into the script\u201d and sometimes she pushed for it. \u201cI\u2019m very conscious about not perpetuating stereotypes,\u201d she explains. \u201cIn a scene, if they have written that I\u2019m doing \u2018lady-chores\u2019 such as the cooking, I\u2019m like: why? It\u2019s not pivotal to the story. Let Dre do the chopping and I\u2019ll stand here at my computer, or drink a glass of wine, or hold a book. I speak up and I drive them crazy sometimes. But in the context of being a black woman on television, I am very aware of what that imagery says and the stereotypes it perpetuates. My interest is in offering other expressions, other examples, other imagery.\u201d</p> <p>Some of that \u201cother imagery\u201d is the experience of being mixed race, which we don\u2019t always see on mainstream TV. \u201cI had never, ever played that in my career,\u201d Ross says. \u201cEven though [being half black and half Jewish], that\u2019s what I live.\u201d While her character is clearly mixed race, Black-ish didn\u2019t meaningfully explore that facet of Bow\u2019s identity. \u201cIt ended up being relegated to this space of jokes,\u201d Ross says. \u201cAs a mixed person, you\u2019re constantly being bombarded by questions such as, \u2018Are you this, or are you that?\u2019 which is the least interesting part of being mixed\u2026\u201d She trails off for a second, losing her thread. \u201cYou know when you haven\u2019t been talking a lot?\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s like you lose access to words.\u201d</p> <p>She makes a wide-mouthed, silly face and recovers from Quarantine Voice\u2122 enough to explain how this particular frustration led her to co-create <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/tv/reviews/mixedish-review-blackish-spinoff-abc-1203347524/\" title=\"\">Mixed-ish</a>, a prequel to Black-ish that debuted on ABC last year. While Bow\u2019s heritage was a comic sidenote in Black-ish, Mixed-ish centres it: Ross narrates the story of Bow\u2019s childhood, as the daughter of a black mother and white father growing up in 80s America. But there were mixed reviews, with some critics deeming the show\u2019s politics too <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/10/mixed-ish-thomas-chatterton-williams-race/600679/\" title=\"\">simplistic</a>, and it\u2019s not clear whether it will be back for a second season.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0362fe141a595da4018776a7af5fa57e407d6ff8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0362fe141a595da4018776a7af5fa57e407d6ff8/0_30_2889_2106/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Actor Tracee Ellis Ross, December 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"729\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018As a mixed person, you\u2019re constantly being bombarded by questions: are you this, or are you that?\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amar Daved/Art Partner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, there is one thing Ross has not yet turned her hand to in a long and varied career. She has modelled, given a <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/tracee_ellis_ross_a_woman_s_fury_holds_lifetimes_of_wisdom/transcript?language=en\" title=\"\">TED talk</a> (on the power of women\u2019s fury) and signed up as an ambassador for <a href=\"https://timesupnow.org/\" title=\"\">Time\u2019s Up</a>.

She runs her own company, <a href=\"https://patternbeauty.com/\" title=\"\">Pattern</a>, a successful haircare line for people with naturally curly hair. But there is one thing she has spent her entire life petrified of doing: becoming a singer. \u201cI have wanted to sing since I was a kid,\u201d she tells me. \u201cBut it was something I buried, because it was too scary a dream.\u201d There was, after all, a lot to live up to.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At 47, to go into a studio and discover I had a voice: that was life-changing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A year ago she landed a lead role in a movie. Directed by <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0304091/\" title=\"\">Nisha Ganatra</a> (who worked on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/transparent\" title=\"\">Amazon\u2019s Transparent</a>), <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9308382/\" title=\"\">The High Note</a> sees Ross play a superstar singer, Grace Davis, whose career has peaked. Afraid of creating fresh material, Davis keeps trotting out old hits until her assistant (played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/dakota-johnson\" title=\"\">Dakota Johnson</a>) convinces her to record new work. Ross sings six original songs in the film, a dream come true for her. Then, all of a sudden, it was a dream deferred. The High Note was due to premiere in May; in an alternative, coronavirus-free universe, Ross would be crisscrossing the country on a busy promotion schedule. Now, she says, she\u2019s not sure if a premiere will ever happen. The film will be released, but nobody is quite sure when.</p> <p>A lot of people are dealing with much worse than cancelled movie premieres, she says. \u201cThis is a very small disappointment.\u201d But still, it stings. \u201cAt 47 years old, to go into the studio and start singing, and discover that I actually had a voice that could work\u2026 it was life-changing for me.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8de43decbd005a92ed30ae8100aba7da3cb1c1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8de43decbd005a92ed30ae8100aba7da3cb1c1b/0_0_2717_1811/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tracee Ellis Ross (in yellow dress) with (from left) Dakota Johnson, Ricky Martin and Ice Cube in the film The High Note , 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In The High Note, with Dakota Johnson, Ricky Martin and Ice Cube.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Planet Photos/Focus Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Did she really wait until 47 to start? \u201cPretty much. In high school, I took choir \u2013 it was one of the required courses \u2013 and we had to perform The Pirates Of Penzance. I was furious. I was so scared of singing in front of people that I marched myself to the headmaster\u2019s office: \u2018Mrs Regalman, I do not think that it\u2019s fair to force somebody who doesn\u2019t want to sing and who doesn\u2019t want to be on a stage to be on a stage.\u2019 And she told me I had to do it. So I did the play but I just mouthed the words.\u201d</p> <p>Ross sang in public a couple of times after that, but says she would always add \u201ca flare of comedy or hide behind a character\u201d. So it wasn\u2019t until very recently that she decided \u201cto face one of my biggest childhood fears. And, typical me, I didn\u2019t do it small \u2013 I decided to do it as the lead in a movie playing a musical diva.\u201d</p> <p>A couple of months ago, Ross unveiled a clip of her singing <a href=\"https://www.oprahmag.com/entertainment/a30950759/tracee-ellis-ross-oprah-2020-vision-tour/\" title=\"\">in the film, during an on-stage interview with Oprah Winfrey</a>. Curled up in her chair in an electric-blue suit, she looked on the verge of tears as the song, called Love Myself, played to a live audience. \u201cI had no memory of getting myself curled up in that chair until I looked over and saw the screen,\u201d she says. She wasn\u2019t the only emotional one: Oprah cried, too, and the audience applauded; Ross has a beautiful voice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d61d071899e70811541a631e0555acd5df31f6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d61d071899e70811541a631e0555acd5df31f6e/54_237_3767_2261/1000.jpg\" alt=\"(L-R) Rhonda Ross Kendrick, Callaway Lane, Chudney Ross, Evan Ross, Jagger Snow Ross, Diana Ross, host Tracee Ellis Ross, Raif-Henok Emmanuel Kendrick, Indigo Naess, Ross Naess, and Bronx Wentz pose in the press room during the 2017 American Music Awards at Microsoft Theater on November 19, 2017 in Los Angeles, California\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With her family, hosting the 2017 American music awards.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Granitz/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On-screen and off, she has spent much of her career challenging established narratives. She is often asked about her unmarried status, and has become a sort of accidental spokeswoman for the joy of being a single, childfree woman. The idea that being a woman means having a husband and kids is so deeply ingrained, she says, that most people don\u2019t even know how inappropriate they\u2019re being when they ask why she\u2019s not married. Strangers poking around in her uterus used to irritate her, but she doesn\u2019t \u201cmind any more. It no longer stings. It\u2019s just an opportunity for me to expand somebody\u2019s idea of the world and add something different. Women, particularly black and brown women, are told we should occupy a smaller area of real estate. Everything in my being and my career is about encouraging women to give themselves permission to take up the space. I am very comfortable making people uncomfortable. Not just for my own wellbeing, but hopefully so that other women don\u2019t have to bear that weight quite as heavily as my generation.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dd08271114b90ced026aaf88cd47f94181839622\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd08271114b90ced026aaf88cd47f94181839622/86_200_1781_2761/645.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Ellis Silberstein aka Bob Ellis attends a movie with daughters (L) Rhonda and Tracee in 1975 in Los Angeles, California\" width=\"645\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With her father and sister Rhonda (left) in 1975.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She remains \u201chappily and gloriously single\u201d, but that doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t men in the background.

Ross has been doing regular group calls with her family since lockdown began. \u201cFaceTime with my dad is like this,\u201d she says with a laugh, manoeuvring the computer under her armpit. \u201cI\u2019m like: \u2018I can\u2019t see you!\u2019 And he\u2019s like: \u2018I can see you!\u2019 And I\u2019m like: \u2018I <em>know</em>, I can\u2019t see you!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>What does she miss most about normal life? \u201cI really miss smelling the people that I love,\u201d Ross says. \u201cBeing able to nestle my head in my mom\u2019s neck, or in my best friend\u2019s.

      "bodyText": "There is a strange noise coming from Tracee Ellis Ross\u2019s Los Angeles garden. Hang on, she says, looking away from her computer screen to the window with an alarmed expression. \u201cI\u2019m just going to go check that out. Stand by!\u201d If this were a horror movie, then the stylish woman disappearing into the distance would never come back. But it isn\u2019t a horror movie, it\u2019s a Zoom interview, and Ross, a Golden Globe-winning actor best known for her role in the US sitcom Black-ish, is talking to me from the sunny living room of her home. Or at least she was; right now, I\u2019m staring at a fiddle-leaf fig tree and a comfortable-looking couch. In a youth-obsessed Hollywood, many women find their careers decline with age, but at 47, Ross appears to be just hitting her stride. The actor, activist and entrepreneur has been in the public eye since her 20s, but started getting serious attention only in her early 40s, with Black-ish. Now on its sixth season, the show centres on an upper-middle-class African American family, living in a largely white LA neighbourhood, and stars Ross as the matriarch, anaesthetist Rainbow \u201cBow\u201d Johnson. Its unapologetic handling of race-related issues has turned the comedy into something of a cultural phenomenon. Barack and Michelle Obama are fans; Donald Trump, who tweeted that the show was racism at the highest level, is not. A few minutes after vanishing, Ross slides back in front of her computer and gives the all clear. There is no emergency except, you know, the one we\u2019re all living through. At the time of speaking, LA has been under lockdown for almost a month and, like the rest of us, Ross is still struggling to get to grips with it. \u201cI think we\u2019re all dealing with these waves of emotion where everything seems fine. And then it hits you. It\u2019s like the fear is just waiting right there.\u201d She gestures towards the window. The fear has not infiltrated her wardrobe. Ross\u2019s hair is styled into two Princess Leia-like space buns and she\u2019s wearing a floral, Georgia O\u2019Keeffe-esque top. Even through the awkward interface of a Zoom call, her signature mix of goofiness and glamour comes through \u2013 a willingness to poke fun at herself that is a large part of her on-screen appeal. As Black-ish creator Kenya Barris once put it, Ross \u201ccan do expressions and physical movement that take a joke from a five to a 10\u201d. But if Ross seems down to earth, her childhood was anything but. Her mother is Diana Ross, and her father, Robert Ellis Silberstein, is a successful music executive, who managed the likes of Ronnie Wood and Meat Loaf. As a child, she attended an elite school in Manhattan, and did a stint at the type of Swiss boarding school where a typical gym class means a skiing lesson. She did a photoshoot with Andy Warhol when she was 11, and modelled in her teens. How, I ask, did she avoid turning into a brat? \u201cI\u2019ve always been taught that you work for the things you want,\u201d Ross says. \u201cMy mom always joked: \u2018I\u2019m not leaving you guys any of this money. I made this money for me! I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s a roof over your head. You can have health insurance and food. But other than that\u2026\u2019 I mean, I had a job in high school. I worked as a salesperson at Ralph Lauren. My mom was like, \u2018If you want to keep buying those clothes, you\u2019re going to have to figure out how to pay for them.\u2019 There was a commitment on her part to a normalcy that I have taken into my adult life.\u201d Ross speaks fondly of her family, to whom she is extremely close. Her parents split when she was five but remained on good terms, and the childhood she shared with her siblings (four of whom were Diana Ross\u2019s children, and three of whom were step-siblings from Ross\u2019s second marriage) sounds happy and wholesome. \u201cMy mom always put us in bed, then she\u2019d go to the recording studio while we were sleeping. She\u2019d sit with us for dinner and she never left for more than a week.\u201d Ross remembers her mother getting the kids to help her make the beds, and she remains a pro at hospital corners. Actually, she says, she still has some of those sheets. \u201cI nicked them out of the closet at home and Mom doesn\u2019t know I have them. They remind me of my childhood.\u201d But being her mother\u2019s daughter didn\u2019t necessarily help when it came to work. \u201cWhen I was starting in my career, being the child of somebody famous was not what it is today,\u201d Ross says. \u201cIt might unlock the door, but the people sitting on the other side have their arms crossed and are asking: \u2018OK, is she as good as her mom?\u2019\u201d She got her first big break as a comic on MTV\u2019s The Lyricist Lounge Show in 2000. The same year, she landed a lead role on the sitcom Girlfriends, which ran for eight seasons, making it the longest-running live-action network sitcom at the time; but its predominantly black cast meant it was always pigeonholed as a \u201cblack show\u201d. \u201cThe landscape of television was not the same as it is now,\u201d Ross says. \u201cIt was still very segregated. We go through waves in this country, around celebrating black narratives: the early 2000s were not that time.\u201d Despite the size of Girlfriends\u2019 audience, she didn\u2019t get invited on to the late-night TV shows, or the award shows, or the high-profile industry events. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a matter of how many eyeballs were watching the show,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a matter of which eyeballs were watching.\u201d Then, in 2014, Black-ish came along and \u201ceverything started to happen\u201d. In 2017 she won a Golden Globe for her role, making her the first black woman to pick up the award since 1983 (when Debbie Allen won for Fame). Her proud family had already taken out a full-page ad in the Hollywood Reporter to congratulate her on the nomination. Ross says one of the things that drew her to Black-ish was the way it disrupted conventional narratives. There is a warmth and respect between Bow and her on-screen husband, Andre \u201cDre\u201d Johnson, that isn\u2019t always evident in sitcoms. \u201cOften the comedy of married couples on television is about how they roll their eyes at each other, how they frustrate each other,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve never enjoyed that. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot that poked holes in the status quo, particularly as a woman of colour,\u201d she continues. \u201cWhile the story is told through the eyes of the man, I\u2019m not just the wife. I\u2019m not just a doctor. I\u2019m not just a mom. I\u2019m all of those things. And my point of view is not seen in relation to Dre\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s based in my experience and my life.\u201d Sometimes, Ross says, Bow\u2019s autonomy was \u201cnaturally written into the script\u201d and sometimes she pushed for it. \u201cI\u2019m very conscious about not perpetuating stereotypes,\u201d she explains. \u201cIn a scene, if they have written that I\u2019m doing \u2018lady-chores\u2019 such as the cooking, I\u2019m like: why? It\u2019s not pivotal to the story. Let Dre do the chopping and I\u2019ll stand here at my computer, or drink a glass of wine, or hold a book. I speak up and I drive them crazy sometimes. But in the context of being a black woman on television, I am very aware of what that imagery says and the stereotypes it perpetuates. My interest is in offering other expressions, other examples, other imagery.\u201d Some of that \u201cother imagery\u201d is the experience of being mixed race, which we don\u2019t always see on mainstream TV. \u201cI had never, ever played that in my career,\u201d Ross says. \u201cEven though [being half black and half Jewish], that\u2019s what I live.\u201d While her character is clearly mixed race, Black-ish didn\u2019t meaningfully explore that facet of Bow\u2019s identity. \u201cIt ended up being relegated to this space of jokes,\u201d Ross says. \u201cAs a mixed person, you\u2019re constantly being bombarded by questions such as, \u2018Are you this, or are you that?\u2019 which is the least interesting part of being mixed\u2026\u201d She trails off for a second, losing her thread. \u201cYou know when you haven\u2019t been talking a lot?\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s like you lose access to words.\u201d She makes a wide-mouthed, silly face and recovers from Quarantine Voice\u2122 enough to explain how this particular frustration led her to co-create Mixed-ish, a prequel to Black-ish that debuted on ABC last year. While Bow\u2019s heritage was a comic sidenote in Black-ish, Mixed-ish centres it: Ross narrates the story of Bow\u2019s childhood, as the daughter of a black mother and white father growing up in 80s America. But there were mixed reviews, with some critics deeming the show\u2019s politics too simplistic, and it\u2019s not clear whether it will be back for a second season. Meanwhile, there is one thing Ross has not yet turned her hand to in a long and varied career. She has modelled, given a TED talk (on the power of women\u2019s fury) and signed up as an ambassador for Time\u2019s Up. She has appeared in music videos for Drake and Kanye West, a former neighbour. She runs her own company, Pattern, a successful haircare line for people with naturally curly hair. But there is one thing she has spent her entire life petrified of doing: becoming a singer. \u201cI have wanted to sing since I was a kid,\u201d she tells me. \u201cBut it was something I buried, because it was too scary a dream.\u201d There was, after all, a lot to live up to. A year ago she landed a lead role in a movie. Directed by Nisha Ganatra (who worked on Amazon\u2019s Transparent), The High Note sees Ross play a superstar singer, Grace Davis, whose career has peaked. Afraid of creating fresh material, Davis keeps trotting out old hits until her assistant (played by Dakota Johnson) convinces her to record new work. Ross sings six original songs in the film, a dream come true for her. Then, all of a sudden, it was a dream deferred. The High Note was due to premiere in May; in an alternative, coronavirus-free universe, Ross would be crisscrossing the country on a busy promotion schedule. Now, she says, she\u2019s not sure if a premiere will ever happen. The film will be released, but nobody is quite sure when. A lot of people are dealing with much worse than cancelled movie premieres, she says. \u201cThis is a very small disappointment.\u201d But still, it stings. \u201cAt 47 years old, to go into the studio and start singing, and discover that I actually had a voice that could work\u2026 it was life-changing for me.\u201d Did she really wait until 47 to start? \u201cPretty much. In high school, I took choir \u2013 it was one of the required courses \u2013 and we had to perform The Pirates Of Penzance. I was furious. I was so scared of singing in front of people that I marched myself to the headmaster\u2019s office: \u2018Mrs Regalman, I do not think that it\u2019s fair to force somebody who doesn\u2019t want to sing and who doesn\u2019t want to be on a stage to be on a stage.\u2019 And she told me I had to do it. So I did the play but I just mouthed the words.\u201d Ross sang in public a couple of times after that, but says she would always add \u201ca flare of comedy or hide behind a character\u201d. So it wasn\u2019t until very recently that she decided \u201cto face one of my biggest childhood fears. And, typical me, I didn\u2019t do it small \u2013 I decided to do it as the lead in a movie playing a musical diva.\u201d A couple of months ago, Ross unveiled a clip of her singing in the film, during an on-stage interview with Oprah Winfrey. Curled up in her chair in an electric-blue suit, she looked on the verge of tears as the song, called Love Myself, played to a live audience. \u201cI had no memory of getting myself curled up in that chair until I looked over and saw the screen,\u201d she says. She wasn\u2019t the only emotional one: Oprah cried, too, and the audience applauded; Ross has a beautiful voice. On-screen and off, she has spent much of her career challenging established narratives. She is often asked about her unmarried status, and has become a sort of accidental spokeswoman for the joy of being a single, childfree woman. The idea that being a woman means having a husband and kids is so deeply ingrained, she says, that most people don\u2019t even know how inappropriate they\u2019re being when they ask why she\u2019s not married. Strangers poking around in her uterus used to irritate her, but she doesn\u2019t \u201cmind any more. It no longer stings. It\u2019s just an opportunity for me to expand somebody\u2019s idea of the world and add something different. Women, particularly black and brown women, are told we should occupy a smaller area of real estate. Everything in my being and my career is about encouraging women to give themselves permission to take up the space. I am very comfortable making people uncomfortable. Not just for my own wellbeing, but hopefully so that other women don\u2019t have to bear that weight quite as heavily as my generation.\u201d She remains \u201chappily and gloriously single\u201d, but that doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t men in the background. When I ask whether she\u2019s had texts from exes during lockdown \u2013 something of a pandemic phenomenon \u2013 she grins. \u201cOh, that\u2019s definitely come up,\u201d she says coyly, but won\u2019t go into detail. \u201cI have a heart that is very open and available to find the right man,\u201d she continues. \u201cBut, you know, the old expression \u2018sweep me off my feet\u2019 seems ridiculous. I want to find a man who will meet me where I am. Because, actually, I like my feet. I like them grounded on the floor.\u201d Our conversation is interrupted by the ping of a text message from a special man in her life. It\u2019s her dad, wishing her a happy Passover. Ross has been doing regular group calls with her family since lockdown began. \u201cFaceTime with my dad is like this,\u201d she says with a laugh, manoeuvring the computer under her armpit. \u201cI\u2019m like: \u2018I can\u2019t see you!\u2019 And he\u2019s like: \u2018I can see you!\u2019 And I\u2019m like: \u2018I know, I can\u2019t see you!\u2019\u201d What does she miss most about normal life? \u201cI really miss smelling the people that I love,\u201d Ross says. \u201cBeing able to nestle my head in my mom\u2019s neck, or in my best friend\u2019s. When I hug my best friend, it\u2019s a full body hug. And I know what her scent is \u2013 not just her perfume, but just what she smells like. I don\u2019t think I realised how important that is.\u201d The hardest moments of lockdown, Ross says, seem to be between 10.30pm and 1am. It\u2019s then that the \u201ccollective trauma and bizarre nature\u201d of what we\u2019re going through really hits her. \u201cI just want something to distract me and it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s just me. Oh hi again! Hey you!\u2019\u201d There has been some solace, she says, in the fiddle-leaf fig she\u2019s sitting next to. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing a lot of talking to her. She was a little upset to begin with because I forgot to water her for the first few weeks \u2013 a lot of leaves started to fall off. But this last week has given me some encouragement that maybe my father\u2019s green thumb got genetically passed down, after all.\u201d She looks at the plant with a quiet expression of satisfaction. \u201cYou know, I think she\u2019s back to a joyful state.\u201d \u2022 The High Note will be available to rent at home from 29 May.",

      "body": "<p>My sister is a junior doctor in a big hospital. I don\u2019t have much to say about how work has been for her during the coronavirus pandemic, because she tells me nothing about it. Or, to be more specific, she tells me things are \u201cfine\u201d. This is how things are with us. I\u2019ve always held out my problems for all to see, dumping them on friends and any poor sod who happens to sit next to me on the train, like a dog presenting its latest kill from the garden. But my sister operates in a lower key, as my parents and I discovered when she casually mentioned one night in her early 20s that she had been held up at gunpoint a year or so ago. She hadn\u2019t thought to tell any of us at the time, because she didn\u2019t want to worry people and, honestly, she was fine.</p> <p>So I don\u2019t hear much about the goings on at hospital from her, but I don\u2019t really have to: I read about them in my newspaper every morning. Even aside from the whole global plague situation, which would be a big enough portion on any doctor\u2019s plate, there are the now notoriously dwindling supplies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/coronavirus-ppe-shortage-doctors-face-hard-decisions-on-whether-to-treat-patients\" title=\"\">of personal protective equipment</a>, or PPE.

      "bodyText": "My sister is a junior doctor in a big hospital. I don\u2019t have much to say about how work has been for her during the coronavirus pandemic, because she tells me nothing about it. Or, to be more specific, she tells me things are \u201cfine\u201d. This is how things are with us. I\u2019ve always held out my problems for all to see, dumping them on friends and any poor sod who happens to sit next to me on the train, like a dog presenting its latest kill from the garden. But my sister operates in a lower key, as my parents and I discovered when she casually mentioned one night in her early 20s that she had been held up at gunpoint a year or so ago. She hadn\u2019t thought to tell any of us at the time, because she didn\u2019t want to worry people and, honestly, she was fine. So I don\u2019t hear much about the goings on at hospital from her, but I don\u2019t really have to: I read about them in my newspaper every morning. Even aside from the whole global plague situation, which would be a big enough portion on any doctor\u2019s plate, there are the now notoriously dwindling supplies of personal protective equipment, or PPE. I\u2019d previously thought PPE was merely an acronym for Politics, Philosophy and Economics, one of those weird Oxford degrees studied by people who fantasise about running Britain one day. And perhaps that\u2019s what the people who run Britain thought, too, because they were rather cavalier about our supplies: we don\u2019t need any more PPE \u2013 we\u2019re already chock-full of those degrees! Except it turns out the other kind is quite useful and the government missed not one, not two, but three chances to bulk-buy it for healthcare workers. As a result, while EU doctors were getting \u00a31.3bn of PPE this month, NHS staff were being told to make do with aprons and snorkel masks. As I write, at least 100 NHS healthcare workers have died from coronavirus. By the time you read this, it will be more. Doctors are now forced to make an impossible decision: continue doing their job and risk infecting themselves and their families, or walk away from their patients and colleagues. This is not a choice those of us who are related to healthcare workers can make for them, as much as we would like to.

      "body": "<p>Good evening, and welcome to our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Melissa Davey bringing you the main stories on Saturday 2 May.</p> \n<h2>Spread throughout NSW nursing home continues</h2> \n<p>Another two staff members at Sydney\u2019s Newmarch House nursing home have tested positive for Covid-19 following the deaths of 13 residents. The New South Wales chief medical officer, Dr Kerry Chant, has said NSW Health <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/02/investigation-into-possible-breaches-of-coronavirus-infection-control-at-newmarch-house\">will look into the possibility that infection controls were breached</a>. More than one-third of the home\u2019s residents have now been infected. Anglicare, which manages the home, said on Saturday that the new infections occurred \u201cdespite having strict procedures and enforced infection control practices in place\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are investigating further as to how this occurred and we continue to work closely with the NSW public health unit on this. Additional positive cases associated with Newmarch House are very distressing for our staff, our residents, and their families,\u201d Anglicare said in a statement. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/02/why-is-it-spreading-sydneys-newmarch-house-aged-care-home-becomes-epicentre-of-covid-19-fight\">Read more about how the highly infectious virus was able to take hold in the home</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/02/well-feel-a-bit-more-human-australians-welcome-partial-lift-of-coronavirus-lockdown\">'We'll feel a bit more human': Australians welcome partial lift of coronavirus lockdown</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>Restrictions begin to ease throughout the country</h2> \n<p>Queenslanders are enjoying their first weekend under eased restrictions, which means they can leave their home for recreation. They can have a picnic, shop for non-essential items, and the distance they can travel has also been extended. Some national parks are also open. Meanwhile the Tasmanian premier, Peter Gutwein, confirmed that as of midnight Sunday, extra restrictions in the north-west of the state, put in place following clusters of the virus in two hospitals, will be removed. On Friday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/02/well-feel-a-bit-more-human-australians-welcome-partial-lift-of-coronavirus-lockdown\">NSW partially relaxed its restrictions so that up to two adults (and any dependent children) can visit any other household</a>.</p> \n<p>While restrictions have eased elsewhere in Australia, they remain in place in Victoria. There are only four reasons for people in the state to leave their home: food and supplies, medical care and care giving, exercise, and work or education. Two further meetings of national cabinet are scheduled next week, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/morrison-says-early-mark-of-eased-restrictions-depends-on-uptake-of-covidsafe-tracing-app\">leaders to decide on Friday how federal restrictions can be eased</a>. The federal government wants to see more downloads of its Covidsafe contact tracing app before then.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>New Zealand Warriors granted permission to enter the country</h2> \n<p>The New Zealand Warriors will arrive in Tamworth on Sunday and be able to train despite a 14-day isolation period, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/02/warriors-given-green-light-to-enter-australia-and-train-for-nrl-season-starting-on-28-may\">after receiving clearance from Australian border force and the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton</a>. They received final approvals on Saturday. The latest green light was crucial for the NRL\u2019s ambition of a return by 28 May. The NRL chairman,<strong> </strong>Peter V\u2019landys, said the Warriors would join every club in a mandatory education day on Monday to ensure players toed the line during the coronavirus pandemic. Queensland\u2019s premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, confirmed on Friday that borders would be open for the state\u2019s three NRL teams to play in NSW.

      "bodyText": "Good evening, and welcome to our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Melissa Davey bringing you the main stories on Saturday 2 May. Spread throughout NSW nursing home continues Another two staff members at Sydney\u2019s Newmarch House nursing home have tested positive for Covid-19 following the deaths of 13 residents. The New South Wales chief medical officer, Dr Kerry Chant, has said NSW Health will look into the possibility that infection controls were breached. More than one-third of the home\u2019s residents have now been infected. Anglicare, which manages the home, said on Saturday that the new infections occurred \u201cdespite having strict procedures and enforced infection control practices in place\u201d. \u201cWe are investigating further as to how this occurred and we continue to work closely with the NSW public health unit on this. Additional positive cases associated with Newmarch House are very distressing for our staff, our residents, and their families,\u201d Anglicare said in a statement. Read more about how the highly infectious virus was able to take hold in the home. Restrictions begin to ease throughout the country Queenslanders are enjoying their first weekend under eased restrictions, which means they can leave their home for recreation. They can have a picnic, shop for non-essential items, and the distance they can travel has also been extended. Some national parks are also open. Meanwhile the Tasmanian premier, Peter Gutwein, confirmed that as of midnight Sunday, extra restrictions in the north-west of the state, put in place following clusters of the virus in two hospitals, will be removed. On Friday, NSW partially relaxed its restrictions so that up to two adults (and any dependent children) can visit any other household. While restrictions have eased elsewhere in Australia, they remain in place in Victoria. There are only four reasons for people in the state to leave their home: food and supplies, medical care and care giving, exercise, and work or education. Two further meetings of national cabinet are scheduled next week, with leaders to decide on Friday how federal restrictions can be eased. The federal government wants to see more downloads of its Covidsafe contact tracing app before then. New Zealand Warriors granted permission to enter the country The New Zealand Warriors will arrive in Tamworth on Sunday and be able to train despite a 14-day isolation period, after receiving clearance from Australian border force and the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton. They received final approvals on Saturday. The latest green light was crucial for the NRL\u2019s ambition of a return by 28 May. The NRL chairman, Peter V\u2019landys, said the Warriors would join every club in a mandatory education day on Monday to ensure players toed the line during the coronavirus pandemic. Queensland\u2019s premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, confirmed on Friday that borders would be open for the state\u2019s three NRL teams to play in NSW. It means North Queensland, Brisbane and the Gold Coast will not need to enter isolation camps in Sydney and can remain at home with their families. Australia\u2019s US ambassador says virus inquiry just about getting the facts The Australian ambassador to the United States, Arthur Sinodinos, says calls to hold an inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus are not about retribution or revenge. \u201cMy view is we have got a lot to learn from this, China has a lot to learn from this, we\u2019ve all go a lot to learn by comparing how we did things and in the early stages working out what could have been done better,\u201d he told Sky News on Saturday. \u201cThis is about getting the facts.\u201d He said the call by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, for such an inquiry was \u201cpretty sensible\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a major life-changing event, the biggest event probably of our lifetimes,\u201d the former Liberal senator said. \u201cWe did it after the Ebola crisis a few years ago. The World Health Organization and other bodies looked at what lessons we could learn from that. We have got to do the same again.\u201d Virus cluster at a meat processing plant A coronavirus cluster has been uncovered at a Melbourne meat processing facility, the state\u2019s health minister, Jenny Mikakos, said on Saturday.

      "body": "<p>The effects of the coronavirus crisis have been felt everywhere, but one of the hardest hit sectors has been the holiday industry. With resorts closed and all but essential journeys banned in countries across the world, 2020 looks set to be the year that travel was put on hold.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/who-declares-coronavirus-pandemic\">Less than two months into the pandemic</a>, thousands of holidays, honeymoons, backpacking trips, cruises, and city breaks have either been cancelled, or look like they will be.</p> <p>The shutdown has left hundreds of thousands of consumers out of pocket, in some cases by more than \u00a320,000. It has also left the travel industry fighting to survive. Here, we try to navigate you through the chaos.</p> <h2><strong>My flight </strong><strong>has been cancelled and </strong><strong>all I\u2019m being offered is an alternative flight or vouchers </strong>\u2013<strong> is this legal?</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1cecaae1d68a5ae68d6d1195769682e41f51672\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1cecaae1d68a5ae68d6d1195769682e41f51672/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Signs asking people to not use seats in Terminal 5 at Heathrow airport\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coronavirus restrictions at Heathrow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>No. But that hasn\u2019t stopped airlines doing exactly that. All flights on EU carriers within, or heading into the EU, and all flights leaving from an EU airport, are protected by \u201cdenied boarding\u201d rules, which require a full refund in seven days when flights are cancelled.</p> <p>The problem is that enforcing these rights is proving very difficult. Many airlines are making it near impossible to get refunds in the hope that customers will reschedule or accept vouchers instead.</p> <p>After initially promising to reimburse consumers within 20 working days, Ryanair has now said they should <a href=\"https://www.ryanair.com/ie/en/useful-info/refund-voucher\">accept vouchers</a> valid for 12 months, which it will then refund if not used by the end of the year.

It\u2019s a similar story across the sector, and the regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, has so far declined to intervene.

While Ryanair looks safe, some airlines have already collapsed and others, including Norwegian, are in bailout talks.</p> <p>Coby Benson, a solicitor at the specialist flight compensation firm Bott and Co, says the law is on the side of cash refunds. He advises customers to submit their refund request using the following text:</p> <p>\u201cI understand that my flight [flight number] on [flight date] has been cancelled and I therefore request a full refund pursuant to articles 5(1)(a) and 8(1)(a) of EC Regulation No.261/2004. For the avoidance of doubt, I do not accept a travel voucher.\u201d</p> <p>There is evidence that passengers have been getting refunds \u2013 but only after very long waits.</p> <p>If the airline does not respond or refuses to comply, you can issue small court proceedings or use the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/alternative-dispute-resolution-for-consumers/alternative-dispute-resolution-for-consumers\">Alternative Dispute Resolution</a>. You will need the airline\u2019s address, which can usually be found online.</p> <p>Benson says all claims for flights that started or ended in the UK can be heard in Britain\u2019s courts.

      "bodyText": "The effects of the coronavirus crisis have been felt everywhere, but one of the hardest hit sectors has been the holiday industry. With resorts closed and all but essential journeys banned in countries across the world, 2020 looks set to be the year that travel was put on hold. Less than two months into the pandemic, thousands of holidays, honeymoons, backpacking trips, cruises, and city breaks have either been cancelled, or look like they will be. The shutdown has left hundreds of thousands of consumers out of pocket, in some cases by more than \u00a320,000. It has also left the travel industry fighting to survive. Here, we try to navigate you through the chaos. My flight has been cancelled and all I\u2019m being offered is an alternative flight or vouchers \u2013 is this legal? No. But that hasn\u2019t stopped airlines doing exactly that. All flights on EU carriers within, or heading into the EU, and all flights leaving from an EU airport, are protected by \u201cdenied boarding\u201d rules, which require a full refund in seven days when flights are cancelled. The problem is that enforcing these rights is proving very difficult. Many airlines are making it near impossible to get refunds in the hope that customers will reschedule or accept vouchers instead. After initially promising to reimburse consumers within 20 working days, Ryanair has now said they should accept vouchers valid for 12 months, which it will then refund if not used by the end of the year. Alternatively, it says customers can wait until the \u201ccrisis has passed\u201d for a refund. Refunds at British Airways are being processed only by customer services, which is proving difficult to contact. It\u2019s a similar story across the sector, and the regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, has so far declined to intervene. Airlines have asked the EU to suspend the rules and allow vouchers instead, although it is hard to see how this could be applied retrospectively. In the face of a no-refund policy, what should I do? Accepting replacement vouchers is risky. While Ryanair looks safe, some airlines have already collapsed and others, including Norwegian, are in bailout talks. Coby Benson, a solicitor at the specialist flight compensation firm Bott and Co, says the law is on the side of cash refunds. He advises customers to submit their refund request using the following text: \u201cI understand that my flight [flight number] on [flight date] has been cancelled and I therefore request a full refund pursuant to articles 5(1)(a) and 8(1)(a) of EC Regulation No.261/2004. For the avoidance of doubt, I do not accept a travel voucher.\u201d There is evidence that passengers have been getting refunds \u2013 but only after very long waits. If the airline does not respond or refuses to comply, you can issue small court proceedings or use the Alternative Dispute Resolution. You will need the airline\u2019s address, which can usually be found online. Benson says all claims for flights that started or ended in the UK can be heard in Britain\u2019s courts. The other option is to approach your bank card provider (see below). My flight operated as scheduled but I was unable to go on it due to the lockdown. What then? Amazingly, several airlines are still running flights in and out of UK airports, meaning the trip is not cancelled. Richard Colbey, a barrister at Lamb Chambers, says the fact that it is currently illegal to go on holiday to, say Lisbon, means that the contract between the passenger and the airline can be deemed to be \u201cfrustrated\u201d. In such cases a refund is due, although the customer may have to resort to the courts to get the money. The easier option for many will be to claim on travel insurance. Because the government advised against all but essential travel, policies should pay cancellation claims provided you bought it before the pandemic was declared on 11 March. I had a package holiday booked, what are my rights? Package tour operators are required to refund customers within 14 days when a trip is cancelled. However, in many cases refunds have been denied and holidaymakers told they must rebook or accept vouchers. Tui said this week it would give customers accepting vouchers a 20% \u201cbooking incentive\u201d \u2013 extra money to spend on their next break.

If have lost your job or income, ask to be moved to the front of the queue. Travel insurers will not pay out when the tour operator is legally obliged to refund and is still trading. I\u2019m booked to go away over the May half-term or in June, but I don\u2019t want to go The next big date in the holiday calendar is 25 May, the start of half-term in some parts of the UK, but trips look unlikely to go ahead. For those planning DIY trips, it seems highly unlikely that European countries will be accepting guests \u2013 France said this week its beaches would remain closed until June. If you are due to travel and your trip is yet to be cancelled, the advice is to do nothing. If the Foreign Office continues to advise against all but essential travel, your tour operator will have cancel and a full refund will be due. Even if you have no intention of travelling, do not cancel the holiday yourself as you will lose your booking and the possible refund. It is a similar story for UK trips. Whether these will happen will depend on the lockdown measures still in place. Holiday cottages in Cornwall, for example, may technically be accessible in May and June.

And yes, it truly is an embarrassment. Whether it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/ellen-degeneres\">Ellen DeGeneres</a> joking that being trapped in one of her many multimillion dollar mansions was \u201clike being in prison\u201d, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/justin-bieber\">Justin Bieber</a> sighing that it was similarly tough being in his mansion, \u201cbut obviously, you know, we\u2019ve worked hard for where we\u2019re at, so it\u2019s like, we can\u2019t feel bad\u201d, or of course <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/mar/20/comedians-gal-gadot-imagine-video-joe-lycett\">Gal Gadot\u2019s gruesome </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/mar/20/comedians-gal-gadot-imagine-video-joe-lycett\">all-star medley of Imagine</a>, we have not been left short of examples of \u201cthe talent\u201d seeming to be completely tone deaf. When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/madonna\">Madonna</a> intoned, from a bath strewn with petals, that this strand of coronavirus was \u201cthe great equaliser\u201d, it turned out she was quite right. Yes, we replied straight back, you\u2019re all equally irritating.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2020/mar/25/the-guide-staying-in-sign-up-for-our-home-entertainment-tips\">The Guide: Staying In  \u2013 sign up for our home entertainment tips</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The speed of the spread of Covid-19 has been one of the most astonishing things about it; the rate at which it emerged and upended all of our lives. It is no surprise, then, that it should affect celebrity culture in the same way. The pace at which artists of every kind responded to the crisis, mostly through their own social media channels, was only equalled by the ferocity with which the public clapped back as they exposed new depths of narcissism and privilege. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/arts/virus-celebrities.html\">\u201cCelebrity Culture is Burning,\u201d screeched the New York Times</a> a few weeks ago; <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/04/celebrity-coronavirus-social-media\">\u201cThere Is No Good Celebrity Content Right Now,\u201d decreed Vanity Fair</a>.</p> <p>Before we go further, it must be said that we are loving some stars more than ever in this crisis: whether that is Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson, diagnosed with the virus early and handling their predicament with good grace (or, more to the point, communicating that good grace well, too); or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/meerasyal\">Meera Syal</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/naughtyboymusic\">Naughty Boy</a>, who have used their platform to broadcast health advice to the British BAME community, which seems to be disproportionately affected by the crisis; or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/08/john-krasinski-a-quiet-place-emily-blunt-horror\">John Krasinski</a>, who created a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOe_y6KKvS3PdIfb9q9pGug\">\u201cgood news\u201d YouTube show</a>, offering a virtual prom for high schoolers deprived of the real thing, and helping healthcare workers get tickets for their favourite baseball team.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b1c82d65fd2db9d179431a8cfa8eaef3944ff0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b1c82d65fd2db9d179431a8cfa8eaef3944ff0a/21_58_1470_1142/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ellen Degeneres at home.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"777\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sofa, so good... Ellen DeGeneres.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Instagram</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A kind of rigorously selfless approach seems to have defined the efforts of those who are coming out of this well (it helps, of course, if you already liked them in the first place). When, on Instagram Live (the stars\u2019 favourite recourse to publicity in these times), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/rihanna\">Rihanna</a> was asked yet again where her latest album is, she snapped back that she was busy \u201ctrying to save the world\u201d \u2013 after all, she has, among other things, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/10/rihanna-1-point-coronavirus-lockdown-donation-los-angeles-domestic-violence\">donated bucketloads of money</a>. Now, if some other celebrity had said that, we might not have been so forgiving. Yet people seem to have liked the comment; for one thing, that\u2019s how we like RiRi to talk, and, for another, unlike those stars who mostly seemed to have just been lecturing us from a (suitable) distance, there is the sense that she really is trying to save the world . </p> <p>Often, though, a simmering annoyance is defining many people\u2019s engagement with the biggest entertainers. And if you stop and think about it, there is a thudding inevitability to it. Not only are we, the public, cooped up at home, glued to our smartphones, with fewer places to vent our frustrations, but they, the stars, are as well. People who positively thrive off gaining our attention \u2013 who make a living both financially and emotionally from it \u2013 have had their means of doing so drastically reduced. Because it is vital to point out that the showbiz economy has been decimated: no TV shows or films being made, no plays staged, no festivals all summer, no \u201cevents\u201d that even that brightest new strand of celebrity, the influencer, can \u201cinfluence\u201d from. Whether you are dealing in old-school showbiz entertainment or very new-school social media performance, your stage has been shut down. And so it is that many have thrown themselves at their own phones, their last remaining medium, with a desperate fervour \u2013 and often equally desperate results.</p> <p>The ones who have most galled people \u2013 eg Sam Smith vlogging about having a \u201cquarantine meltdown\u201d from their mansion \u2013 have done so for a couple of reasons, diagnoses <a href=\"https://www.city.ac.uk/people/academics/chris-rojek\">Chris Rojek</a>, professor of sociology at City University, London, and author of an academic study of celebrity. If we now live in a world where celebrities are rated more than politicians \u2013 and can indeed take politicians\u2019 jobs \u2013 it\u2019s because they feel more \u201creal\u201d, says Rojek. Over the last century, stars became more and more intimate-seeming as they entered our homes via first the radio, then television and then, latterly, the internet.</p> <p>Indeed, the creation of Twitter, Facebook and Instagram has just accelerated the trend where celebs appear to us every single day, telling us stories about their lives and helping us make sense of ours. So, when all is well, they can project a profitable relatability. The intended effect is that \u201cyou can trust these people and what they say, because they seem more on your side than a politician,\u201d says Rojek.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/B95M4kNhbzz/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

They have inserted themselves in pretty much every facet of existence, from how to bake muffins to navigating war zones, and this is now broadly accepted as the norm.

We did not need Covid-19 to get a peek into Ellen DeGeneres\u2019s or the Beckhams\u2019 mansions; we had had plenty of peeks already, as they invited us (at well-curated moments) into their own houses. The greatest stars of the 2010s, the Kardashian clan, built their behemoth brand round a show set for the most part in their airy LA homes. So why are we finding this so grating now? It could be that, before, we liked to think we could aspire to that lifestyle, somehow. Even a tiny unconscious part of you might still believe you could live like Kendall Jenner. Now, locked at home and with diminished income, the gap seems concrete and unbridgeable.</p> <p>Also, says Rojek, it might not just be a simple frustration that these people are far more privileged than us. \u201cI think one of the factors that is different about the virus is the sense that celebrities are appearing to the audience as irrelevant. The cure now lies with medical staff and with scientists and politicians. It\u2019s becoming apparent, in a crisis like this, that whatever gestures celebrities have made, they\u2019re as helpless as the ordinary person.\u201d Naturally, this is not a sexy look.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a0659f4b7ab4b2172edda5605c21b0e5df11c5cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0659f4b7ab4b2172edda5605c21b0e5df11c5cb/243_0_3750_2251/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lady Gaga performing during One World\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">All we hear is... Lady Gaga performing during One World: Together at Home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toge/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Funnily enough, so far it seems like the best way for an entertainer to handle the current crisis is just to, well, entertain. Whether it\u2019s Florence Pugh cooking up a storm in her kitchen on her Instastories, or a whole galaxy of singers just sticking to their day job, singing, in Lady Gaga\u2019s Together at Home concert, we are mostly appreciative of good, old-fashioned distraction. In today\u2019s cluttered celebrity landscape, it comes as a kind of relief. One of the most dominant stories being told in this Covid-19 era is that it could lead us back to a kind of simplification, or detox, and this applies to showbiz, too; there seems to be a persistent hope this pandemic may yet sort the celebrity wheat from the sublebrity chaff. It is an impression that is reinforced when I speak to one senior showbiz publicist in London, who looks after a handful of old-school megastars. \u201cEurgh! Influencers!\u201d he cries. If coronavirus does us one favour, he suggests, it would be to flatten the curve of the influencer boom. </p> <p>He may get his wish: there have been reports of influencers struggling to make ends meet, the events they post their missives from having all now evaporated. The publicist isn\u2019t too sympathetic. \u201cI think that proper celebrities \u2013 ie people that are talented and creative \u2013 might enjoy this time,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ll write a brilliant book or a brilliant song. But \u2018celebrities\u2019 in the modern sense of the word are gonna shrink, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p> <p>Certainly, it\u2019s true that for those who once motored on, constantly producing cosily banal content every day for content\u2019s sake, the machine has started to splutter. Instead, the publicist believes that all this will usher in a more austere take on celebrity culture. \u201cI saw something the other day where someone wrote: \u2018Why don\u2019t we fill the Strictly lineup with health workers and real life?\u2019 Although I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll do that, I do think there\u2019ll be a shift away from the sort of champagne-lifestyle celebrity.\u201d</p> <p>And yet \u2026 will there be? Coronavirus is unprecedented, and it is too early to grasp its effects on the celebrity ecosystem. For instance, the publicist thinks that many stars have already stopped keeping their PR teams on retainers; will they go back to them? Can gossip sites such as TMZ subsist on just reporting on celebrities\u2019 Instastories in lockdown? Still, it would be naive to hope that it will somehow undo the total dominance over our culture that celebrities have achieved throughout the 20th century and into the 21st. Yes, we may gripe and grouch and push back, chew them up and turn them into memes, but are we any less dependent on them? And, frankly, in a culture that looks set to be stripped back for months to come, what other options for entertainment do we have? Perhaps we need to be more honest with ourselves as to what we want from our stars. We may chuckle at their desperate need for approval but it works both ways, says Rojek. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that celebrities are going to go away because what we will need from them is that feeling of grounding, that somebody understands us,\u201d he says. If Covid-19 reveals the extent of our celebrity culture addiction, it doesn\u2019t yet offer us a way to wean ourselves off it. Honestly, imagine a world where your day was not brightened by Gal Gadot having Kristen Wiig mutter some John Lennon at you in a wide-brimmed fedora. No, really \u2013 can you?</p>",

      "bodyText": "Covid-19: which celebrity is annoying you the most? Ever since the world went pretty much into lockdown in March, we have been offered an embarrassment of riches. And yes, it truly is an embarrassment. Whether it is Ellen DeGeneres joking that being trapped in one of her many multimillion dollar mansions was \u201clike being in prison\u201d, or Justin Bieber sighing that it was similarly tough being in his mansion, \u201cbut obviously, you know, we\u2019ve worked hard for where we\u2019re at, so it\u2019s like, we can\u2019t feel bad\u201d, or of course Gal Gadot\u2019s gruesome all-star medley of Imagine, we have not been left short of examples of \u201cthe talent\u201d seeming to be completely tone deaf. When Madonna intoned, from a bath strewn with petals, that this strand of coronavirus was \u201cthe great equaliser\u201d, it turned out she was quite right. Yes, we replied straight back, you\u2019re all equally irritating. The speed of the spread of Covid-19 has been one of the most astonishing things about it; the rate at which it emerged and upended all of our lives. It is no surprise, then, that it should affect celebrity culture in the same way. The pace at which artists of every kind responded to the crisis, mostly through their own social media channels, was only equalled by the ferocity with which the public clapped back as they exposed new depths of narcissism and privilege. \u201cCelebrity Culture is Burning,\u201d screeched the New York Times a few weeks ago; \u201cThere Is No Good Celebrity Content Right Now,\u201d decreed Vanity Fair. Before we go further, it must be said that we are loving some stars more than ever in this crisis: whether that is Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson, diagnosed with the virus early and handling their predicament with good grace (or, more to the point, communicating that good grace well, too); or Meera Syal and Naughty Boy, who have used their platform to broadcast health advice to the British BAME community, which seems to be disproportionately affected by the crisis; or John Krasinski, who created a \u201cgood news\u201d YouTube show, offering a virtual prom for high schoolers deprived of the real thing, and helping healthcare workers get tickets for their favourite baseball team. A kind of rigorously selfless approach seems to have defined the efforts of those who are coming out of this well (it helps, of course, if you already liked them in the first place). When, on Instagram Live (the stars\u2019 favourite recourse to publicity in these times), Rihanna was asked yet again where her latest album is, she snapped back that she was busy \u201ctrying to save the world\u201d \u2013 after all, she has, among other things, donated bucketloads of money. Now, if some other celebrity had said that, we might not have been so forgiving. Yet people seem to have liked the comment; for one thing, that\u2019s how we like RiRi to talk, and, for another, unlike those stars who mostly seemed to have just been lecturing us from a (suitable) distance, there is the sense that she really is trying to save the world . Often, though, a simmering annoyance is defining many people\u2019s engagement with the biggest entertainers. And if you stop and think about it, there is a thudding inevitability to it. Not only are we, the public, cooped up at home, glued to our smartphones, with fewer places to vent our frustrations, but they, the stars, are as well. People who positively thrive off gaining our attention \u2013 who make a living both financially and emotionally from it \u2013 have had their means of doing so drastically reduced. Because it is vital to point out that the showbiz economy has been decimated: no TV shows or films being made, no plays staged, no festivals all summer, no \u201cevents\u201d that even that brightest new strand of celebrity, the influencer, can \u201cinfluence\u201d from. Whether you are dealing in old-school showbiz entertainment or very new-school social media performance, your stage has been shut down. And so it is that many have thrown themselves at their own phones, their last remaining medium, with a desperate fervour \u2013 and often equally desperate results. The ones who have most galled people \u2013 eg Sam Smith vlogging about having a \u201cquarantine meltdown\u201d from their mansion \u2013 have done so for a couple of reasons, diagnoses Chris Rojek, professor of sociology at City University, London, and author of an academic study of celebrity. If we now live in a world where celebrities are rated more than politicians \u2013 and can indeed take politicians\u2019 jobs \u2013 it\u2019s because they feel more \u201creal\u201d, says Rojek. Over the last century, stars became more and more intimate-seeming as they entered our homes via first the radio, then television and then, latterly, the internet. Indeed, the creation of Twitter, Facebook and Instagram has just accelerated the trend where celebs appear to us every single day, telling us stories about their lives and helping us make sense of ours. So, when all is well, they can project a profitable relatability. The intended effect is that \u201cyou can trust these people and what they say, because they seem more on your side than a politician,\u201d says Rojek. In the 21st century, it is hard to overestimate how far we\u2019ve come in using celebrities to make sense of the world. They have inserted themselves in pretty much every facet of existence, from how to bake muffins to navigating war zones, and this is now broadly accepted as the norm. Again, this isn\u2019t necessarily sinister: Tom Hanks\u2019s Covid-19 diagnosis is credited with helping many Americans take the virus seriously (unlike, say, their president). When assorted superstars transmit messages from their mega-compounds in the countryside, they are reminding us that they are \u201cuntouchable\u201d, says Rojek. \u201cHere you are, saying: \u2018We\u2019re all in this together,\u2019 but you\u2019re actually underlining the fact that an enormous gulf separates celebrities from ordinary people.\u201d It is true that one of the fun side-effects of this crisis has been gaining ever more insight into celebrities\u2019 home lives, but the gawping has often turned sour. The funny thing is, though, we always knew this gulf existed. We did not need Covid-19 to get a peek into Ellen DeGeneres\u2019s or the Beckhams\u2019 mansions; we had had plenty of peeks already, as they invited us (at well-curated moments) into their own houses.

Now, locked at home and with diminished income, the gap seems concrete and unbridgeable. Also, says Rojek, it might not just be a simple frustration that these people are far more privileged than us. \u201cI think one of the factors that is different about the virus is the sense that celebrities are appearing to the audience as irrelevant. The cure now lies with medical staff and with scientists and politicians. It\u2019s becoming apparent, in a crisis like this, that whatever gestures celebrities have made, they\u2019re as helpless as the ordinary person.\u201d Naturally, this is not a sexy look. Funnily enough, so far it seems like the best way for an entertainer to handle the current crisis is just to, well, entertain. Whether it\u2019s Florence Pugh cooking up a storm in her kitchen on her Instastories, or a whole galaxy of singers just sticking to their day job, singing, in Lady Gaga\u2019s Together at Home concert, we are mostly appreciative of good, old-fashioned distraction. In today\u2019s cluttered celebrity landscape, it comes as a kind of relief. One of the most dominant stories being told in this Covid-19 era is that it could lead us back to a kind of simplification, or detox, and this applies to showbiz, too; there seems to be a persistent hope this pandemic may yet sort the celebrity wheat from the sublebrity chaff. It is an impression that is reinforced when I speak to one senior showbiz publicist in London, who looks after a handful of old-school megastars. \u201cEurgh! Influencers!\u201d he cries. If coronavirus does us one favour, he suggests, it would be to flatten the curve of the influencer boom. He may get his wish: there have been reports of influencers struggling to make ends meet, the events they post their missives from having all now evaporated. The publicist isn\u2019t too sympathetic. \u201cI think that proper celebrities \u2013 ie people that are talented and creative \u2013 might enjoy this time,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ll write a brilliant book or a brilliant song. But \u2018celebrities\u2019 in the modern sense of the word are gonna shrink, aren\u2019t they?\u201d Certainly, it\u2019s true that for those who once motored on, constantly producing cosily banal content every day for content\u2019s sake, the machine has started to splutter. Instead, the publicist believes that all this will usher in a more austere take on celebrity culture. \u201cI saw something the other day where someone wrote: \u2018Why don\u2019t we fill the Strictly lineup with health workers and real life?\u2019 Although I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll do that, I do think there\u2019ll be a shift away from the sort of champagne-lifestyle celebrity.\u201d And yet \u2026 will there be? Coronavirus is unprecedented, and it is too early to grasp its effects on the celebrity ecosystem. For instance, the publicist thinks that many stars have already stopped keeping their PR teams on retainers; will they go back to them? Can gossip sites such as TMZ subsist on just reporting on celebrities\u2019 Instastories in lockdown? Still, it would be naive to hope that it will somehow undo the total dominance over our culture that celebrities have achieved throughout the 20th century and into the 21st. Yes, we may gripe and grouch and push back, chew them up and turn them into memes, but are we any less dependent on them? And, frankly, in a culture that looks set to be stripped back for months to come, what other options for entertainment do we have? Perhaps we need to be more honest with ourselves as to what we want from our stars. We may chuckle at their desperate need for approval but it works both ways, says Rojek. \u201cI don\u2019t think that celebrities are going to go away because what we will need from them is that feeling of grounding, that somebody understands us,\u201d he says. If Covid-19 reveals the extent of our celebrity culture addiction, it doesn\u2019t yet offer us a way to wean ourselves off it. Honestly, imagine a world where your day was not brightened by Gal Gadot having Kristen Wiig mutter some John Lennon at you in a wide-brimmed fedora. No, really \u2013 can you?",

But declarations of false victory by the Trump administration and a vacuum of federal leadership have undermined the endeavor, leading experts to warn that reopening the US could result in a disaster. Interviews with agents on the frontlines of the coronavirus battle \u2013 lab directors, chemists, manufacturers, epidemiologists, academics and technologists \u2013 reveal as diverse an application of the legendary American ingenuity as the century has seen. Test kit manufacturers are running production lines around the clock to triple their output, and triple it again. A private healthcare institute in California has constructed a mega-lab to process thousands of tests daily and deliver the results by text message. In smaller labs across the country, microbiologists improvise each day to fill unpredictable supply chain gaps that might leave them without swabs one day, and without crucial chemicals the next. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible what we\u2019ve done together over a short period of time,\u201d Donald Trump said at a White House briefing this week, praising his administration\u2019s response to the pandemic. But analysts say that without centralized governance and coordination, the national effort remains a competing coalition of state and local outfits hampered by duplicated work, competition for supplies, siloed pursuits of non-transferable solutions and red tape that leaves some labs with testing backlogs and others with excess capacity. All of which leaves the US without a unified, coherent strategy for testing and contact tracing to contain a virus that does not respect state borders and has already killed more than 60,000 Americans. Without it, the imminent experiment of reopening the country could be catastrophic, warned Harvard epidemiologist Michael Mina in a conference call with reporters this week. \u201cMy concern is that we\u2019ll end up right where we have been, with major cities having healthcare systems that get overrun quickly because of major outbreaks,\u201d Mina said. Meanwhile, as states begin to relax social distancing measures, the Trump administration is spreading dangerous misinformation, denying supply shortages, underestimating the number of Covid-19 cases and exaggerating the margin of safety conferred by the current volume of testing and contact-tracing, experts say. \u201cWe\u2019ve done more than 200,000 tests in a single day,\u201d Mike Pence said at a taskforce briefing this week, in which Trump touted testing as \u201cone of the great assets that we have\u201d in reopening the US. But at current testing levels, with only rudimentary plans for contact tracing for new cases, the US will be flying virtually blind as it reopens, said Glen Weyl, a technologist who co-authored a report issued by Harvard\u2019s Safra Center for Ethics that calls for 5m tests a day by early June. \u201cNo, definitely not, you can\u2019t open up with that number,\u201d Weyl said of Pence\u2019s announcement. \u201cIt\u2019s not even remotely in the right ballpark.

Thanks from me Graham Readfearn, and Melissa Davey who took you through most of the day\u2019s developments. The Guardian\u2019s global live coverage continues. Here\u2019s what happened in Australia today. Only three states recorded new cases on Saturday. Queensland had one, New South Wales five and Victoria seven. There were no new deaths announced. A coronavirus cluster emerged at an unnamed Melbourne meat processing facility, with eight workers testing positive. Some states started to lift restrictions. Queenslanders were allowed non-essential travel up to 50km from their homes for recreation, but had to stick to social distancing rules. The National Rugby League\u2019s hopes for a restart by 28 May were boosted when the New Zealand Warriors were told they could fly into the Tamworth tomorrow. Australia\u2019s peak medical body, the AMA, urged the NRL and other sporting codes to be cautious as they planned their returns. Australia\u2019s US ambassador, Arthur Sinodinos, said calls for an inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus were not about retribution or revenge against China, but \u201cgetting the facts\u201d. Thanks for being with us. As South Australia launches a new TV campaign tonight, I\u2019ll steal their tag line. Let\u2019s Not Undo All the Good. Saturday is South Australia\u2019s 10th straight day with no new cases. But like other states and territories where new cases numbers are low, the SA government doesn\u2019t want people to get complacent. They\u2019re launching an ad campaign tonight under the tagline \u201cLet\u2019s Not Undo All the Good.\u201d Queenslanders were allowed out from today for recreation after coronavirus restrictions were loosened. People were allowed to travel up to 50km from their homes and be with members of their household, or with one other person. That included non-essential travel. That meant Queenslanders could do radical stuff like laze on a beach, hang around on a park bench, go for a drive, and have a picnic in a park. And so they did. The New Zealand Warriors rugby league team will touch down in Tamworth, NSW tomorrow after they were given a special exemption by Australia\u2019s Border Force to enter the country. New Zealand reported two new Covid-19 cases this morning. Matt Manukia, a sports reporter at TVNZ, says he\u2019s been sent a welcome graphic from the team\u2019s hosts in Tamworth. Tamworth Warriors, anyone? Here\u2019s a quick look at the new cases that have been reported today by all the states and territories. Zero cases have been reported in Tasmania, the ACT, South Australia and Western Australia. Still checking on the NT. Queensland reported one case, New South Wales five and Victoria seven. Afternoon. Graham Readfearn here from a sunny Brisbane, where the Queensland government has very slightly eased restrictions on people\u2019s movement. At lunchtime, the Queensland government launched a new health initiative to try to encourage people to stay healthy and build on all that home-based exercise that absolutely everyone has definitely been doing. Queensland\u2019s health minister, Steve Miles, says he wants Queenslanders to log on to the \u201cBoost Your Healthy\u201d website and \u201ckeep these healthy habits going as restrictions begin to be lifted\u201d. The government says it will be releasing daily workouts from famous Queensland sporting figures, including the Australian netball star Gretel Bueta and boxer Jeff Horn. Here\u2019s Horn\u2019s workout. Do try this at home. Thanks for following our Covid-19 updates throughout the day. I\u2019m handing the blog over to Graham Readfearn to take you through the evening. Signing off from Melbourne, where restrictions are still firmly in place and where it\u2019s 13C. I hope all you Queenslanders are enjoying your beaches and picnics. Back to the deputy chief medical officer update. Prof Michael Kidd urged more people to download the CovidSafe app, with just over 4m downloads to date. He said 611,000 tests had been carried out in Australia, and as of Friday the criteria for testing had been widened. Anyone with respiratory symptoms or fever or \u201ceven the slightest sniffle, cough or sweating\u201d should contact their GP or the healthdirect phone line. He said people with non-Covid health issues should look after their own health and should still call their doctors and arrange an appointment, many of which could be conducted via telehealth. Kidd was concerned people with chronic conditions in particular were putting off appointments and said people should not delay those appointments. \u201cIf you have a child due for immunisation, please take your child to get their regular immunisations. If you need a test including cancer screening please continue to do this as you usually would,\u201d he said. Kidd thanked healthcare workers including those in aged, disability and home care, saying they were looking after the most vulnerable people in challenging times. The West Australian health minister, Roger Cook, said that for the third day in a row no new virus cases had been recorded in the state. He announced the Therapaeutic Goods Administration had approved an order for up to 10,000 West Australian-manufactured face shields. They are being made in the suburb of Malaga, and will be rolled out to hospital staff. The shields have involved input from staff at Royal Perth hospital. A deputy chief medical officer, Prof Michael Kidd, is giving an update, and saying there\u2019s no \u201cabsolute number\u201d of Covidsafe app downloads the government is aiming for, but that it wants as many people as possible to download it. A return to normality will depend on uptake of the contact tracing app, the prime minister said on Friday. Kidd said more than 4m people had downloaded it. \u201cObviously the prime minister is keen to get the number up a lot further,\u201d Kidd said. He said there had been a glitch with the app, with reports that it may be interfering with diabetes-monitoring apps. He said work was being done to rectify that but in the meantime diabetes patients should prioritise their diabetes monitoring and uninstall the app if it was causing problems. Kidd said 611,000 Covid-19 tests had been carried out in Australia to date, one of the highest testing rates in the world. In Australian Covid-19 news so far today: Another two staff members at Sydney\u2019s Newmarch House nursing home have tested positive for Covid-19 following the deaths of 13 residents. Anglicare, which manages the home, said on Saturday that the new infections occurred \u201cdespite having strict procedures and enforced infection control practices in place\u201d. Queenslanders are enjoying their first weekend under eased restrictions which means they can leave their home for recreation. On Friday New South Wales partially relaxed its restrictions so that two adults (and any dependent children) can visit any other household. While restrictions have eased elsewhere in Australia, they remain in place in Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia. The New Zealand Warriors will arrive in Tamworth on Sunday and be able to train despite a 14-day isolation period, after receiving clearance from Border Force and the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton. They received final approvals on Saturday. But the Australian Medical Association warned sporting codes about rushing to start or restart competitions, and said they should wait until the medical experts advise it is safe. A coronavirus cluster has been uncovered at a Melbourne meat processing facility, the state\u2019s health minister, Jenny Mikakos, said on Saturday. Mikakos declined to name the business and said it had been closed for cleaning and all staff were being tested. More on flight QF614 from Melbourne to Brisbane which the Queensland health minister earlier said had a traveller on board with the virus. Queensland Health is in the process of contacting people from the 22 April flight. In a statement the department said: We ask that passengers seated in rows 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 of this flight who have not already been contacted by Queensland Health call 13 HEALTH and advise that you were a passenger on this flight. All other passengers are considered very low risk, however anyone with health concerns can contact 13 HEALTH. Queensland health\u2019s chief health officer, Dr Jeannette Young, said 972 of the state\u2019s 1,034 confirmed cases had recently travelled overseas or had close contact with a confirmed case, such as their partner or flatmate. High-risk patients will now receive their Covid-19 test results within the hour, down from between 24 and 48 hours, the New South Wales health minister, Brad Hazzard, said. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) kits have been used in priority regional areas where clusters of concern were identified and will now be rolled out to 29 additional labs. \u201cThe faster we can isolate higher-risk patients and quarantine their contacts, the less likely they can unknowingly spread it to others,\u201d Hazzard said. \u201cOn average, test results are being processed in less than 48 hours from the far corners of this vast state which is an achievement in itself, given the issues with flights and logistics.\u201d The new, rapid PCR testing kits are presently in use in NSW Health Pathology laboratories in Broken Hill, Wagga Wagga, Orange, Coffs Harbour and Tamworth and 29 more labs across the state will commence rapid testing from next week. From AAP: Fewer people are turning up to Queensland hospitals for sporting or car crash injuries but paramedics are getting more mental health related calls amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Health officials are holding their breath to see whether allowing people to venture outside their homes will drive a wave of new diagnoses. \u201cWe have seen reduced presentations for things like road trauma and sporting injuries [but] that\u2019s been in part offset by an increase in mental health presentations,\u201d the health minister, Steven Miles, said on Saturday. \u201cOur ambulance service has seen a 12 to 15% increase in mental health-related calls \u2013 anxiety depression, suicidal ideation, that kind of thing.\u201d Saturday is the first day of an experiment in easing some restrictions on people\u2019s everyday lives. It will take two weeks before officials know whether they can successfully juggle suppressing the virus while allowing people to move around a little more freely. \u201cIf we don\u2019t mess this up, we\u2019ll be able to get more of our freedoms back,\u201d Miles said. Non-essential travel is allowed but there are still limits. People are limited to spending time with members of their own family while those who are single can spend time with one other person. Picnics, hikes and shopping for clothing and shoes are permitted but Queenslanders must stay within 50km of their home. \u201cThis is a test run,\u201d the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said in a pre-recorded video message on Twitter on Saturday. \u201cHow well we do this weekend determines what else we can do in the future. I know it\u2019s been hard; I know you\u2019re sick of it. Who isn\u2019t? Keep up the good work and have a great weekend.\u201d There were 63 active cases of the virus in the state on Saturday. Here\u2019s a comprehensive list of shopping centre testing locations in Victoria. The Australian Medical Association has issued a statement urging the NRL to be cautious about its plans to fast-track the restart of its 2020 season. It follows news today that the New Zealand Warriors have been approved to take part in the 28 May return of the NRL season. They will arrive in Tamworth on Sunday and will be able to train despite having a 14-day isolation period. But across the world all major sporting competitions remain on hold, and the Tokyo Olympics have been suspended for a full year. The AMA president, Dr Tony Bartone, cautioned the NRL and all sporting codes about rushing to start or restart competitions, and said they should wait until the medical experts advise it is safe. \u201cSport is a big part of the Australian way of life, and the absence of sporting events is obviously affecting many people,\u201d Bartone said. \u201cWe understand the financial and other pressures on the big sporting codes during the Covid-19 crisis, but we have to put the broader public health implications first.\u201d Bartone said all sports bodies must recognise the expertise of the Australian health protection principal committee, which will work with relevant state governments advising on how and when the NRL could and should resume its competition. \u201cAny discussions and decisions about return to play before that advice is received is premature,\u201d he said. \u201cThere must be absolutely no risk to the health of players, officials, support stuff, or anyone involved with the possible resumption of the NRL competition, including the fans and the general public. In recent days, we have seen a handful of elite sports people ignoring social distancing rules. \u201cThese examples raise serious questions about the ability of all players to fully comply with requirements that are likely to be part of return to play, and a resumption of competitions.\u201d The AFL\u2019s chief executive, Gillon McLachlan, has set a target of 31 October to complete the 2020 premiership season. He is increasingly confident long-term hubs won\u2019t be required. Some players have balked at the prospect of going into an isolation hub for up to 20 weeks, but McLachlan moved to allay fears that would be required in a teleconference with the 18 club captains on Friday. However, shorter-term hubs are still in play to get the season restarted. McLachlan confirmed Queensland has given the AFL permission to fly teams in and out of the state without going into quarantine. The foreign affairs department has urged Australians in Africa to leave ASAP. Incoming passenger flights to Thailand have been suspended. There are limited flights out. \u201cIf you want to go home [from there] do so as soon as possible by commercial means,\u201d the department\u2019s Smartraveller warned. AAP reports that there has been an alarming drop in patients presenting for diabetes check-ups. Diabetes Australia, the Australian Diabetes Society and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners are urging people living with diabetes to have their routine pathology and other check-ups to avoid long-term damage to their health. About 1.35 million Australians have diabetes. Diabetes Australia\u2019s chief executive, Greg Johnson, said regular health checks were essential. \u201cIt is really important that people don\u2019t stop getting these checks and that they keep up with other aspects of their diabetes management during the Covid-19 pandemic,\u201d Johnson said on Saturday. \u201cDiabetes doesn\u2019t stop during Covid-19. We are concerned that if people don\u2019t have their pathology checks, or checks for their vision, foot problems, kidney function or other health checks, then serious problems could develop unnoticed.\u201d Looking overseas briefly, with news that at least 3,334,416 people have been infected and at least 237,943 have died around the world since the pandemic began, according to researchers from Johns Hopkins University. In the US, president Donald Trump has offered an increasingly bleak picture, telling a White House event: \u201cHopefully, we\u2019re going to come in below that 100,000 lives lost, which is a horrible number, nevertheless.\u201d Meanwhile, the UK reported 739 more deaths, bringing the total death toll in the country to 27,510. You can read the latest developments from around the world here. While restrictions have eased elsewhere in Australia, they remain in place in Victoria. There are only four reasons for people in the state to leave their home: food and supplies, medical care and care giving, exercise, and work or education. The state government has announced expanded testing which will help inform decisions about potentially slowly lifting restrictions ahead of the state of emergency being reviewed on 11 May. \u201cUp to 100,000 Victorians will be tested for coronavirus over the next two weeks as part of a major testing blitz across the state,\u201d Victoria\u2019s chief health officer, Prof Brett Sutton, said. \u201cWe\u2019ve more than doubled the number of daily tests we\u2019re conducting since the introduction of this blitz and these results will be reflected in coming days. \u201cThe main aim of this increase in testing is to improve access and actively search for cases, allowing us to gain a better picture of this virus and make informed decisions for Victoria. \u201cVictorians have done a remarkable job sticking to the coronavirus restrictions, and by staying home have saved lives. We are now asking Victorians to again play their part and get tested if they have symptoms, because the more tests we do the more data we have about the prevalence of coronavirus in the community. \u201cPeople with common symptoms of coronavirus including fever, chills, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, runny nose or loss of sense of smell \u2013 however mild \u2013 are encouraged to get tested. \u201cOur daily case numbers are still low which is encouraging. They prove that our physical distancing measures are working but this is not a time to relax our strong approach. This disease can get away from you very quickly as we have seen overseas.\u201d One additional case of the virus has been identified in Queensland overnight in a returned overseas traveller who acquired it from a cruise ship. Anyone on QF614 on 22 April has been urged to contact 13 HEALTH. Those near the passenger will be asked to quarantine. Guardian Australia wants to hear from couples of all backgrounds and orientations \u2013 especially if your relationship is non-traditional \u2013 about how they are coping with Covid-19 isolation and restrictions. Tell us about what you\u2019ve learned and we may interview you and your partner for our How we stay together series. Submit your stories here. Brad Hazzard, the NSW health minister, is speaking in Sydney and said he had \u201cgood news\u201d. \u201cWe have five new cases,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d still like to see zero, but it\u2019s still good.\u201d There have been 3,031 cases in the state. Almost 236,000 tests have been carried out and 232,863 were negative. Of the 3,031 confirmed cases, 2,300 have recovered and just over 300 have not. \u201cWhile we\u2019re doing better, if we take our foot off the brake we will be in deep trouble,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to be careful in what we do \u2013 in how we lift some of these onerous restrictions.\u201d Hazzard said with Mother\u2019s Day coming up he had received requests about reopening including tanning, waxing and beauty salons. \u201cWe are not reopening those,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not the right time. But we are opening them for limited activities to allow the sale of retail items from these facilities. You can go into beauty salons and buy favourite retail products.\u201d So products and vouchers can be bought but no appointments can be made. The chair of the Lung Foundation Australia and leading respiratory physician, Prof Christine Jenkins, says that amid the Covid-19 pandemic, vulnerable groups should not underestimate the seriousness of pneumonia. Pneumococcal pneumonia is a potentially deadly lung infection caused by the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae and is one of the most common types of pneumonia. Over 65s, infants, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, those with impaired immunity, chronic tobacco smokers and people with chronic medical illnesses, such as heart, lung, kidney and liver disease, and diabetes are considered most at risk. Each year in Australia, pneumonia and influenza account for more than 4,200 deaths. Jenkins urged vulnerable groups to get vaccinated against pneumococcal disease. Just 51% of over 65s vaccinated against it. The outbreak in Tasmania\u2019s north-west in which two hospitals closed and health workers were placed in quarantine is \u201clargely under control\u201d, the state\u2019s premier, Peter Gutwein, says. As of Sunday at midnight, additional restrictions placed on the north-west would be lifted, he said. Strict rules in place elsewhere around the state would still apply. \u201cI have said consistently we acted early and we acted hard because we had a more vulnerable, older population and we need to protect them,\u201d Gutwein said. \u201cWhat we need to do is keep people safe and at the same time start to open up our economy in a sensible way. All of these steps will be guided by public health. \u201cIt is so important we do not become complacent.\u201d Gutwein said Australia was in a much better position than the UK, the US and much of Europe. He said Australia\u2019s success must not be railroaded by reopening the country too quickly. He added: \u201cI\u2019m absolutely convinced we will be able to rebuild Tasmania.\u201d There were no new cases of the virus in Tasmania on Friday. Meanwhile in Victoria, seven people gathering for a birthday party are among fines that have been issued for breaches of the public health act in the past 24 hours. Since 21 March, Victoria police have conducted 34,192 spot checks. Victoria\u2019s health minister, Jenny Mikakos, says there has been seven more cases of Covid-19 cases in the state since yesterday, bringing the total to 1,371. There have been no further deaths; the death toll remains at 18. There are 12 people in hospital, four fewer since yesterday. Of those in hospital, seven are in intensive care. Of the seven new cases, three relate to a meat-processing facility, Mikakos said. Eight employees have tested positive. \u201cThe advice I have is testing for all staff is being conducted and contact tracing is occurring,\u201d Mikakos said. \u201cThe business has now been closed and is being thoroughly cleaned. I am also advised there is no concern about food safety.\u201d This is a heartwarming read by Alyx Gorman about how she and her husband planned and held their wedding in the middle of a pandemic. She writes: Covid-19 had already robbed the world of thousands of lives, jobs and freedoms \u2013 but could it give us our dream wedding? No complex travel arrangements, no savings drained. When most people\u2019s realities have been completely upended, getting married on the internet just didn\u2019t seem that weird any more. We could skip the most painful gut churn of wedding planning \u2013 weighing up our love for our friends against the cost of feeding them \u2013 and invite anyone who wanted to come. We just had to act fast. Read the full piece here. My colleague Naaman Zhou has examined how Australians are reacting to the easing of restrictions in some states and territories. You can read his piece here. A reminder that we have a breakdown of what is and isn\u2019t allowed in each state and territory, which can be found here. The Australian ambassador to the United States says calls to hold an inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus are not about retribution or revenge, but just getting the facts. From AAP: Covid-19 was first recognised in Wuhan, China, before it became a worldwide pandemic, but the Chinese government has taken offence to such an inquiry. It has even floated a consumer boycott of Australian products in retaliation for the Morrison government\u2019s backing for a global investigation. Arthur Sinodinos, who took over from Joe Hockey as US ambassador earlier this year, said he understood the Chinese government being defensive about the prospect of an inquiry. \u201cBut my view is we have got a lot to learn from this, China has a lot to learn from this, we\u2019ve all go a lot to learn by comparing how we did things and in the early stages working out what could have been done better,\u201d he told Sky News on Saturday. \u201cThis not an exercise in retribution, it\u2019s not an exercise in revenge or whatever. This is about getting the facts.\u201d He said the call by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, for such an inquiry was \u201cpretty sensible\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a major life-changing event, the biggest event probably of our lifetimes,\u201d the former Liberal senator said. \u201cWe did it after the ebola crisis a few years ago. The World Health Organisation and other bodies looked at what lessons we could learn from that. We have got to do the same again.\u201d As he said in his final speech to the Senate last year, as an emerging superpower, a strong and prosperous China was in the best interest of the world. \u201cBut we also have to accept that everyone should live by the same rules,\u201d he said. There\u2019s more news this morning of job losses in the childcare sector after a drop in attendance and funding during the Covid-19 crisis. Uniting NSW.ACT, which provides community services on behalf of the Uniting church, has announced it is standing down 45 workers across its early learning services. This decision is effective from Monday and will apply for an initial four weeks, although the group will keep the workers on its books and hopes they can come back in the near future. Rod Nadwie-Smith, the group\u2019s head of early learning, said it was \u201cheartbreaking to have to stand down some of our talented and committed team of educators\u201d. \u201cWhat we need right now is certainty of funding so we can keep the remainder of our team engaged and employed and continue to provide our quality services to the 4,500 children and essential workers who rely on us,\u201d he said. The organisation employs 850 people at 56 early learning services across New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory but is not eligible for the jobkeeper wages subsidy because it provides a range of other services that have not been as badly affected. A week ago, Nadwie-Smith told Guardian Australia the organisation had \u201cheld on\u201d and sought to keep its centres open without standing down staff or closing services, but that was becoming increasingly difficult because of a projected $3m loss over the next three months. In NRL news, the New Zealand Warriors will arrive in Tamworth on Sunday and be able to train despite a 14-day isolation period, after receiving clearance from Border Force. They received final approvals today. The latest green light was crucial for the NRL\u2019s ambition of a return by 28 May, AAP reports. The NRL chairman, Peter V\u2019landys, said the Warriors would join every club in a mandatory education day on Monday to ensure players toed the line during the coronavirus pandemic. The approval comes after Friday\u2019s crucial move from Queensland\u2019s premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, confirming borders would be open for the state\u2019s three NRL teams to play in NSW. It means North Queensland, Brisbane and the Gold Coast will not need to enter isolation camps in Sydney and can remain at home with their families. As mentioned earlier Anglicare\u2019s Newmarch House aged-care facility is continuing to grapple with the spread of the virus. Two more staff members were confirmed to have the virus this morning following the deaths of 13 residents. My colleagues Michael McGowan and Elias Visontay have interviewed family members of some of the residents and looked into how the highly infectious virus was able to take hold. You can read their feature here. A reader, 70 year-old Karl from Canberra, has emailed me to ask whether the government\u2019s CovidSafe app works with an iPad. The answer is yes, it is compatible with a number of devices including the iPad or iPod touch. My colleague Josh Taylor has written an explainer about how to download and use the app here. The ABC has also written a useful explainer on troubleshooting and problems you may have trying to download it. Hope that helps you and others, Karl. AAP reports that petrol prices have crept up in Queensland, where people are venturing out of their homes for the first time after being confined for weeks of semi-lockdown. The report says: Fuel pumps across Brisbane have bucked recent record low prices, jumping as high as $1.19 on Saturday morning, as people head outdoors for picnics and retail shopping following an ease on restrictions. However, some southern suburbs are still selling for as little as 82.9c at the end of a week where the state recorded just eight new diagnoses for Covid-19. All Queenslanders are restricted to staying within 50km of their home and must continue to practise social distancing. Meanwhile, about 150 extra police will be out questioning Queenslanders as they enjoy their first weekend under eased restrictions which means they can leave their home for recreation. Queenslanders can have a picnic, shop for non-essential items, and the distance they can travel has also been extended. Some national parks are also open. You can read an explainer of the lockdown restrictions and rules in each state and territory here. In overseas developments it seems the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, has reemerged after being absent for almost three weeks, if reports from South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency are correct. Conjecture about Kim\u2019s health had grown since his conspicuous absence from the 15 April celebrations for the birthday of his grandfather, Kim Il-sung. But he attended a fertiliser factory completion ceremony, state media reported on Saturday, his first public appearance after 20 days of absence that sparked rumours about his health. Yonhap news reports: \u201cThe official Korean central news agency [KCNA] reported that Kim cut the tape at the ceremony marking the completion of Sunchon Phosphatic Fertilizer Factory in Sunchon, north of Pyongyang.\u201d However ... KCNA has not released photos of him or the ceremony. Guardian Australia\u2019s editor Lenore Taylor writes that after listening to the experts to successfully curb the spread of Covid-19, Australia should do the same thing when it comes to climate change. In this note from the editor, she says: We\u2019re already being swamped with ideas about \u201creforms\u201d needed to recover from the pandemic crisis. But the word reform is like gift wrap \u2013 a handy cover for any offering, thought-through or otherwise. Perhaps we should ditch the word entirely, and with it the forest of feelpinions about what governments \u201cmust\u201d do to advance an author\u2019s previously-held ideological positioning in the post-corona world. Imagine if we took just two lessons from the way Australian governments responded to the coronavirus: that good decisions are made when they consider the evidence and the best available expert advice; and that policy-making can accommodate reasonable differences of opinion, without becoming a \u201cwar\u201d. Think, as Laura Tingle did in a piece for the ABC\u2019s 7.30 this week, of the difference it would make if interviewers and commentators allowed room for discussion of complex and competing ideas, before demanding that politicians rule them \u201cin\u201d or \u201cout\u201d, or before finding a backbencher who will say they might cross the floor on a policy that conflicts with their ideological prejudice \u2013 even if that policy hasn\u2019t yet been outlined. Now consider if those principles were applied to climate policy in Australia.\u201d Read the full piece here. On Thursday, the Northern Territory government announced a multi-staged approach to lifting restrictions after successfully containing the virus. As of noon yesterday, simple and safe outdoor activities where physical distancing can be maintained were once again allowed. It means personal gatherings including outdoor weddings and funerals can recommence, and playgrounds, parks and campgrounds outside biosecurity areas can reopen. Public swimming pools, lagoons and water parks are also open. Outdoor sports where physical distancing can be maintained including golf and tennis as well as training outdoors are back on. Fishing, boating, and sailing with other people is also allowed. Northern Territory chief health officer Dr Hugh Heggie was very excited about the developments, while urging people to still be responsible with hygiene and physical distancing. Anglicare has issued a statement following news this morning that two staff members of its Newmarch House aged care home in Sydney have been diagnosed with the infection. The virus has killed 13 residents of the home since April. The statement says the new infections occurred \u201cdespite having strict procedures and enforced infection control practices in place\u201d. We are investigating further as to how this occurred and we continue to work closely with the NSW Public Health Unit on this. Additional positive cases associated with Newmarch House are very distressing for our staff, our residents, and their families. We are very appreciative of the support being provided by the commonwealth and NSW governments and by the aged care sector more broadly. We are further improving our pastoral care for residents and their families by offering access to Anglicare Sydney\u2019s counselling and chaplaincy services as well as continuing the successful window visits between residents and families. Additionally, Anglicare Sydney was relieved to hear that the outbreak of Covid-19 at Dorothy Henderson Lodge has now been dealt with. This gives us great hope that we will overcome this devastating virus at Newmarch House.\u201d This virus is proving devastating once it gets into nursing homes. Another two staff members at Sydney\u2019s Newmarch House nursing home have tested positive for Covid-19 following the deaths of 13 residents over the past few weeks. More than one third of the home\u2019s residents have now been infected. New South Wales Labor leader Jodi McKay last week criticised the state government for not acting sooner on the coronavirus-stricken aged care home, and said families were not always given the choice to transfer Covid-19 positive residents to hospital. The home began testing for coronavirus on 11 April after a carer who worked part-time at the facility tested positive to Covid-19. The NSW chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, said the carer had extremely mild symptoms such as a \u201cscratchy\u201d throat and worked five shifts at the home and two at a western Sydney disability service before she realised she was sick. It\u2019s understood she did not have symptoms while still working. NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian said at a press conference on Wednesday she was concerned at the lack of information given to family members of residents since the beginning of the outbreak. Flinders University this morning published an analysis of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on South Australia. The director of Flinders University\u2019s Australian Industrial Transformation Institute Professor John Spoehr says by 2024, some 61,000 people in the state will lose their jobs, notwithstanding the JobKeeper initiative. \u201cGross State Product will be 14.8% lower this quarter than it would have been without the Covid-19 restrictions, and recovery will be slow, with GSP remaining 6.4% lower than would otherwise have been the case at this time next year,\u201d he said. \u201cOur earnings from interstate exports will fall 18% and our overseas export earnings will plunge 23.5%.\u201d Meanwhile two new reports released by the Melbourne Institute assess the scope of the Covid-19 pandemic\u2019s economic impact in Australia at a state-by-state level. The Melbourne Institute Nowcast of Australian GDP report found \u201cConsumer sentiment, which tends to lead consumption, fell dramatically in April. It is now at a similar level to that observed during the global financial crisis\u201d. Its report on State Leading Indexes of Economic Activity says federal government support packages, to a certain extent, may have helped to soften this rising consumer pessimism. Good morning everyone, Melissa Davey here with you to take you through all the Covid-19 updates for Australia today. Here\u2019s a quick recap of where we are at, starting with some good news: On Friday the Australian Capital Territory became the first jurisdiction in Australia to report no active cases of Covid-19. All of this good work flattening the curve led the prime minister to offer Australians an \u201cearly mark\u201d to ease Covid-19 restrictions. These will be announced next week. But there\u2019s a catch \u2013 return to normality will depend on uptake of the Covidsafe contact tracing app, he says. Andrew \u201cTwiggy\u201d Forrest reportedly plans to make a bid for Virgin Australia. The airline went into administration on 21 April and creditors held a meeting by video link on Friday morning. An interim report into an outbreak of the virus in north-west Tasmania that saw two hospitals close and health workers placed into lockdown confirmed what was suspected for weeks \u2013 the Ruby Princess cruise ship was the root cause of the virus hitting the region. What authorities do not know yet is how the virus then took hold of the hospitals. There has been a lot of excitement about experimental drugs to treat the virus given currently, the only treatment patients can receive is supportive care. However, these drugs should not be overhyped or seen as a breakthrough in the absence of rigorous evidence, experts including Australia\u2019s chief scientist have warned. It comes as the US pharmaceutical company Gilead is finalising the location of five hospitals in Australia to receive the highly sought-after experimental coronavirus drug remdesivir which made headlines this week after being promoted by the White House. ME Bank has slashed the amount an estimated 20,000 customers can redraw from their home loans by thousands of dollars, drawing outrage from borrowers hoping to use the money during the coronavirus crisis. It seems as we go into the weekend, many are hopeful that we will be seeing some kind of easing of restrictions sooner than anticipated. But the last thing Australian wants is the situation we\u2019ve seen unfolding in Singapore, where after successful containment of the virus which were praised around the world, it experienced record-breaking days of new cases last week. The country has now implemented a lockdown. This is something we are going to see those countries who are containing the virus increasingly grapple with over the next few weeks. The deputy chief medical officer on Friday described this navigation between a return to normality and avoiding unmitigated virus spread as a \u201cdance\u201d, and it\u2019s something that the national cabinet will be discussing over the coming days. Let me know if I\u2019ve missed anything throughout the day over at Twitter or at melissa.davey@theguardian.com . Or feel free to just tell me how you\u2019re coping with all of this. As always, please be nice.",

      "bodyText": "When it comes to our current healthcare system, the waste, cruelty and dysfunction was glaringly obvious even before the horrific pandemic we are now experiencing. Today, as millions of Americans lose their jobs and their healthcare benefits that come with them, it is now virtually impossible for any rational person to defend a system \u2013 unique among wealthy countries \u2013 that ties healthcare to employment, and is designed only to make huge profits for the insurance industry and drug companies, while ignoring the needs of ordinary Americans. Before the pandemic, 87 million people were uninsured or underinsured in our country, and more than 30,000 people died every year because they couldn\u2019t get to a doctor when they needed to see one. More than half a million families declared bankruptcy each year because of medically related debt. One out of five Americans could not afford the outrageously priced prescription drugs their doctors prescribed to them. And our healthcare outcomes, from maternal deaths to life expectancy to infant mortality, lagged behind most other industrialized nations. And for all of that, the United States still spends nearly $11,000 on healthcare for every adult and child \u2013 more than twice the average of other major countries. That was before the pandemic. The situation is far more dire now. Over just the last five weeks, more than 26 million Americans have lost their jobs and now face a crisis unique among advanced countries: for most of them, their healthcare was tied to their jobs. In America, unlike any other major country, when you lose your job, you lose your healthcare. As a result, up to 35 million Americans are estimated to see their health coverage disappear in the middle of this Covid-19 nightmare. And premiums for those who retain their health insurance in this crisis could increase by up to 40% . As horror stories circulate of $34,000 coronavirus medical bills, the uninsured remain terrified of going bankrupt just to get tested and treated for Covid-19. In many cases, they just cannot afford to go to a doctor or the hospital. But it\u2019s not just the high cost and growing number of uninsured that expose the irrationality of the current system. It\u2019s that the current \u201csystem\u201d makes absolutely no sense to anyone. It is an incredibly byzantine and complicated collection of independent entities without a common purpose \u2013 except greed. Think about it: In the midst of the worst healthcare crisis in modern American history, with thousands of doctors and nurses and other medical personnel becoming infected and sometimes dying, hospitals and clinics have, for financial reasons, been forced to lay off thousands of medical workers at a time when they are needed most. Further, our public health system is incredibly weak, in part because of consistent federal disinvestment and austerity that have decimated too many public health agencies. In most states, we lack the capability to significantly increase the level of coronavirus testing and contact tracing we need to begin to safely reopen the economy. Price-gouging and profiteering has affected everything from hand sanitizer to respirator prices which, in some cases, have more than quintupled \u2013 virtually overnight. Cities, states and hospitals continue to fight over scarce gloves, gowns, masks and ventilators. Four out of five frontline nurses don\u2019t have enough protective equipment. In the richest country in the history of the world, nurses caring for coronavirus patients have resorted to wearing trash bags as makeshift protective gear. That is an international embarrassment. The current crisis has also exposed, to a horrific degree, how the massive level of income and wealth inequality in America magnifies healthcare inequities, and financially ravages our most vulnerable people. Rural hospitals and community health clinics, which often treat the poor, are on the verge of going bankrupt and shutting down. Major outbreaks are attacking our Black, Hispanic, Native American and undocumented communities, as well as the incarcerated and the homeless. State and local data show that more than 30% of reported deaths have been African American, even though they only make up less than 15% of the population. The perverse irony of our broken for-profit healthcare system is that black, brown, rural and low-income people are most likely to be uninsured or underinsured, delaying or forgoing the costly necessary treatments or prescription drugs that could prevent the very conditions that make them most susceptible to the virus. It is no coincidence that the poor, the working class, the sick and the elderly disproportionately make up America\u2019s 1m reported coronavirus infections and over 57,000 deaths \u2013 the largest figures of any country on Earth. If there is any silver lining in this unprecedented moment that we find ourselves in, it is that we must use this time to reassess the foundational institutions of American society and determine how we go forward into a better future. With tens of thousands of Americans dying and millions losing their jobs, how sad it would be if we learned nothing from all that we have done wrong. Do we really want to continue the current expensive and cruel system that ties healthcare to our jobs? Or do we need a simple, comprehensive and cost-effective system that understands that healthcare is a human right for all of our people \u2013 employed or unemployed, young or old, rich or poor? Do we really want to continue being ripped off by the pharmaceutical industry that charges us, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs? Or do we want a system that negotiates drug prices like every other country on Earth? Do we really want to continue the complicated, wasteful and bureaucratic system in which virtually every visit to a doctor or hospital requires the filling out of endless forms in order to determine how much of our deductible we have paid, what percentage of our procedure is covered, and whether we got sick in the appropriate \u201cnetwork\u201d? Or do we want a simple system in which we go to any doctor we choose and never see a bill, because the system is publicly funded? Do we really want to continue having a woefully inadequate primary healthcare system because medical and nursing school graduates, faced with huge student debt, often gravitate to communities where they can make big bucks? Or do we want to make sure we have an appropriate number of medical personnel in the locations where they are most needed? The good news is that a growing number of Americans \u2013 especially in the face of this pandemic \u2013 believe that this dysfunctional and wasteful healthcare system must be replaced. A poll conducted this month, for example, indicated that 69% of all Americans \u2013 including 68% of independents and 88% of Democrats \u2013 support providing Medicare to every American. The bad news is that the healthcare industry, which made more than $100bn in profits last year and provides their CEOs with huge compensation packages, will do everything possible to maintain the status quo. And don\u2019t be fooled: they will lobby just as hard against any lesser proposal as they will against Medicare for All, buying politicians with campaign contributions and spending endless amounts of money on lobbying and advertising. There is no question that this will be an enormous challenge \u2013 but we can win this struggle if we engage people in the political process in a way we have never done before. We are all in this together. In this unprecedented moment in American history, let us stand united and harness the solidarity and compassion that so many are now demonstrating. Let us, finally, guarantee healthcare to all our people as a human right.",

      "body": "<p>When Drew Layton dropped out of college in 2006 to play online poker full-time, it was a hard sell to his parents: \u201cThey were not thrilled,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But 14 years later, as coronavirus and the subsequent shelter-in-place orders have shut businesses around the globe and forced people to stay inside, some jobs have proven more stable than others. For Layton, online poker seems to be a good bet.</p> <p>Layton said he had seen a marked increase in traffic to websites where he plays and thus a rise in his income. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m thriving because of the pandemic, but one area of my life has gotten a little better,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of a sudden, being self-employed is a huge benefit.\u201d</p> <p>The four US states with legal online poker sites \u2013 New Jersey, Nevada, Delaware, and Pennsylvania \u2013 reported record revenues in March. Operators in New Jersey, for example, took in a combined $3,629,112 that month \u2013 an increase of 90.9% year over year, according to numbers reported by the <a href=\"https://www.gambling.com/news/pennsylvania-new-jersey-online-poker-revenues-set-records-2236300\">New Jersey </a><a href=\"https://www.gambling.com/news/pennsylvania-new-jersey-online-poker-revenues-set-records-2236300\">division of </a><a href=\"https://www.gambling.com/news/pennsylvania-new-jersey-online-poker-revenues-set-records-2236300\">gaming </a><a href=\"https://www.gambling.com/news/pennsylvania-new-jersey-online-poker-revenues-set-records-2236300\">enforcement</a>, and more than double February\u2019s online poker revenue. </p> <p>With more time being spent at home, the number of people turning to online poker is increasing, said Donnie Peters, managing editor of online poker news site and forum <a href=\"https://www.pocketfives.com/\">PocketFives.com</a>. Meanwhile, in states like New Jersey and Nevada where gambling is big business, many avid poker players unable to go to casinos may be migrating online. According to the American Gaming Association, a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/sports/ncaabasketball/coronavirus-sports-betting.html\">trade group</a>, 987 of the US\u2019s 989 casinos were closed by early April to stop the spread of the coronavirus. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/27/uk-betting-firms-to-stop-advertising-on-tv-and-radio-during-lockdown\">UK betting firms to stop advertising on TV and radio during lockdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Veteran players are making more money for two reasons, according to Peters. The influx of online players are generally newer to poker and more inexperienced, making it easier for professionals to win. And when the number of players increases, so does the pot \u2013 the money players wager.</p> <p>On Sunday, the online poker tournament GGPoker <a href=\"https://www.pocketfives.com/articles/sunday-majors-alex-foxen-wins-powerfest-big-game-for-239k-630553/\">beat its</a> $500,000 guarantee pot for the first time after 3,662 players joined. The recent WSOP.com Super Circuit Series, which was launched to replace a live event in Las Vegas, increased its prize money from $1.24m to $4m after a higher-than-expected turnout of players.</p> <p>\u201cWhat this means is that not only are those who make their income from poker able to do so more efficiently because they\u2019re playing against a larger population of weaker competition, but the money that can be won from online poker tournaments has grown,\u201d Peters said. \u201cIn short, professionals are able to win more money more often.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs unfortunate as a situation as this has been for so many, online poker is an industry that is flourishing right now,\u201d Peters said.</p> <p>But the rise in online gambling has also sparked concern. Those who already gambled online are doing so more often, a survey published in the UK on Friday found. Since the beginning of the Covid outbreak, 25% of gamblers said they were continuing to bet at least once a week while 28% had increased their activity,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/24/growth-in-problem-gambling-amid-coronavirus-lockdown\"> the survey showed</a>. This has worried anti-gambling advocates in the UK, who are calling for legislation to protect people from gambling their money away while on lockdown. UK betting firms have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/27/uk-betting-firms-to-stop-advertising-on-tv-and-radio-during-lockdown\">stopped advertising</a> on TV and radio.</p> <p>No similar research has been published yet in the US, but advocates there too are calling on states to take measures. The anti-gambling group Stop Predatory Gambling on 20 April <a href=\"https://www.casino.org/news/anti-gambling-group-calls-on-state-lotteries-to-suspend-operations/\">called</a> on states to halt to state lotteries.</p> <p>Although there is no federal law banning online poker, regulations bar it most states and many online poker sites block users based on their computer location. So-called \u201csocial poker sites\u201d do not allow betting and thus are legal across the country. Instead of betting on each hand, users participate in sweepstakes and get cash prizes. One such site, National League of Poker, saw a 30%-50% increase in new players in March alone and a 131% increase in revenue, a spokesman said.</p> <p>Some worry that the restrictions on online poker sites may cause novice online gamblers to turn to unregulated and dangerous offshore poker sites. \u201cThe Covid-19 pandemic has magnified this issue,\u201d said Jed Hoffman, who has been playing online poker for 12 years but does not play full-time. \u201cOne thing we don\u2019t need right now, as individuals or as communities, is any more risk, especially at the precipice of a serious recession.\u201d</p> <p>Hoffman said he has noticed about four times as much activity in the past month on his go-to poker site, which is legal and based in Nevada. On Monday, he took home $4,259 in a tournament on Monday he only paid $75 to join.</p> <p>\u201cI do hope people stuck in lockdown don\u2019t injure themselves economically by playing too much or too high,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cThat is bad for society, and bad for the viability of long term growth in the online poker community.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>In the US, the <a href=\"https://www.ncpgambling.org/help-treatment/national-helpline-1-800-522-4700/\">National Problem Gambling Helpline</a> can be reached at 1-800-522-4700.

The recent WSOP.com Super Circuit Series, which was launched to replace a live event in Las Vegas, increased its prize money from $1.24m to $4m after a higher-than-expected turnout of players. \u201cWhat this means is that not only are those who make their income from poker able to do so more efficiently because they\u2019re playing against a larger population of weaker competition, but the money that can be won from online poker tournaments has grown,\u201d Peters said. \u201cIn short, professionals are able to win more money more often.\u201d \u201cAs unfortunate as a situation as this has been for so many, online poker is an industry that is flourishing right now,\u201d Peters said. But the rise in online gambling has also sparked concern. Those who already gambled online are doing so more often, a survey published in the UK on Friday found. Since the beginning of the Covid outbreak, 25% of gamblers said they were continuing to bet at least once a week while 28% had increased their activity, the survey showed. This has worried anti-gambling advocates in the UK, who are calling for legislation to protect people from gambling their money away while on lockdown. UK betting firms have stopped advertising on TV and radio. No similar research has been published yet in the US, but advocates there too are calling on states to take measures. The anti-gambling group Stop Predatory Gambling on 20 April called on states to halt to state lotteries. Although there is no federal law banning online poker, regulations bar it most states and many online poker sites block users based on their computer location. So-called \u201csocial poker sites\u201d do not allow betting and thus are legal across the country. Instead of betting on each hand, users participate in sweepstakes and get cash prizes. One such site, National League of Poker, saw a 30%-50% increase in new players in March alone and a 131% increase in revenue, a spokesman said. Some worry that the restrictions on online poker sites may cause novice online gamblers to turn to unregulated and dangerous offshore poker sites. \u201cThe Covid-19 pandemic has magnified this issue,\u201d said Jed Hoffman, who has been playing online poker for 12 years but does not play full-time. \u201cOne thing we don\u2019t need right now, as individuals or as communities, is any more risk, especially at the precipice of a serious recession.\u201d Hoffman said he has noticed about four times as much activity in the past month on his go-to poker site, which is legal and based in Nevada. On Monday, he took home $4,259 in a tournament on Monday he only paid $75 to join. \u201cI do hope people stuck in lockdown don\u2019t injure themselves economically by playing too much or too high,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cThat is bad for society, and bad for the viability of long term growth in the online poker community.\u201d In the US, the National Problem Gambling Helpline can be reached at 1-800-522-4700. In the UK, GamCare can be reached on 0808 8020 133. In Australia, Gambling Help Online is available at 1800 858 858. Global support is available at GamblingTherapy.org",

Nature\u2019s role in the wellbeing and happiness of billions of people will be more important than ever. While urbanisation is a major driver of biodiversity loss,&nbsp;many conservationists and town planners are trying to make built-up areas more nature-friendly. The role of green spaces in urban areas has even been formalised in a draft UN agreement to halt and reverse biodiversity loss, often referred to as the Paris agreement for nature.<br></p>\n    <p>The Covid-19 outbreak has seen cities and towns across the world go into lockdown which has enabled wildlife such as wild boar, deer, monkeys, foxes and even lions to venture into territory previously dominated by humans. It has also offered us the chance to notice and appreciate the natural world in cities in an unprecedented way.<br></p>\n    <p>In this special series of reports we'll be looking at how animals and plants adapt to city life, what to look out for right now and how we can encourage more wild cities in the future.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Nothing quite marks the coming of spring more clearly than birdsong. From the start of the new year, as inch-by-inch, minute-by-minute, and hour-by-hour, the days get lighter and the promise of life\u2019s annual renewal becomes ever more a reality, so the volume, intensity and variety of birdsong increases. Now \u2013 at the end of April and beginning of May \u2013 it is reaching its peak.</p> \n<p>Yet for the eight out of 10 Britons who spend their lives in towns and cities, this annual crescendo can often pass them by. During my late twenties and early thirties, I lived in north London, during which time my few interactions with the natural world occurred when I got in my car and drove out to the Kent or Essex coast.</p> \n<p>If I neglected my birding fix for a few weeks, I might only realise that spring had arrived when \u2013 usually on a fine, sunny morning during the first week of May \u2013 a familiar sound would reach my ears.

Social media, newspapers and TV and radio programmes are alive with another kind of tweeting: the realisation that there is a parallel world out there. As if to mock us \u2013 but also very reassuringly \u2013 birds are simply getting on with what they always do at this time of year: finding a mate, defending a territory and beginning the long and risky process of raising a family.</p> \n<p>Finally, as if a veil has been lifted, people are noticing that \u2013 even in the heart of the so-called urban jungle \u2013 nature has found a place to live. We shouldn\u2019t really be surprised, as cities deliver everything that any wild creature needs: plenty of food (either deliberately or accidentally provided by us), water to drink and bathe, places to roost and breed, earlier springs caused by the \u201curban heat island effect\u201d and, most importantly of all, a huge variety of habitats squeezed into a small area, from woods to grasslands and rivers to ponds.</p> \n<p>Because of this, unlike more specialised biomes such as mountains and moors, heaths and ancient woodlands, our cities in the UK are home to a very diverse range of plants and animals. There are bats and badgers, foxes and fallow deer, orchids and otters; kittiwakes (an ocean-going seabird) nest on the Tyne Bridge in the centre of Newcastle; porpoises, dolphins and even the occasional whale swim up London\u2019s River Thames.</p> \n<p>Globally, city wildlife is doing rather well too. Red-tailed hawks \u2013 the North American equivalent of our buzzard \u2013 nest on the ledges of high-rise skyscrapers in New York; magnificent frigatebirds drift over the statue of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, their outstretched wings mirroring his own pose; lesser kestrels \u2013 one of Europe\u2019s rarest birds of prey \u2013 gather above Seville\u2019s vast cathedral; and pied kingfishers hover like giant black-and-white butterflies over the River Nile in Cairo. All have found a niche where they can thrive in the heart of our cities.</p> \n<p>This is happening at a time when, in North America and western Europe \u2013 including Britain \u2013 what we think of as \u201cthe countryside\u201d is so intensively farmed that large swathes have become more or less wildlife-free zones. So rather than being surprised that we find wildlife in the heart of our cities, we should instead perhaps wonder why more of our wild creatures haven\u2019t moved in to take advantage of what\u2019s on offer.</p> \n<p>As well as the variety of species, another huge advantage of watching wildlife in a city is that it is almost always much tamer than in rural areas. I still recall, when I first moved down to Somerset from London, that I came across a fox taking a nap at the end of my garden. When it awoke, and noticed me, I expected it to behave like the streetwise city creatures I was used to, and simply go back to sleep. Instead, it stared back, its eyes full of fear, before leaping up and fleeing into the undergrowth.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/30/an-opportunity-to-experts-urge-us-to-take-a-closer-look-at-nature-aoe\">Look up, look down: experts urge us to take a closer look at the concrete jungle</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Birds also behave very differently in cities. Normally shy waterbirds such as herons and kingfishers are so used to the constant stream of joggers, dog-walkers and commuters along canal and river towpaths that they usually stay put, so if you are patient you can often get great views.</p> \n<p>But until recently, many city-dwellers have always been in so much of a hurry that they have hardly given wildlife a second thought. Only now, when despite government restrictions most people are still able to escape the confines of their home for a short while each day, are they starting to notice what has been around them all along.</p> \n<p>So, how can you take advantage of being confined to your home and its immediate surroundings? For a start, you can follow the sage advice of my old friend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/10/urban-birder-birdspotting-cities-david-lindo\">David Lindo \u2013 aka the Urban Birder</a> \u2013 and simply \u201clook up\u201d. You\u2019ll be amazed what birds fly over: from peregrines, which are now breeding on cathedrals and church towers in virtually every British city, to swifts (which should be arriving back right now), house martins \u2013 compact little bluish-black and white birds that look like miniature killer whales \u2013 and, in the capital at least, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jun/06/the-great-green-expansion-how-ring-necked-parakeets-took-over-london\">now-ubiquitous ring-necked parakeets</a>.</p> \n<p>Last year one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/22/white-tailed-eagles-southern-britain\">white-tailed eagles newly released on the Isle of Wight</a> went \u201cflyabout\u201d, and according to data from its radio transmitter passed all the way over London, without a single person noticing it. That\u2019s quite an achievement when, with a 2.5-metre (more than 8ft) wingspan, these birds look like flying barn doors.</p> \n<p>As part of your daily exercise regime, try seeking out hidden corners of natural habitat: places we built for ourselves with no thought for nature, but where wildlife has moved in. These sites range from disused railway lines to roadside verges, and gravel pits to churchyards. Even some official nature reserves \u2013 including many of those run by the London Wildlife Trust \u2013 are still accessible, because they are designated as public open spaces.</p> \n<p>As well as the advantage of less hustle, bustle and extraneous noise from traffic and aircraft, the skies are clearer too, because air pollution has fallen dramatically. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/20/nature-is-taking-back-venice-wildlife-returns-to-tourist-free-city\">Venice, the canals are clear and blue for the first time in decades</a>, allowing fish and birds to thrive. The next step might be to cut light pollution at night: leaving lights blazing in empty offices and other commercial buildings is not only wasteful, but helps drive the climate crisis. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/22/light-pollution-insect-apocalypse\">It also seriously impacts wildlife</a>, especially moths, bats and migrating birds, which can get disoriented by artificial light sources as they travel by night.</p> \n<p>Although many wild creatures have found a home in our cities, some have had to make compromises in order to do so. A 2009 study by scientists at Aberystwyth University revealed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jun/03/great-tit-city-bird-song\">urban great tits now sing at a higher pitch</a> than their country cousins, in order to make themselves heard above the traffic.</p> \n<p>But wouldn\u2019t it be better if they did not have to adapt and compromise? Terrible and frightening though it is, at least the current crisis has allowed us to glimpse \u2013 for a few weeks at least \u2013 just how different our cities could be in a carbon-neutral world.</p> \n<p>My fear is that once the horror is all over, and things return to some kind of normal, we will simply ignore the lessons we learned during these atypical few weeks and months. Or might we remember how wonderful it was to wake up to an urban dawn chorus, uncluttered by extraneous noise? If so, are we prepared to make the dramatic changes to our lifestyles, and to the structure and workings of our cities, which urban wildlife needs if it is to thrive?</p> \n<p>And if, as a result of these changes, every day of the week sounds like a Sunday, will we not all benefit?</p> \n<p><em>Stephen Moss is a naturalist and author born and raised in London, but now living in rural Somerset.

This is happening at a time when, in North America and western Europe \u2013 including Britain \u2013 what we think of as \u201cthe countryside\u201d is so intensively farmed that large swathes have become more or less wildlife-free zones. So rather than being surprised that we find wildlife in the heart of our cities, we should instead perhaps wonder why more of our wild creatures haven\u2019t moved in to take advantage of what\u2019s on offer. As well as the variety of species, another huge advantage of watching wildlife in a city is that it is almost always much tamer than in rural areas. I still recall, when I first moved down to Somerset from London, that I came across a fox taking a nap at the end of my garden. When it awoke, and noticed me, I expected it to behave like the streetwise city creatures I was used to, and simply go back to sleep. Instead, it stared back, its eyes full of fear, before leaping up and fleeing into the undergrowth. Birds also behave very differently in cities. Normally shy waterbirds such as herons and kingfishers are so used to the constant stream of joggers, dog-walkers and commuters along canal and river towpaths that they usually stay put, so if you are patient you can often get great views. But until recently, many city-dwellers have always been in so much of a hurry that they have hardly given wildlife a second thought. Only now, when despite government restrictions most people are still able to escape the confines of their home for a short while each day, are they starting to notice what has been around them all along. So, how can you take advantage of being confined to your home and its immediate surroundings? For a start, you can follow the sage advice of my old friend David Lindo \u2013 aka the Urban Birder \u2013 and simply \u201clook up\u201d. You\u2019ll be amazed what birds fly over: from peregrines, which are now breeding on cathedrals and church towers in virtually every British city, to swifts (which should be arriving back right now), house martins \u2013 compact little bluish-black and white birds that look like miniature killer whales \u2013 and, in the capital at least, the now-ubiquitous ring-necked parakeets. Last year one of the white-tailed eagles newly released on the Isle of Wight went \u201cflyabout\u201d, and according to data from its radio transmitter passed all the way over London, without a single person noticing it. That\u2019s quite an achievement when, with a 2.5-metre (more than 8ft) wingspan, these birds look like flying barn doors. As part of your daily exercise regime, try seeking out hidden corners of natural habitat: places we built for ourselves with no thought for nature, but where wildlife has moved in. These sites range from disused railway lines to roadside verges, and gravel pits to churchyards. Even some official nature reserves \u2013 including many of those run by the London Wildlife Trust \u2013 are still accessible, because they are designated as public open spaces. As well as the advantage of less hustle, bustle and extraneous noise from traffic and aircraft, the skies are clearer too, because air pollution has fallen dramatically. In Venice, the canals are clear and blue for the first time in decades, allowing fish and birds to thrive. The next step might be to cut light pollution at night: leaving lights blazing in empty offices and other commercial buildings is not only wasteful, but helps drive the climate crisis. It also seriously impacts wildlife, especially moths, bats and migrating birds, which can get disoriented by artificial light sources as they travel by night. Although many wild creatures have found a home in our cities, some have had to make compromises in order to do so. A 2009 study by scientists at Aberystwyth University revealed that urban great tits now sing at a higher pitch than their country cousins, in order to make themselves heard above the traffic. But wouldn\u2019t it be better if they did not have to adapt and compromise? Terrible and frightening though it is, at least the current crisis has allowed us to glimpse \u2013 for a few weeks at least \u2013 just how different our cities could be in a carbon-neutral world. My fear is that once the horror is all over, and things return to some kind of normal, we will simply ignore the lessons we learned during these atypical few weeks and months. Or might we remember how wonderful it was to wake up to an urban dawn chorus, uncluttered by extraneous noise? If so, are we prepared to make the dramatic changes to our lifestyles, and to the structure and workings of our cities, which urban wildlife needs if it is to thrive? And if, as a result of these changes, every day of the week sounds like a Sunday, will we not all benefit?

      "body": "<p>In 2018, NK Jemisin became the first writer ever to win three consecutive Hugo best novel awards for science fiction and fantasy. Her first award had been in 2016, for her novel <em>The Fifth Season</em>, and its two sequels,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/11/hugo-awards-2017-nk-jemisin-repeats-best-novel-win-the-obelisk\"> </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/11/hugo-awards-2017-nk-jemisin-repeats-best-novel-win-the-obelisk\">The Obelisk Gate</a></em> and <em>The Stone Sky</em>, won in the following years. Yet speaking on the phone from her home in coronavirus-hit Brooklyn, Jemisin says she never thought she\u2019d be published. \u201cI honestly didn\u2019t think I had a chance. You just didn\u2019t see characters like me in fiction,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Growing up in Mobile, Alabama and New York, Jemisin was an avid reader, making up her own stories from the age of eight, but the lack of black women writing science fiction and fantasy, the genre she loved, made her believe it wasn\u2019t for her. \u201cWe were all exposed to nothing but white dude fiction, occasionally young white women fiction, and if that\u2019s how you\u2019ve grown up, then that is what is normal.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We were all exposed to nothing but white dude fiction and if that\u2019s how you\u2019ve grown up, then that is what is normal</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Occasionally black characters would make their way into those stories written by white men. Jemisin recalls <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/arthurcclarke\">Arthur C Clarke</a>\u2019s <em>Childhood\u2019s End</em>, in which Jan Rodricks, a black man, is the last human on Earth. \u201cThere\u2019s a paragraph when the black male character is introduced where Clarke pauses the story to basically explain to the audience that, you know, this character is black, but it doesn\u2019t really matter anymore in the future. And so for all intents and purposes, he\u2019s basically a white guy who just happens to have black skin. Not really the ideal way to handle it.\u201d She discovered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/mar/16/guardianobituaries.bookscomment\">Octavia Butler</a> in the 80s, and that \u201chelped a great deal, but she was one person\u201d.</p> <p>Jemisin trained as a psychologist and worked in universities, in a branch of counselling psychology specific to late adolescents. She carried on writing but gave up on any idea of publishing \u2013 she\u2019d been to graduate school, she had student loans, it didn\u2019t make sense to change careers. Then she hit 30, and had a \u201cmini midlife crisis\u201d. She\u2019d written a novel \u2013 an early take on what would become <em>The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms</em> \u2013 and sent it out to publishers, also taking science fiction and fantasy writing workshop<a href=\"https://viableparadise.com/\"> Viable Paradise</a>, where she gave short stories a try for the first time, and began selling her work. The novel didn\u2019t get picked up, \u201cprobably because it wasn\u2019t very good\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"40addcd99c614081b76632b392dcaf4a85a029bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40addcd99c614081b76632b392dcaf4a85a029bd/0_186_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Childhood\u2019s End (2015).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The last human on Earth in the 2015 TV adaptation of Arthur C Clarke\u2019s Childhood\u2019s End.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Narelle Portanier/Weed Road/Universal Cable Prods/Michael De Luca Prods/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She wrote another, <em>The Killing Moon</em>, which got her an agent. Set in a world based on ancient Egypt, it had an almost exclusively black cast \u2013 and didn\u2019t find her a publisher. \u201cIt was the mid 2000s, and at that time science fiction and fantasy publishers were not super interested in stories with black casts by black writers. They had done some stories with black casts by white writers, but they were not interested in those stories coming from people who actually were black.\u201d Rejection letters would say things like, \u201cwe like this, but we\u2019re not sure how to market it. We like this but we\u2019re not sure who its audience would be\u201d\u2013 the implication from publishers being \u201cthat fantasy readers don\u2019t want to read about black people.

They\u2019d shank each other for, like, nothing. And I wrote this angry story about this lone brown girl going into this place full of mean white people,\u201d she says. It went to auction, with three different publishers fighting over it. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, this is what you want?\u201d she says. \u201cI was pretty bitter \u2026 I\u2019d taken such care in [<em>The Killing Moon</em>] to include sympathetic white people, but that wasn\u2019t what they wanted.\u201d</p> <p>Telling of Yeine Darr, an outcast from the barbarian north who is summoned to the city of Sky, where she is named one of the potential heirs to the king (whose family has enslaved the gods), <em>The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms</em> won Jemisin the Locus award for best first novel in 2011. Two more novels in the Inheritance trilogy followed in an astonishingly prolific 18 months. The books were selling steadily, if not meteorically, and her publishers were hungry for more: luckily, she had held on to <em>The Killing Moon</em>. Set in the ancient city-state of Gujaareh, where the Gatherers\u2019 role is to harvest the magic of sleeping minds to use it for good, until the dreamers start dying, it was nominated for a Nebula award.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A Nasa-sponsored workshop for writers about astronomy and her fascination with volcanoes fed into The Fifth Season</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>By now Jemisin was back in her day job as a counsellor. She had a dream, of \u201can angry woman coming towards me with a mountain floating behind her\u201d. It gelled with ideas she\u2019d had since going on a Nasa-sponsored workshop for writers about astronomy, and she began to write <em>The Fifth Season</em>. Taking place on a planet with \u201cone vast, unbroken continent\u201d, the earthquake-racked Stillness, the novel opens with the \u201cend of the world\u201d as one man \u2013 a despised and enslaved \u201corogene\u201d, who can manipulate the earth \u2013 tears a great rift through the heart of the world. Jemisin has said in the past that \u201cit\u2019s pretty obvious that I\u2019m drawing on the human history of structural oppression, as well as my feelings about this moment in American history\u201d. It won Jemisin astonishing plaudits, as well as a deal for a television series. Accepting her third Hugo, she told her audience in <a href=\"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/blog/sci-fi-fantasy/read-n-k-jemisins-historic-hugo-speech/?st=AFF&amp;SID=Barnes+%26+Noble+-+Top+100%3A+Book+Bestsellers&amp;2sid=Skimlinks_7598037_NA&amp;sourceId=AFFSkimlinks&amp;cjevent=371dc90271fe11ea802101ed0a18050c&amp;dpid=tekz25v83\">a winner\u2019s speech that went viral</a>: \u201cThis has been a hard year, hasn\u2019t it?

For some of us, things have always been hard.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"bc99f7ae231b07e7d2bfcb6d153c2728f1cdf576\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc99f7ae231b07e7d2bfcb6d153c2728f1cdf576/0_0_327_499/327.jpg\" alt=\"The City we Became\" width=\"327\" height=\"499\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Writing the trilogy while working almost full time hadn\u2019t been easy, particularly as Jemisin\u2019s mother had fallen ill in 2015. In the middle of writing the third book, she decided to launch a<a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/nkjemisin\"> Patreon</a>, an online subscriber platform, to fund her work. She didn\u2019t have high hopes, but \u201cI got a lot more money than I was expecting, so I went ahead and quit the day job\u201d .</p> <p>That was 2016. After a number of years in which a group of writers \u2013 mostly male, white, and overwhelmingly rightwing \u2013 attempted to thwart the increasing diversity of the Hugos by block voting for their approved titles, Jemisin\u2019s triple whammy felt like a turning of the tide. As she put it in her blistering winner\u2019s speech: \u201cThis is the year in which I get to smile at all of those naysayers \u2013 every single mediocre insecure wannabe who fixes their mouth to suggest that I do not belong on this stage, that people like me cannot possibly have earned such an honour, that when they win it it\u2019s meritocracy but when we win it it\u2019s \u2018identity politics\u2019 \u2013\u2026 I get to smile at those people, and lift a massive, shining, rocket-shaped middle finger in their direction.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s gone on to raise that middle finger at them in her writing. The enemy in her new novel, <em>The City We Became</em>, is a huge, tentacled, Lovecraftian horror, an evil out to destroy cities. But this villain is no homage to the master of eldritch horror. In Jemisin\u2019s story \u2013 \u201ca glorious fantasy,\u201d says Neil Gaiman \u2013 the greatest of cities become living entities. New York has just awoken, and a \u201cbeast from the deeps\u201d is out to take it down. \u201cWhen you experience walking through any city at the right time, when the light is right, and it feels like it\u2019s you and the city communing. I wanted to put some words to that feeling, as artists do, and that\u2019s what I came up with,\u201d says Jemisin.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When you read HP Lovecraft books like The Horror at Red Hook he\u2019s blatant about the racism</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>HP Lovecraft, she says, also wanted to put words to a feeling: the feeling he had, however, was a vicious xenophobia. \u201cWhen you read things like <em>The Horror at Red Hook</em> he\u2019s blatant both about the racism and the fact that the racism is the inspiration for his feeling that these people are evil.\u201d Until 2015, a bust of Lovecraft was given to winners of the World Fantasy awards.

      "bodyText": "In 2018, NK Jemisin became the first writer ever to win three consecutive Hugo best novel awards for science fiction and fantasy. Her first award had been in 2016, for her novel The Fifth Season, and its two sequels, The Obelisk Gate and The Stone Sky, won in the following years. Yet speaking on the phone from her home in coronavirus-hit Brooklyn, Jemisin says she never thought she\u2019d be published. \u201cI honestly didn\u2019t think I had a chance. You just didn\u2019t see characters like me in fiction,\u201d she says. Growing up in Mobile, Alabama and New York, Jemisin was an avid reader, making up her own stories from the age of eight, but the lack of black women writing science fiction and fantasy, the genre she loved, made her believe it wasn\u2019t for her. \u201cWe were all exposed to nothing but white dude fiction, occasionally young white women fiction, and if that\u2019s how you\u2019ve grown up, then that is what is normal.\u201d Occasionally black characters would make their way into those stories written by white men. Jemisin recalls Arthur C Clarke\u2019s Childhood\u2019s End, in which Jan Rodricks, a black man, is the last human on Earth. \u201cThere\u2019s a paragraph when the black male character is introduced where Clarke pauses the story to basically explain to the audience that, you know, this character is black, but it doesn\u2019t really matter anymore in the future. And so for all intents and purposes, he\u2019s basically a white guy who just happens to have black skin. Not really the ideal way to handle it.\u201d She discovered Octavia Butler in the 80s, and that \u201chelped a great deal, but she was one person\u201d. Jemisin trained as a psychologist and worked in universities, in a branch of counselling psychology specific to late adolescents. She carried on writing but gave up on any idea of publishing \u2013 she\u2019d been to graduate school, she had student loans, it didn\u2019t make sense to change careers. Then she hit 30, and had a \u201cmini midlife crisis\u201d. She\u2019d written a novel \u2013 an early take on what would become The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms \u2013 and sent it out to publishers, also taking science fiction and fantasy writing workshop Viable Paradise, where she gave short stories a try for the first time, and began selling her work. The novel didn\u2019t get picked up, \u201cprobably because it wasn\u2019t very good\u201d. She wrote another, The Killing Moon, which got her an agent. Set in a world based on ancient Egypt, it had an almost exclusively black cast \u2013 and didn\u2019t find her a publisher. \u201cIt was the mid 2000s, and at that time science fiction and fantasy publishers were not super interested in stories with black casts by black writers. They had done some stories with black casts by white writers, but they were not interested in those stories coming from people who actually were black.\u201d Rejection letters would say things like, \u201cwe like this, but we\u2019re not sure how to market it. We like this but we\u2019re not sure who its audience would be\u201d\u2013 the implication from publishers being \u201cthat fantasy readers don\u2019t want to read about black people. Black people don\u2019t want to read fantasy. So what do we do?\u201d Jemisin decided to rewrite The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms, making nearly the entire cast white. \u201cAll of them were horrible people. They\u2019d shank each other for, like, nothing. And I wrote this angry story about this lone brown girl going into this place full of mean white people,\u201d she says. It went to auction, with three different publishers fighting over it. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, this is what you want?\u201d she says. \u201cI was pretty bitter \u2026 I\u2019d taken such care in [The Killing Moon] to include sympathetic white people, but that wasn\u2019t what they wanted.\u201d Telling of Yeine Darr, an outcast from the barbarian north who is summoned to the city of Sky, where she is named one of the potential heirs to the king (whose family has enslaved the gods), The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms won Jemisin the Locus award for best first novel in 2011. Two more novels in the Inheritance trilogy followed in an astonishingly prolific 18 months. The books were selling steadily, if not meteorically, and her publishers were hungry for more: luckily, she had held on to The Killing Moon. Set in the ancient city-state of Gujaareh, where the Gatherers\u2019 role is to harvest the magic of sleeping minds to use it for good, until the dreamers start dying, it was nominated for a Nebula award. By now Jemisin was back in her day job as a counsellor. She had a dream, of \u201can angry woman coming towards me with a mountain floating behind her\u201d. It gelled with ideas she\u2019d had since going on a Nasa-sponsored workshop for writers about astronomy, and she began to write The Fifth Season. Taking place on a planet with \u201cone vast, unbroken continent\u201d, the earthquake-racked Stillness, the novel opens with the \u201cend of the world\u201d as one man \u2013 a despised and enslaved \u201corogene\u201d, who can manipulate the earth \u2013 tears a great rift through the heart of the world. Jemisin has said in the past that \u201cit\u2019s pretty obvious that I\u2019m drawing on the human history of structural oppression, as well as my feelings about this moment in American history\u201d. It won Jemisin astonishing plaudits, as well as a deal for a television series. Accepting her third Hugo, she told her audience in a winner\u2019s speech that went viral: \u201cThis has been a hard year, hasn\u2019t it? A hard few years. A hard century. For some of us, things have always been hard.\u201d Writing the trilogy while working almost full time hadn\u2019t been easy, particularly as Jemisin\u2019s mother had fallen ill in 2015. In the middle of writing the third book, she decided to launch a Patreon, an online subscriber platform, to fund her work.

A senior government source confirmed to the PA Media the plans were being looked at but stressed they were a \u201clong way\u201d from becoming policy. There will likely be questions over whether everyone has accurate devices to take their temperature, just as there have been concerns over the availability of respirator masks, which have been widely used in Asia to combat the spread of the virus. Temperature scanning at airports, which has been mandatory in many countries but not in the UK, may also be part of the recommendations. The government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has been asked to look into the feasibility of reducing the distance people must keep away from each other in public. Since the lockdown began on 24 March, people have been asked to keep 2 metres apart when outside their homes. The World Health Organization (WHO), however, advocates a distance of 1 metre while Germany has prescribed a distance of 1.5 metres. According to reports in the Telegraph, Sage will report back to government on Tuesday as to whether the advice on distancing should be changed. Few alterations to the current lockdown conditions are expected on Thursday, when ideas to restart the economy and reopen schools are expected to be announced for when the government\u2019s five tests for reducing the spread of Covid-19 have been passed. \u201cWhat you\u2019re going to get next week is really a roadmap, a menu of options,\u201d Johnson said on Thursday. \u201cUntil this day comes [when a vaccine is ready], we are are going to have to beat this disease by our growing resolve and ingenuity.\u201d",

Mika Brzezinski, a host of MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe, pressed him to align his past comments on how such allegations should be viewed with his assertion that Reade\u2019s account was false.</p> <p>\u201cAre women to be believed \u2026 unless it pertains to you?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cWomen are to be believed, given the benefit of the doubt,\u201d Biden said.</p> <p>But he added that \u201cthe facts in this case do not exist. They never happened, and there\u2019s so many inconsistencies in what has been said in this case. So yes, look at the facts, and I assure you it did not happen. Period. Period.\u201d</p> <p>For weeks Biden\u2019s campaign has grappled with how he should defend him while upholding the \u201cbelieve women\u201d ethos of the #MeToo movement that Democrats have embraced. In the years since Donald Trump was elected, Democrats have confronted sexual misconduct aggressively, policing their own ranks to draw a sharp distinction with Republicans on issues of gender, equality and accountability.</p> <p>Trump has been accused by more than a dozen women of sexual harassment, assault or rape.

      "bodyText": "Nearly three decades after Joe Biden faced sharp backlash over his treatment of Anita Hill, when she came before his Senate committee to accuse Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, he urged lawmakers not to repeat the same mistakes when considering a sexual assault claim against another supreme court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, by Dr Christine Blasey Ford. \u201cIt takes enormous courage for a woman to come forward, under the bright lights of millions of people watching, and relive something that happened to her,\u201d Biden said in 2018, as he was laying the groundwork for a presidential run. Ford, he said, \u201cshould be given the benefit of the doubt\u201d. That statement was read back to Biden during an interview on Friday, in which the presumptive Democratic nominee broke his months-long silence to unequivocally deny an allegation of sexual assault by a former Senate aide, Tara Reade. Mika Brzezinski, a host of MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe, pressed him to align his past comments on how such allegations should be viewed with his assertion that Reade\u2019s account was false. \u201cAre women to be believed \u2026 unless it pertains to you?\u201d she asked. \u201cWomen are to be believed, given the benefit of the doubt,\u201d Biden said. But he added that \u201cthe facts in this case do not exist. They never happened, and there\u2019s so many inconsistencies in what has been said in this case. So yes, look at the facts, and I assure you it did not happen. Period. Period.\u201d For weeks Biden\u2019s campaign has grappled with how he should defend him while upholding the \u201cbelieve women\u201d ethos of the #MeToo movement that Democrats have embraced. In the years since Donald Trump was elected, Democrats have confronted sexual misconduct aggressively, policing their own ranks to draw a sharp distinction with Republicans on issues of gender, equality and accountability. Trump has been accused by more than a dozen women of sexual harassment, assault or rape. During the 2016 election, a recording emerged of him bragging about groping women. Trump has flatly denied the allegations, often attacking his accusers as opportunists and liars. Indeed, on Friday the president advised Biden to \u201cgo out and fight it\u201d. Speaking to the conservative conservative radio host Dan Bongino, Trump suggested the accusation could be false and even sounded a note of empathy for Biden\u2019s predicament. \u201cAll of a sudden you become a wealthy guy, you\u2019re a famous guy, then you become president, and people \u2026 that you\u2019ve never seen, that you\u2019ve never heard of make charges,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo I guess in a way you could say I\u2019m \u2026 sticking up for him.\u201d Republicans have largely remained silent about Trump\u2019s record on women. By contrast, Democrats demanded Biden publicly address the matter and some have even called for him to step down as the presumptive nominee. \u201cDemanding more of Joe Biden\u2019s leadership is not in contradiction with our commitment to defeat Trump,\u201d said Ana Maria Archila, co-executive director of the Center for Popular Democracy. \u201cIt is, in fact, central to that effort.\u201d Yet Republicans have seized on the matter in an effort to renew the poisonous political fight that erupted over Kavanaugh. \u201cDemocrat double standard\u201d blared a memo from the Republican National Committee which portrayed Democrats as hypocrites who held the allegation against their nominee to a higher standard of proof than the one they used against Kavanaugh. \u201cThe double standard exhibited by Biden, prominent liberal women\u2019s groups and Democrat elected officials \u2013 some of whom want to be Biden\u2019s running mate \u2013 is glaring and cannot be allowed to stand,\u201d said Erin Perrine, a spokeswoman for Trump\u2019s election campaign. But Karen Finney, who worked for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign, said Republicans were \u201cplaying with fire\u201d by attempting to create a \u201cfalse equivalency\u201d between Biden and Trump on the issue. Lis Smith, a senior adviser to Pete Buttigieg\u2019s Democratic presidential campaign, said: \u201cIf Republicans and Biden opponents push too hard on this, it will backfire on them and just raise the question of why President Trump has never addressed the scores of sexual misconduct allegations against him.\u201d Women are a core Democratic constituency.

But in this case, she said, the effort to brand Democrats as hypocrites would be undercut by Trump\u2019s record and Republican silence. Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said Republicans were attempting to \u201cneutralize\u201d Biden\u2019s appeal to suburban women who revolted from the party in 2018. But he said the controversy would probably be eclipsed by the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak and was unlikely to be a \u201cfront-of-mind issue for voters\u201d come November.

But that diary is empty, at least in the immediate future, despite ongoing meetings to provide a roadmap of how and when live sport can return. Global championships, events and league seasons have been cancelled or postponed, falling like a row of dominoes in the past couple of months. And so the first part of lockdown has been shaped by a news agenda chasing what will no longer be happening this spring and summer and the repercussions of those cancellations or delays. That has now been replaced by talk of when live sport might get up and running again, and the ethics of such a return.</p> <p>There has been a glaring hole left in the absence of any live sport to cover. Interviews and features, too, are usually pegged to the news agenda or forthcoming events. Beyond those related to the pandemic itself, we have recast interviews or features to reflect the new reality of lockdown. We have also looked for different ways of engaging with our readers. Our hugely popular live minute-by-minutes have had a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2020/apr/11/the-masters-1996-greg-norman-final-round-live\">retro makeover</a>, some pegged to anniversaries or events that had been in the diary; we have brought in regular columnists such as the England cricketer Moeen Ali <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/18/ask-moeen-the-england-all-rounder-answers-guardian-readers-questions\">to answer readers\u2019 questions</a> and commissioned follow-up features off the back of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/12/missing-live-sport-here-are-12-great-documentaries-to-watch-instead\">readers\u2019 responses to articles</a>.</p> <p>As the lockdown continues, and the news ebbs rather than flows, we are embracing opportunities to turn back the clock, source interviews that we could never quite find the right time to publish, and investigate wider issues.<br></p> <h2>Barry Glendenning, sports writer and broadcaster</h2> <p>Before all this, the problems we were most accustomed to dealing with on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/series/footballweekly\">Guardian\u2019s Football Weekly podcast</a> involved how best to cram in all the big weekend talking points on a Monday morning.

      "bodyText": "Ireland has extended its lockdown for another two weeks to 18 May, when it will introduce a phased, five-stage exit over three months. The country\u2019s lockdown regime has been much stricter than the UK\u2019s, but Friday night\u2019s announcement offers a clear, step-by-step map out of the lockdown for schools, shops and businesses as well as the global Irish diaspora including more than 300,000 in the UK, many of whom would normally make visits home in the summer. The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said while the rise in the death rate from coronavirus had flattened it was still too dangerous to ease the lockdown. While thousands of lives had been saved, \u201cwe have not yet won this fight\u201d, he said, adding that two more weeks of tight restrictions to weaken the virus further were necessary to ensure it \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the strength to make a comeback\u201d. The plan will also be of major interest to Irish people living abroad, with the restriction on non-essential travel continuing for some time. However, sources say that Irish citizens have been free to travel to Ireland through the lockdown but have had to self-isolate for 14 days. Last night\u2019s televised address will have been watched closely by the British government, which is under pressure to release its own clear roadmap for an exit to lockdown. From May, the five phases of lockdown easing in Ireland are: Phase 1 (18 May) Outdoor meetings of up to four people from different households will be allowed and childcare for healthcare workers will be opened. Outdoor work, such as construction and gardening, to resume. Some shops, such as those selling stationery and IT equipment and opticians can also reopen. Retail outlets that are primarily outdoors, such as garden centres, hardware stores and repair shops can reopen. Current rules restricting funerals up to 10 people still apply. Schools and college buildings will reopen to teachers only. Phase 2 (8 June) Visits to a different household by groups of up to four people will be allowed, as long as they maintain a 2-metre distance from those they don\u2019t live with. Small retail outlets can open with physical distancing measures in place. Libraries can open again. Phase 3 (29 June) Sporting events can resume behind closed doors. Cafes and restaurants can reopen with physical distancing measures and strict cleaning protocols. Playgrounds can reopen. Those with low levels of interaction in their jobs can return to work. Non-essential retail, such as clothes shops, can reopen, but this is limited to those with street-level entrances and does not include shops inside shopping centres. Phase 4 (20 July) Movement beyond a 20km radius will be allowed. Small social gatherings by family and close friends, including small weddings and baptisms, will be allowed with a maximum number of attendees and physical distancing in place. Larger numbers can visit another household for a limited period of time, while maintaining physical distancing. Those who cannot work at home can return to work. Museums, galleries and churches can reopen. Phase 5 (10 August) Some larger social gatherings will be allowed, with restrictions in place. On a phased basis, schools and universities can start to reopen. Varadkar said the last few weeks had transformed people\u2019s lives \u201cin so many different ways and ways that we could not have imagined\u201d. \u201cI know it has been difficult - sometimes dispiriting,\u201d he said.",

Step forward Sarina Wiegman and a solution to Nexit potentially as dazzling as the sea of orange that greeted the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/aug/06/womens-euro-2017-holland-denmark-match-report\">Netherlands\u2019 Euro 2017 triumph</a>.</p> <p>In leading the <em>Oranje</em> to European Championship success on home soil and then the final of last summer\u2019s World Cup in France, Wiegman has transformed the topography of the women\u2019s game in the Netherlands beyond recognition. Perhaps more important, the 50-year-old\u2019s career evolution \u2013 including a formative stint working in the men\u2019s game \u2013 represents a template for female coach development in England.</p> <p>Wiegman\u2019s contract with the Dutch FA ends in 2021 and she has seemed receptive to a new challenge. Admittedly, with two teenage daughters and a husband coaching in men\u2019s football, the timing and logistics could be wrong but surely the FA should be making an approach to a female coach who ticks multiple boxes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1ff5f7f380069ab3828a562869bae739d1183ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1ff5f7f380069ab3828a562869bae739d1183ac/0_258_4282_2571/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sarina Wiegman puts Ashleigh Weerden through a drill during Netherlands training\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarina Wiegman steers Ashleigh Weerden through a drill during Netherlands training.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Soccrates Images/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wiegman would arrive not only fluent in English but with fresh eyes and a healthy emotional detachment from a Lionesses squad that has fallen at the semi-final stage in the last three major tournaments.</p> <p>If scouting trips to watch the raft of Netherlands players plying their trade in the WSL will have offered her sufficient insight to hit the ground running, so too should Wiegman\u2019s tactical flexibility and streak of stylistic pragmatism.</p> <p>Neville, set to remain in situ until next summer, was derailed by his failure to compromise his possession-heavy vision, based on building from the back. Wiegman\u2019s subtle refinement of the Netherlands\u2019 counterattacks and transitions between attack and defence shows greater adaptability.</p> <p>Granted England need to retain the ball better but their progress under Mark Sampson was based on a hybrid, flexible and counterattacking style that kept opponents guessing and camouflaged individual flaws.

      "bodyText": "\u201cNexit\u201d \u2013 Phil Neville\u2019s departure from the role of England Women\u2019s coach \u2013 has been confirmed for next year and the hunt to find a successor is under way at a time when coronavirus has left the domestic game facing financial stress. In the wake of Nexit, the need to appoint a national manager capable of reassuring \u2013 and inspiring \u2013 supporters, sponsors and investors has assumed unprecedented urgency; the Football Association knows this is a decision that it literally cannot afford to get wrong. Early frontrunners include Jill Ellis \u2013 the Portsmouth-born coach who took the USA to victory in last year\u2019s World Cup \u2013 Chelsea\u2019s talented Emma Hayes, her promising Manchester United counterpart, Casey Stoney, and Laura Harvey, now in a development role with the USA after an impressive stint as Arsenal manager. There are other credible contenders but one outstanding candidate has received puzzlingly few mentions. Step forward Sarina Wiegman and a solution to Nexit potentially as dazzling as the sea of orange that greeted the Netherlands\u2019 Euro 2017 triumph. In leading the Oranje to European Championship success on home soil and then the final of last summer\u2019s World Cup in France, Wiegman has transformed the topography of the women\u2019s game in the Netherlands beyond recognition. Perhaps more important, the 50-year-old\u2019s career evolution \u2013 including a formative stint working in the men\u2019s game \u2013 represents a template for female coach development in England. Wiegman\u2019s contract with the Dutch FA ends in 2021 and she has seemed receptive to a new challenge. Admittedly, with two teenage daughters and a husband coaching in men\u2019s football, the timing and logistics could be wrong but surely the FA should be making an approach to a female coach who ticks multiple boxes. Wiegman would arrive not only fluent in English but with fresh eyes and a healthy emotional detachment from a Lionesses squad that has fallen at the semi-final stage in the last three major tournaments. If scouting trips to watch the raft of Netherlands players plying their trade in the WSL will have offered her sufficient insight to hit the ground running, so too should Wiegman\u2019s tactical flexibility and streak of stylistic pragmatism. Neville, set to remain in situ until next summer, was derailed by his failure to compromise his possession-heavy vision, based on building from the back. Wiegman\u2019s subtle refinement of the Netherlands\u2019 counterattacks and transitions between attack and defence shows greater adaptability. Granted England need to retain the ball better but their progress under Mark Sampson was based on a hybrid, flexible and counterattacking style that kept opponents guessing and camouflaged individual flaws. They do not need another coach stubbornly in thrall to Neville\u2019s principles, which failed to maximise the Lionesses\u2019 strengths. Wiegman has been making the best of things in an imperfect context since. As a six-year-old, she demanded her hair be cut short in order to defy a ban on mixed football and join her twin brother in a boys\u2019 team in The Hague. In 2001 she became the first female Dutch international to earn 100 caps, while 2016 marked her pro licence coaching qualification, then held by only two other women in the Netherlands. Wiegman went on to spend a season playing in North Carolina under Anson Dorrance, who had coached the USA to victory in the 1991 World Cup. \u201cI always thought I was different from other girls,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople said: \u2018You\u2019re too fanatical about football.\u2019 When I went to Carolina I was normal; it was paradise.\u201d She returned home on a mission to transplant American passion and nous for women\u2019s football into her Dutch compatriots. \u201cWe needed proper facilities, good programmes and good coaches,\u201d she says. \u201cAfter 20 years we got that system.\u201d In the interim she worked as a PE teacher, becoming a full-time women\u2019s coach at Den Haag in 2007. By the time the pro licence was secured Wiegman was on the national coaching staff and an innovative fast-track that involved the culture shock of a year\u2019s internship at Sparta Rotterdam, deployed as an assistant men\u2019s first-team coach. If teaching had honed Wiegman\u2019s communication skills and organisational abilities, she gained a streetwise edge and increased emotional intelligence. \u201cIt was a new environment and I had to figure things out,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it improved me, gave me confidence and taught me about different behaviours.\u201d Sparta Rotterdam offered her the right framework in which to properly develop a talent swiftly reapplied when she became national women\u2019s manager.

After weeks of silence, the presumptive Democratic nominee categorically denied the accusation in a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-7a9593bd3012\">Medium post</a> and in an interview on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe.</p> <p>\u201cThis never happened, and when she first made the claim, we made it clear that it never happened, and it\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d the former vice-president said on Morning Joe.</p> <p>But, of course, it isn\u2019t as simple as that. While it\u2019s commendable that Biden finally addressed Reade\u2019s allegations directly, instead of having his campaign issue more denials, he needs to go further. Biden must authorize a search of his Senate papers, which are held at the University of Delaware, to identify any evidence of the complaint that Reade says she made about him at the time.</p> <p>Morning Joe co-host Mika Brzezinski repeatedly asked Biden if he would authorize such a search; his answer was \u201cno.\u201d Biden said that he would ask the National Archives to make public any record of a complaint filed by Reade, but would not allow his Senate papers to be unsealed as they \u201cdo not contain personnel files\u201d and could become political \u201cfodder\u201d.</p> <p>That\u2019s not good enough. Surely Biden can order an independent investigation of his Senate papers for mentions of Reade without compromising other sensitive information? If he\u2019s not capable of doing that then I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s capable of being the president of the United States.</p> <p>But what about the current president? What about the pussy-grabber in chief? What about the dozens of sexual harassment allegations against him? Why should Biden be held to a higher standard than Donald Trump?</p> <p>There has been a huge amount of whataboutism by liberals when it comes to the allegations against Biden. I can understand the frustration fueling this: the fact that Trump supporters are suddenly concerned about sexual consent is jaw-droppingly hypocritical.</p> <p>The White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, for example, seems to have suddenly become a massive #MeToo advocate. \u201c\u2018Believe all women\u2019 means <em>all</em> women,\u201d Conway <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/kellyanne-conway-joe-biden-accuser-believe-women\">told Fox News on Friday</a>. \u201cLet\u2019s not pretend Joe Biden doesn\u2019t have a history of, without permission, and without restraint, planting his face in the back of women\u2019s heads, sniffing their hair, fondling their necks and creeping them out,\u201d Conway <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CillizzaCNN/status/1256245211392606208?s=20\">further noted</a>. Hang on, does this woman know who she works for? Does she have any shame at all?</p> <p>But it\u2019s not just Trump supporters who are being hypocritical. Conservatives have rightly <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/495502-pelosi-tells-reporter-she-doesnt-need-a-lecture-on-biden-kavanaugh-comparison\">pointed out</a> the difference in the way Democrats and the mainstream media treated the sexual assault allegations against supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh versus the allegations against Biden. There is arguably a lot more evidence supporting the allegations against Biden than there ever was against Kavanaugh, but there\u2019s a hell of a lot less liberal outrage. When confronted with a question about those double standards on Thursday, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/495502-pelosi-tells-reporter-she-doesnt-need-a-lecture-on-biden-kavanaugh-comparison\">Nancy Pelosi responded</a> by saying that she didn\u2019t need a \u201clecture or a speech\u201d and \u201cJoe Biden is Joe Biden\u201d. An extremely persuasive retort.</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure that the allegations against Biden will end up doing any serious damage to his campaign. However, the way in which the Democratic party and liberals have rallied behind him is going to do a huge amount of damage to #MeToo. Alyssa Milano, the woman who helped mainstream #MeToo, choosing to believe Biden over Reade will be brought up every single time someone says \u201cbelieve women\u201d. The way in which liberals downplayed allegations against Biden will be used as ammunition every single time someone on the right is accused of sexual assault.</p> <p>Indeed, Trump is already using the Democrats\u2019 defense of Biden to discredit his own accusers. When asked about the Reade allegations by reporters on Thursday he mused that Biden that might have been <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/495563-trump-biden-allegations-could-be-false-but-he-should-respond\">falsely accused</a>. \u201cIt could be false accusations. I know all about false accusations,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been falsely charged numerous times, and there is such a thing.\u201d Trump then went on to speak about Kavanaugh, saying: \u201cHe was falsely charged. What happened with him was an absolute disgrace to our country.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s an absolute disgrace to America: the fact that, in November, women will be forced to choose between two men credibly accused of sexual assault for president.</p> <h2><strong>New Zealand safety net helps sex workers in lockdown</strong></h2> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2003/0028/latest/DLM197815.html\">New Zealand Prostitution Reform Act</a>, developed with the input of sex workers, decriminalized sex work in 2003.

      "bodyText": "Sign up for the Week in Patriarchy, a newsletter on feminism and sexism sent every Saturday #MeToo is dead and Joe Biden killed it \u201cI\u2019m saying unequivocally: it never, never happened.\u201d On Friday Joe Biden made his first public comment on the allegation that he sexually assaulted a former Senate staffer, Tara Reade, in 1993. After weeks of silence, the presumptive Democratic nominee categorically denied the accusation in a Medium post and in an interview on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe. \u201cThis never happened, and when she first made the claim, we made it clear that it never happened, and it\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d the former vice-president said on Morning Joe. But, of course, it isn\u2019t as simple as that. While it\u2019s commendable that Biden finally addressed Reade\u2019s allegations directly, instead of having his campaign issue more denials, he needs to go further. Biden must authorize a search of his Senate papers, which are held at the University of Delaware, to identify any evidence of the complaint that Reade says she made about him at the time. Morning Joe co-host Mika Brzezinski repeatedly asked Biden if he would authorize such a search; his answer was \u201cno.\u201d Biden said that he would ask the National Archives to make public any record of a complaint filed by Reade, but would not allow his Senate papers to be unsealed as they \u201cdo not contain personnel files\u201d and could become political \u201cfodder\u201d. That\u2019s not good enough. Surely Biden can order an independent investigation of his Senate papers for mentions of Reade without compromising other sensitive information? If he\u2019s not capable of doing that then I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s capable of being the president of the United States. But what about the current president? What about the pussy-grabber in chief? What about the dozens of sexual harassment allegations against him? Why should Biden be held to a higher standard than Donald Trump? There has been a huge amount of whataboutism by liberals when it comes to the allegations against Biden. I can understand the frustration fueling this: the fact that Trump supporters are suddenly concerned about sexual consent is jaw-droppingly hypocritical. The White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, for example, seems to have suddenly become a massive #MeToo advocate. \u201c\u2018Believe all women\u2019 means all women,\u201d Conway told Fox News on Friday. \u201cLet\u2019s not pretend Joe Biden doesn\u2019t have a history of, without permission, and without restraint, planting his face in the back of women\u2019s heads, sniffing their hair, fondling their necks and creeping them out,\u201d Conway further noted. Hang on, does this woman know who she works for? Does she have any shame at all? But it\u2019s not just Trump supporters who are being hypocritical. Conservatives have rightly pointed out the difference in the way Democrats and the mainstream media treated the sexual assault allegations against supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh versus the allegations against Biden. There is arguably a lot more evidence supporting the allegations against Biden than there ever was against Kavanaugh, but there\u2019s a hell of a lot less liberal outrage. When confronted with a question about those double standards on Thursday, Nancy Pelosi responded by saying that she didn\u2019t need a \u201clecture or a speech\u201d and \u201cJoe Biden is Joe Biden\u201d. An extremely persuasive retort. I\u2019m not sure that the allegations against Biden will end up doing any serious damage to his campaign. However, the way in which the Democratic party and liberals have rallied behind him is going to do a huge amount of damage to #MeToo. Alyssa Milano, the woman who helped mainstream #MeToo, choosing to believe Biden over Reade will be brought up every single time someone says \u201cbelieve women\u201d. The way in which liberals downplayed allegations against Biden will be used as ammunition every single time someone on the right is accused of sexual assault. Indeed, Trump is already using the Democrats\u2019 defense of Biden to discredit his own accusers. When asked about the Reade allegations by reporters on Thursday he mused that Biden that might have been falsely accused. \u201cIt could be false accusations. I know all about false accusations,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been falsely charged numerous times, and there is such a thing.\u201d Trump then went on to speak about Kavanaugh, saying: \u201cHe was falsely charged. What happened with him was an absolute disgrace to our country.\u201d I\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s an absolute disgrace to America: the fact that, in November, women will be forced to choose between two men credibly accused of sexual assault for president. New Zealand safety net helps sex workers in lockdown The New Zealand Prostitution Reform Act, developed with the input of sex workers, decriminalized sex work in 2003. This means that sex workers are able to apply for emergency wage subsidies during the coronavirus crisis like any other self-employed person. Contrast this to the dire situation sex workers in places like India, the UK and US now find themselves in. America has a proud pussy-grabber as its president but sex workers, or anyone whose professional activities involve \u201cprurient\u201d products or content, can\u2019t get emergency loans designated for the self-employed. Is it OK to speculate about Jared Kushner and Botox? \u201cChat about Kushner\u2019s face started last year after he was interviewed on HBO and his weirdly dewy and immobile skin led some to compare him to a \u2018wet, haunted doll\u2019,\u201d Hadley Freeman notes. But is it OK to speculate about the world\u2019s creepiest Ken doll potentially having had cosmetic surgery? In short, yes. Are the people in the American Gothic painting a couple or dad and daughter? Like many people, I always thought they were a married couple but the models in the famous Grant Wood painting are actually the artist\u2019s sister and their family dentist, who was meant to portray their father.

According to Gage, there is some evidence that \u201caltruistic streetwear is <em>more</em> popular on average in terms of resale than your typical streetwear item\u201d. For example, \u201cthe Supreme Covid-19 relief tee is selling for around $850 on StockX, good for a 14x resale premium, which is higher than average for box logo tees.\u201d</p> <p>Part of this is down to design. Gage thinks it\u2019s no coincidence that the \u201ctwo highest profile \u2018social\u2019 drops from Supreme \u2013 the Covid-19 relief tee and the Japanese earthquake relief tee \u2013 are box logo tees\u201d, the brand\u2019s bread and butter. \u201cAltruistic streetwear needs to be more than just altruism,\u201d he said. \u201cIt needs to be exciting and interesting, in and of itself. That combines hype and social conscience, and that\u2019s when things get really cool.\u201d</p> <p>Banger hopes these efforts go deeper than T-shirts. \u201cKatharine Hamnett said it best: \u2018T-shirts don\u2019t change the world \u2013 and they can even cause inaction.\u2019 What we need is action.\u201d As he puts it: \u201cI just look forward to meeting all these people and everyone clapping on the next [NHS] protest march. Whenever and wherever that is.\u201d</p>",

If the idea of hyped NHS hoodies seems unlikely, think again. \u201cStreetwear is really more about community than anything else, so it\u2019s not surprising that \u2018drops\u2019 [limited edition ranges] around social issues are common,\u201d said streetwear analyst Justin Gage. Nicolaus Li, an editor at lifestyle magazine Hypebeast, thinks these \u201caltruistic drops\u201d are worthwhile: \u201cConsumption will always be tied to fashion, but if there is a way to make consumption meaningful, why not?\u201d he said. \u201cThese products really help to spotlight what is important and I hope they serve to maintain that sentiment after the pandemic is over.\u201d These collections often score well when it comes to the all-important modern measure of popularity: resale. According to Gage, there is some evidence that \u201caltruistic streetwear is more popular on average in terms of resale than your typical streetwear item\u201d. For example, \u201cthe Supreme Covid-19 relief tee is selling for around $850 on StockX, good for a 14x resale premium, which is higher than average for box logo tees.\u201d Part of this is down to design. Gage thinks it\u2019s no coincidence that the \u201ctwo highest profile \u2018social\u2019 drops from Supreme \u2013 the Covid-19 relief tee and the Japanese earthquake relief tee \u2013 are box logo tees\u201d, the brand\u2019s bread and butter. \u201cAltruistic streetwear needs to be more than just altruism,\u201d he said. \u201cIt needs to be exciting and interesting, in and of itself. That combines hype and social conscience, and that\u2019s when things get really cool.\u201d Banger hopes these efforts go deeper than T-shirts. \u201cKatharine Hamnett said it best: \u2018T-shirts don\u2019t change the world \u2013 and they can even cause inaction.\u2019 What we need is action.\u201d As he puts it: \u201cI just look forward to meeting all these people and everyone clapping on the next [NHS] protest march. Whenever and wherever that is.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Yesterday morning I spent an hour doing a jigsaw puzzle, followed by a game of Scrabble, fortified by tea and scones. For once, there was no one I had to see and nowhere I had to be. The way we live now has split us in two. For introverts, it\u2019s largely business as usual. But for my more extroverted friends, who are clamouring for Zoom calls to fill the gaping hole the pub has left in their lives, it\u2019s a deeply testing time.</p> <p>I\u2019m an introvert, which means I need time alone to recharge. This doesn\u2019t mean I hate socialising, but it may well mean I will feel stressed and fatigued if I\u2019m not left on my own for a while afterwards.</p> <p>On the flipside, extroverts are energised by time spent with other people and are often, though not always, more outgoing. In the 1960s the German psychologist Hans Eysenck suggested the reason behind this difference lies in our environmental sensitivity. Introverts need lower levels of stimulation to reach their \u201cset point\u201d of social arousal than extroverts, leading them to seek an escape into quiet solitude sooner.</p> <p>So it makes sense that we introverts are finding lockdown easier than our extroverted counterparts. They are struggling to reverse their behaviour, which I sympathise with \u2013 I can\u2019t imagine what it would feel like to suddenly have to live life the other way round, with the government forcing me to socialise relentlessly. The thought of having to meet and talk to new people day and night without the possibility of withdrawing alone to recharge my batteries makes me feel nauseous.</p> <p>Natasha Tiwari, a psychologist with a practice in London, agrees that self-isolation plays to an introvert\u2019s strengths, but notes the importance of recognising that introversion and extroversion exist on a fluid scale. It\u2019s natural to find things tough, however you identify. \u201cIntroversion and extroversion are not binary concepts,\u201d she says. \u201cMany of us flick between them depending on our mood, environment and the people surrounding us. The key is to work out how to attain the right balance in your lifestyle to support your mental health.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For once, there is no guilt about wanting to stay at home</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In his 2011 paper on introversion, the American psychologist Jonathan Cheek argued that there are four main types of introvert: anxious, restrained, thinking and social \u2013 though overlap is normal. Anxious introverts struggle with shyness, often avoiding other people. Restrained introverts can enjoy socialising, but will stay in their shell until they feel comfortable. Thinking introverts are happy around others but are prone to daydreaming, and social introverts enjoy meeting friends but prefer to do so in intimate groups.</p> <p>I fall mostly into the last camp and always have done. I socialise one-on-one where possible. I relish a deep and meaningful conversation, but find the small-talk element of big gatherings tedious. You\u2019ll find me on the dancefloor, but I won\u2019t be asking 20 different people, \u201cHow\u2019s work?\u201d Being a social introvert means I am missing the injections of real-life connection that I carefully thread through my diary every few days. Technology isn\u2019t quite doing it for me; it feels too frenetic.</p> <p><em><strong>I\u2019m living with</strong></em> my extroverted mum who has been enjoying regular \u201cprosecco hours\u201d on Zoom, the soundtrack to which goes like this: \u201cWhere are you? Turn your camera on! Oh, there you are! Cheers darling! Oh, you\u2019ve gone again! Unmute! Unmute!\u201d</p> <p>I downloaded the Houseparty app, opened it up and immediately a friend\u2019s face popped up to say hi, entirely unannounced. The horror has stayed with me.</p> <p>Cat Archer Underwood, 36, a brand consultant from Hampshire and an introvert, is learning more about herself. \u201cI\u2019ve had moments of utter peace, watching my husband and four-year-old daughter pottering about in the garden,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I have been surprised at how I am feeling about the prospect of more weeks of this. I am dreaming of hosting barbecues, having a house full of laughing children and seeing people who aren\u2019t quite friends but are more than strangers. I may be choosier about the events I force upon myself in the future, but I\u2019ve learned that this introvert needs to party sometimes, too.\u201d</p> <p>Others further along the introversion scale are finding their daily life has barely changed. English teacher Ellie Grout, 29, from Bristol, is one of them. \u201cSelf-isolation is similar to my normal experience,\u201d she says. \u201cThe difference is that, for once, there is no pressure to arrange social events and no guilt about cancelling plans when I realise I want to stay at home.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Introverts like to have their own space to process their ideas</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Hardcore introvert <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jessica-pan\" title=\"\">Jessica Pan</a>, 34, spent a year living like an extrovert while writing her 2019 book, <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sorry-Late-Didnt-Want-Come/dp/0857526154\" title=\"\">Sorry I\u2019m Late, I Didn\u2019t Want to Come</a></em>. She lives with her husband Ian, a \u201csolid ambivert\u201d. Both are working from home and appreciating the slower pace of lockdown life. \u201cI don\u2019t believe any introvert actively enjoys being locked in their home at this time of anxiety,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I am finding pleasure in the small things, such as reading more, cooking slowly and doing pilates.

      "bodyText": "Yesterday morning I spent an hour doing a jigsaw puzzle, followed by a game of Scrabble, fortified by tea and scones. For once, there was no one I had to see and nowhere I had to be. The way we live now has split us in two. For introverts, it\u2019s largely business as usual. But for my more extroverted friends, who are clamouring for Zoom calls to fill the gaping hole the pub has left in their lives, it\u2019s a deeply testing time. I\u2019m an introvert, which means I need time alone to recharge. This doesn\u2019t mean I hate socialising, but it may well mean I will feel stressed and fatigued if I\u2019m not left on my own for a while afterwards. On the flipside, extroverts are energised by time spent with other people and are often, though not always, more outgoing. In the 1960s the German psychologist Hans Eysenck suggested the reason behind this difference lies in our environmental sensitivity. Introverts need lower levels of stimulation to reach their \u201cset point\u201d of social arousal than extroverts, leading them to seek an escape into quiet solitude sooner. So it makes sense that we introverts are finding lockdown easier than our extroverted counterparts. They are struggling to reverse their behaviour, which I sympathise with \u2013 I can\u2019t imagine what it would feel like to suddenly have to live life the other way round, with the government forcing me to socialise relentlessly. The thought of having to meet and talk to new people day and night without the possibility of withdrawing alone to recharge my batteries makes me feel nauseous. Natasha Tiwari, a psychologist with a practice in London, agrees that self-isolation plays to an introvert\u2019s strengths, but notes the importance of recognising that introversion and extroversion exist on a fluid scale. It\u2019s natural to find things tough, however you identify. \u201cIntroversion and extroversion are not binary concepts,\u201d she says. \u201cMany of us flick between them depending on our mood, environment and the people surrounding us. The key is to work out how to attain the right balance in your lifestyle to support your mental health.\u201d In his 2011 paper on introversion, the American psychologist Jonathan Cheek argued that there are four main types of introvert: anxious, restrained, thinking and social \u2013 though overlap is normal. Anxious introverts struggle with shyness, often avoiding other people. Restrained introverts can enjoy socialising, but will stay in their shell until they feel comfortable. Thinking introverts are happy around others but are prone to daydreaming, and social introverts enjoy meeting friends but prefer to do so in intimate groups. I fall mostly into the last camp and always have done. I socialise one-on-one where possible. I relish a deep and meaningful conversation, but find the small-talk element of big gatherings tedious. You\u2019ll find me on the dancefloor, but I won\u2019t be asking 20 different people, \u201cHow\u2019s work?\u201d Being a social introvert means I am missing the injections of real-life connection that I carefully thread through my diary every few days. Technology isn\u2019t quite doing it for me; it feels too frenetic. I\u2019m living with my extroverted mum who has been enjoying regular \u201cprosecco hours\u201d on Zoom, the soundtrack to which goes like this: \u201cWhere are you? Turn your camera on! Oh, there you are! Cheers darling! Oh, you\u2019ve gone again! Unmute! Unmute!\u201d I downloaded the Houseparty app, opened it up and immediately a friend\u2019s face popped up to say hi, entirely unannounced. The horror has stayed with me. Cat Archer Underwood, 36, a brand consultant from Hampshire and an introvert, is learning more about herself. \u201cI\u2019ve had moments of utter peace, watching my husband and four-year-old daughter pottering about in the garden,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I have been surprised at how I am feeling about the prospect of more weeks of this. I am dreaming of hosting barbecues, having a house full of laughing children and seeing people who aren\u2019t quite friends but are more than strangers. I may be choosier about the events I force upon myself in the future, but I\u2019ve learned that this introvert needs to party sometimes, too.\u201d Others further along the introversion scale are finding their daily life has barely changed. English teacher Ellie Grout, 29, from Bristol, is one of them. \u201cSelf-isolation is similar to my normal experience,\u201d she says. \u201cThe difference is that, for once, there is no pressure to arrange social events and no guilt about cancelling plans when I realise I want to stay at home.\u201d Hardcore introvert Jessica Pan, 34, spent a year living like an extrovert while writing her 2019 book, Sorry I\u2019m Late, I Didn\u2019t Want to Come. She lives with her husband Ian, a \u201csolid ambivert\u201d. Both are working from home and appreciating the slower pace of lockdown life. \u201cI don\u2019t believe any introvert actively enjoys being locked in their home at this time of anxiety,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I am finding pleasure in the small things, such as reading more, cooking slowly and doing pilates. I\u2019m trying to embrace this new normal and live in the moment.\u201d Jemma Broadstock, 24, a virtual assistant from Derbyshire, is hopeful this lockdown will reveal the often overlooked strengths of introverts and help erode what Susan Cain, author of the 2012 bestseller Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can\u2019t Stop Talking, dubs \u201cthe extroverted ideal\u201d. \u201cBusiness is thriving for me,\u201d she says. \u201cThe idea of networking events has always felt overwhelming, but now people are holding them online and I\u2019ve been finding new clients.

Yet nearly a decade after its publication, extroversion is still considered a model of success, especially in the workplace where what Cain describes as \u201cthe omnipresent belief that the ideal self is gregarious, alpha and comfortable in the spotlight\u201d prevails. Working in an open-plan office, taking part in daily meetings, public speaking and networking are all activities that are geared towards the extrovert\u2019s need for stimulation, while introverts struggle to make themselves seen and maintain their energy reserves. Our response to the coronavirus pandemic means that society has changed overnight, reshaped to suit a more introverted way of being \u2013 one that is rarely permitted \u2013 of thriving in a quiet setting, having time to think and be creative, and having control over how much socialising you do.

      "bodyText": "The main hospital in Zabul, southern Afghanistan, was abandoned after a Taliban attack last September destroyed most of the building and killed nearly 40 people. But when coronavirus slipped into the province this spring, desperate health authorities, casting around for ways to fight this new enemy, settled on its shattered remains. The paediatric ward, the only part of the building still standing, was refurbished and opened as an isolation centre for patients with Covid-19. It now stands beside the ruins of the rest of the hospital as a symbol of the terrible double challenge Afghanistan faces in fighting the virus while still in the middle of a long and bloody civil war. \u201cAfter the Taliban destroyed our main hospital, something remained and we made a two-storey building from that to hospitalise Covid patients,\u201d said Dr Lal Mohammad Tokhi, head of the pubic health directorate in Zabul. \u201cWe have plenty of protective materials like mask and gloves. We need ventilators but are expecting to get two from Kabul.\u201d The province has seen 10 cases and no deaths so far, and is trying to impose a lockdown, but it is being widely ignored by people who will not eat if they do not go out to work. \u201cPeople are so poor, there are serious problems with hunger,\u201d Tokhi said. Poverty and conflict meant that Afghanistan\u2019s health systems were over-stretched before coronavirus - by malnutrition, war injuries and infectious diseases eliminated elsewhere long ago. It is one of just two countries where polio is still endemic. Last week, the US watchdog for war and reconstruction efforts warned in a report that when coronavirus arrived, Afghanistan was \u201clikely (to) confront a health disaster\u201d, because of its many challenges. On Friday, health authorities said nationwide confirmed infections hit 2,335, with 68 deaths. The disease is widely accepted to have spread further than captured by official tests, although a very young population \u2013 over half under 25 \u2013 may have helped keep mortality rates lower than elsewhere. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that we have more deaths that are unreported to us,\u201d health minister Feroz Ferozuddin told the New York Times. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t seen mass deaths.\u201d The disease may cause huge collateral damage, however, among Afghanistan\u2019s many vulnerable citizens. Save the Children has already warned that lockdowns \u2013 although they are being widely ignored \u2013 have put 7 million children at risk of hunger. Adding to Afghanistan\u2019s challenges, the country went into 2020 with a divided government facing political, military and economic crises. The government has been paralysed by a months-long political dispute over who won last year\u2019s presidential election, which prompted the US to withhold a billion dollars of funding, vital to the functioning of a country with little tax base. US President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to sign a withdrawal deal with the Taliban, in a bid to end America\u2019s long war, has thrust the civil conflict between Afghan factions into an uncertain new phase. The militants have scaled back attacks in major cities but have rejected calls for a ceasefire to give time to fight the virus. They continue to attack government forces around the country, arguing their pact of non-aggression is only with the US. In northern Kunduz province, a hospital where a fifth of staff have been quarantined with suspected infections remains open to receive war wounded from the battles raging nearby because there is nowhere else to treat them, it has been reported. The Taliban has allowed health officials in the south to travel to rural areas, including those under militant control, to provide coronavirus information and checks, doctors and officials say. But information reaching Afghanistan\u2019s scattered villages may be too little, too late to stop the disease spreading. Zabul is a sparsely populated province far from the worst outbreak in the capital Kabul, apparently at the very fringes of Afghanistan\u2019s battle against covid-19. Yet cases have been rising sharply in neighbouring Kandahar , and there are also infections thought to have been imported directly to the province from Iran, by people trying to flee the epidemic there. \u201cSome Zabul residents who had been labourers in Iran, and came home to escape the outbreak there, brought it with them.

He was ahead of the game in his 1989 debut book <em>Liar\u2019s Poker</em>, which revealed the scandalous risk-taking practised on Wall Street. He went on to document the monomaniacal ambition of Silicon Valley (<em>The New New Thing</em>) and the fledgling business of sports analytics (<em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/jul/29/summer-readings-moneyball-michael-lewis\">Moneyball</a></em>), but never has his cultural antenna tuned into the future with greater accuracy than that particular remark.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/dec/07/michael-lewis-interview-the-big-short-fifth-risk\">Michael Lewis: \u2018Don\u2019t bet against the US. It has an incredible capacity for self-reinvention\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now that the coronavirus is here, Lewis has further predictions. He says that financial speculators will be looking to the White House for tips to exploit the economic crisis that the pandemic has unleashed.</p> <p>\u201cGiven what we know about Trump and his network of cronies,\u201d he says, \u201cyou just wonder how many of them are out there with some advanced notice of what he\u2019s going to say, and are taking advantage of it.\u201d</p> <p>While he may not be overly concerned with the complexities of good governance, Trump has maintained a firm focus on a much more visible, if volatile, yardstick of success: the US stock market.</p> <p>On 12 February, the main <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/feb/12/european-us-stock-markets-record-highs-coronavirus-fears-stock-markets-business-live\">US stock indexes recorded all-time highs</a>, and the president was a happy man. Less than two weeks later, as Wall Street realised the dimensions of the approaching pandemic, there was a spectacular crash, followed by a series of further reversals. Suddenly, Trump\u2019s chief selling point looked as vulnerable as his hairdo.</p> <p>But every stock market crash is an opportunity for the canny speculator. Lewis\u2019s bestselling book, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/mar/27/big-short-inside-doomsday-machine\">The Big Short</a></em>, later turned into an Oscar-winning film, was a classic on the subject. It told the story of the hedge fund managers and traders who bet against the market leading up to the 2007-8 financial crisis. Now, says Lewis, such people will surely be studying Trump\u2019s Twitter account.</p> <p>\u201cThere are bound to be smart hedge funds or high-frequency traders who have figured out how to time the tweets and the market reactions. Trump has the ability to move sectors up and down by recommending a drug or saying that he\u2019s solved the problem between the Saudis and the Russians, and the oil market\u2019s going to recover.</p> <p>\u201cI keep waiting for the story that they found the guy or guys who are doing this,\u201d he says.</p> <p>For all Trump\u2019s many missteps, the political impact of Covid-19 remains far from certain. The US leads the world with over a million cases and more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/29/coronavirus-us-economy-covid-19-donald-trump-live\">60,000 deaths</a>. But has it awoken the American public to their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/sep/27/this-guy-doesnt-know-anything-the-inside-story-of-trumps-shambolic-transition-team\">president\u2019s methodical shortcomings</a>? Or has it simply reinforced the ideological sectarianism that is a feature of a deeply divided country?</p> <p>\u201cIt has been party politicised,\u201d says Lewis, \u201cbut less successfully than anything else that\u2019s come down the pike. You see friction between Trump and Republican governors. You see friction between Trump and Republican legislators. He should\u2019ve had a big spike up in his poll numbers. Instead, he\u2019s drifting down.\u201d</p> <p>Liberal critics have come to realise that challenging Trump often serves only to rally his supporters. But, in recent weeks, tactical circumspection has been completely abandoned. In a piece in the latest issue of <em>The Atlantic</em>, entitled <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/06/underlying-conditions/610261/\">We Are Living in a Failed State</a>, the respected commentator George Packer writes: \u201cThe crisis demanded a response that was swift, rational and collective. The United States reacted instead like Pakistan or Belarus \u2014 like a country with shoddy infrastructure and a dysfunctional government whose leaders were too corrupt or stupid to head off mass suffering.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a5a523bc32668034b24e3ceaabbce128307af6c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5a523bc32668034b24e3ceaabbce128307af6c6/0_0_3500_2339/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President Trump talks with Reuters in interview at the White House in Washington\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I think Trump\u2019s figuring out in his reptilian brain that he actually has to solve a problem.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Barr\u00eda/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The nature of that shoddiness and dysfunction was the issue that Lewis explored in <em>The Fifth Risk</em>, his coruscating expos\u00e9 of the depletion of US government agencies by the Trump administration. The book, published in 2018, sought to educate Americans in the many vital roles the much-pilloried federal bureaucracy performs \u2013 from maintaining nuclear waste to assembling the data for weather forecasts.</p> <p>Nowhere was ignorance of these responsibilities quite as glaring as within the Trump camp when it walked into the White House. The presidential team had next to no interest in studying the outgoing Obama administration\u2019s painstaking transition documents.</p> <p>And ever since, Trump has displayed a barely concealed indifference to the government he is supposed to lead, either leaving key posts vacant or appointing ill-suited hangers-on or business people with obvious conflicts of interest to head up different departments, agencies and regulatory bodies.</p> <p>It\u2019s a laissez-faire attitude that has left him ill-prepared to mobilise a coordinated national response to Covid-19. Lewis rates Trump\u2019s performance at the outset of the pandemic as \u201cappallingly bad\u201d, not least because he had already dismantled a programme called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/trump-scrapped-pandemic-early-warning-program-system-before-coronavirus\">Predict </a>that was designed to anticipate the movement of viruses around the world.</p> <p>\u201cBut the big thing he did,\u201d Lewis adds, \u201cwas to remove the pandemic response team from the White House. So he cost us time in the beginning, and time is lives. He cost us much more time than an ordinarily inept man would\u2019ve cost us because, in addition to being inept, he dug his heels in and pretended for weeks that he wasn\u2019t inept. And those weeks were expensive.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s downplaying or outright denial of the Covid-19 threat is well-documented. From mid-January to mid-March, he seemed to view it as something that could be talked away, as though it would disappear through the sheer force of his bluster. Since then he has been forced by events to change tack. The strategic line, though, has been rather muddled: one moment he emphasises the need to support the lockdown, the next he encourages protesters to reject individual state restrictions.</p> <p>\u201cHe should be speaking for the whole country and he\u2019s not,\u201d says Lewis, \u201cbut having said that, he hasn\u2019t been as hostile to science as he might have been.\u201d</p> <p>By this, Lewis means that Trump has largely stood by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/20/fauci-coronavirus-covid-19-stay-home\">Anthony Fauci</a>, the key member of the White House coronavirus task force, whom Lewis calls \u201cthe most popular man in America\u201d. The celebrated immunologist has certainly spearheaded a much-needed revival of expertise, but nonetheless Trump\u2019s newfound support for science is not an obvious improvement on his previous hostility.

      "bodyText": "Back in December, the bestselling author Michael Lewis was asked by the Observer what it would take for America to want a leader who understood the importance of scientific knowledge. \u201cI think a pandemic might do it.\u201d he replied. \u201cSomething that could affect millions of people indiscriminately and from which you could not insulate yourself even if you were rich.\u201d Lewis has a long track record for spotting trends. He was ahead of the game in his 1989 debut book Liar\u2019s Poker, which revealed the scandalous risk-taking practised on Wall Street. He went on to document the monomaniacal ambition of Silicon Valley (The New New Thing) and the fledgling business of sports analytics (Moneyball), but never has his cultural antenna tuned into the future with greater accuracy than that particular remark. Now that the coronavirus is here, Lewis has further predictions. He says that financial speculators will be looking to the White House for tips to exploit the economic crisis that the pandemic has unleashed. \u201cGiven what we know about Trump and his network of cronies,\u201d he says, \u201cyou just wonder how many of them are out there with some advanced notice of what he\u2019s going to say, and are taking advantage of it.\u201d While he may not be overly concerned with the complexities of good governance, Trump has maintained a firm focus on a much more visible, if volatile, yardstick of success: the US stock market. On 12 February, the main US stock indexes recorded all-time highs, and the president was a happy man. Less than two weeks later, as Wall Street realised the dimensions of the approaching pandemic, there was a spectacular crash, followed by a series of further reversals. Suddenly, Trump\u2019s chief selling point looked as vulnerable as his hairdo. But every stock market crash is an opportunity for the canny speculator. Lewis\u2019s bestselling book, The Big Short, later turned into an Oscar-winning film, was a classic on the subject. It told the story of the hedge fund managers and traders who bet against the market leading up to the 2007-8 financial crisis. Now, says Lewis, such people will surely be studying Trump\u2019s Twitter account. \u201cThere are bound to be smart hedge funds or high-frequency traders who have figured out how to time the tweets and the market reactions. Trump has the ability to move sectors up and down by recommending a drug or saying that he\u2019s solved the problem between the Saudis and the Russians, and the oil market\u2019s going to recover. \u201cI keep waiting for the story that they found the guy or guys who are doing this,\u201d he says. For all Trump\u2019s many missteps, the political impact of Covid-19 remains far from certain. The US leads the world with over a million cases and more than 60,000 deaths. But has it awoken the American public to their president\u2019s methodical shortcomings? Or has it simply reinforced the ideological sectarianism that is a feature of a deeply divided country? \u201cIt has been party politicised,\u201d says Lewis, \u201cbut less successfully than anything else that\u2019s come down the pike. You see friction between Trump and Republican governors. You see friction between Trump and Republican legislators. He should\u2019ve had a big spike up in his poll numbers. Instead, he\u2019s drifting down.\u201d Liberal critics have come to realise that challenging Trump often serves only to rally his supporters. But, in recent weeks, tactical circumspection has been completely abandoned. In a piece in the latest issue of The Atlantic, entitled We Are Living in a Failed State, the respected commentator George Packer writes: \u201cThe crisis demanded a response that was swift, rational and collective. The United States reacted instead like Pakistan or Belarus \u2014 like a country with shoddy infrastructure and a dysfunctional government whose leaders were too corrupt or stupid to head off mass suffering.\u201d The nature of that shoddiness and dysfunction was the issue that Lewis explored in The Fifth Risk, his coruscating expos\u00e9 of the depletion of US government agencies by the Trump administration. The book, published in 2018, sought to educate Americans in the many vital roles the much-pilloried federal bureaucracy performs \u2013 from maintaining nuclear waste to assembling the data for weather forecasts. Nowhere was ignorance of these responsibilities quite as glaring as within the Trump camp when it walked into the White House. The presidential team had next to no interest in studying the outgoing Obama administration\u2019s painstaking transition documents. And ever since, Trump has displayed a barely concealed indifference to the government he is supposed to lead, either leaving key posts vacant or appointing ill-suited hangers-on or business people with obvious conflicts of interest to head up different departments, agencies and regulatory bodies. It\u2019s a laissez-faire attitude that has left him ill-prepared to mobilise a coordinated national response to Covid-19. Lewis rates Trump\u2019s performance at the outset of the pandemic as \u201cappallingly bad\u201d, not least because he had already dismantled a programme called Predict that was designed to anticipate the movement of viruses around the world. \u201cBut the big thing he did,\u201d Lewis adds, \u201cwas to remove the pandemic response team from the White House. So he cost us time in the beginning, and time is lives. He cost us much more time than an ordinarily inept man would\u2019ve cost us because, in addition to being inept, he dug his heels in and pretended for weeks that he wasn\u2019t inept. And those weeks were expensive.\u201d Trump\u2019s downplaying or outright denial of the Covid-19 threat is well-documented. From mid-January to mid-March, he seemed to view it as something that could be talked away, as though it would disappear through the sheer force of his bluster. Since then he has been forced by events to change tack. The strategic line, though, has been rather muddled: one moment he emphasises the need to support the lockdown, the next he encourages protesters to reject individual state restrictions. \u201cHe should be speaking for the whole country and he\u2019s not,\u201d says Lewis, \u201cbut having said that, he hasn\u2019t been as hostile to science as he might have been.\u201d By this, Lewis means that Trump has largely stood by Anthony Fauci, the key member of the White House coronavirus task force, whom Lewis calls \u201cthe most popular man in America\u201d. The celebrated immunologist has certainly spearheaded a much-needed revival of expertise, but nonetheless Trump\u2019s newfound support for science is not an obvious improvement on his previous hostility. After all, the cause of empirical research was hardly advanced by his suggestion that injecting disinfectant could be the answer to the pathogen. Lewis concedes the point, yet sees signs that Trump, or those around him, are trying to scramble together a functioning operation to deal with the pandemic, if only because there is now no alternative. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting to watch,\u201d Lewis says, \u201cbecause I think he\u2019s figuring out in his reptilian brain that he actually has to solve a problem, rather than just let it all happen and then make up a story after the fact.\u201d The problem for Trump, whose speciality is presidential edict by tweet, is that he\u2019s never had much respect for policy and planning. The degradation of federal planning and infrastructure is not a new development. It extends back to Ronald Reagan\u2019s day, but Trump has rapidly accelerated the process. He is, says Lewis, \u201cthe last station on the Reagan Express\u201d. An illustrative example of his approach to government was his appointment of Rick Perry as the head of Department of Energy \u2013 a huge bureaucracy that, among other things, is responsible for nuclear weapons and waste. Perry\u2019s main claim to relevance was that, as an unimpressive presidential candidate, he promised to close down the Department of Energy, without actually knowing what it did. Trump also unsuccessfully sought to install Barry Myers, CEO of AccuWeather, as head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which oversees the National Weather Service (NWS). At AccuWeather, which his family owns, Myers had lobbied to undermine the NWS. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite as cynical as Trump auctioning off the government to business interests,\u201d cautions Lewis. \u201cIt\u2018s more that he had no interest whatsoever himself, paid no attention to it, and so he had no positive motivation to put the right people into the various positions. Who then comes rushing in? The people who have a financial interest.\u201d Such behaviour has led Lewis to conclude that Trump never expected to become president. The campaign was just a brand-building exercise. \u201cHe\u2019s the dog who caught the car,\u201d he says. But if that were the case, wouldn\u2019t he welcome the release of electoral defeat in November? \u201cI\u2019m guessing he\u2019s worried about going to jail if he doesn\u2019t control the White House,\u201d Lewis says. What\u2019s clear is that Trump has confounded, not to say dumbfounded, many experienced observers. At the outset, the received wisdom was that the established processes of the American political system, and the sheer weight of responsibility, would force the maverick to conform to presidential expectations. Not only has that not proven the case, but Trump has redefined the whole concept of presidential politics. The fact that no one knows what he\u2019s going to do next, least of all his advisers, has become the means by which the White House operates. \u201cThe model I have in my head right now for our society is the model of a family with kind of a psycho, alcoholic dad,\u201d says Lewis. \u201cIt is the story of how the country compensated for its president, which is a really bizarre story to tell about an American crisis.

He knows that if he is to avoid being the Neville Chamberlain of the pandemic, he has to wrest control of the narrative. To that end, he has directed fire at China (which does, indeed, have questions to answer) and dog-whistled the growing libertarian revolt. Ultimately, however, he will be judged on the numbers. Not of his favoured Dow Jones index \u2013 though that doesn\u2019t look great at the moment \u2013 but of the death count of Americans.

For those struck down by Covid-19 and who have been treated in ICUs, there are likely to be further issues, researchers have warned.

That can induce panic on its own. Later you get flashbacks, extreme anxiety \u2013 particularly about your family and your partner.\u201d</p> <p>In one study by Hong Kong University researchers of people who had contracted Sars, it was found that those who survived the disease still had, a year later, elevated stress levels and \u201cworrying levels of psychological distress\u201d. They also showed alarming levels of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic symptoms. \u201cThere is every reason to expect to see the same sorts of symptoms appearing in those directly affected by Covid-19,\u201d added Wykes.</p> <p>In addition to the psychological impact of the disease, it is also clear that lingering physiological problems are likely to be associated with Covid-19. \u201cNo one knows exactly what the disease will do in the long term to patients but we do know what impacts other forms of viral pneumonia \u2013 which Covid-19 can trigger \u2013 can have on patients,\u201d said Professor Ian Hall of Nottingham University.</p> <p>With these conditions, many patients suffer from significant lung scarring and are affected by a condition known as advanced respiratory distress syndrome which can require months of recovery. \u201cThere is some initial evidence to suggest that for Covid-19 patients, it may take even longer,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Hall added that there was likely to be impacts on other parts of the body. \u201cFor example, Covid-19 can cause serious inflammation that affects patients in the early stages of dementia and can leave them increasingly confused and stressed.\u201d</p> <p>Cardiologist Professor Tim Chico at Sheffield University also pointed to studies indicating that people hospitalised with Covid-19 were also at risk from blood clots in multiple locations, including their lungs, veins and brain. \u201cCrucially, the risk of blood clots with Covid-19 appears to be even greater than the increased risk of blood clots seen in other severe illnesses,\u201d he said. Such an effect would leave patients vulnerable to pulmonary embolisms, strokes and deep vein thrombosis.<br></p>",

In addition to the psychological impact of the disease, it is also clear that lingering physiological problems are likely to be associated with Covid-19. \u201cNo one knows exactly what the disease will do in the long term to patients but we do know what impacts other forms of viral pneumonia \u2013 which Covid-19 can trigger \u2013 can have on patients,\u201d said Professor Ian Hall of Nottingham University. With these conditions, many patients suffer from significant lung scarring and are affected by a condition known as advanced respiratory distress syndrome which can require months of recovery. \u201cThere is some initial evidence to suggest that for Covid-19 patients, it may take even longer,\u201d he said. Hall added that there was likely to be impacts on other parts of the body. \u201cFor example, Covid-19 can cause serious inflammation that affects patients in the early stages of dementia and can leave them increasingly confused and stressed.\u201d Cardiologist Professor Tim Chico at Sheffield University also pointed to studies indicating that people hospitalised with Covid-19 were also at risk from blood clots in multiple locations, including their lungs, veins and brain. \u201cCrucially, the risk of blood clots with Covid-19 appears to be even greater than the increased risk of blood clots seen in other severe illnesses,\u201d he said. Such an effect would leave patients vulnerable to pulmonary embolisms, strokes and deep vein thrombosis.",

      "body": "<p>An animated musical extravaganza about a group of pop-loving trolls may turn out to be the most important film in recent Hollywood history. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/11/trolls-world-tour-review-uplifting-animated-sequel\" title=\"\"><em>Trolls World Tour</em></a><em>, </em>which has become a lockdown hit, notching up digital sales of $100m (\u00a380m) in three weeks, has become the focal point of a battle that could forever change moviegoing habits in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/22/as-cinemas-go-dark-the-film-industry-may-go-straight-to-netflix\" title=\"\">the Netflix era</a>.</p> <p>With cinemas closed, Hollywood studios are challenging the sacrosanct tradition that multiplexes air films first for up to three months, before their release on other platforms such as pay-TV, DVD and streaming. Instead, they are pushing new films straight to fans at home.</p> <p>Universal Pictures has been the most aggressive of the Hollywood studios with its strategy for <em>Trolls World Tour</em>. The film had been due for a global cinema release on 10 April, but instead became the most high-profile movie to be made available solely on digital services such as Amazon\u2019s Prime Video at \u00a315.99 ($19.99).</p> <p>Universal gets a greater cut of revenue from digital services than at the box office, which means the film has made the same amount of profit in its first three weeks as the first <em>Trolls </em>film did during its entire five-month run in US cinemas.</p> <p>Emboldened by its success, last week the company indicated that it would collapse the cinema release window by releasing films digitally at the same time. \u201cAs soon as theatres reopen, we expect to release movies on both formats,\u201d said Jeff Shell, the chief executive of parent company NBCUniversal.</p> <p>Those comments immediately prompted the world\u2019s two biggest cinema operators \u2013 AMC, which owns the Odeon chain in the UK, and Cineworld \u2013 to issue a global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/29/odeon-bans-all-universal-pictures-films-as-studio-skips-cinema-releases\" title=\"\">ban on screenings of all films from the maker of the <em>Fast &amp; Furious</em> and <em>Jurassic World </em>franchises</a> when business restarts. The operators accused Universal of \u201cbreaking the business model\u201d that has underpinned the Hollywood movie system for generations.</p> <p>\u201cUniversal has cast the first stone,\u201d said Jeff Bock, an analyst at research firm Exhibitor Relations. \u201cThis is exactly what the theatrical exhibition world had always feared \u2013 proof that bypassing theatres could be a viable model of distribution for studios.

      "bodyText": "An animated musical extravaganza about a group of pop-loving trolls may turn out to be the most important film in recent Hollywood history. Trolls World Tour, which has become a lockdown hit, notching up digital sales of $100m (\u00a380m) in three weeks, has become the focal point of a battle that could forever change moviegoing habits in the Netflix era. With cinemas closed, Hollywood studios are challenging the sacrosanct tradition that multiplexes air films first for up to three months, before their release on other platforms such as pay-TV, DVD and streaming. Instead, they are pushing new films straight to fans at home. Universal Pictures has been the most aggressive of the Hollywood studios with its strategy for Trolls World Tour. The film had been due for a global cinema release on 10 April, but instead became the most high-profile movie to be made available solely on digital services such as Amazon\u2019s Prime Video at \u00a315.99 ($19.99). Universal gets a greater cut of revenue from digital services than at the box office, which means the film has made the same amount of profit in its first three weeks as the first Trolls film did during its entire five-month run in US cinemas. Emboldened by its success, last week the company indicated that it would collapse the cinema release window by releasing films digitally at the same time. \u201cAs soon as theatres reopen, we expect to release movies on both formats,\u201d said Jeff Shell, the chief executive of parent company NBCUniversal. Those comments immediately prompted the world\u2019s two biggest cinema operators \u2013 AMC, which owns the Odeon chain in the UK, and Cineworld \u2013 to issue a global ban on screenings of all films from the maker of the Fast &amp; Furious and Jurassic World franchises when business restarts. The operators accused Universal of \u201cbreaking the business model\u201d that has underpinned the Hollywood movie system for generations. \u201cUniversal has cast the first stone,\u201d said Jeff Bock, an analyst at research firm Exhibitor Relations. \u201cThis is exactly what the theatrical exhibition world had always feared \u2013 proof that bypassing theatres could be a viable model of distribution for studios. Like it or not, the floodgates have opened. This is just the beginning, and the longer it takes for theatres to open on a worldwide scale, we\u2019re going to see the PVOD [premium video on demand] schedule become more and more populated.\u201d That schedule is now filling up. Universal announced last week that Judd Apatow\u2019s new comedy The King of Staten Island would scrap its planned cinema release on 19 June and premiere on-demand instead.

The straight-to-digital strategy is only considered to be viable for mid- and lower-budget films forecast to earn at most a few hundred million at the global box office. The first Trolls film made $346m worldwide. Disney\u2019s Mulan and Black Widow, the James Bond film No Time To Die, Warner Bros\u2019s Wonder Woman 1984 and Universal\u2019s Minions sequel \u2013 all potential $1bn-plus hits \u2013 are just some of the titles that have been shifted to later this year with a cinema release still firmly in mind. Global box-office revenues hit an all-time record of $42bn last year, dominated by blockbusters including Avengers: Endgame.

      "body": "<p>The row between cinema chains and Universal Studios over the digital-only release of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/29/amc-us-cinema-chain-boycott-universal-studios-home-streaming\" title=\"\"><em>Trolls World Tour</em></a> is one of may crises racking the entertainment industry during the coronavirus lockdown. The challenges range from working out how to stage live performances to managing social distancing in queues for rollercoasters. Here are some of the issues they face.</p> <h2>Television</h2> <p>Television is facing two main obstacle: programme supply issues in the short term; and, in the longer run, potentially fundamental changes to how shows are produced. ITV says, despite cuts in programme frequency, it will run out of episodes of <em>Emmerdale</em> at the end of May, and of <em>Coronation Street</em> at the end of June.</p> <p>The almost total shutdown of the UK\u2019s multibillion-pound TV and film production industry could see gaps in schedules for some genres, such as high-profile dramas, of up to two years. Kevin Lygo, ITV\u2019s director of programming, has already flagged likely reruns of <em>Midsomer Murders</em> in its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/30/itv-considers-filming-love-island-in-cornwall-or-cancelling-series\" title=\"\">depleted schedule</a> next year.</p> <p>How productions are made will change too. Live TV audiences may be a thing of the past for some shows. ITV and the BBC have said they will forgo them if necessary for upcoming series of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/14/silly-naff-unmissable-the-masked-singer-is-a-truly-terrible-delight\" title=\"\"><em>The Masked Singer</em></a> and <em>Strictly Come Dancing</em>. On-set production will also be altered by social distancing \u2013 there will be no more mass catering or crowded makeup trucks, and the previously unthinkable prospect of stars actually driving themselves to studios and filming locations may become thinkable.</p> <h2>Music</h2> <p>Artists face a number of lean years following the shutdown of the $27bn global live music industry. The streaming revolution has been a boon for music discovery and promotion, but the real money remains in live performance.</p> <p>\u201cA typical artist gets 65% to 75% of their income from live performances,\u201d says Mark Mulligan, analyst at Midia Research. \u201cBut it will take ages for consumer confidence to recover and return in mass numbers to live music. Toilets, ticketing and cloakrooms are all cluster points. What are club venues going to do, those with capacity of 150 to 200 people? They won\u2019t be viable with two-metre social distancing.\u201d</p> <h2>Standup comedy</h2> <p>Standup is an industry built on close-knit audiences in intimate, sometimes cramped, locations. It is a social-distancing nightmare.</p> <p>\u201cStandup has always been in rooms above pubs, or basements: it\u2019s like an underground movement,\u201d says Simon Lupton, a former BBC commissioning editor for comedy and co-founder of Seven Seas Films. \u201cThese are the very venues you wouldn\u2019t want to go to with coronavirus around, but close-proximity environments are where comedy thrives.\u201d</p> <p>Comedy venues are not big moneyspinners; income from food and drink sales tends to be crucial, and decreased footfall is likely to push many to the brink.</p> <p>\u201cI hope we don\u2019t see venue closures, but I suspect it will be inevitable as a lot of these places run on shoestring budgets,\u201d adds Lupton. \u201cThis won\u2019t be the death of comedy: everything is evolving and finding new ways of working.

      "bodyText": "The row between cinema chains and Universal Studios over the digital-only release of Trolls World Tour is one of may crises racking the entertainment industry during the coronavirus lockdown. The challenges range from working out how to stage live performances to managing social distancing in queues for rollercoasters. Here are some of the issues they face. Television Television is facing two main obstacle: programme supply issues in the short term; and, in the longer run, potentially fundamental changes to how shows are produced. ITV says, despite cuts in programme frequency, it will run out of episodes of Emmerdale at the end of May, and of Coronation Street at the end of June. The almost total shutdown of the UK\u2019s multibillion-pound TV and film production industry could see gaps in schedules for some genres, such as high-profile dramas, of up to two years. Kevin Lygo, ITV\u2019s director of programming, has already flagged likely reruns of Midsomer Murders in its depleted schedule next year. How productions are made will change too. Live TV audiences may be a thing of the past for some shows. ITV and the BBC have said they will forgo them if necessary for upcoming series of The Masked Singer and Strictly Come Dancing. On-set production will also be altered by social distancing \u2013 there will be no more mass catering or crowded makeup trucks, and the previously unthinkable prospect of stars actually driving themselves to studios and filming locations may become thinkable. Music Artists face a number of lean years following the shutdown of the $27bn global live music industry. The streaming revolution has been a boon for music discovery and promotion, but the real money remains in live performance. \u201cA typical artist gets 65% to 75% of their income from live performances,\u201d says Mark Mulligan, analyst at Midia Research. \u201cBut it will take ages for consumer confidence to recover and return in mass numbers to live music. Toilets, ticketing and cloakrooms are all cluster points. What are club venues going to do, those with capacity of 150 to 200 people? They won\u2019t be viable with two-metre social distancing.\u201d Standup comedy Standup is an industry built on close-knit audiences in intimate, sometimes cramped, locations. It is a social-distancing nightmare. \u201cStandup has always been in rooms above pubs, or basements: it\u2019s like an underground movement,\u201d says Simon Lupton, a former BBC commissioning editor for comedy and co-founder of Seven Seas Films. \u201cThese are the very venues you wouldn\u2019t want to go to with coronavirus around, but close-proximity environments are where comedy thrives.\u201d Comedy venues are not big moneyspinners; income from food and drink sales tends to be crucial, and decreased footfall is likely to push many to the brink. \u201cI hope we don\u2019t see venue closures, but I suspect it will be inevitable as a lot of these places run on shoestring budgets,\u201d adds Lupton. \u201cThis won\u2019t be the death of comedy: everything is evolving and finding new ways of working. It will take time, but it will survive.\u201d Theatre Alistair Smith, editor of The Stage, worries that while the focus has been on when theatres might open, another question has not been given equal billing: how? \u201cLarge communal activities such as theatre are going to be among the last to reopen,\u201d he says. \u201cEven then, it will probably be with some modifications: reduced capacities, temperature-testing on entrance, maybe even smaller casts due to cramped backstage facilities. And I can\u2019t imagine too many people wanting to crush around a theatre bar in the interval.\u201d Reduced capacities could have a knock-on effect on expensive West End productions with high running costs \u2013 they need packed theatres to be economically viable. Lower-budget shows could afford to play to smaller houses. And restrictions might make immersive theatre impossible. Smith adds that social distancing raises myriad questions, such as how audiences will get to their seats, and whether measures taken in theatres will be undermined if people travel to venues on public transport. Theme parks Large amusement parks operate as mini-cities: packed with rides, shopping malls, cinemas and restaurants, they face multiple issues in a virus-hit world. Guidelines published last week by Florida\u2019s Orange County \u2013 home to Disney World, Universal Studios and SeaWorld, all of which hope to reopen next month \u2013 make for lengthy reading. They include touchless hand sanitiser stations at all ticketing and entry areas and turnstiles, as well as markers six feet apart in queues.

Yet the latter has created a conundrum for hospitals: how do they deal with donations from well-wishers which can arrive in vast amounts and often without notice? \u201cWe had about 6,000 Easter eggs come in before and after Easter,\u201d said Ainne Dolan-Williams, who leads the health and wellbeing programme at King\u2019s College hospital trust in London. \u201cThey were particularly popular.\u201d Soon they were getting two and a half tonnes of fruit and veg a week from two local wholesalers, Smith and Brock, and Turnips, and meal deliveries from groups like Mealforce, one of dozens of organisations that delivers food from restaurants to NHS staff. Now the hospital tells Dolan-Williams\u2019s team every morning how many people need to be fed so that they can inform the suppliers. The outpouring of generosity has led to a gentle debate among NHS staff, some of whom feel guilty about food and gifts they feel might be better directed at others. San Sunkaraneni, a consultant surgeon in Guildford, tweeted last week:\u201cAs much as the free food to NHS workers is appreciated, I\u2019d rather it went to people that really needed it. Shops are open and accessible now. There is plenty of food available for us.\u201d Pete Neville, a consultant gastroenterologist who works in rotation on Covid-19 wards in Prince Charles hospital in Merthyr Tydfil, told the Observer: \u201cWe\u2019re in a poor area and there are high levels of deprivation and poverty. It is extraordinarily sweet of people and we are very grateful. But when you\u2019re getting it night after night, you start to wonder about the homeless and the newly unemployed. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to an awful lot of junior doctors and nurses and secretaries and we\u2019re all very lucky \u2013 we\u2019re being paid a decent salary and we can afford to buy our own food. Perhaps the local food bank is a better option.\u201d Similar sentiments in a letter published in Metro last week from Dr Sutapa Biswas, a consultant neurophysiologist at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, prompted a response from Damian Lewis, the actor, who set up FeedNHS with his wife, Helen McCrory, the comedian Matt Lucas and Leon restaurants. The FeedNHS coalition has grown to include Mealforce, FeedOurFrontline and BaxterStorey and delivers 40,000 meals a day to 84 hospitals in 10 of the UK\u2019s largest cities. \u201cWe at FeedNHS suspect the problem lies not with the formal coordinated relationship we and our partners have in place with hospitals, but with unsolicited and ad hoc donations,\u201d Lewis wrote. \u201cWe are feeding critical care workers who are finding it logistically very difficult to eat. This is not a \u2018thank you\u2019 for a job well done. It\u2019s an essential provision of food to critical care teams to help them do their job effectively, and make it more likely they themselves will stay healthy.\u201d Andrew Muir Wood of Meals for the NHS, which has delivered 87,000 meals so far, explained: \u201cWhere people are wearing double layers of protective equipment, they have to scrub down when they want to leave. It takes 25 minutes to get changed, so it\u2019s not like they can pop into Tesco. For those people, meals are dropped off inside the Covid zone and they can actually get a proper meal.\u201d",

Its kindness and sweetness and community spirit stand for everything that\u2019s good about British society.

The rainbows, the window art, the slogans painted on the roads overwhelm me with raw gratitude of my own. When doing your day job could cost you your life, knowing the public are behind you means everything.</p> <p>But government war talk is an altogether different matter. The more I hear Conservative MPs applaud and fawn over NHS staff, the more I think back to the footage from 2017 of those same MPs in the Commons cheering as they <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/mps-who-voted-against-full-21866381\">voted down a proper pay rise for nurses</a>. Ellwood was among them, alongside Rishi Sunak, Dominic Raab, Matt Hancock and Boris Johnson.</p> <p>The true measure of how much others esteem you resides fundamentally in their actions, not words. All this rousing talk of heroes, medals, memorials and flypasts increasingly feels like a clever and calculated distraction. The worth of nurses is so self-evident to this government, for instance, that they are routinely compelled to use foodbanks. And Hancock may have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/17/the-guardian-view-on-recognising-care-work-a-royal-charter-would-help\">offered Britain\u2019s 1.5 million carers a badge</a> recently, yet two-thirds of them are paid the minimum wage, with many on punitive zero-hours contracts. How convenient that now, with the spotlight on their vital work, their poverty wages are being augmented by lavish ministerial clapping.</p> <p>Most iniquitous of all, of course, is the government\u2019s willingness to laud us as heroes even while watching us die without proper personal protective equipment. How dare they? Testimony from staff forced to wear bin bags, Marigolds and even sanitary towels as facial protection should shame every member of the cabinet. The irony surely isn\u2019t lost on Johnson that the one thing Hollywood scriptwriters reliably award their superheroes is, at least, a mask and cape?</p> <p>The mythology of ancient Greece may abound with monster-slaying, death-defying demigods who strut and stride their way through quests that showcase epic feats of fearlessness. But classical heroes choose to put themselves in danger. Heroes aren\u2019t scared. Heroes don\u2019t cry. Heroes are immune to PTSD. Heroes don\u2019t need work-life balance and lunch breaks. Heroes don\u2019t lie awake at night worrying about infecting their partners and children.</p> <p>We, on the other hand, are highly skilled professionals who never volunteered to die for our country and should be as appropriately paid, trained and protected from industrial injury as anyone else. The dehumanising narrative of healthcare as heroism benefits political leaders by deflecting attention from their dismal failure to keep staff from avoidable harm. We will never stop striving to keep our patients safe \u2013 but we are not, like cheap rhetoric, disposable.</p> <p><em>Rachel Clarke is a palliative care doctor</em></p>",

All this rousing talk of heroes, medals, memorials and flypasts increasingly feels like a clever and calculated distraction. The worth of nurses is so self-evident to this government, for instance, that they are routinely compelled to use foodbanks. And Hancock may have offered Britain\u2019s 1.5 million carers a badge recently, yet two-thirds of them are paid the minimum wage, with many on punitive zero-hours contracts. How convenient that now, with the spotlight on their vital work, their poverty wages are being augmented by lavish ministerial clapping. Most iniquitous of all, of course, is the government\u2019s willingness to laud us as heroes even while watching us die without proper personal protective equipment. How dare they? Testimony from staff forced to wear bin bags, Marigolds and even sanitary towels as facial protection should shame every member of the cabinet. The irony surely isn\u2019t lost on Johnson that the one thing Hollywood scriptwriters reliably award their superheroes is, at least, a mask and cape? The mythology of ancient Greece may abound with monster-slaying, death-defying demigods who strut and stride their way through quests that showcase epic feats of fearlessness. But classical heroes choose to put themselves in danger. Heroes aren\u2019t scared. Heroes don\u2019t cry. Heroes are immune to PTSD. Heroes don\u2019t need work-life balance and lunch breaks. Heroes don\u2019t lie awake at night worrying about infecting their partners and children. We, on the other hand, are highly skilled professionals who never volunteered to die for our country and should be as appropriately paid, trained and protected from industrial injury as anyone else. The dehumanising narrative of healthcare as heroism benefits political leaders by deflecting attention from their dismal failure to keep staff from avoidable harm. We will never stop striving to keep our patients safe \u2013 but we are not, like cheap rhetoric, disposable. Rachel Clarke is a palliative care doctor",

He has been raging about the US lockdown, describing it as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-coronavirus-comments-timeline-stay-at-home-rules-fascist-2020-5?r=US&amp;IR=T\">fascist</a>\u201d and \u201cagainst all constitutional rights\u201d.</p> <p>Previously, he derided the \u201cpanic\u201d, passed on what\u2019s been criticised as dubious science to his 33 million Twitter followers, incorrectly declared children to be \u201cessentially immune\u201d and much more. </p> <p>He is entitled to favour lifting the lockdown.

The effect of Musk\u2019s sustained public protest has been to make the arena of techy super-moguls look ill informed, brattish and grotesquely self-interested.

My skin is more pallid than usual and would be \u201cend-stage consumption\u201d on the Farrow &amp; Ball paint chart. Now, after weeks of waiting for my hairdressing scissors/hair dye to arrive, I\u2019ve reached peak Methuselah\u2019s grandmother. My nails look as if I\u2019ve spent the last two months trying to claw my way out of a crypt. I suspect my eyebrows have developed their own eco-system. And on it goes. I\u2019m not even that high maintenance. Once I could have said \u201croad maintenance\u201d and got a laugh; now I\u2019d just get sympathy and, worse, murmured agreement. I\u2019m being facetious, but this is a feminist mind-melt. Am I a gender traitor for pining for my hair stylist or just a shallow idiot? In the past, I\u2019ve tended to be impatient with people over-fretting about the rightness/wrongness of makeup and sundry grooming rituals \u2013 my attitude is, do what you like, with the emphasis on \u201cyou\u201d. Still, even now, the core feminist questions apply. Should appearance matter so much? Who or what tells us that it should? When it comes to societal pressure, what conditioning are women also buckling under? All these issues are as valid as ever, but there are limits and for some of us, those limits are manifesting in our skin, nails and hair. Let\u2019s just say that I wouldn\u2019t be 100% uninterested in sourcing a head-to-toe face mask. Give space cadet Elon Musk a reality check The Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, doesn\u2019t seem inclined to let coronavirus interfere with his one-tech-tycoon crusade to make us equate \u201cbillionaire\u201d with \u201cbillions of stupid\u201d. He has been raging about the US lockdown, describing it as \u201cfascist\u201d and \u201cagainst all constitutional rights\u201d. Previously, he derided the \u201cpanic\u201d, passed on what\u2019s been criticised as dubious science to his 33 million Twitter followers, incorrectly declared children to be \u201cessentially immune\u201d and much more. He is entitled to favour lifting the lockdown. He\u2019s also entitled to be concerned about Tesla. (Though don\u2019t cry him a river \u2013 along with others, Musk\u2019s company, Space X, has just landed a multimillion-dollar contract for a Nasa moon landing project.) However, contrary to what his outsize sense of entitlement is telling him, he isn\u2019t the last word on every subject. The effect of Musk\u2019s sustained public protest has been to make the arena of techy super-moguls look ill informed, brattish and grotesquely self-interested. After a public outcry, Victoria Beckham reconsidered her decision to furlough staff in her fashion company. Maybe Musk could also try reading the global room. \u2022 Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist",

But the crisis has disproportionately burdened black mothers, who are exponentially more likely to die from conditions related to or aggravated by pregnancy than their white and Hispanic counterparts nationwide. And, as Covid-19 overburdens already under-resourced hospitals and complicates how women give birth, experts fear pre-existing problems may get worse. Isaac died in the same hospital where her mother has worked for 25 years, after switching Montefiore facilities because she felt so mistreated at her original branch, under the care of a doctor she had known since she was a teenager. \u201cImplicit bias, racism, being very dismissive of people that look like Amber, making assumptions,\u201d said Angela D Aina, interim executive director of the Black Mamas Matter Alliance. \u201cThis is the result.\u201d Isaac developed HELLP syndrome, a pregnancy-related condition that only proves fatal for \u201ca small number of women\u201d \u2013 if they go without treatment, according to March of Dimes, a nonprofit focused on mothers and babies. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not something that people in the United States generally die from,\u201d Crear-Perry said. \u201cIf you are a person who has been receiving prenatal care and people are aware that you have something going on, it\u2019s not a surprise, you\u2019re able to manage it with treatment.\u201d Around 60% of pregnancy-related deaths are preventable, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As early as February, Isaac knew her platelet levels \u2013 which help blood clot \u2013 had started to drop. But because of the pandemic, her routine doctor\u2019s visits turned into conference calls over Zoom, where she answered a few screening questions and checked her blood pressure. Isaac got updated bloodwork because she decided she wanted to hire a doula or midwife for an at-home delivery during the pandemic, partially because she felt so neglected by the system, McIntyre said. But she was labeled too high-risk and needed a surgeon after she discovered her platelet counts were still falling. Isaac tried to raise the alarm and figure out what was happening, but her medical team at first ignored her calls. When she finally had blood work done and was later admitted to the hospital, she entered scared and alone \u2013 neither her mother nor McIntyre was initially allowed to join her. She died on 21 April, after being induced more than a month early, then rushed into an emergency C-section. The surgeon she had been assigned wasn\u2019t present. Aina said there has been an uptick in C-sections during the pandemic, after years of advocacy campaigns against the invasive surgery\u2019s rising rates. Now, Isaac\u2019s newborn Elias will live in an apartment that was meticulously planned for him by a mother who will never get to be a part of it. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard being in this home and imagining her here with us,\u201d McIntyre said. \u201cShe never got to even meet him. She never got to see him. And she was just so thrilled about having him.\u201d",

The Randox instructions that come with the kits state: \u201cTest kits are only valid for 48 hours after use.\u201d The 29-year-old told the Guardian:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> This means there could be hundreds of useless kits sent out to workers like myself.<br></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>After calling the help centre, she was told there had been an influx of the same complaint and the advice was to order another one.</p> \n  <p>Similarly, Lou, a 31-year-old PR manager from London, was sent a kit without a return postage label enclosed. As a label couldn\u2019t be sent to her in time, Lou had a void sample and had to order a second kit to repeat the process. </p> \n  <p>Both women expressed concern over the delay in getting tested and also over whether the first testing kits they were sent would still count towards the government\u2019s daily testing figures.</p> \n  <p>The government was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/ministers-accused-of-changing-covid-19-test-tally-to-hit-100000-goal\">accused on Friday of bending the truth about how it passed its target of 100,000 tests a day</a>, amid reports that tests were being counted on dispatch rather than upon return to the lab.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/ministers-accused-of-changing-covid-19-test-tally-to-hit-100000-goal\">Hancock says UK hit 100,000 tests amid claims tally is artificially boosted</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>Jade also expressed concern that people would have trouble following the instructions to self-swab because, as she put it, testing for Covid-19 is \u201cquite invasive and very unpleasant for patients and the nurses doing it\u201d. This, she said, led her to fear many tests being sent out won\u2019t be utilised properly. </p> \n  <p>Lou said she had found the instructions \u201cexceedingly confusing\u201d and hard to follow. She said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I mainly worry for those with severe symptoms, this delay could be really damaging and also the confusing nature of the instructions make it difficult for those with lower literacy levels. </p> \n   <p>It\u2019s a worrying delay for many who may be experiencing worse symptoms than me, who might be struggling to complete and return these tests.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>She added that she found self-swabbing \u201cpainful\u201d and thought others might struggle with it \u2013 a process she now has to go through a second time. </p> \n  <p>Their concerns mirror those of a leading GP who <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-home-testing-for-covid-19-could-be-useless-leading-gp-warns-11981898\">told Sky News that \u201ca significant portion of [home tests] will be useless\u201d</a> because many people will struggle to perform the test on themselves. </p> \n  <p>Dr Gary Marlowe, the London chair of the <strong>British Medical Association</strong>, said that to collect a sample of the virus, patients need to scrape a long swab against their tonsils and push it into their nose until it meets resistance, which is \u201creally uncomfortable and difficult\u201d to do.</p> \n  <p>He said the difficulties with self-swabbing \u201cmeans that there will be a significant amount of people in whom the test comes back as negative when they\u2019re actually carrying the virus\u201d.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T15:00:06.505Z\">at 4.00pm

It found that changing the length of a lockdown \u2013 from eight to 12 or 16 weeks \u2013 would have an impact on the date at which any second wave might arrive, but only a marginal effect on the number of cases or deaths.</p> \n  <p>Another finding in the report claimed that the later a second period of lockdown was introduced \u2013 one that lasted for eight weeks \u2013 the bigger the reduction in any cases would be, compared to taking no lockdown action at all.</p> \n  <p>Communities with a younger average age of population would also extract greater benefit from a longer period of lockdown than one with an older population, according to the study. It found that any lockdown would save more lives amongst a younger community than an older one.</p> \n  <p>Dr Konstantin Blyuss, Reader in Mathematics at the University of Sussex, said: <br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Although in each case we explored, there will be a second epidemic peak after the quarantine is lifted, interestingly and quite counterintuitively, the later quarantine is introduced, the smaller this second peak will be. This reduction becomes quite substantial for quarantines introduced at a later stage.</p> \n   <p>Introducing an eight-week quarantine 10 weeks after the start of an outbreak reduces the magnitude of the peak in infected individuals by between 45% and 59% compared to no quarantine, and this reduces to only 8.5%-23.5% for a quarantine of the same duration introduced after six weeks.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Dr Yuliya Kyrychko, a reader in mathematics at the University of Sussex and one of the authors of the report, said the expanded effects of lockdown on young people could be explained by the likelihood of their being more socially mobile. She said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>A bigger impact of quarantine on reducing deaths in regions with younger populations can be attributed to a number of factors, such as the fact that younger people have more contacts and thus are making a bigger contribution to disease transmission, so quarantining them makes a bigger impact on reducing the overall disease burden.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T11:55:58.255Z\">at 12.55pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ead568e8f082b32fdd6bfc1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T11:16:51.070Z\">12.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e92e93d92f2969669fa66982b2d0553ae1873e4\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e92e93d92f2969669fa66982b2d0553ae1873e4/32_114_3077_1847/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mural in tribute to the NHS painted by artist Rachel List in Pontefract.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mural in tribute to the NHS painted by artist Rachel List in Pontefract.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lee Smith/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ead55ba8f082b32fdd6bfba\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/davidbatty\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T11:14:13.904Z\">12.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jeremy-deller\">artist Jeremy Deller</a> has called on middle-aged ravers to buy a poster he has produced in recognition of the plight of victims of domestic violence and care home residents during the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"http://www.pleasedonotbend.co.uk/work/bless-this-acid-house\">Sales of the print</a>, which says Bless this Acid House, will support Refuge, a charity for survivors of domestic abuse, and Pilgrims\u2019 Friend Society, which runs care homes across the UK.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B_ra0jOlDZu/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s death toll surpassed 28,000 as another 621 deaths across all settings took the total to 28, 131. NHS staff are \u201cbreaking down\u201d on the front line tackling coronavirus and their mental health must be made a priority now rather than when the crisis is over, Labour warned. The shadow mental minister, Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, wrote to the health secretary to seek assurances medical staff will get the support they need. Concerns were raised over home testing kits sent out by the government amid reports of kits arriving without return postage labels, without reference codes for registering online, and warnings from medical workers that members of the public will find self-swabbing too difficult. With several people contacting the Guardian to say they had had to order a second testing kit after the above issues left them with void samples, it raises further questions about whether those voided tests would still count towards the government\u2019s daily testing figures. More than 70% of critical care patients with Covid-19 in the UK are men, a new report from the ICNARC found. It also found that men were more likely to die in critical care, with 51% dying in care compared with around 43% of women. The government pledged a support package of over \u00a376m to support victims of domestic abuse, vulnerable children and victims of modern slavery through the pandemic. A task force led by Dame Louise Casey will also look at what long-term support can be offered for rough sleepers who have been accommodated during the lockdown. Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds name their baby boy Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson, in a tribute to their grandfathers and the two doctors who treated the prime minister during his brush with Covid-19. That\u2019s it from me today on the UK side. Thank you to everybody who got in touch with tips and suggestions, and to all of you for reading along. If you would like to continue to follow the Guardian\u2019s coronavirus coverage, head over to the global live blog for the worldwide picture. Q. Can you give some hope to parents of children whose futures have been put on hold? Jenrick says they\u2019re not able to give a date yet for the return of schools, but reiterates it will likely be \u201cin a phased manner\u201d when it\u2019s the right time. Harries adds that it\u2019s still unclear how transmission of the disease impacts children. Q. How are you going to ensure enough people download the app? Jenrick says he\u2019s sure people will get behind the app and download it, particularly through \u201cgreat affection for the NHS\u201d. And that\u2019s it, the briefing is over. Q. How seriously is the government investigating concerns that China might have been less transparent than thought at the beginning of the outbreak? Jenrick says \u201cthere will come a time when we will want to analyse the origins of the virus in detail and consider the actions of other countries\u201d. But that\u2019s not now, he says. Q. How will you reassure people who are uneasy about going back to normal life after lockdown? Jenrick says it\u2019s a huge success that people have listened and adhered to the restrictions. Any decisions the government takes will be guided by medical opinion, he adds. Harries says people need clear public health messaging in order to be reassured. Q. Are we likely to see permission for mass gatherings resume before pubs can reopen, if not then why not? Jenrick says now we\u2019re past the peak, the PM will set out how to bring the country forward in terms of schools, public transport, work etc next week. The rate of transmission is significantly less outdoors than indoors, so that will be a factor to take into consideration, he says. But any decisions will be based on the scientific evidence, he adds. Harries says generally outdoor environments are safer, but it depends how you go there and what you do. If you\u2019re meeting up with people outside your household and spend time face-to-face, for instance, that\u2019s not good, she adds. Q. Can we assume that among the numbers of new infections, there is a higher proportion among frontline workers,and what does this say about failures to deliver PPE to those workers? Harries says she recognises that healthcare staff have a higher risk of infection, as they are treating sick patients. We\u2019re starting to see strong evidence around transmission in care homes, she adds. As well as PPE, systematic processes of managing infections are also important, she says. Q. How will you manage to do contact-tracing successfully if not enough people download the NHS contact-tracing app? Jenrick says he\u2019s sure people will get behind the app and play their part. Q. Do you know where people are now catching the virus? Harries says when there is sustained community transmission, it\u2019s important to identify pockets of transmission. There is a focus on hospitals and care environments like care homes, she says. With more testing, we will get a better understanding of the virus\u2019s prevalence and have the opportunity to interrupt transmission, she adds. Q. What more is the government prepared to do to help the aviation sector through the pandemic? Jenrick says the government wants to support the industry though the challenges it faces, but doesn\u2019t provide further details on this. Q. Could you define what is meant by \u201ccontact\u201d that would require someone to self-isolate? Harries says a close contact with Covid-19 comes primarily from a respiratory risk. People living in the same household is one, she says, hence household isolation rules. Close, face-to-face proximity is also close contact, she says. The length of time you spend with someone and how physically near to them you were are also risk factors, she says. The NHS contact-tracing app will determine proximity, she says. They are taking questions from the media now. Q. What are your long-term plans to help people who will have to continue to shield even after lockdown is eased? Jenrick says he appreciates the huge emotional impact shielding is having on people. Tailored support such as priority delivery for food is available, he says. Harries adds that as time goes on and more evidence comes in, they aim to review these measures and identify how services can be adapted for clinical needs, including mental health support. Q. How many daily tests will you need and how many staff will need to be trained for tracking and tracing to be fully operational? Harries says tests need to be quick so that contacts don\u2019t have to isolate for long periods of time when their contact actually doesn\u2019t have Covid-19. Around 3,000 clinical staff and 15,000 tracing staff are being recruited by Public Health England, a significant task, she says. Paul in the East Midlands asks about what the government will do to help those in dire need whose situation has been made worse by the pandemic. Jenrick says the government has taken steps to protect those in need, through food parcels for those shielding, for example. He also outlines some of the economic measures the government has introduced to help people get by. They are taking questions from members of the public now. Ashley from Yorkshire asks about the possibility of catching Covid-19 twice and how a vaccine might change this. Harries says the World Health Organization position is that there isn\u2019t yet enough information on the immune status. The elderly tend to show a weaker antibody response, but we still don\u2019t know enough, she says. Dr Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer for England, is speaking now. We are past the peak but still have a lot of work to do, she says. We must keep in mind the five tests for easing the lockdown, she adds. Transport use has been a concern when motor vehicle usage flipped up, she says, but the number of social interactions has stayed very low. The R rate is down, suggesting the significant drop in transport use and adherence to social distancing is working. The \u201cmassive increase in daily testing\u201d will continue, she says. That is panning out between NHS testing and the growth in wider testing capacity, she says. As the number of cases requiring clinical care in hospitals falls, all patients coming in are now being tested, so there is likely to be a drop-off in the number of cases as we consistently test through hospitals, she says. The number of people in hospital with Covid-19 has decreased by about 13% since last week, she says. This signifies that pressure on the NHS is coming down and other services can be ramped up, she says. Critical care bed use is starting to come down, and the death rate is starting to come down very slowly and very gradually, she says. Jenrick says 1.8 million people in England have been instructed to shield. For those without family and friends to support them, he expects the one millionth package of food and essential supplies to be delivered in the next few days. Turning to the subject of rough sleepers, Jenrick says they are particularly vulnerable to Covid-19. So far more than 5,400 rough sleepers known to councils have been offered safe accommodation in just under a month, he says. This is over 90%, he says. This was the right thing to do. He says Dame Louise Casey has been appointed by the prime minister and himself to lead a new task force so oversee the national effort to ensure those rough sleepers now in accommodation receive the support they need and move into long-term safe, sustainable accommodation once the pandemic is over. Jenrick says that victims of domestic abuse should call 999 in an emergency, or if you\u2019re in danger and unable to talk, call 999 then press 55, he says. The police will be there for you, they will help you, he adds. If you need support, call the domestic abuse helpine on 0808 2000 247 at any time, he says. Jenrick says that now we\u2019re past the peak, the prime minister will set out how the government will address the second phase next week. He says the lockdown has been \u201ca nightmare\u201d for victims of domestic abuse trapped in homes across the country. Through the domestic abuse bill, the government will ensure the victims get the priority need status to access local housing services more easily, he says. This is a fully funded commitment, he says, so that victims don\u2019t have to make the choice between staying somewhere unsafe and being made homeless. He announces a package of more than \u00a376m in new funding to support the most vulnerable during the pandemic. It will go towards charities supporting vulnerable children, victims of domestic abuse, and victims of modern slavery. The money will be used to provide more safe spaces and accommodation for victims of abuse, in the recruitment of workers for victims of sexual violence, and for frontline charities supporting those in need, including virtual or phone-based services. The local government secretary is speaking now. As of today, 1,129,907 tests have now been carried out in the UK, he says, including 105,937 tests carried out yesterday. 182,260 people have tested positive, that\u2019s an increase of 4,806 cases since yesterday. 14,695 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus, down from 15,111 yesterday. Of those who tested positive across all settings, 28,131 have now died, an increase of 621 fatalities since yesterday. These are \u201cheartbreaking losses for every family affected\u201d, he says. The local government secretary, Robert Jenrick, will lead the daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing, due to begin shortly. He will be joined by England\u2019s deputy chief medical officer, Dr Jenny Harries. Readers have been getting in touch with me regarding issues they have experienced with the Covid-19 home testing kits being sent out by the government. Jade, a pre-registered nurse from Glasgow, received one bearing instructions to register the kit online in order to receive her results \u2013 only her kit had been sent without the reference code to do this. The Randox instructions that come with the kits state: \u201cTest kits are only valid for 48 hours after use.\u201d The 29-year-old told the Guardian: This means there could be hundreds of useless kits sent out to workers like myself. After calling the help centre, she was told there had been an influx of the same complaint and the advice was to order another one. Similarly, Lou, a 31-year-old PR manager from London, was sent a kit without a return postage label enclosed. As a label couldn\u2019t be sent to her in time, Lou had a void sample and had to order a second kit to repeat the process. Both women expressed concern over the delay in getting tested and also over whether the first testing kits they were sent would still count towards the government\u2019s daily testing figures. The government was accused on Friday of bending the truth about how it passed its target of 100,000 tests a day, amid reports that tests were being counted on dispatch rather than upon return to the lab. Jade also expressed concern that people would have trouble following the instructions to self-swab because, as she put it, testing for Covid-19 is \u201cquite invasive and very unpleasant for patients and the nurses doing it\u201d. This, she said, led her to fear many tests being sent out won\u2019t be utilised properly. Lou said she had found the instructions \u201cexceedingly confusing\u201d and hard to follow. She said: I mainly worry for those with severe symptoms, this delay could be really damaging and also the confusing nature of the instructions make it difficult for those with lower literacy levels. It\u2019s a worrying delay for many who may be experiencing worse symptoms than me, who might be struggling to complete and return these tests. She added that she found self-swabbing \u201cpainful\u201d and thought others might struggle with it \u2013 a process she now has to go through a second time. Their concerns mirror those of a leading GP who told Sky News that \u201ca significant portion of [home tests] will be useless\u201d because many people will struggle to perform the test on themselves. Dr Gary Marlowe, the London chair of the British Medical Association, said that to collect a sample of the virus, patients need to scrape a long swab against their tonsils and push it into their nose until it meets resistance, which is \u201creally uncomfortable and difficult\u201d to do. He said the difficulties with self-swabbing \u201cmeans that there will be a significant amount of people in whom the test comes back as negative when they\u2019re actually carrying the virus\u201d. A further 44 people have died after testing positive for coronavirus in Wales, taking the total number of deaths there to 969, Public Health Wales has said. Another 183 people have tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 10,155. NHS England has announced 370 more deaths of patients who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 20,853. Of the 370 new deaths announced today: 75 occurred on 1 May 149 occurred on 30 April 52 occurred on 29 April The figures also show 85 of the new deaths took place between 1 and 28 April while the remaining nine deaths occurred in March, with the earliest new death taking place on 13 March. NHS England releases updated figures each day showing the dates of every coronavirus-related death in hospitals in England, often including previously uncounted deaths that took place several days or even weeks ago. This is because of the time it takes for those who have died to be confirmed as testing positive for Covid-19, for postmortem examinations to be processed and for data from the tests to be validated. The figures published today by NHS England show 8 April continues to have the highest number for the most hospital deaths occurring on a single day, with a current total of 864. Boris Johnson and his fiancee Carrie Symonds have named their baby boy Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson, after their grandfathers and the doctors who helped save the prime minister\u2019s life. Symonds announced on Instagram: Introducing Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson born on 29.04.20 at 9am. Wilfred after Boris\u2019 grandfather, Lawrie after my grandfather, Nicholas after Dr Nick Price and Dr Nick Hart \u2013 the two doctors that saved Boris\u2019 life last month. Thank you so, so much to the incredible NHS maternity team at UCLH that looked after us so well. I couldn\u2019t be happier. My heart is full. Later, Dr Nick Price and Prof Nick Hart offered their \u201cwarm congratulations\u201d to the prime minister and Symonds. They said in a statement: Our warm congratulations go to the Prime Minister and Carrie Symonds on the happy arrival of their beautiful son Wilfred. We are honoured and humbled to have been recognised in this way, and we give our thanks to the incredible team of professionals who we work with at Guy\u2019s at St Thomas\u2019 and who ensure every patient receives the best care. We wish the new family every health and happiness. Transmission rates for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections have plunged since the pandemic lockdown, according to experts. The measures to control the Covid-19 outbreak have led to fewer infections over the past five weeks, said David Stuart, of sexual health service 56 Dean Street in Soho, London. Stuart tweeted that the coronavirus outbreak presented a historic opportunity to cut HIV infections. He said: It\u2019s broken a chain of onward infections that\u2019s been relentless &amp; consistent for decades; this gives us an unprecedented opportunity \u2013 to literally interrupt an epidemic (or two). To help to achieve this, he urged people, particularly gay and bisexual men, to order free home HIV-testing kits. JK Rowling, author of the Harry Potter series, has said she will donate \u00a31m to be split between charities Refuge, which supports people experiencing domestic violence, and Crisis, which supports those who are homeless. NHS staff are \u201cbreaking down\u201d on the front line tackling coronavirus and their mental health must be made a priority now rather than when the crisis is over, Labour has warned. The shadow mental health minister and A&amp;E doctor Rosena Allin-Khan has written to Matt Hancock to seek assurances that medics are getting the support they need. In her letter to the health secretary, she said: Increasingly, NHS staff are breaking down - I see it first-hand working shifts. From a fear of spreading the virus to patients and loved ones, a lack of PPE, an increased workload owing to the number of cases and staff absences, to being redeployed to ICUs and witnessing more patients die, staff are experiencing greater pressure, which is inevitably taking its toll on their mental health. At this time of crisis, staff mental health must be a priority now. It simply cannot be an afterthought once the acute stage of the crisis is over. Lifting lockdown measures in two weeks would result in a second wave of infection comparable to leaving them in place until the summer, according to a new study by mathematicians at the University of Sussex. The findings, which run contrary to lessons many have drawn from the recent period of lockdown across the world, have been published on medRxiv and have not yet been peer-reviewed. The research was based on modelling that looked at \u201cnon-exponential distribution of incubation and recovery periods\u201d, as well as the age structure of a given population. It found that changing the length of a lockdown \u2013 from eight to 12 or 16 weeks \u2013 would have an impact on the date at which any second wave might arrive, but only a marginal effect on the number of cases or deaths. Another finding in the report claimed that the later a second period of lockdown was introduced \u2013 one that lasted for eight weeks \u2013 the bigger the reduction in any cases would be, compared to taking no lockdown action at all. Communities with a younger average age of population would also extract greater benefit from a longer period of lockdown than one with an older population, according to the study. It found that any lockdown would save more lives amongst a younger community than an older one. Dr Konstantin Blyuss, Reader in Mathematics at the University of Sussex, said: Although in each case we explored, there will be a second epidemic peak after the quarantine is lifted, interestingly and quite counterintuitively, the later quarantine is introduced, the smaller this second peak will be. This reduction becomes quite substantial for quarantines introduced at a later stage. Introducing an eight-week quarantine 10 weeks after the start of an outbreak reduces the magnitude of the peak in infected individuals by between 45% and 59% compared to no quarantine, and this reduces to only 8.5%-23.5% for a quarantine of the same duration introduced after six weeks. Dr Yuliya Kyrychko, a reader in mathematics at the University of Sussex and one of the authors of the report, said the expanded effects of lockdown on young people could be explained by the likelihood of their being more socially mobile. She said: A bigger impact of quarantine on reducing deaths in regions with younger populations can be attributed to a number of factors, such as the fact that younger people have more contacts and thus are making a bigger contribution to disease transmission, so quarantining them makes a bigger impact on reducing the overall disease burden. The artist Jeremy Deller has called on middle-aged ravers to buy a poster he has produced in recognition of the plight of victims of domestic violence and care home residents during the coronavirus pandemic. Sales of the print, which says Bless this Acid House, will support Refuge, a charity for survivors of domestic abuse, and Pilgrims\u2019 Friend Society, which runs care homes across the UK. One of Deller\u2019s most famous artworks, Acid Brass, saw him collaborate with a brass band that performed 1980s acid house classics such as A Guy Called Gerald\u2019s Voodoo Ray. Graphic designer Fraser Muggeridge, who co-produced the posters, said he and Deller wanted to support charities \u201cunder increased pressure during this time and to bring a bit of joy into people\u2019s homes and windows\u201d. Last month, the pair published a poster called Thank God For Immigrants, which raised \u00a350,000 for food bank charity the Trussell Trust and Refugee Action, which supports asylum seekers. This is from ITV\u2019s Daniel Hewitt. He previously reported that hospices were set to run out of PPE \u201cwithin days\u201d because providers of end-of-life care were being denied access to government supplies. My colleague Aamna Mohdin has written about how coronavirus has hit the borough of Newham \u2013 one of the country\u2019s most deprived areas \u2013 harder than anywhere else. The east London borough has recorded the worst mortality rate in England and Wales. The borough\u2019s rate \u2013 144.3 deaths per 100,000 people \u2013 is closely followed by Brent in north London (141.5), and Newham\u2019s neighbour Hackney (127.4), according to figures published by the Office for National Statistics. The data confirms what had already been suspected: people living in the poorest parts of the country are dying from Covid-19 at a much higher rate than those in the richest. Newham resident Kamul Islam, a 40-year-old cab driver, said 22 people had died aftering contracting the virus on his road and neighbouring street alone. He said: Every day I get a message from someone in my community telling me of people who have died. They are young and old. It\u2019s been really tough. A son has written an emotional tribute to his mother, a care home nurse who died after contracting Covid-19, saying a lack of personal protective equipment is what killed her. Ian O\u2019Neal described Suzanne Loverseed, 63, as a \u201clioness\u201d who gave everything for her children. He said: \u201cAt the end, she worked in a care home, with patients dying of this virus. She had no PPE [protective personal equipment] but fearlessly she carried on. That\u2019s what killed her.\u201d O\u2019Neal described having to say goodbye to his mother via iPad. \u201cThere are some people out there still urging that the virus is not that threatening, or that the government has overreacted, or that it doesn\u2019t matter if a few oldies die. They are mistaken. \u201cWe might have had another 20 years with her: instead, we had to say goodbye via an iPad, unable to hold her hand. Her grandson is not yet three. About 25,000 other families will know what I mean when I say that I hope to God such people never have personal cause to amend their opinions,\u201d he said. On 6 April, Compassion in Care released figures showing it had received 87 calls in the previous two weeks from staff in social care raising PPE concerns, including 61 in residential homes, 20 from nursing homes and six for home care agencies. Many high-street law firms could face closure this year as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a Law Society survey. The results showed 71% of small law firms believe they may have to close their doors within the next six months because of physical distancing hindering face-to-face transactions, court hearings and the wider economy. The Law Society defines high-street law firms as those with four partners or fewer, and the survey results were based on answers from 774 firms. Its president, Simon Davis, said the shock to the legal system has been \u201csudden and severe\u201d and firms face \u201ca dramatic plunge in income\u201d. He said: Although a firm may be open for business, this does not mean it is business as usual. Residential property transactions have ground to a halt. Reduction in court hearings has massively impacted on the amount of work available - while social distancing and the lack of face-to-face meetings is causing difficulty delivering in other areas, such as the execution of wills. Elsewhere, small firms have suffered from the decline in overall activity - particularly from service industries such as retail, leisure and hospitality. The fate of the high-street firm is thus intrinsically bound to that of other small businesses. He said firms are struggling because although the government provides some relief, they are specifically excluded from support for small businesses, and are expected to continue paying business rates while their buildings are empty. There is therefore a growing fear that \u201cmany businesses will fall through the crack\u201d, he added. Davis also said individual solicitors are also at risk, because some are not eligible for support for the self-employed, and those who are paid via dividends are in need of a support package. New polling shows extraordinarily high support for the SNP government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. According to a YouGov survey for the Times Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has the confidence of 71% of Scots when it comes to her ability to make the correct decisions in dealing with the virus, with 23% saying they do not have faith in her judgments. That gives the Scottish first minister a +48 rating overall. There was a high level of cross-party consensus in support of the Scottish government\u2019s performance \u2013 three-quarters of Scots, including the vast majority of Tory and Labour voters, believe the SNP government is handling the crisis well. As well as 85% of SNP voters and 84% of Liberal Democrats, 70% of both Conservative and Labour supporters are happy with the approach taken by the Scottish government. Just 19% said the virus was being handled badly in Edinburgh. This consensus falls apart when assessing the UK government\u2019s performance. Scots are split, with 47% of those surveyed agreeing Conservative ministers have handled the outbreak well and 48% disagreeing. Boris Johnson himself has a net rating of -15. A nurse who died after contracting coronavirus will be remembered for her \u201clovely smile\u201d, hospice bosses have said. Gill Oakes, a senior clinical support nurse at Bolton hospice, died on 30 April at Royal Bolton hospital with Covid-19, the hospice said. Chief executive Leigh Vallance said: She was a dedicated and compassionate member of our team, caring for patients at Bolton hospice for nearly 24 years. She will be dearly missed by us all. Gill was the sort of person who always offered to help others - nothing was ever too much trouble for her. She was a brilliant nurse who often helped new members of the team settle into their role at the hospice. We will always remember her kindness and her lovely smile. We\u2019d like to thank our colleagues at Royal Bolton hospital for taking care of Gill, and our thoughts are with her family at this impossibly sad time. More than 70% of coronavirus patients admitted to critical care in England, ,Wales and Northern Ireland are men, according to new data from the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC). The figures were based on a sample of 7,542 critically ill patients confirmed as having Covid-19. Researchers found that 5,389 of the patients were men, compared with 2,149 women. The report, published on Friday, also found that men were more likely to die in critical care, with 51% dying in care compared with around 43% of women. In total about 49% of the 5,139 patients admitted to critical care who had recorded care outcomes had died, it found. The report analysed data on patients with confirmed Covid-19 from 286 NHS critical care units in England, Wales and Northern Ireland taking part in the ICNARC programme up to 4pm on Thursday. Prof Calum Semple, from the University of Liverpool and a consultant respiratory paediatrician at Alder Hey children\u2019s hospital, said the data showed that coronavirus was just as fatal as Ebola for hospital patients. Research by Semple and his team, which was published on Wednesday, found that of the total number of patients, 17% required admission to high dependency or intensive care units and of these, 31% were discharged alive, 45% died and 24% continued to be treated in hospital. He said: Some people persist in believing that Covid-19 is no worse than a bad dose of flu. They are gravely mistaken. Despite the best supportive care that we can provide, the crude case fatality rate for people who are admitted to hospital - that is, the proportion of people ill enough to need hospital treatment who then die - with severe Covid-19 is 35% to 40%, which is similar to that for people admitted to hospital with Ebola. It\u2019s a really nasty disease. My colleague Amy Walker has spoken to the relatives of care home residents who have lost their lives in the coronavirus pandemic. She writes: Before they were care home residents, they were our factory workers, teachers, engineers and administrative workers. Some were singers, and some were boxers. Some were parents, grandparents, and even great-grandparents. Now they have died after contracting coronavirus in their homes. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that between 10 and 24 April, there were 4,343 recorded deaths from Covid-19 in residential care homes. Meanwhile, frustration among operators, staff and relatives that the government has underestimated the seriousness of the spread of the virus in care continues to grow. Here are the stories of some of those who have died. The National Trust could lose up to \u00a3200m this year due to the coronavirus crisis, the charity has said as it appeals to the government for \u201curgent, practical\u201d support after having to halt a number of projects amid the pandemic. The conservation charity\u2019s director general, Hilary McGrady, said \u201ca sharp drop in income\u201d is threatening the future of nature sites and staff across the country. She told BBC Breakfast, the trust \u201clost about 50% of our annual income literally overnight\u201d when it closed earlier this year. Writing in the Telegraph (paywall), McGrady urged ministers to step in and \u201caddress nature, wildlife and environmental organisations with an immediate offer of support\u201d, given that they had thanked a number of manufacturing businesses, and called for \u201ca green recovery after lockdown\u201d. Good morning. The government continues to insist its 100,000 tests per day target was met despite revelations that home kits are being counted as they are posted rather than when they are returned. The health secretary Matt Hancock said that 122,347 tests were performed in the 24 hours up to 9am on Friday \u2013 but questions have been raised over how the tests have been counted. The government\u2019s national testing coordinator, Prof John Newton, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme this morning: All the tests are only counted once, and you can count tests when they go out or when they come back in, and whichever way you do it we still meet the target. Elsewhere, The Times (paywall) reports that commuters could be asked to check their temperature at home before travelling, under plans to ease restrictions being considered by the government. According to the paper, Boris Johnson will present a \u201croad map\u201d on Thursday for socially distanced work, travel and schooling to take the UK out of full lockdown in an effort to restart the economy while still keeping the rate of infection down. The Telegraph (paywall) also understands the 2-metre rule is being reviewed by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) at the government\u2019s request. The FT (paywall), however, reports that working from home is set to become the new norm, with offices expected to stay shut for months.

      "body": "<p>The chancellor Rishi Sunak is under intense pressure this weekend to offer a massive \u201csecond wave\u201d of financial support to businesses within weeks amid growing fears of a catastrophic early summer of spiralling unemployment and company bankruptcies.</p> <p>With the government\u2019s \u00a340bn job-retention scheme running until the end of June, business groups and the Labour party are demanding that Sunak extend the scheme as a matter of urgency to give an essential lifeline to the UK economy.</p> <p>Under the scheme \u2013 known as furloughing \u2013 the government covers 80% of the wages of workers who are staying at home and not working at all, up to a cap of \u00a32,500 a month. So far an estimated 140,000 UK companies have opted to furlough a total of around 4 million staff.</p> <p>But large and small employers have warned the Treasury that they will need to notify the government of widescale redundancies over the next fortnight if it fails to give details soon of subsidies it will offer beyond June.</p> <p>Last night The Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA) said that pulling the plug on the furlough subsidy too early, before the lockdown had been lifted substantially, risked a return to unemployment rates not seen since the 1930s.</p> <p>Alan Lockey, head of the RSA\u2019s Future of Work Centre, said: \u201cThere is an estimated 27% of the entire workforce on furlough, with more than 80% of workers in the hospitality sector affected. If those people were made redundant the level of unemployment would rocket to levels not seen since the Great Depression\u201d.</p> <p>Tej Parikh, chief economist at The Institute of Directors, said that the government should try to avoid a cliff-edge moment where support ended suddenly: \u201cGetting the economy running again won\u2019t be like flicking a switch. Even if lockdown measures were completely lifted, many firms wouldn\u2019t expect demand to lift to normal levels immediately.</p> <p>\u201cA sharp removal of the furlough scheme at the end of June could cause significant problems for some businesses, so the government should explore how it could taper off the system in a flexible way.\u201d</p> <p>Writing in today\u2019s <em>Observer</em>, the shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, calls on Sunak to do more. \u201cThousands of businesses face an existential threat, with risks to hundreds of thousands of their workers and the very fabric of our high streets and communities,\u201d he writes.</p> <p>\u201cEssential public health measures must be accompanied by economic help. The government must act urgently with a second wave of support, including, where necessary, an extension of the furlough scheme \u2013 with greater flexibility to enable part-time working \u2013 and it must look again at the gaps in current schemes.\u201d</p> <p>Miliband also says that companies that pay dividends to shareholders should not be eligible for state support. \u201cIf you\u2019re a large multinational and plan to pay dividends to your shareholders while claiming government resources, you clearly don\u2019t need them.

      "bodyText": "The chancellor Rishi Sunak is under intense pressure this weekend to offer a massive \u201csecond wave\u201d of financial support to businesses within weeks amid growing fears of a catastrophic early summer of spiralling unemployment and company bankruptcies. With the government\u2019s \u00a340bn job-retention scheme running until the end of June, business groups and the Labour party are demanding that Sunak extend the scheme as a matter of urgency to give an essential lifeline to the UK economy. Under the scheme \u2013 known as furloughing \u2013 the government covers 80% of the wages of workers who are staying at home and not working at all, up to a cap of \u00a32,500 a month. So far an estimated 140,000 UK companies have opted to furlough a total of around 4 million staff. But large and small employers have warned the Treasury that they will need to notify the government of widescale redundancies over the next fortnight if it fails to give details soon of subsidies it will offer beyond June. Last night The Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA) said that pulling the plug on the furlough subsidy too early, before the lockdown had been lifted substantially, risked a return to unemployment rates not seen since the 1930s. Alan Lockey, head of the RSA\u2019s Future of Work Centre, said: \u201cThere is an estimated 27% of the entire workforce on furlough, with more than 80% of workers in the hospitality sector affected. If those people were made redundant the level of unemployment would rocket to levels not seen since the Great Depression\u201d. Tej Parikh, chief economist at The Institute of Directors, said that the government should try to avoid a cliff-edge moment where support ended suddenly: \u201cGetting the economy running again won\u2019t be like flicking a switch. Even if lockdown measures were completely lifted, many firms wouldn\u2019t expect demand to lift to normal levels immediately. \u201cA sharp removal of the furlough scheme at the end of June could cause significant problems for some businesses, so the government should explore how it could taper off the system in a flexible way.\u201d Writing in today\u2019s Observer, the shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, calls on Sunak to do more. \u201cThousands of businesses face an existential threat, with risks to hundreds of thousands of their workers and the very fabric of our high streets and communities,\u201d he writes. \u201cEssential public health measures must be accompanied by economic help. The government must act urgently with a second wave of support, including, where necessary, an extension of the furlough scheme \u2013 with greater flexibility to enable part-time working \u2013 and it must look again at the gaps in current schemes.\u201d Miliband also says that companies that pay dividends to shareholders should not be eligible for state support. \u201cIf you\u2019re a large multinational and plan to pay dividends to your shareholders while claiming government resources, you clearly don\u2019t need them. Every pound that goes to them is a pound denied to an SME [small or medium-sized enterprise] for whom it can make the difference between survival or going to the wall.\u201d EasyJet paid \u00a3171m in dividends to shareholders last month while negotiating a \u00a3600m loan from the Treasury and the Bank of England\u2019s emergency coronavirus fund. The airline\u2019s founder and biggest shareholder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, received \u00a360m of the dividend payout. Meanwhile Tesco paid a \u00a3635m dividend while accepting a similar-sized tax break from the government\u2019s emergency coronavirus support package. Companies in the hard-hit hospitality sector have put more than 80% of their employees on the furlough scheme, while the average for the private sector is 27%. Treasury sources said last night that the issue of extending the furlough scheme beyond June was under review. It is in talks with business groups to allow companies to claim support for staff returning to work part-time to prevent a \u201ccliff-edge decision\u201d that would otherwise force companies to make a choice between reinstating employees or make them redundant. Make UK, the manufacturers\u2019 trade body, has warned that firms would struggle to bring factories back to full capacity without a more flexible scheme that allowed for part-time working to be subsidised. Government officials are, however, cautious about extending subsidies beyond June following calculations by the Office for Budget Responsibility showing that the cost will exceed \u00a3100bn this year. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research said that the Treasury rescue schemes and extra spending by other departments were likely to send borrowing this year to in excess of \u00a3200bn, pushing the annual spending deficit above 10%. In an open letter to the prime minister, Boris Johnson, the president of the British Chambers of Commerce, Ruby McGregor-Smith said: \u201cBeginning with the chancellor\u2019s budget in March, Her Majesty\u2019s government has acted at speed and scale to deliver cash to firms on the ground through loans, grants and the job retention scheme. Government must ensure these schemes continue to evolve to support a phased restart of the economy, enabling businesses to survive through this crisis and thrive in the future.\u201d Johnson is expected to announce an outline strategy for lifting the lockdown late this weekend.

They denied reports that the two-metre physical distancing rule could soon be relaxed.

The response appears, to Canberra, like an attempt to deflect responsibility, or worse, to shift blame elsewhere.</p> <p>Relations were already deeply damaged, scarred by a succession of antagonisms that the two countries seem to find easy to accumulate, but far harder to shake: the decision of Australia to exclude Huawei from the 5G network rollout; China\u2019s continued incarceration of Australian pro-democracy writer Yang Hengjun; a dispute over the South China Sea; concerns over Chinese influence in Australian business, economics and politics; continuing allegations of espionage.</p> <p>This week, the fracas was focused on the Covid-19 investigation, but that fight carried all the baggage of those gone before, and still being waged. It escalated to a thinly veiled threat from China\u2019s ambassador to Australia, Cheng Jingye, who told a newspaper \u2013 <a href=\"http://au.china-embassy.org/eng/sghdxwfb_1/t1773741.htm\">admittedly under some leading questioning</a> \u2013 that Australia\u2019s push for an inquiry was \u201cdangerous\u201d, politically motivated at the urging of the Trump administration, and would harm Australia\u2019s national interest.</p> <p>\u201cThe Chinese public is frustrated, dismayed and disappointed with what you are doing now \u2026 if the mood is going from bad to worse, people would think why we should go to such a country while it\u2019s not so friendly to China.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/chewing-gum-stuck-on-the-sole-of-our-shoes-the-china-australia-war-of-words-timeline\">'Chewing gum stuck on the sole of our shoes': the China-Australia war of words \u2013 timeline</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe tourists may have second thoughts.

The language of the diplomats and parliamentarians has been anything but diplomatic, and far from parliamentary. The robust conversations usually kept behind closed doors have tumbled into the public square, leaked to broadcasters and splashed in newsprint. Australia and China\u2019s fractious relationship scrapped its way to an unedifying new low this week, with a degenerating dispute emerging, ostensibly, from Australia\u2019s call for an international, independent inquiry into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic that has so far killed more than 230,000 people. But China and Australia view this inquiry \u2013 amorphous though the proposal still is \u2013 as entirely different entities. China sees Australia as frontrunning \u2013 yet again in Beijing\u2019s eyes \u2013 on an issue deliberately constructed to isolate, condemn and humiliate China. It contends the inquiry is a political witch-hunt, engineered by Washington. From Australia\u2019s perspective, the Chinese response appears a dramatic overreaction to an entirely legitimate international concern to understand the origins of the Covid-19 outbreak. The response appears, to Canberra, like an attempt to deflect responsibility, or worse, to shift blame elsewhere. Relations were already deeply damaged, scarred by a succession of antagonisms that the two countries seem to find easy to accumulate, but far harder to shake: the decision of Australia to exclude Huawei from the 5G network rollout; China\u2019s continued incarceration of Australian pro-democracy writer Yang Hengjun; a dispute over the South China Sea; concerns over Chinese influence in Australian business, economics and politics; continuing allegations of espionage. This week, the fracas was focused on the Covid-19 investigation, but that fight carried all the baggage of those gone before, and still being waged. It escalated to a thinly veiled threat from China\u2019s ambassador to Australia, Cheng Jingye, who told a newspaper \u2013 admittedly under some leading questioning \u2013 that Australia\u2019s push for an inquiry was \u201cdangerous\u201d, politically motivated at the urging of the Trump administration, and would harm Australia\u2019s national interest. \u201cThe Chinese public is frustrated, dismayed and disappointed with what you are doing now \u2026 if the mood is going from bad to worse, people would think why we should go to such a country while it\u2019s not so friendly to China. \u201cThe tourists may have second thoughts. Maybe the parents of the students would also think whether this place, which they find is not so friendly, even hostile, is the best place to send their kids to. So it\u2019s up to the public, the people to decide. And also, maybe the ordinary people will think why they should drink Australian wine or eat Australian beef?\u201d The ambassador later said in the interview he hoped there would not be a boycott, and that he was not seeking to \u201cimply\u201d anything through his comments. But the Australian government was swift in its response, condemning what it saw as the threat of \u201ceconomic coercion\u201d through a consumer boycott. And while neither of those terms were used by the ambassador, within the corridors of the Department of Foreign Affairs\u2019 RG Casey Building, the intent of the ambassador\u2019s comments was considered unmistakable: Beijing was seeking to paint Australia as vulnerable because of an economic dependence on China. The foreign minister, Marise Payne, called out the Chinese statement for the threat Australia perceived it as: \u201cWe reject any suggestion that economic coercion is an appropriate response to a call for such an assessment, when what we need is global cooperation.\u201d The spat degenerated further with the leaking of details of a subsequent phone call between Cheng and the Dfat secretary, Frances Adamson: fanned by freelancing commentary from Australian politicians, and thundering denouncements in the CCP mouthpiece the Global Times. But there is important broader context. China feels under extreme pressure to defend its handling of the Covid-19 outbreak \u2013 less its suppression of the virus, albeit using repressive measures far more draconian than any liberal democracy might consider \u2013 but rather against accusations it initially misled the world about the seriousness of the virus, costing the global community precious weeks to prepare its response. China is anxious for the world to read the end of its Covid-19 story: it doesn\u2019t want anyone turning back to the start of the book. Australia is not the only country that has been castigated, condemned and threatened for demanding accountability from Beijing. China has excoriated the US for blaming it for the outbreak, even releasing a bizarre cartoon Lego propaganda video through its Xinhua news agency, called \u201cOnce Upon a Virus\u201d and set to the tune of The Entertainer. China\u2019s ambassador to France, Lu Shaye, has launched a sustained attack on the \u201cmalevolence\u201d of the French media, calling them lapdogs of the US. He said Le Figaro trafficked in \u201clies\u201d and said western politicians excited and legitimised \u201cthe populist, racist and anti-Chinese strands of their countries against China\u201d. Lu wrote that critics of China were \u201cpsychologically fragile\u201d. \u201cSome Westerners are starting to have no confidence in liberal democracy.\u201d The Chinese embassy in the Netherlands called the De Volkskrant newspaper \u201cfull of prejudice, discrimination and malice\u201d. And the Global Times threatened \u201cChina may consider suspending medical supplies to the Netherlands\u201d after it simplified the name of its mission in Taiwan to the Netherlands Office Taipei (dropping the words \u201ctrade and investment\u201d) \u2013 an apparent affront to the one-China principle. It is the case that Australia\u2019s trading relationship with China is hugely significant. China is Australia\u2019s largest two-way trading partner in goods and services, representing more than a quarter of all international trade. Two-way trade reached $235bn in 2018-19, the highest ever amount, up 20% year on year. And it is not inconceivable that particular sectors \u2013 such as food exports like beef, seafood and dairy, collectively worth more than $12bn \u2013 could be exposed if relations deteriorate further. But Australia\u2019s relationship with China is not so one-way that China would escape a boycott unharmed. A 2017 report by the ANU\u2019s national security college, edited by the former diplomat and intelligence analyst Prof Rory Medcalf, argued perceptions of Australia\u2019s dependence on China, and vulnerability to Chinese economic pressure, were exaggerated. \u201cThe nature of our economic relationship means that there are limits to the pressure China can apply without imposing sizeable costs on itself. \u201cPressure that would have the biggest impact on our economy \u2013 such as threatening to restrict the iron ore trade \u2013 would likely be a \u2018one shot\u2019 option for Beijing, doing serious harm to that link thereafter.

Laurenceson said from Beijing\u2019s perspective, Australia leading calls for an international Covid-19 inquiry was another example of the country \u201cfrontrunning\u201d an anti-China agenda, as it was perceived to have done when it was the first country to ban Huawei from its 5G network rollout. \u201cChina has developed an impression that Australia is leading the charge internationally against them.

      "bodyText": "As countries around the world try to figure out the best way to limit the spread of coronavirus, many are considering some form of contact tracing app. But the methods and level of privacy intrusion vary widely. Here\u2019s what we know about how apps are being rolled out in various countries. Australia Last weekend Australia released Covidsafe, an app that collects, via bluetooth, records of other people with the app who have been in close proximity within the past 21 days. Aside from registration data, the information remains on the phone until a user who tests positive to Covid-19 consents to upload it. The data can then be used to trace the contacts of the infected person. The Australian model has attracted criticism because of the amount of data held by the federal government, even though the government has stressed only state health officials will have access to it. More than 3.5 million people downloaded the app in the first five days following its release. Uptake is voluntary, but the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has said \u201cmillions more\u201d will be needed. He said uptake of the app would inform discussions in national cabinet about easing restrictions. Singapore Australia\u2019s app is based on Singapore\u2019s, and the two work largely in the same way. It has had around 20% take up, but since its launch at the start of April, the number of coronavirus cases has gone from just over 1,000 to more than 16,000. The iPhone version of the app had many negative reviews on the app store because it didn\u2019t function when it wasn\u2019t the open app on a user\u2019s screen. Australia made some changes designed to overcome this problem, but the app still needs to be running in the foreground in order to work. New Zealand Australia\u2019s closest neighbour has contained coronavirus better than most parts of the world. As New Zealand begins to come out of its hard lockdown it will launch a contact tracing app, but how it will work is unclear. Radio NZ reports it will update people\u2019s details with the department of health so they can be contacted, but beyond that very little is known at this stage. The report suggests QR codes could be used to allow people into venues and restaurants. China China\u2019s app is much more strict than in many other countries. Not only is it mandatory, and tied to your identification, but it governs where you can go, using QR code scanners and colours to determine whether the person identified is clear (green), amber (needs to isolate) or red (a confirmed case or close contact of a confirmed case). People need the app to travel and gain entry to venues as restrictions have been eased. Associate prof Jie Huang, an international law expert at the University of Sydney, said the app had been successful for China. \u201cThis is typically portrayed in a negative light in Australia,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, undeniably, Chinese digital surveillance by mobile apps has helped China to successfully manage and constrain the Covid-19 pandemic in a short period of time. \u201cConsidering the large population in China and the consequent difficulty in contact tracing, Australia may draw useful perspectives from lessons and insights from the Chinese experience.\u201d India India\u2019s version of the bluetooth app is called Aarogya Setu. The country is further ahead in rolling out its app, and take-up in a month has been around 75 million at last reporting \u2013 still just a fraction of India\u2019s 1.35 billion population. The app is not compulsory except for government workers, but the government is now looking to make it a requirement for new smartphones. Another major hurdle facing the government is that more people in India still use feature phones (such as the old Nokias) on 2G than smartphones (450 million versus 550 million). The Indian IT minister, Ravi Shankar Prasad, said on Twitter the government was working to make something that was compatible for feature phones. United Kingdom The UK is following a similar route to Australia and Singapore and adopting a bluetooth-style contact tracing app in the next few weeks. Unlike the Australian and Singapore model, however, the UK app will allow the public to report their symptoms and order a swab test through the app. United States There is no country-wide effort for a national contact tracing system in place yet. However, two US companies, Google and Apple, have been leading the charge to have their decentralised, bluetooth tracing functionality embedded in many of the world\u2019s apps. Europe Italy, Germany and Austria are all adopting apps that use the Google-Apple functionality, but the European Union has called for strict rules to ensure privacy. Switzerland, not an EU member, is on a similar path. \u201cContact tracing apps to limit the spread of coronavirus can be useful, especially as part of member states\u2019 exit strategies,\u201d said Thierry Breton, the EU commissioner for the internal market. \u201cHowever, strong privacy safeguards are a prerequisite for the uptake of these apps, and therefore their usefulness. \u201cWhile we should be innovative and make the best use of technology in fighting the pandemic, we will not compromise on our values and privacy requirements.\u201d France is reportedly going for a more centralised version, closer to the Australian and Singapore models. There is also a separate push for Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT) to enable EU countries to develop an app that could allow users to cross national borders. Israel Israel initially attempted to do contact tracing by tracking the movements of people with coronavirus by their phone location, but the supreme court ruled it needed legislative backing. Israel also has an opt-in app that records GPS and wifi information and compares it to positive test results to inform people they may need to be tested. South Korea South Korea uses a combination of phone location data, CCTV footage and electronic financial data to track confirmed coronavirus cases, then makes this information public. While South Korea has now reported no new cases, thanks to extensive testing and tracing, concerns have been raised about how much information has been obtained and made public. Justin Fendos, a professor of cell biology at Dongseo University, reported a couple allegedly engaged in an affair were found by people looking at the data. Can results be compared? The main disagreement between proponents of the non-compulsory apps is over whether the data is held by the government, or whether it remains with the users. Richard Buckland, an engineering professor at the University of NSW, said more paternalistic governments like Australia liked to retain that control. \u201cThe centralised approach means the government can make sure it happens, otherwise you have to trust people to act on this information\u201d he said. In the decentralised model, only those who have been close contacts of those who have tested positive know, whereas in the centralised approach, the government can get an idea of who all those people are, even if the information is restricted to health officials engaged in contact tracing. No country can claim the app itself as the reason for any success in slowing the spread of coronavirus, because none has been running long enough, Buckland said. \u201cTo be honest, we might never know,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will either be in world A or world B and we will never be able to compare the data between world A or world B. \u201cIt\u2019ll be very hard to answer questions about how impactful it will be, but clearly it won\u2019t be worse than not having it.\u201d",

What is particularly baffling is patients are presenting with poor oxygenation but little lung damage. This type of presentation is more typical of patients suffering from altitude sickness than a viral infection, Gattignoni says. As a result, patients who are very sick may not feel like they\u2019re really struggling to breathe \u2013 even as they\u2019re being critically deprived of oxygen.</p> <p>\u201cHow is this possible?\u201d Gattinoni told Guardian Australia from the intensive care department of the German hospital where he is working as a guest professor. \u201cBad oxygenation and good lungs tells me this must have something to do with the blood vessels.

So, in some patients, many organs are affected.\u201d</p> <p>The problem is, mechanical ventilation in intensive care replaces the strength of the respiratory muscles.

      "body": "<p>A young film-maker who worked on a music video that mocked Egyptian president Abdel Fatah al-Sisi has died in an Egyptian prison, after he was imprisoned without trial for more than two years.</p> <p>Shady Habash, 24, died inside Cairo\u2019s infamous Tora prison complex, from \u201chealth issues not yet specified,\u201d according to announcements from family and friends.</p> <p>Habash\u2019s detention and death represent a stark reminder of the growing number of young people at risk inside Egypt\u2019s sprawling prison system, including many detained for their work as artists, making dissenting statements against Sisi\u2019s rule or for no charge at all.</p> <p>There is also growing concern over unsanitary and unsafe mass detentions inside Egyptian prisons, reflecting fears about the spread of Covid-19 in places of detention around the world. Prominent activist Alaa Abdel al-Fattah, re-imprisoned last September, recently began a hunger strike in protest at prison conditions. The Egyptian authorities, who <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde12/2152/2020/en/\">suspended</a> prison visits in March due to the coronavirus outbreak, have been criticised for widespread and deadly medical neglect of prisoners, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/17/mohamed-morsi-dead-ousted-president-egypt-collapses-after-court-session\">former president Moham</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/17/mohamed-morsi-dead-ousted-president-egypt-collapses-after-court-session\">ed Morsi</a>, who collapsed and died in court in June 2019.</p> <p>Mai al-Sedany, an expert on the Egyptian legal system with the Washington thinktank the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, said that Habash\u2019s death highlights rising concern around a lack of due process in Egypt. This includes \u201ca rise in prosecution around freedom of expression, continued and near automatic pretrial detention extensions in violation of even Egyptian law, and poor prison conditions that severely harm the well-being of those incarcerated,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The young artist was detained in March 2018, after directing a music video for the exiled Egyptian rock musician Ramy Essam. The video sees Essam, who now lives in Sweden, dancing as he criticises the rule of Egyptian president Sisi, comparing him to a date or \u201cbalaha\u201d, the name of a character in a popular comedy film used against Sisi by his critics. \u201cYou live in gardens and we live in jails,\u201d he sings, \u201cmay the Lord take you we all pray, with all your gang boys in that darkest jail, I hope you rot in such a place.\u201d</p> <p>The video\u2019s release prompted the arrest of eight people, most with little connection to Essam. These included Habash, the poet and lyricist Galal al-Beheiry and Mohamed Abdel-Basset, who was arrested after playing the song on his car stereo in Kuwait and deported back to Egypt. All were accused of joining a terrorist group and spreading false news. Beheiry was <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-egypt-rights/egypt-military-court-sentences-poet-to-prison-for-insulting-army-idUSKBN1KL2KX\">sentenced</a> to three years in prison in July 2018 for publishing false news and insulting the military in a separate military trial.</p> <p>Following the release of five involved in the case, Habash and Mustafa Gamal, who helped Essam verify his Facebook page, remained in prison on pre-trial detention. \u201cHe should have been released after two years,\u201d said a representative from the Cairo-based Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression, who asked not to be named for their own safety. \u201cInstead he was forced to remain in custody with no legal grounds. He died in jail, where he shouldn\u2019t have been in the first place. No artist should be in jail for his work.\u201d</p> <p>Essam <a href=\"https://www.ramyessam.com/post/photographer-director-shady-habash-dies-at-the-age-of-24-in-egyptian-prison?fbclid=IwAR3DkN6i_2odqe6Lni9q_kD-CvW1MgKB7ggGpOwWCWGOvixO8M_Qtc-agIs\">wrote</a> on his website that \u201cShady didn\u2019t have anything to do with the content of the song.\u201d He also published Habash\u2019s last letter from prison, <a href=\"https://www.ramyessam.com/post/photographer-director-shady-habash-dies-at-the-age-of-24-in-egyptian-prison?fbclid=IwAR3DkN6i_2odqe6Lni9q_kD-CvW1MgKB7ggGpOwWCWGOvixO8M_Qtc-agIs\">headed</a>, \u201cPrison doesn\u2019t kill, loneliness does.

      "bodyText": "A young film-maker who worked on a music video that mocked Egyptian president Abdel Fatah al-Sisi has died in an Egyptian prison, after he was imprisoned without trial for more than two years. Shady Habash, 24, died inside Cairo\u2019s infamous Tora prison complex, from \u201chealth issues not yet specified,\u201d according to announcements from family and friends. Habash\u2019s detention and death represent a stark reminder of the growing number of young people at risk inside Egypt\u2019s sprawling prison system, including many detained for their work as artists, making dissenting statements against Sisi\u2019s rule or for no charge at all. There is also growing concern over unsanitary and unsafe mass detentions inside Egyptian prisons, reflecting fears about the spread of Covid-19 in places of detention around the world. Prominent activist Alaa Abdel al-Fattah, re-imprisoned last September, recently began a hunger strike in protest at prison conditions. The Egyptian authorities, who suspended prison visits in March due to the coronavirus outbreak, have been criticised for widespread and deadly medical neglect of prisoners, including former president Mohamed Morsi, who collapsed and died in court in June 2019. Mai al-Sedany, an expert on the Egyptian legal system with the Washington thinktank the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, said that Habash\u2019s death highlights rising concern around a lack of due process in Egypt. This includes \u201ca rise in prosecution around freedom of expression, continued and near automatic pretrial detention extensions in violation of even Egyptian law, and poor prison conditions that severely harm the well-being of those incarcerated,\u201d she said. The young artist was detained in March 2018, after directing a music video for the exiled Egyptian rock musician Ramy Essam. The video sees Essam, who now lives in Sweden, dancing as he criticises the rule of Egyptian president Sisi, comparing him to a date or \u201cbalaha\u201d, the name of a character in a popular comedy film used against Sisi by his critics. \u201cYou live in gardens and we live in jails,\u201d he sings, \u201cmay the Lord take you we all pray, with all your gang boys in that darkest jail, I hope you rot in such a place.\u201d The video\u2019s release prompted the arrest of eight people, most with little connection to Essam. These included Habash, the poet and lyricist Galal al-Beheiry and Mohamed Abdel-Basset, who was arrested after playing the song on his car stereo in Kuwait and deported back to Egypt. All were accused of joining a terrorist group and spreading false news. Beheiry was sentenced to three years in prison in July 2018 for publishing false news and insulting the military in a separate military trial. Following the release of five involved in the case, Habash and Mustafa Gamal, who helped Essam verify his Facebook page, remained in prison on pre-trial detention. \u201cHe should have been released after two years,\u201d said a representative from the Cairo-based Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression, who asked not to be named for their own safety. \u201cInstead he was forced to remain in custody with no legal grounds. He died in jail, where he shouldn\u2019t have been in the first place. No artist should be in jail for his work.\u201d Essam wrote on his website that \u201cShady didn\u2019t have anything to do with the content of the song.\u201d He also published Habash\u2019s last letter from prison, headed, \u201cPrison doesn\u2019t kill, loneliness does. I need your support not to die.\u201d",

Nearly 200 Congress members are more vulnerable to serious complications from a Covid-19 infection because they are 65 and older.

White House blocks Fauci testimony as Trump welcomes Senate return. The administration said it would be \u2018counterproductive\u2019 for senior member of the taskforce to discuss response in House hearing. Protests sweep California as governor promises changes to lockdown. Gavin Newsom said state would announce changes in coming days, but that move was motivated by data, not political resistance. Tara Reade says she didn\u2019t explicitly accuse Biden of assault in report. The former Senate staffer who alleges Joe Biden sexually assaulted her 27 years ago has said she filed a limited report with a congressional personnel office that did not explicitly accuse him of sexual assault or harassment. New York mother dies after raising alarm on hospital neglect. Amber Rose Isaac died less than four days after tweeting that she should write an expos\u00e9 on \u2018dealing with incompetent doctors\u2019. Donald Trump has appeared to confirm that Kim Jong Un is \u201calive and well\u201d after weeks of speculation over the North Korean leader\u2019s health. \u201cI, for one, am glad to see he is back, and well!\u201d Trump wrote, quote-tweeting North Korean state media photos of Kim attending a ribbon cutting ceremony at the Sunchon Phosphatic Fertilizer Factory. The photos appear to document Kim\u2019s first public appearance in more than three weeks. Presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has reiterated his denial of Tara Reade\u2019s allegations in an interview with MSNBC\u2019s Al Sharpton that was recorded on Friday night but aired this afternoon. \u201cIt\u2019s not true,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI\u2019m saying unequivocally, it never happened, period. Believing a woman means taking her claim seriously when she steps forward and then vetting it, looking into it. That\u2019s true in this case as well. Women have a right to be heard and the press should rigorously investigate the claims like these and I\u2019d always uphold those principles. But in the end, in every case, the truth is what matters. And in this case, the truth is these claims are false.\u201d Biden went on to field a number of topics in the wide-ranging interview, including a harsh criticism of the armed protesters in Michigan who gathered inside the state capitol in protest of Democratic governor Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s shutdown orders. \u201cThey\u2019re armed and I\u2019m told one or two of them had Nazi flags or Confederate flags \u2013 I don\u2019t know which it was, I can\u2019t swear to that, I didn\u2019t see it,\u201d Biden said. \u201cSuch an attempt to intimidate is just beyond the pale and the president should be speaking out and say it\u2019s totally inappropriate to \u2026 intimidate a governor who is doing one heck of a job. She\u2019s listening to the scientists, she\u2019s listening to the docs, she\u2019s listening to the experts and that\u2019s her judgment and it should be sustained and not have a bunch of people coming in, in numbers, with loaded weapons sitting in the hallways of the legislative body.\u201d A man in Florida has been arrested after he was discovered quarantining on a shuttered Disney World island, telling authorities it felt like a \u201ctropical paradise.\u201d Richard McGuire, 42, was found by Orange County sheriff\u2019s deputies Disney\u2019s Discovery Island on Thursday, telling authorities that he began camping on the island earlier in the week. \u201cRichard stated that he had made entry to the island to go camping on Monday or Tuesday and had planned on staying on the island for approximately one week,\u201d the police report said. McGuire claimed that he didn\u2019t know the island, once the site of a zoological park before it was closed to the public in 1999, was restricted despite the closed gates and multiple \u201cno trespassing\u201d signs in the vicinity. \u201cRichard stated that he was unaware of that and that it looked like a tropical paradise,\u201d the report stated. Orange County Marine deputies on Bay Lake said they used a public address system to tell McGuire he was not allowed to be on the property after his presence was discovered, but the Alabama native claimed he didn\u2019t hear them because he was asleep in a building. McGuire was arrested on a trespassing charge, banned from all Disney properties and taken to jail without incident. Disney World has been shut down since March due to the coronavirus pandemic. Tara Reade, the former Senate staffer who alleges Joe Biden sexually assaulted her 27 years ago, has disputed today\u2019s Associated Press story in which she was quoted as saying her original report against the Democrats\u2019 presumptive presidential candidate did not accuse him of assault. \u201cThis is false,\u201d she said on Twitter, referencing the AP story pushing several hours earlier. Reade had spoken with the wire service after it had discovered transcripts and notes from interviews with the former Biden staffer last year in which she said she \u201cchickened out\u201d after going to the Senate personnel office. \u201cI remember talking about him wanting me to serve drinks because he liked my legs and thought I was pretty and it made me uncomfortable,\u201d Reade said. \u201cI know that I was too scared to write about the sexual assault.\u201d Reade did not specify which elements of the AP story were incorrect beyond her three-word tweet, though she did follow up shortly after with another brief statement. \u201cNo survivor be fearful to come forward,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cAnd I did file a complaint.\u201d As Florida\u2019s leaders move to reopen beaches, restaurants and retail stores as part of the governor Ron DeSantis\u2019s phase one, the state\u2019s department of health confirmed 735 new cases of Covid-19 on Saturday morning, bringing the overall total of confirmed cases to more than 35,000. The Miami Herald reports: Saturday\u2019s daily total of 35,463 brings the number of newly confirmed cases back under 1,000, which had been a weeklong trend until Friday\u2019s report topped out at 1,038. There were also 50 new deaths announced, bringing the statewide death toll to 1,364 \u2014 a bump of four more than the health department had reported on Friday morning. Of those latest deaths, 18 were in South Florida. Nine more people died in Miami-Dade, bringing the county\u2019s death toll to 367, the highest in the state. Five more people died in Broward, raising the county\u2019s death toll to 204. Palm Beach County reported four new deaths, bringing the county\u2019s count to 195. Monroe had held steady at three deaths in the Florida Keys. The number of deaths being reported by the state Department of Health may be incomplete. The list of coronavirus deaths being compiled by Florida\u2019s medical examiners has shown the death count was up to 10 percent higher than what the Florida Department of Health has released. In addition to the 18 new deaths in South Florida\u2019s tri-county area, the other 32 people who tested positive and died from Covid-19 were in Charlotte, Clay, Escambia, Flagler, Manatee, Nassau, Orange, Pinellas, St. Lucie, Suwannee and Volusia counties. Of the statewide total of Covid-19 confirmed cases, 34,555 are Florida residents \u2014 a rise of 726 since Friday \u2014 and 908 are non-residents who were diagnosed or isolated in the state. That\u2019s nine more non-residents in the count since Friday. The question of when to reopen schools has been widely discussed over the last few weeks. The closing of schools has not only disrupted education but has also added strain on parents who must look after children who would usually be in a classroom. While fatality rates from Covid-19 are significantly lower among children than adults, Austin Beutner, the superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District, told CNN on Saturday that it is not just students who would be taken into consideration. \u201cOne school with 500 individuals [is] connected to a quarter million people,\u201d Beutner told CNN. \u201cWe don\u2019t want the quarter million people bringing the virus into the school and the school to spread and be a petri dish to share with the rest of the community.\u201d California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, has discussed reopening the state\u2019s schools in July or August. But Beutner said such a move would be complicated. \u201cIt\u2019s not just as simple as spreading the desks apart,\u201d he said. There has been beautiful spring weather across much of the east coast today and the US Navy Blue Angels and US Air Force Thunderbirds completed a flypast over several cities - including Atlanta, Baltimore and Washington DC \u2013 in tribute to healthcare workers during the Covid-19 pandemic. Drivers stopped on a freeway in Atlanta to observe the flypast but there were concerns that crowds, already boosted by the good weather, could help the spread of Covid-19. In DC, people flocked to the National Mall to watch the planes overhead. The former Senate staffer who claims Joe Biden sexually assaulted her in 1993 says the original complaint against the Democrats\u2019 presumptive presidential candidate did not accuse him of assault. \u201cI remember talking about him wanting me to serve drinks because he liked my legs and thought I was pretty and it made me uncomfortable,\u201d Reade told the Associated Press. \u201cI know that I was too scared to write about the sexual assault.\u201d She added: \u201cThe main word I use \u2013 and I know I didn\u2019t use sexual harassment\u2013 I used \u2018uncomfortable.\u2019 And I remember \u2018retaliation.\u2019\u201d The distinction is important because if the original report resurfaces it will not reflect her current allegation, that the former US vice-president sexually assaulted her. Reade says that in 1993 Biden pushed her against a wall and assaulted her, penetrating her with his fingers. Three people close to Reade have said she mentioned the incident to them in the past. Last year, Reade and seven other women publicly accused Biden of gestures that made them uncomfortable. Reade did not then mention the alleged assault. On Friday, in a Medium post, Biden said the claims \u201caren\u2019t true. This never happened.\u201d He also spoke to MSNBC, and appealed to the National Archives to find the complaint Reade mentioned. The Archives said it wouldn\u2019t have the report, which it said would rest with the Senate. The Trump campaign accused Democrats of a \u201cdouble standard\u201d, comparing their defence of Biden with their approach to a sexual assault claim against Trump supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in late 2018. Trump has faced multiple claims of sexual misconduct and assault. At a White House briefing on Friday, new press secretary Kayleigh McEnany sought to portray the claims, which the president denies, as old news. Joe Biden has waded into the dispute between the US women\u2019s national soccer team and the US Soccer federation. On Friday, US district judge R Gary Klausne threw out the players\u2019 unequal pay claim against US soccer\u2019s governing body. \u201cDon\u2019t give up this fight,\u201d Biden wrote on Twitter on Saturday. \u201cThis is not over yet.\u201d The presumptive Democratic candidate for president then turned his attention to US Soccer. \u201cTo @USSoccer: equal pay, now,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOr else when I\u2019m president, you can go elsewhere for World Cup funding.\u201d In March 2019, 28 members of the USWNT filed a lawsuit in California seeking equal pay and treatment, in addition to damages of $66m including back pay. The group, which included some of the best players in the world such as Megan Rapinoe, Alex Morgan and Carli Lloyd, also sought compensation for any player who has appeared for the US since February 2015. \u201cWe are shocked and disappointed with today\u2019s decision, but we will not give up our hard work for equal pay,\u201d Molly Levinson, spokeswoman for the women\u2019s players, said on Friday after the decision. \u201cWe are confident in our case and steadfast in our commitment to ensuring that girls and women who play this sport will not be valued as lesser just because of their gender.\u201d Klausne said the USWNT players had rejected a chance to be paid under the same terms as their male counterparts. \u201cThe history of negotiations between the parties demonstrates that the WNT rejected an offer to be paid under the same pay-to-play structure as the MNT, and the WNT was willing to forgo higher bonuses for benefits, such as greater base compensation and the guarantee of a higher number of contracted players,\u201d Klausner wrote. The judge did, however, allow allegations that the USWNT were subject to discriminatory working conditions, and those claims will now go to trial in federal court next month. Klausner left intact allegations the USWNT players received inferior travel, accommodation and medical treatment compared to the men. The US won the Women\u2019s World Cup last summer, retaining the title they captured in 2015. The US men\u2019s team, who have supported the USWNT lawsuit, failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup. CNN has revealed that Michael Caputo, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services and a staunch ally of Donald Trump sent multiple sexist and derogatory tweets over the last few years. He has since deleted them. Caputo, who worked on Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and is now central to the government\u2019s messaging on Covid-19, called multiple women \u201cdogface\u201d and told another one to \u201cgo f**k yourself\u201d. He called Alexandra Chalupa, a Democratic consultant, a \u201ccrone\u201d and a \u201cnutty hag\u201d. Caputo responded to CNN\u2019s investigation by telling the broadcaster: \u201cI stopped caring about what handwringing, virtue signaling leftists think of me after their 59th death threat against my family. Have fun with this while I\u2019m fighting a deadly pandemic 24/7.\u201d Trump did not address the CNN story directly but did respond to a tweet from Caputo on Friday calling the president \u201ca fearless man\u201d. Trump wrote on Saturday: \u201cThank you Michael. You also!\u201d A Fox News reporter, John Roberts, has tweeted that a senior intelligence source tells him Covid-19 was created in a Wuhan lab. The tweet lends support to a theory long put forth by Donald Trump, although the US president has repeatedly declined to provide details to back up his assertion. In a follow-up tweet, Roberts said: \u201cSources say not all 17 intelligence agencies agree that the lab was the source of the virus because there is not yet a definitive \u201csmoking gun\u201d. But confidence is high among 70-75% of the agencies.\u201d On Thursday, a rare on-the-record statement from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence stated no such assessment has been made and continues to \u201crigorously examine\u201d whether the outbreak \u201cbegan through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan\u201d. The organization that runs the Auschwitz memorial has condemned the appearance at an anti-lockdown rally in Chicago\u2019s Loop district of a picket sign bearing a Nazi slogan displayed above the entrance of the concentration camp. A demonstrator attending the rally, where hundreds of people protested against the state\u2019s lockdown and social distancing measures, was photographed carrying a sign bearing the words \u201cArbeit macht frei, JB\u201d. The German phrase translates as \u201cwork sets you free\u201d, with JB referring to the Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, who is of Jewish descent. The font of both instances of the letter \u201cB\u201d on the picket sign bore a striking resemblance to the shape of the letter \u201cB\u201d on the sign above the gates of Auschwitz, the largest of the German Nazi concentration camps and extermination centers, where more than 1.1 million men, women and children were murdered. The official Auschwitz memorial Twitter account condemned the gesture, writing: \u201c\u2018Arbeit macht frei\u2019 was a false, cynical illusion the SS gave to prisoners of Auschwitz. Those words became one of the icons of human hatred. It\u2019s painful to see this symbol instrumentalised and used again to spread hate. It\u2019s a symptom of moral and intellectual degeneration.\u201d The New York Police Department has dispatched 1,000 officers this weekend to enforce social distancing amid warmer weather. The Associated Press reports: Officers set out on foot, bicycles and cars to break up crowds and remind those enjoying the weather of public health restrictions requiring they keep 6 feet away from others. \u201cI believe with the warm weather people will come outside,\u201d Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Saturday. \u201cYou can\u2019t stay indoors all the time. People will come outside and that\u2019s great, go for a walk. But respect the social distancing and wear a mask.\u201d The New York City Police Department has made 60 arrests and issued 343 summonses related to social distancing since March 16. Police Commissioner Dermot Shea issued a stern warning after a series of clashes this week between police officers and members of Orthodox Jewish communities over social distancing. \u201cWe will not tolerate it,\u201d Shea said after community members flooded the streets for funeral processions. \u201cYou are putting my cops\u2019 lives at risk and it\u2019s unacceptable.\u201d Enforcement has its limitations when it comes to social distancing, police concede, leaving it up to New Yorkers to play by the rules to help keep infections on the downturn. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get voluntary compliance,\u201d Benjamin Tucker, NYPD\u2019s first deputy commissioner,\u201d said last month. Most people are heeding officers\u2019 warnings to keep their distance in parks and around essential businesses like grocery stores, Shea said. But a stark example of non-compliance came Thursday when officers interrupted a crowded funeral procession in Brooklyn\u2019s Borough Park neighborhood. Video posted to social media showed officers in protective masks chasing a minivan and shouting at dozens of people marching behind the van to get out of the street and onto the sidewalk. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said there are about 900 new infections per day in the state\u2019s hospitals. \u201cThat is unacceptable,\u201d he said at a press conference this morning. Cuomo also released the results of antibody testing of 15,000 New Yorkers which showed a disproportionate number of people testing positive in New York City borough, the Bronx. The Bronx is the city\u2019s poorest borough. Despite the multitudes of unknowns about Covid-19 infections, the findings further demonstrate the disproportionate impact the outbreak is having on low-income people and people of color. Cuomo said health officials are still trying to figure out how and why that is happening. The aim is to identify where new cases are coming from so the state has asked hospitals to figure out where people with new cases work, how they are traveling around and what communities they are in. \u201cTransit workers have been very much at the frontline,\u201d Cuomo said. He noted the high infection rate among transit workers and said the state would direct more resources and testing to transit bodies. The state announced this week that New York City\u2019s 24-hour subway system would take the unprecedented step of closing from 1am to 5am for deep cleaning. Cuomo said at some point in the next few days, officials would launch a website to help people who usually take the train at those times to find alternatives, such as the bus. In California, officials said 32 people were arrested Friday during a volatile protest at the state capitol, in which hundreds of demonstrators protested against the state\u2019s stay-at-home order. Most of the people arrested were cited and released, the Sacramento Bee reported. The Sacramento protesters did not have a permit to hold a rally on the Capitol grounds and were told multiple times to disperse as the crowd grew to at least 500 people, a California Highway Patrol (CHP) spokesman said in a statement late on Friday. \u201cThe majority of the demonstrators were not wearing face masks or physically distancing and at one point a group of them locked hands,\u201d the CHP said in a press release. Officers warned the protesters multiple times that they would be arrested if they did not leave, and that \u201ctheir demonstration posed a health hazard,\u201d the CHP said in a statement. \u201cNo use of force was used on the demonstrators,\u201d and the majority of people arrested \u201coffered no physical resistance,\u201d CHP said. In Huntington Beach, where nearly 3,000 people protested along the beach, there were \u201cno arrests or citations,\u201d the local police chief told The O.C. Register. Vermont senator Bernie Sanders and Washington representative Pramila Jayapal said the Covid-19 outbreak is further exposing the flaws in the US health insurance system and called for radical change in an opinion piece for the Guardian. The US spends more than twice the average of other major countries on healthcare, but its ties to employment mean people avoid going to the doctor because of the cost and declare bankruptcy because of the bills, they wrote. Price-gouging and profiteering has affected everything from hand sanitizer to respirator prices which, in some cases, have more than quintupled \u2013 virtually overnight. Cities, states and hospitals continue to fight over scarce gloves, gowns, masks and ventilators. Four out of five frontline nurses don\u2019t have enough protective equipment. In the richest country in the history of the world, nurses caring for coronavirus patients have resorted to wearing trash bags as makeshift protective gear. That is an international embarrassment. The current crisis has also exposed, to a horrific degree, how the massive level of income and wealth inequality in America magnifies healthcare inequities, and financially ravages our most vulnerable people. Rural hospitals and community health clinics, which often treat the poor, are on the verge of going bankrupt and shutting down. Major outbreaks are attacking our Black, Hispanic, Native American and undocumented communities, as well as the incarcerated and the homeless. Late Friday, the White House moved to replace a Health department official who warned of supply shortages and testing delays at hospitals, according to the New York Times. Donald Trump criticized the official, Christi Grimm, at a press briefing three weeks ago in response to a government report she authored which warned of critical shortages of supplies. Inspector generals perform an oversight role in federal departments, working as internal watchdogs to investigate and report on issues within. In response to Grimm\u2019s findings, which included warnings about a lack of protective gear for hospital workers and hospitals\u2019 issues in obtaining test kits, Trump said the report was \u201cwrong\u201d on April 6. \u201cDid I hear the word \u2018inspector general\u2019? Really? It\u2019s wrong. And they\u2019ll talk to you about it. It\u2019s wrong,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhere did he come from, the inspector general? What\u2019s his name? No, what\u2019s his name? What\u2019s his name?\u201d Trump also attacked Grimm on Twitter, highlighting her work in the Obama administration though she also served under George W Bush and Bill Clinton. The White House announced Friday night that it had nominated a new inspector general for the department who would replace Grimm. She would be the fourth government watchdog to be pushed out of their role by the Trump administration in recent weeks. Donald Trump disputed warnings from the US Capitol physician and said it is safe for the Senate to return to the Washington DC building next week in a tweet which, as usual, needs a bit of explanation. \u201cThere is tremendous CoronaVirus testing capacity in Washington for the Senators returning to Capital Hill on Monday.\u201d The New York Times reported yesterday that the office for the doctor for Congress, Brian Monahan, told Republicans they will not be able to screen all 100 Senators on Monday. \u201cLikewise the House, which should return but isn\u2019t because of Crazy Nancy P.\u201d House speaker, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, said House members should not return to the US Capitol next week in response to guidance from Dr Monahan. Nearly 200 Congress members are more vulnerable to serious complications from a Covid-19 infection because they are 65 and older. It is unknown how many are also at-risk because of underlying conditions or who live with people who are at greater risk if they contract the illness. \u201cThe 5 minute Abbott Test will be used.\u201d The New York Times also reported that Trump and other members of the White House have access to a rapid-testing kit developed by Abbott Laboratories which provides results in five-minutes. Monahan\u2019s office said the testing kits they have access to don\u2019t provide results for two days. \u201cPlease inform Dr. Brian P. Monahan.\u201d This suggests Trump has access to different information than the US Capitol physician. It also suggests that Trump can only contact Dr Monahan through social media, though that seems highly unlikely. \u201c@MarkMeadows\u201d Meadows is the White House chief of staff. I guess Trump wants him to see this Tweet. Notably omitted from the post is Mitch McConnell, the senator majority leader who is requiring senators, staff and US Capitol employees to return to the building on Monday despite the attending Dr Monhan\u2019s recommendations. McConnell\u2019s desire to return to the Capitol is in part because of his focus on pushing conservative judicial nominees through the Republican-majority Senate. \u201cMy motto for the rest of the year is leave no vacancy behind,\u201d he said in late March. The White House said it would be \u201ccounterproductive\u201d for Dr Anthony Fauci to testify before Congress next week and is blocking him from speaking about the government\u2019s response to the pandemic ina House committee hearing. Fauci, who has worked at the National Institute of Health since 1968, has been a source of measured, expert analysis on the Covid-19 outbreak in press briefings and interviews. This has put him at odds with the president, who has downplayed the pandemic and disputed facts about the crisis. Fauci and Trump\u2019s disparate responses have left many concerned the president would silence Fauci, or push him out of the response team entirely. In April, Trump retweeted a post calling for Fauci to be fired but has denied that he was considering firing him. \u201cWhile the Trump Administration continues its whole-of-government response to COVID-19, including safely opening up America again and expediting vaccine development, it is counterproductive to have the very individuals involved in those efforts appearing at congressional hearings,\u201d said White House spokesman Judd Deere. \u201cWe are committed to working with Congress to offer testimony at the appropriate time.\u201d An unnamed senior administration official told the Washington Post that this was \u201cnot muzzling\u201d because because Fauci is expected at a Senate hearing about testing the following week. At the House committee hearing next week, speakers instead will include the former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Thomas Frieden and possibly others. There\u2019s no other way to put this: Alex Jones is thinking about eating his neighbours. In a bizarre video, the InfoWars host, conspiracy theorist and supporter and interviewer of Donald Trump told followers the coronavirus pandemic and resultant lockdown has him planning for societal breakdown, which in his case will involve killing his neighbours in order to feed his children. I won\u2019t quote him or link to the video, which of course can be easily found, but in the words of the Huffington Post, \u201cAlthough Jones\u2019 admission could make neighborhood watch meetings awkward, he said he plans on gobbling \u2018globalists\u2019 who imposed the lockdowns first.\u201d It is what it is and of course it duly went viral. It\u2019s worth noting, in the meanwhile, that Jones said his infamous comments about the Sandy Hook school shooting \u2013 he said it was a hoax, parents of murdered first-graders sued \u2013 were caused by \u201cpsychosis\u201d. Here\u2019s Jason Wilson of this parish, an expert on the murky circles in which Jones swims, with more on the American far (out) right in the time of coronavirus: The Associated Press has more from Michigan, a hard-hit state (42,000 cases and nearly 4,000 deaths according to Johns Hopkins) which has also been hit hard by protests against Democratic governor Gretchen Whitmer, demanding she end her stay-at home order. On Thursday, some protesters at the statehouse in Lansing were armed with \u201clong guns\u201d, frightening lawmakers. On Friday, Donald Trump said the protesters were \u201cgood people\u201d with whom the governor should \u201cmake a deal\u201d. The president has targeted Whitmer with criticism before, in part because she is thought to be on Joe Biden\u2019s short list for a running mate in November\u2019s presidential election. Here\u2019s the AP: Governor Gretchen Whitmer said on Friday Michigan\u2019s stay-at-home order remains in effect through 15 May despite Republicans\u2019 refusal to extend her underlying coronavirus emergency declaration, as she amended it to allow construction, real estate and more outdoor work to resume in person next week. The Democratic governor, who may be sued by the GOP-led Legislature, addressed reporters the same day President Donald Trump tweeted she should \u201cmake a deal\u201d with conservatives who protested her restrictions at the Capitol a day earlier. She denounced the protest as \u201cdisturbing,\u201d noting there were swastikas, Confederate flags, nooses and some people with assault weapons who \u201cdo not represent who we are as Michiganders\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re not in a political crisis where we should just negotiate and find some common ground here. We\u2019re in a public health crisis,\u201d Whitmer said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the midst of a global pandemic that has already killed almost 4,000 people in our state.\u201d Whitmer said she will continue listening to epidemiologists, public health experts and business leaders, \u201cnot to pollsters and not to people with political agendas.\u201d \u2026 Whitmer last week let some businesses like plant nurseries and bike repair shops reopen, as well as stores selling nonessential supplies for curbside pickup or delivery. On Friday, she allowed work that is traditionally and primarily done outdoors \u2013 forestry workers, power equipment technicians, parking enforcers \u2013 to resume next Thursday. Construction workers, real estate agents, appraisers, brokers, inspectors and surveyors also will be able to work in person. So will manufacturing workers who make items like partitions, cubicles and furniture that will help businesses modify their workplaces amid the pandemic. \u2026Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, a Republican who had encouraged people to protest, said many did so safely and responsibly. But he said several others are a \u201cbunch of jackasses\u201d who used intimidation and threats. \u201cI condemn their behavior and denounce their tactics,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir actions hurt their cause and steal from the rights of others by creating an environment where responsible citizens do not feel safe enough to express themselves.\u201d There is currently no White House briefing \u2013 presidential, coronavirus task force or straight press \u2013 on the schedule for today. That of course can change. In the meantime, here\u2019s what Washington bureau chief David Smith made of Kayleigh McEnany\u2019s debut behind the podium (or lectern, Twitter pedants) in the James S Brady Press Briefing Room on Friday: Associated Press reporter Jill Colvin had a question: \u201cWill you pledge to never lie to us from that podium?\u201d Without missing a beat, McEnany replied: \u201cI will never lie to you. You have my word on that.\u201d Expect to hear replays of that line before this presidency is done. Even on what proved an assured debut, McEnany skated close to peddling dodgy information about Trump\u2019s responses to the coronavirus pandemic (\u201cThis president has always sided on the side of data\u201d) and to allegations of sexual misconduct (\u201cHe has always told the truth\u201d). But the good news for the White House is that McEnany, 32, benefits by comparison with the desperately low standards of both her boss and her predecessors. David also noted that McEnany \u201cechoed Trump\u2019s accusation that the World Health Organization \u2018praised China\u2019s leadership on the 22nd and 23rd\u2019 of January, without mentioning that on 22 January Trump tweeted \u2018Terrific working with President Xi\u2019 and on 24 January wrote: \u2018China has been working very hard to contain the coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well.\u2019\u201d The whole piece, from Sean Spicer and Kellyanne Conway\u2019s \u201calternative facts\u201d to the elusive Stephanie Grisham and beyond, is here: \u2026and welcome to another day of coverage of the coronavirus outbreak in the US, and of course the politics around it. First the figures, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland: US cases: 1,103,615 US deaths: 65,063 New York cases: 308,314 New York deaths: 24,039 New York is the hottest hot spot for Covid-19 \u2013 other states are badly and in some cases increasingly affected, despite gathering attempts to re-open shuttered economies. There have been protests demanding faster re-opening, some protesters have been armed, and the president has expressed his support. We\u2019ve plenty of Guardian reporting to get you going today: on the nursing home in New York (not too far from where I am, as it happens, at the top of Manhattan) where nearly 100 people have died; from California, where Governor Gavin Newsom is moving towards reopening; and from southern bureau chief Oliver Laughland in New Orleans, with Amanda Holpuch in New York, on how meat plant workers have been treated on the front line of US food supply. In short, not well: In Washington on Friday, Donald Trump did not hold a briefing but his new press secretary \u2013 his fourth \u2013 did. Judged by the standards of her predecessors \u2013 by Washington bureau chief David Smith, who was there for Sean Spicer, Sarah Sanders and Stephanie Grisham, although the last named didn\u2019t actually hold any briefings \u2013 Kayleigh McEnany made an assured debut. She may, however, come to regret her promise from the podium (or lectern) not ever to lie. Not least because as she attacked China and the World Health Organization, defended Michael Flynn and dismissed questions about allegations of sexual misconduct against Trump, she flirted, as British hacks of a certain vintage might put it, with being a tad economical with the actualit\u00e9. Here\u2019s our world affairs editor, Julian Borger, with a fact check on the WHO side of it: More to come, obviously.",
