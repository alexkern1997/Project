      "bodyText": "A 46,000-year-old Aboriginal heritage site destroyed by Rio Tinto this month is one of more than 463 sites that mining companies operating in Western Australia have applied for permission to destroy or disturb since 2010. None of those applications have been refused. And under the state\u2019s 48-year-old Aboriginal heritage laws, only the land- or leaseholder has the right to appeal \u2013 traditional owners do not. The figures show that the shocking destruction of the sites in the Juukan Gorge in the western Pilbara was not unique. The conflict between mining companies and Aboriginal heritage, particularly in mineral-rich areas such as the iron ore-rich Hamersley range of the Pilbara, has spawned a system of suffocating bureaucracy and lopsided agreement-making that privileges development over protecting sacred spaces and leaves traditional owners with no legislative power, and very little institutional power, to fight back. The Juukan one and two sites are listed on WA\u2019s Aboriginal heritage register as Brock-20 and Brock-21. They sit a short distance apart in Juukan Gorge, about 60km from the mining town of Tom Price, on the edge of the multibillion-dollar Brockman 4 iron ore mine. Juukan two is one of the only sites on the Pilbara to show continual human occupation through the last ice age, and archeological records, including bone pits that catalogued changing fauna, dated back 46,000 years. The sites were drilled and set with explosives last week. Traditional owners the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) peoples don\u2019t yet know the full extent of the damage. The operation had been discussed at meetings with Rio Tinto over a number of years, but Burchell Hayes, one of the directors of the PKKP Aboriginal Corporation, says those meetings often conveyed technical information which PKKP elders found hard to interpret. He says the \u201cblunt details\u201d that would have helped them understand exactly what was being proposed, and when, was lacking. \u201cThe sadness and the loss of our country has been very distressing,\u201d Hayes said. Rio Tinto says the \u201cmining activity\u201d conducted this month was \u201cundertaken in accordance with all necessary approvals\u201d, which had been obtained following a decade of \u201cdetailed consultation\u201d with the PKKP. \u201cWe are sorry that the recently expressed concerns of the PKKP did not arise through the engagements that have taken place over many years under the agreement that governs our operations on their country,\u201d a company statement says. The PKKP Aboriginal Corporation rejected that statement on Saturday, saying they had told Rio Tinto of the importance of the site on a number of occasions since 2013, the last as recently as March. Hayes said the mining company did not advise the PKKP of its intention to blast, and they only found out \u201cby default\u201d on 15 May \u201cwhen we sought access to the area for Naidoc Week in July\u201d. On a site visit in October 2019, Hayes said, their cultural and heritage manager, Dr Heather Builth, told a senior manager from the mine that the rock shelters were significant. \u201c[He] advised Dr Builth that there were no plans to extend the mine and Rio Tinto had been monitoring Juukan Gorge for vibration effects of local blasting,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cAt all times the PKKPAC has been direct and explicit in the archaeological and ethnographic significance of these rock shelters and the importance that they be preserved. For Rio Tinto to suggest otherwise is incorrect. \u201cWe believe Rio Tinto\u2019s outrageous statement is a bid to minimise the adverse public reaction and community outrage about Sunday\u2019s blast at Juukan Gorge; and the distress and upset caused to the Puutu Kunti Kurrama people.\u201d The WA Aboriginal affairs minister, Ben Wyatt, says he is normally \u201ccontacted pretty rapidly by the relevant Aboriginal organisation\u201d when a heritage site is under imminent threat, but was not called in this case. \u201cThe first I heard about this was after the explosion,\u201d Wyatt told reporters in Perth. The federal Indigenous affairs minister, Ken Wyatt, says he received an 11th hour call from lawyers for the PKKP advising him of the risk and asking for advice, and that he advised them to seek an injunction under federal heritage legislation. He did not take it further or intervene, but said in a statement after the blast that the \u201cdestruction should not have occurred\u201d. Even if Ben Wyatt had known, there are no legal levers under the current legislation that allow for ministerial intervention. Wyatt has promised to reform the laws but consultation on that reform has been slow and was put off again last month due to the coronavirus. It is now highly unlikely the WA government will have those new laws drafted and through parliament before the state election next March. Robin Chapple, a Greens MP who campaigned alongside Wyatt to reform the legislation when Labor was in opposition, says Wyatt has \u201cfound himself to be incredibly compromised\u201d by the conflicting responsibilities of protecting Aboriginal heritage, as Aboriginal affairs minister, and supporting its most significant industry as the state\u2019s treasurer. \u201cYou cannot have one person who is pushing the state in the pursuit of mining \u2026 being the same person that has to represent the interests of Aboriginal people to protect the excesses of the mining industry from destroying their sites,\u201d Chapple says. In response, Wyatt says he acts \u201cin the interests of all Western Australians when carrying out my ministerial responsibilities\u201d and that his dual portfolios \u201conly elevates the significance of Aboriginal affairs within this government\u201d. How did this happen? Negotiations over the protection of Juukan Gorge began in 2003. In 2005, Hamersley Iron, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rio Tinto, applied for environmental approval to build a new iron ore mine dubbed Brockman 4. Documents submitted as part of that assessment process said it had found 27 archaeological sites within the project area: mostly rock shelters with some artefact scatters, water sources and scarred trees. It said that identified Aboriginal heritage sites \u201cmay need to be either disturbed or actively managed\u201d for the mine to proceed but that \u201cit is not anticipated that the project will adversely impact on any areas of ethnographic significance\u201d. In 2008, the archaeologist Dr Michael Slack was engaged to conduct a test dig in the large rock shelter known as Juukan two, and concluded it was a \u201cquite significant\u201d site that was about 20,000 years old. In 2013, Rio Tinto applied for and was granted ministerial consent under section 18 of the Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972 to destroy Juukan one and two, as part of the expansion of its proposed Brockman 4 mine, which had become operational three years earlier. The minister who provided that consent was Peter Collier, a member of the Barnett Liberal government that was in power at the time. But it\u2019s unlikely he knew the details of what he signed off on, Chapple says. All applications are assessed by the Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Committee, which then provides a recommendation with scant detail to the minister. There is no legislated requirement for the ACHC to consult traditional owners. In 2015, the committee was chastised by the supreme court for using an invalid definition of sacred sites that explicitly excluded sites that were part of songlines. In 2014, after permission to destroy the site had been granted, a salvage mission dated the Juukan two site at 46,000 years old and of very high archaeological and cultural significance. One year later the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura were granted native title over the area, and a 10,888sq km patch of the Hamersley range. That gave them the right to negotiate over any new developments, and to make financial agreements with mining companies profiting from their land. But it did not confer any legal ability to protect heritage sites, unless negotiated as part of a land use agreement. Those land use agreements are designed to foster closer relationships between industry and Aboriginal peoples, like the relationship that Rio says it has with the PKKP. The relationship is both financial and institutional, and can make it difficult to take a disagreement over a matter like the protection of a heritage site into a public arena. But because of the lack of power granted to traditional owners under the WA Aboriginal Heritage Act, a public fight is the only mechanism left to traditional owners to defend heritage if negotiation fails. Chapple says the financial ties between traditional owner corporations and the mining companies that threaten their heritage are well known, but rarely discussed. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s particularly corrupt, I just think we need to know that there are relationships that can be used to the benefit of the mining companies,\u201d Chapple says. \u201cYou get this in small communities, and Western Australia is a small community.\u201d An antiquated law The Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972 has been relatively unchanged for almost 50 years and does not give traditional owners any formal right of consultation or appeal. In his second reading speech in April 1972, the then minister for community welfare, Bill Willessee, said the legislation had been drafted because \u201cthe preservation of sites and objects of Aboriginal origin is now recognised throughout Australia as an important aspect of providing Aboriginal citizens with the social environment that they need when they still retain partly or wholly their traditional beliefs\u201d. This speech proved more enlightened than the resulting legislation, says Greg McIntyre SC, a leading expert on Aboriginal heritage cases. He says that had the legislation included a strong emphasis on spiritual value as a basis for heritage protection, he would be \u201creasonably happy\u201d. \u201cThe problem is that the legislation doesn\u2019t even do that,\u201d he says. Under the current legislation, McIntyre says, the only legal option for traditional owners who oppose a decision allowing the destruction of their heritage lies in administrative law, an argument that due process has not been followed. That does not in itself halt a development, but it does cause delays. \u201cAdministrative relief is like guerrilla warfare in that you hope it will slow people down and they will be forced to rethink it, but it doesn\u2019t really get to the key issues of whether it\u2019s affecting Aboriginal heritage or the environment,\u201d McIntyre says. Even if the act is reformed, McIntyre says, the economic importance of the mining industry made it likely that the focus would remain on finding a compromise between heritage and industry. \u201cThe best legislation I think we\u2019re likely to get is legislation that has a heavy emphasis on involving Aboriginal people in the decision making, but with the understanding that ultimately they will be expected at best to go into partnership with those that wish to extract minerals rather than prevent that from happening,\u201d he says. This article was amended on 4 June 2020 to correct the date the PKKP Aboriginal Corporation found out about the plan to blast the site, and the date of the site visit in which Rio Tinto was informed of its significance.",

      "body": "<p>On 20 April, Lucy left her house in a small market town in Buckinghamshire and walked through winding country lanes to a quiet field. There, her friend Owen was waiting with a joint already rolled. The weather was balmy; barely a cloud in sight. The pair smoked and caught up on school gossip, before Lucy judged that she should probably head home \u2013 any longer, and her parents might become suspicious.</p> <p>When she got back, she chatted to her family, before heading upstairs to her bedroom, her mother none the wiser. Lucy, who is 17, wasn\u2019t going to let the coronavirus pandemic stop her marking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/20/420-marijuana-hallmark-holiday\" title=\"\">4/20</a>, the international day of cannabis celebration.</p> <p>\u201cI do feel guilty about it,\u201d Lucy tells me, whispering (she does not want her parents to know about her weed-smoking). \u201cI have cut back on it the last week or so.\u201d Because she wanted to observe the lockdown rules? \u201cWell, mostly because the weather hasn\u2019t been great.\u201d</p> <p>When social distancing measures were announced in March, thousands of students had to quickly throw their possessions into suitcases, bid goodbye to university friends, and return to their childhood bedrooms. Teenagers who\u2019d been bracing themselves for the shock of GCSEs and A-levels were told to stand down, their exams cancelled. There will be no tearful goodbyes to friends, no rite-of-passage trips abroad, no festivals, no 18th-birthday parties. Instead, the summer months stretch out into a flat expanse of nothingness. Lucy is one of many young British adults who have been snatching moments of freedom when they can.</p> <p>\u201cSo much of your first year is about going out with your mates,\u201d says Harry Batt, 20, from Fareham, Hampshire. He was in his first year of a biomedical science degree at the University of Birmingham when he had to return home to live with his sister and parents, who are both key workers. \u201cYou have that taste of freedom and then you lose it so abruptly. You feel like you\u2019re kind of existing. My sleeping patterns are pretty rubbish. There\u2019s not a lot to wake up for.\u201d</p> <p>Socrates first complained that children \u201clove chatter in the place of exercise\u201d more than 2,000 years ago, and little has changed since then. The young adult brain is typically more dependent on social interaction than a fully matured adult\u2019s. \u201cThe importance of peers has been a hallmark of adolescence for thousands of years,\u201d says Dr Amy Orben, a research fellow at the University of Cambridge\u2019s cognition and brain sciences unit. \u201cWhat we have seen in studies is that this period involves a strengthening of social ties and a reconfiguration of social networks. Young people are finding their place in a maturing social world.\u201d </p> <p>It is too soon to know what the impact of the lockdown will be on young people, because the coronavirus pandemic is so unprecedented. \u201cIt\u2019s something we will only fully understand in future years, through more detailed study,\u201d Orben says.</p> <p>Batt\u2019s lockdown hasn\u2019t been entirely unsociable; he\u2019s in a tentative new romance with someone who lives locally. They connected on Instagram, and, although they haven\u2019t met yet, they have spent hours on video calls. \u201cThe hours we\u2019ve spent on FaceTime, it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Batt jokes. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the equivalent of 10 dates.\u201d Once lockdown is over, they plan to go on their first date. \u201cHe lives near the sea, so we\u2019ll probably go for a walk on the beach and to a McDonald\u2019s drive-through.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve worked really hard to get my grades, and now I\u2019m just going to be given them \u2013 it feels like I don\u2019t deserve it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s not just their social lives that teenagers are missing. Away from the feckless stereotypes of tabloid lore, some conscientious young people crave the satisfaction of passing through examinations into adult life. If exam season is a corset, afterwards there is the sweet release of slouching into a summer free of obligations. Without the build-up to A-levels, 17-year-old Amina, a student from a small town in the north, says she feels aimless.</p> <p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t had a prom or a chance to say goodbye properly to friends or teachers,\u201d she says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do any of the stuff people do when they leave school. That\u2019s the most frustrating part.\u201d She\u2019s also fearful that being part of the \u201cCovid generation\u201d will impair her long-term job prospects. \u201cI\u2019ve been working really hard for the last two years to get my grades, and now I\u2019m just going to be given them \u2013 it feels like I don\u2019t deserve it. Everyone is going to think we just had our grades handed to us on a plate.\u201d</p> <p>British teenagers are among the most tested in the world, and the unhappiest. \u201cWe have been concerned about stress for some time now,\u201d says Natalie Perera of the Education Policy Institute. \u201cOther countries test as frequently as the UK, but what is different about England in particular is that there is greater accountability. These tests come with higher stakes. Your GCSE scores matter, and so do your A-levels.\u201d </p> <p>For diligent students, the sudden cancellation of exams can be disorienting. \u201cThere\u2019s an emotional component,\u201d Perera says. \u201cThey\u2019ve been working for two years to get to this point. In some cases, they may feel deflated: this milestone they\u2019ve been building towards isn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d Of course, for others it may be a blessed relief: teenagers are not a homogeneous bloc.</p> <p>Young people who haven\u2019t had exams cancelled are also concerned. Noor Hashmi, 17, from Manchester, takes her A-levels next year. She feels that her cohort has been \u201coverlooked\u201d, because they\u2019re having to teach themselves the syllabus at home, using online learning. \u201cIf I was in college I would be properly absorbing the information,\u201d Hashmi says. \u201cBut there are only so many emails you can send to your teacher without feeling you\u2019re being annoying.\u201d Hashmi\u2019s classes have all moved online, but she worries she\u2019s not understanding the material fully. \u201cI feel the teachers are going through the content too quickly,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s stressful knowing that everything we\u2019ve covered so far won\u2019t be revisited in depth before our exams.\u201d</p> <p>Despite Hashmi\u2019s concerns, some educationists believe coronavirus could accelerate our progression towards more online models of teaching. \u201cThe government will have to give the whole area of education technology much more focus, in case there\u2019s a second wave,\u201d Perera says. As big tech continues to move into the education sector, some Silicon Valley venture capitalists are staking top dollar on bricks-and-mortar universities becoming a thing of the past.</p> <p> </p> <p>Amina, who is estranged from her family, lives alone, in supported accommodation. She is classed as a vulnerable student, so has been able to access the school building during lockdown. \u201cIt\u2019s really eerie, seeing the school so silent,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no one in the halls or the canteen to say hi to.\u201d At home, she passes the time by packing for uni and reading course textbooks, to get ahead. She has an offer to read law at Swansea, a course she opted for after her experience of legally breaking with her family. \u201cI know it\u2019s early to be reading my books,\u201d Amina admits, \u201cbut I can\u2019t wait to get out of here and explore. I\u2019m tired of being inside on my own all the time.\u201d</p> <p>For those who had already made it to university, there is a different set of challenges. Stripped of their social networks and plunged back into a childhood holding pattern, many are struggling. \u201cMy mental health was a lot better at uni,\u201d says Claudia, 20, from Leeds. She is in the second year of a computer science degree but is currently self-isolating with her mother and sister at home. Lately, things have been strained. Having grown used to her freedom at university, Claudia finds it hard being told what to do. \u201cWe\u2019ll be watching TV for a bit and Mum will say, \u2018Right, you need to deep clean the kitchen,\u2019\u201d Claudia says. \u201cYou have to tiptoe round her. I think she\u2019s getting obsessive about cleaning because she\u2019s not sure what else to do. It makes me feel panicky when she gets like this. I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s going to be like, day to day.\u201d</p> <p>Claudia is not alone: <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2020/mar/new-study-psychological-and-social-effects-covid-19\" title=\"\">University College London\u2019s ongoing Covid-19 social study</a>, which has been tracking the psychological and social experiences of adults in the UK during the pandemic, indicates that depression and anxiety levels have been higher in young adults than in the general population. In April, 17-year-old Manchester student <a href=\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/mourners-teenage-girl-trafford-streets-18069451\" title=\"\">Beth Palmer</a> took her own life after telling her parents that she was struggling to cope with the lockdown restrictions. A month later, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-52655678\" title=\"\">Matthew Mackell</a>, also 17, killed himself in a park in Tunbridge Wells, Kent. Mackell, an academic high achiever, left behind a notebook in which the A-level student expressed his fears that the lockdown might affect his results.</p> <p>As families have been forced to spend more time together, tensions can rise: the victims\u2019 commissioner for England and Wales has warned of a spike in domestic abuse cases, which impact children as well as adults.</p> <p>\u201cPrevious studies have shown that teenagers and young adults are among the most lonely people in the UK, despite being the most digitally connected,\u201d Orben says. \u201cThe removal of contact outside the home during a lockdown can be very destructive.\u201d In addition to her family confrontations, Claudia tells me she misses her boyfriend; she hasn\u2019t seen him for six weeks, which, she says, feels like an eternity. \u201cI\u2019m probably going to be here until September,\u201d she says. </p> <p>When you feel your grasp on adult life slipping, you grab freedom wherever you can. Lucy has kept her violations to a smattering of joints with friends \u2013 although there was that one time where four of them got together in a field and hung out. \u201cIn fairness, that was unplanned,\u201d Lucy says. \u201cIt was spontaneous.\u201d Lucy has confessed to friends that she\u2019s been breaking the rules. \u201cThey said, \u2018At least you\u2019re being honest about it, so we\u2019re not so angry.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Other transgressors have come in for social censure. Someone Lucy knows recently had a birthday party in his parents\u2019 garden. Photos appeared online, and WhatsApp groups turned into choruses of disapproval. \u201cThere was a backlash,\u201d Lucy says. \u201cIt definitely wasn\u2019t OK, but I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s OK for people to bitch about him behind his back.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3278f094636332adc9b95e7530b1a2b89558831\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3278f094636332adc9b95e7530b1a2b89558831/31_0_2854_3567/800.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of a woman balancing on her head, trapped in a jar\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018What might be the long-term consequences of so many months stuck indoors for a young person who already struggles with their mental health?\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Mari Fouz/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s assumed that young people are unlikely to be seriously affected by coronavirus and are mostly in isolation to stop transmission to others \u2013 but many are in high-risk groups themselves. \u201cI\u2019m stuck in limbo,\u201d says Adam Preston, a 22-year-old student at the University of Sheffield who is currently back at his family home in Eastbourne, East Sussex. </p> <p>Preston has a rare form of blood cancer, meaning he is at high risk from coronavirus. The government has told him that he has to isolate until 30 June. Before the pandemic hit, Preston had been accepted on to an Erasmus programme in Stockholm. \u201cI worked so hard to get that place to study abroad,\u201d he says, sounding morose. \u201cAnd now, because of my health, it looks extremely unlikely I\u2019m going to be able to do that.\u201d</p> <p>In lieu of a year\u2019s study in Sweden, Preston\u2019s life is now limited to the four walls of his parents\u2019 house, and the occasional walk outside, avoiding human interaction. He was previously on a waiting list for NHS mental health support, but his long-awaited assessment was cancelled due to the pandemic. \u201cI feel like every avenue of progression I\u2019ve been working towards for the last year has been frozen,\u201d he says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Coronavirus is more than an existential fear: it has put the breaks on rebellion, or the generational search for answers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What might be the long-term consequences of so many months stuck indoors for a young person who already struggles with their mental health? \u201cA lot of people are drawing analogies with the Great Depression,\u201d says Dr Cheryl Sisk, professor of neuroscience at Michigan State University. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a big disruption in people\u2019s lives, and I think it\u2019s going to have a major influence on the generation that is currently in adolescence and young adulthood.\u201d</p> <p>Sisk explains that young people feel stress more acutely than adults: tests on lab rats find that adolescent rats struggle to turn off their stress response as quickly as adult rats do. \u201cThe general neural systems that regulate emotion and executive function are still a work in progress,\u201d Sisk says. \u201cThat means that the brain is more susceptible to life disruptions than a fully matured brain. There is evidence from what we know about neural development that this could have a longer-lasting impact on teenagers than adults.\u201d</p> <p>In addition, coronavirus will lead to the economic hangover to end all hangovers. \u201cEvery generation has its own task in its own time,\u201d says the writer Jon Savage, author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/teenage-9781845951467.html\" title=\"\">Teenage: The Creation</a> <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/teenage-9781845951467.html\" title=\"\">Of Youth 1875-1945</a>. \u201cWhen I was a teenager in the 1960s, I was terrified I would die in a nuclear war. The thought that I could die at any time changed the way I looked at the world. There are always terrible events that threaten our future, until things change and the next threat comes along.\u201d</p> <p>But coronavirus feels different. For starters, young people can\u2019t pin badges to their chests and go out to protest against the virus. They can\u2019t do anything, really, apart from obey their parents\u2019 house rules \u2013 few have places of their own \u2013 and wait for the world to reopen. Coronavirus is more than just an existential fear: it has also put the brakes on reaction, rebellion, or the generational search for answers. It has forced young adults to return to their families, and accelerated the destruction of existing models of work, in sectors such as high-street retail and manufacturing; this generation of young adults will have to navigate their way through a world that is radically changed.</p> <p>\u201cThis generation are growing up in the death throes of the post-world war two world order,\u201d Savage says. \u201cThey are going to have to work out a new method of organisation that is sustainable and allows for a reasonable life for all.\u201d</p> <p>This social reorganisation is likely to be conducted amid a protracted recession in which young people will suffer disproportionately. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen in previous downturns is that the graduate job market has contracted,\u201d Perera says. She anticipates a rising number of young people going into stable professions such as teaching as a stopgap until (if) the economy gets back on track. \u201cWe always need teachers, and it\u2019s a safe profession, although not as well paid as other graduate jobs.\u201d</p> <p>Young people may also look at frontline health workers during the pandemic and consider careers in nursing and medicine; or they could see headlines about PPE shortages and be put off due to safety concerns. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>\u2018Coronavirus might change people for the better. We want to do our part and give back\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Coronavirus could even herald the end of teenagers as a social category entirely. \u201cThe word \u2018teenager\u2019 really began as a marketing concept,\u201d Savage explains. \u201cAmerica had won the war and democratic consumerism came to Europe; these were the fresh young people who could be marketed and sold to.\u201d</p> <p>But teenagers aren\u2019t as valuable as they once were to marketers. \u201cOur society has learned to market products that were initially aimed at teenagers to people of all ages,\u201d Savage says. With teenagers likely to suffer the most from an economic downturn, the concept of the teenager as a discrete subgroup of cash-rich consumers, dreamed up in the boardrooms of Mad Men-era advertising agencies, will effectively be over. </p> <p>This may not be an entirely bad thing. Once the dust settles, young people will have to reconsider their futures in a rapidly shifting world. \u201cThings aren\u2019t going to go back to normal,\u201d Savage says. \u201cThe young are going to play an active part in either destroying or creating a new world. That\u2019s kind of extraordinary.\u201d He predicts greater youth-led social activism, particularly around the climate emergency and animal rights.</p> <p>Hashmi tells me she feels tentatively hopeful for the future. \u201cI think coronavirus might change people for the better,\u201d she says. \u201cSome of my friends, who weren\u2019t considering working in hospitals and stuff, now look at clap-for-carers and think, we want to do our part and give back.\u201d She believes coronavirus will create a more compassionate, selfless generation of young people. \u201cI think we\u2019re more aware of others now,\u201d Hashmi goes on. \u201cAt the start of this, I was just thinking about making myself safe. But seeing the death toll increase, I was thinking about everyone else.\u201d Despite the fact that the lockdown restrictions have been eased, with socially distanced meet-ups for one individual from each household now permitted, Hashmi is in no rush to start socialising. \u201cMost of my friends and I think that it would be safer and better to meet when the lockdown is way, way more relaxed and the death toll has decreased,\u201d she says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel safe to go out right now.\u201d</p> <p>Most of the young adults I spoke to accepted the lockdown in a spirit of sacrifice, with equanimity and good grace. Very few had considered breaking the rules. \u201cWe want to stay in,\u201d Batt explains. \u201cWe know it\u2019s for the best.\u201d</p> <p>And when the lockdown is finally over, they will step out into a world that is radically uncertain, full of promise but also doubt. Will the kids be all right? \u201cI\u2019d like to think the kids will always be all right,\u201d Savage concludes. \u201cI have great faith in young people and their ability to see what is wrong with the world and come up with solutions. I am always optimistic.\u201d </p> <p><em>\u2022 Some names have been changed.

      "bodyText": "On 20 April, Lucy left her house in a small market town in Buckinghamshire and walked through winding country lanes to a quiet field. There, her friend Owen was waiting with a joint already rolled. The weather was balmy; barely a cloud in sight. The pair smoked and caught up on school gossip, before Lucy judged that she should probably head home \u2013 any longer, and her parents might become suspicious. When she got back, she chatted to her family, before heading upstairs to her bedroom, her mother none the wiser. Lucy, who is 17, wasn\u2019t going to let the coronavirus pandemic stop her marking 4/20, the international day of cannabis celebration. \u201cI do feel guilty about it,\u201d Lucy tells me, whispering (she does not want her parents to know about her weed-smoking). \u201cI have cut back on it the last week or so.\u201d Because she wanted to observe the lockdown rules? \u201cWell, mostly because the weather hasn\u2019t been great.\u201d When social distancing measures were announced in March, thousands of students had to quickly throw their possessions into suitcases, bid goodbye to university friends, and return to their childhood bedrooms. Teenagers who\u2019d been bracing themselves for the shock of GCSEs and A-levels were told to stand down, their exams cancelled. There will be no tearful goodbyes to friends, no rite-of-passage trips abroad, no festivals, no 18th-birthday parties. Instead, the summer months stretch out into a flat expanse of nothingness. Lucy is one of many young British adults who have been snatching moments of freedom when they can. \u201cSo much of your first year is about going out with your mates,\u201d says Harry Batt, 20, from Fareham, Hampshire. He was in his first year of a biomedical science degree at the University of Birmingham when he had to return home to live with his sister and parents, who are both key workers. \u201cYou have that taste of freedom and then you lose it so abruptly. You feel like you\u2019re kind of existing. My sleeping patterns are pretty rubbish. There\u2019s not a lot to wake up for.\u201d Socrates first complained that children \u201clove chatter in the place of exercise\u201d more than 2,000 years ago, and little has changed since then. The young adult brain is typically more dependent on social interaction than a fully matured adult\u2019s. \u201cThe importance of peers has been a hallmark of adolescence for thousands of years,\u201d says Dr Amy Orben, a research fellow at the University of Cambridge\u2019s cognition and brain sciences unit. \u201cWhat we have seen in studies is that this period involves a strengthening of social ties and a reconfiguration of social networks. Young people are finding their place in a maturing social world.\u201d It is too soon to know what the impact of the lockdown will be on young people, because the coronavirus pandemic is so unprecedented. \u201cIt\u2019s something we will only fully understand in future years, through more detailed study,\u201d Orben says. Batt\u2019s lockdown hasn\u2019t been entirely unsociable; he\u2019s in a tentative new romance with someone who lives locally. They connected on Instagram, and, although they haven\u2019t met yet, they have spent hours on video calls. \u201cThe hours we\u2019ve spent on FaceTime, it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Batt jokes. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the equivalent of 10 dates.\u201d Once lockdown is over, they plan to go on their first date. \u201cHe lives near the sea, so we\u2019ll probably go for a walk on the beach and to a McDonald\u2019s drive-through.\u201d It\u2019s not just their social lives that teenagers are missing. Away from the feckless stereotypes of tabloid lore, some conscientious young people crave the satisfaction of passing through examinations into adult life. If exam season is a corset, afterwards there is the sweet release of slouching into a summer free of obligations. Without the build-up to A-levels, 17-year-old Amina, a student from a small town in the north, says she feels aimless. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had a prom or a chance to say goodbye properly to friends or teachers,\u201d she says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do any of the stuff people do when they leave school. That\u2019s the most frustrating part.\u201d She\u2019s also fearful that being part of the \u201cCovid generation\u201d will impair her long-term job prospects. \u201cI\u2019ve been working really hard for the last two years to get my grades, and now I\u2019m just going to be given them \u2013 it feels like I don\u2019t deserve it. Everyone is going to think we just had our grades handed to us on a plate.\u201d British teenagers are among the most tested in the world, and the unhappiest. \u201cWe have been concerned about stress for some time now,\u201d says Natalie Perera of the Education Policy Institute. \u201cOther countries test as frequently as the UK, but what is different about England in particular is that there is greater accountability. These tests come with higher stakes. Your GCSE scores matter, and so do your A-levels.\u201d For diligent students, the sudden cancellation of exams can be disorienting. \u201cThere\u2019s an emotional component,\u201d Perera says. \u201cThey\u2019ve been working for two years to get to this point. In some cases, they may feel deflated: this milestone they\u2019ve been building towards isn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d Of course, for others it may be a blessed relief: teenagers are not a homogeneous bloc. Young people who haven\u2019t had exams cancelled are also concerned. Noor Hashmi, 17, from Manchester, takes her A-levels next year. She feels that her cohort has been \u201coverlooked\u201d, because they\u2019re having to teach themselves the syllabus at home, using online learning. \u201cIf I was in college I would be properly absorbing the information,\u201d Hashmi says. \u201cBut there are only so many emails you can send to your teacher without feeling you\u2019re being annoying.\u201d Hashmi\u2019s classes have all moved online, but she worries she\u2019s not understanding the material fully. \u201cI feel the teachers are going through the content too quickly,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s stressful knowing that everything we\u2019ve covered so far won\u2019t be revisited in depth before our exams.\u201d Despite Hashmi\u2019s concerns, some educationists believe coronavirus could accelerate our progression towards more online models of teaching. \u201cThe government will have to give the whole area of education technology much more focus, in case there\u2019s a second wave,\u201d Perera says. As big tech continues to move into the education sector, some Silicon Valley venture capitalists are staking top dollar on bricks-and-mortar universities becoming a thing of the past. Amina, who is estranged from her family, lives alone, in supported accommodation. She is classed as a vulnerable student, so has been able to access the school building during lockdown. \u201cIt\u2019s really eerie, seeing the school so silent,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no one in the halls or the canteen to say hi to.\u201d At home, she passes the time by packing for uni and reading course textbooks, to get ahead. She has an offer to read law at Swansea, a course she opted for after her experience of legally breaking with her family. \u201cI know it\u2019s early to be reading my books,\u201d Amina admits, \u201cbut I can\u2019t wait to get out of here and explore. I\u2019m tired of being inside on my own all the time.\u201d For those who had already made it to university, there is a different set of challenges. Stripped of their social networks and plunged back into a childhood holding pattern, many are struggling. \u201cMy mental health was a lot better at uni,\u201d says Claudia, 20, from Leeds. She is in the second year of a computer science degree but is currently self-isolating with her mother and sister at home. Lately, things have been strained. Having grown used to her freedom at university, Claudia finds it hard being told what to do. \u201cWe\u2019ll be watching TV for a bit and Mum will say, \u2018Right, you need to deep clean the kitchen,\u2019\u201d Claudia says. \u201cYou have to tiptoe round her. I think she\u2019s getting obsessive about cleaning because she\u2019s not sure what else to do. It makes me feel panicky when she gets like this. I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s going to be like, day to day.\u201d Claudia is not alone: University College London\u2019s ongoing Covid-19 social study, which has been tracking the psychological and social experiences of adults in the UK during the pandemic, indicates that depression and anxiety levels have been higher in young adults than in the general population. In April, 17-year-old Manchester student Beth Palmer took her own life after telling her parents that she was struggling to cope with the lockdown restrictions. A month later, Matthew Mackell, also 17, killed himself in a park in Tunbridge Wells, Kent. Mackell, an academic high achiever, left behind a notebook in which the A-level student expressed his fears that the lockdown might affect his results. As families have been forced to spend more time together, tensions can rise: the victims\u2019 commissioner for England and Wales has warned of a spike in domestic abuse cases, which impact children as well as adults. \u201cPrevious studies have shown that teenagers and young adults are among the most lonely people in the UK, despite being the most digitally connected,\u201d Orben says. \u201cThe removal of contact outside the home during a lockdown can be very destructive.\u201d In addition to her family confrontations, Claudia tells me she misses her boyfriend; she hasn\u2019t seen him for six weeks, which, she says, feels like an eternity. \u201cI\u2019m probably going to be here until September,\u201d she says. When you feel your grasp on adult life slipping, you grab freedom wherever you can. Lucy has kept her violations to a smattering of joints with friends \u2013 although there was that one time where four of them got together in a field and hung out. \u201cIn fairness, that was unplanned,\u201d Lucy says. \u201cIt was spontaneous.\u201d Lucy has confessed to friends that she\u2019s been breaking the rules. \u201cThey said, \u2018At least you\u2019re being honest about it, so we\u2019re not so angry.\u2019\u201d Other transgressors have come in for social censure. Someone Lucy knows recently had a birthday party in his parents\u2019 garden. Photos appeared online, and WhatsApp groups turned into choruses of disapproval. \u201cThere was a backlash,\u201d Lucy says. \u201cIt definitely wasn\u2019t OK, but I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s OK for people to bitch about him behind his back.\u201d It\u2019s assumed that young people are unlikely to be seriously affected by coronavirus and are mostly in isolation to stop transmission to others \u2013 but many are in high-risk groups themselves. \u201cI\u2019m stuck in limbo,\u201d says Adam Preston, a 22-year-old student at the University of Sheffield who is currently back at his family home in Eastbourne, East Sussex. Preston has a rare form of blood cancer, meaning he is at high risk from coronavirus. The government has told him that he has to isolate until 30 June. Before the pandemic hit, Preston had been accepted on to an Erasmus programme in Stockholm. \u201cI worked so hard to get that place to study abroad,\u201d he says, sounding morose. \u201cAnd now, because of my health, it looks extremely unlikely I\u2019m going to be able to do that.\u201d In lieu of a year\u2019s study in Sweden, Preston\u2019s life is now limited to the four walls of his parents\u2019 house, and the occasional walk outside, avoiding human interaction. He was previously on a waiting list for NHS mental health support, but his long-awaited assessment was cancelled due to the pandemic. \u201cI feel like every avenue of progression I\u2019ve been working towards for the last year has been frozen,\u201d he says. What might be the long-term consequences of so many months stuck indoors for a young person who already struggles with their mental health? \u201cA lot of people are drawing analogies with the Great Depression,\u201d says Dr Cheryl Sisk, professor of neuroscience at Michigan State University. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a big disruption in people\u2019s lives, and I think it\u2019s going to have a major influence on the generation that is currently in adolescence and young adulthood.\u201d Sisk explains that young people feel stress more acutely than adults: tests on lab rats find that adolescent rats struggle to turn off their stress response as quickly as adult rats do. \u201cThe general neural systems that regulate emotion and executive function are still a work in progress,\u201d Sisk says. \u201cThat means that the brain is more susceptible to life disruptions than a fully matured brain. There is evidence from what we know about neural development that this could have a longer-lasting impact on teenagers than adults.\u201d In addition, coronavirus will lead to the economic hangover to end all hangovers. \u201cEvery generation has its own task in its own time,\u201d says the writer Jon Savage, author of Teenage: The Creation Of Youth 1875-1945. \u201cWhen I was a teenager in the 1960s, I was terrified I would die in a nuclear war. The thought that I could die at any time changed the way I looked at the world. There are always terrible events that threaten our future, until things change and the next threat comes along.\u201d But coronavirus feels different. For starters, young people can\u2019t pin badges to their chests and go out to protest against the virus. They can\u2019t do anything, really, apart from obey their parents\u2019 house rules \u2013 few have places of their own \u2013 and wait for the world to reopen. Coronavirus is more than just an existential fear: it has also put the brakes on reaction, rebellion, or the generational search for answers. It has forced young adults to return to their families, and accelerated the destruction of existing models of work, in sectors such as high-street retail and manufacturing; this generation of young adults will have to navigate their way through a world that is radically changed. \u201cThis generation are growing up in the death throes of the post-world war two world order,\u201d Savage says. \u201cThey are going to have to work out a new method of organisation that is sustainable and allows for a reasonable life for all.\u201d This social reorganisation is likely to be conducted amid a protracted recession in which young people will suffer disproportionately. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen in previous downturns is that the graduate job market has contracted,\u201d Perera says. She anticipates a rising number of young people going into stable professions such as teaching as a stopgap until (if) the economy gets back on track. \u201cWe always need teachers, and it\u2019s a safe profession, although not as well paid as other graduate jobs.\u201d Young people may also look at frontline health workers during the pandemic and consider careers in nursing and medicine; or they could see headlines about PPE shortages and be put off due to safety concerns. Coronavirus could even herald the end of teenagers as a social category entirely. \u201cThe word \u2018teenager\u2019 really began as a marketing concept,\u201d Savage explains. \u201cAmerica had won the war and democratic consumerism came to Europe; these were the fresh young people who could be marketed and sold to.\u201d But teenagers aren\u2019t as valuable as they once were to marketers. \u201cOur society has learned to market products that were initially aimed at teenagers to people of all ages,\u201d Savage says. With teenagers likely to suffer the most from an economic downturn, the concept of the teenager as a discrete subgroup of cash-rich consumers, dreamed up in the boardrooms of Mad Men-era advertising agencies, will effectively be over. This may not be an entirely bad thing. Once the dust settles, young people will have to reconsider their futures in a rapidly shifting world. \u201cThings aren\u2019t going to go back to normal,\u201d Savage says. \u201cThe young are going to play an active part in either destroying or creating a new world. That\u2019s kind of extraordinary.\u201d He predicts greater youth-led social activism, particularly around the climate emergency and animal rights. Hashmi tells me she feels tentatively hopeful for the future. \u201cI think coronavirus might change people for the better,\u201d she says. \u201cSome of my friends, who weren\u2019t considering working in hospitals and stuff, now look at clap-for-carers and think, we want to do our part and give back.\u201d She believes coronavirus will create a more compassionate, selfless generation of young people. \u201cI think we\u2019re more aware of others now,\u201d Hashmi goes on. \u201cAt the start of this, I was just thinking about making myself safe. But seeing the death toll increase, I was thinking about everyone else.\u201d Despite the fact that the lockdown restrictions have been eased, with socially distanced meet-ups for one individual from each household now permitted, Hashmi is in no rush to start socialising. \u201cMost of my friends and I think that it would be safer and better to meet when the lockdown is way, way more relaxed and the death toll has decreased,\u201d she says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel safe to go out right now.\u201d Most of the young adults I spoke to accepted the lockdown in a spirit of sacrifice, with equanimity and good grace. Very few had considered breaking the rules. \u201cWe want to stay in,\u201d Batt explains. \u201cWe know it\u2019s for the best.\u201d And when the lockdown is finally over, they will step out into a world that is radically uncertain, full of promise but also doubt. Will the kids be all right? \u201cI\u2019d like to think the kids will always be all right,\u201d Savage concludes. \u201cI have great faith in young people and their ability to see what is wrong with the world and come up with solutions. I am always optimistic.\u201d \u2022 Some names have been changed. In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

He is abusing the past to distort the present, in order to control the future. But the past is not as malleable as Fox News.</p> <p>The symmetries between the past Kushner seeks to exploit and the discreditable present are striking. If there is any resemblance of the Trump mutation of the Republican party to any actual party in the election of 1856 it is not to the Republicans. Nor is it to the Democrats. Rather, it is to the third party in that campaign, the American party, also known as the Know Nothings, who also had a concise platform.&nbsp;</p> <p>The original American party sought to protect the purity of white native-born Protestants from the first great wave of immigration to the United States, which consisted mostly of the Irish and Germans, and to stigmatize a subversive religion.</p> <p>\u201cAmericans must rule America,\u201d its platform proclaimed. Only native-born citizens should be allowed to hold any public office, federal, state or municipal. Catholics, described in the category of those pledging \u201callegiance or obligation of any description to any foreign prince, potentate or power\u201d, were to be proscribed.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Know Nothings emerged from the crack-up of the Whig party over the issue of the extension of slavery in the territories. Most regarded themselves as Old Whigs, \u201cconservatives in principle\u201d in the words of their party platform. Their standard-bearer was Millard Fillmore, the last Whig president, a decorous figurehead. The Democrats nominated James Buchanan, a northern man of southern sympathy, a distinguished former senator from Pennsylvania, the crucial swing state.</p> <p>Abraham Lincoln, a lifelong Whig, forged the Illinois Republican party in 1856 out of a cacophony of contending factions, including radical abolitionists, Whigs, dissident antislavery Democrats and liberal German immigrants. Lincoln despised Know Nothingism.</p> <p>In 1855, he wrote that if the movement ever won power it would rewrite the Declaration of Independence: \u201cWhen the Know-Nothings get control, it will read \u2018all men are created equal, except negroes, and foreigners, and Catholics.\u2019 When it comes to this I should prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretense of loving liberty \u2013 to Russia, for instance, where despotism can be taken pure, and without the base alloy of hypocrisy.\u201d</p> <p>Behind the scenes, Lincoln worked to undermine the Know Nothings, break up their party and bring some of its former Whig adherents to his new cause. In order to hold together their fragile coalition, Lincoln in Illinois and Republicans nationally advanced the singular goal of prohibiting slavery in the territories.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Republican presidential candidate in 1856, John C Fremont, was a famous western explorer and senator from California. Both the \u201cAmericans\u201d and the Democrats mounted vicious smear campaigns against him: that he was not native-born but of foreign birth, illegitimate and a secret Catholic. \u201cTrial by mud,\u201d his wife Jessie Benton Fremont called it.</p> <p>Two years later, running for the Senate, Lincoln declared that immigrants who believe in the Declaration of Independence\u2019s precept that \u201call men are created equal\u201d are \u201cour equals in all things \u2026 as though they were blood of the blood, and flesh of the flesh of the men who wrote that Declaration, and so they are. That is the electric cord in that Declaration that links the hearts of patriotic and liberty-loving men together.\u201d&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2a5c67391068d75e657d0162c306f816ffbe747\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2a5c67391068d75e657d0162c306f816ffbe747/0_0_5100_3883/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A banner for the American party\u2019s 1856 presidential candidate, Millard Fillmore.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"761\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A banner for the American party\u2019s 1856 presidential candidate, Millard Fillmore.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal History Archive/UIG via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 1856 Republican platform may provide another piece of symmetry to the modern day.

      "bodyText": "Jared Kushner has let it be known that based on his understanding of American history, the Republican party platform should be drastically reduced from 58 convoluted pages in 2016 to \u201ca mission statement\u201d that can fit on a wallet-sized card, along the lines of the platform of 1856, \u201cin order to eliminate alienating language\u201d. The son-in-law of the president, senior adviser above all senior advisers and de facto campaign manager, has shifted from one earthshaking assignment to the next: chief diplomat to achieve Middle East peace; chief overseer of domestic policy and patron of Stephen Miller; chief of medical supplies in the coronavirus crisis. Now a self-designated expert in American history, his attempt to echo the party\u2019s first platform is an abrupt effort to smooth over Trump\u2019s alienation of large numbers of voters, to airbrush the president\u2019s offensive and lethal incompetence, and to justify it all by reference to the origins of the Republican party. He is abusing the past to distort the present, in order to control the future. But the past is not as malleable as Fox News. The symmetries between the past Kushner seeks to exploit and the discreditable present are striking. If there is any resemblance of the Trump mutation of the Republican party to any actual party in the election of 1856 it is not to the Republicans. Nor is it to the Democrats. Rather, it is to the third party in that campaign, the American party, also known as the Know Nothings, who also had a concise platform. The original American party sought to protect the purity of white native-born Protestants from the first great wave of immigration to the United States, which consisted mostly of the Irish and Germans, and to stigmatize a subversive religion. \u201cAmericans must rule America,\u201d its platform proclaimed. Only native-born citizens should be allowed to hold any public office, federal, state or municipal. Catholics, described in the category of those pledging \u201callegiance or obligation of any description to any foreign prince, potentate or power\u201d, were to be proscribed. The Know Nothings emerged from the crack-up of the Whig party over the issue of the extension of slavery in the territories. Most regarded themselves as Old Whigs, \u201cconservatives in principle\u201d in the words of their party platform. Their standard-bearer was Millard Fillmore, the last Whig president, a decorous figurehead. The Democrats nominated James Buchanan, a northern man of southern sympathy, a distinguished former senator from Pennsylvania, the crucial swing state. Abraham Lincoln, a lifelong Whig, forged the Illinois Republican party in 1856 out of a cacophony of contending factions, including radical abolitionists, Whigs, dissident antislavery Democrats and liberal German immigrants. Lincoln despised Know Nothingism. In 1855, he wrote that if the movement ever won power it would rewrite the Declaration of Independence: \u201cWhen the Know-Nothings get control, it will read \u2018all men are created equal, except negroes, and foreigners, and Catholics.\u2019 When it comes to this I should prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretense of loving liberty \u2013 to Russia, for instance, where despotism can be taken pure, and without the base alloy of hypocrisy.\u201d Behind the scenes, Lincoln worked to undermine the Know Nothings, break up their party and bring some of its former Whig adherents to his new cause. In order to hold together their fragile coalition, Lincoln in Illinois and Republicans nationally advanced the singular goal of prohibiting slavery in the territories. The Republican presidential candidate in 1856, John C Fremont, was a famous western explorer and senator from California. Both the \u201cAmericans\u201d and the Democrats mounted vicious smear campaigns against him: that he was not native-born but of foreign birth, illegitimate and a secret Catholic. \u201cTrial by mud,\u201d his wife Jessie Benton Fremont called it. Two years later, running for the Senate, Lincoln declared that immigrants who believe in the Declaration of Independence\u2019s precept that \u201call men are created equal\u201d are \u201cour equals in all things \u2026 as though they were blood of the blood, and flesh of the flesh of the men who wrote that Declaration, and so they are. That is the electric cord in that Declaration that links the hearts of patriotic and liberty-loving men together.\u201d The 1856 Republican platform may provide another piece of symmetry to the modern day. Its longest plank listed the trampling of constitutional rights of the antislavery forces in the Kansas territory, including voter suppression, attacks on freedom of the press, instigation of violence, and violence by armed militias. The Republicans promised to restore the rule of law after the election by bringing members of the current federal administration before the bar of justice for their crimes: \u201cThat all these things have been done with the knowledge, sanction, and procurement of the present National Administration; and that for this high crime against the Constitution, the Union, and humanity, we arraign that Administration, the President, his advisers, agents, supporters, apologists, and accessories, either before or after the fact, before the country and before the world; and that it is our fixed purpose to bring the actual perpetrators of these atrocious outrages and their accomplices to a sure and condign punishment thereafter.\u201d But the Republicans lost the election of 1856. There were no prosecutions. The early platform stood as a warning of greater danger to come. After Lincoln\u2019s election in 1860, many of those identified in the first Republican platform as the enemies of democracy, presidential advisers among them, would not accept the result and helped precipitate the civil war. If Trump loses the election of 2020, will \u201chis advisers, agents, supporters, apologists, and accessories\u201d and \u201caccomplices\u201d \u2013 including, first and foremost, Jared Kushner \u2013 accept the result and its consequences?

As part of its plans to cap the number of undergraduates that universities in England can teach in 2020-21, the Department for Education (DfE) is also to announce on Monday that it will extend the cap to include English students applying to higher education outside England. The new policy will restrict the number of students from England that, for instance, the University of St Andrews and Queen\u2019s University Belfast could admit. The move has provoked \u201cconsiderable anger\u201d and opposition from the governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, which wanted a UK-wide approach to stop damaging competition for students between institutions seeking to fill empty places left as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. Kirsty Williams, the education minister for Wales, said England\u2019s proposals were \u201cregrettable\u201d and cut across efforts to coordinate responses by all four nations. In a letter to Michelle Donelan, the DfE\u2019s universities minister, Williams wrote: \u201cI am deeply concerned that you have chosen to place a control on Welsh institutions rather than work with the Welsh government to achieve a solution that is compatible with devolution. \u201cI do not believe this approach [is] in the best interests of the UK as a whole, and demonstrates a surprising unwillingness to respect complementary policies in each nation.\u201d Williams also hinted the government in Wales was prepared to respond further: \u201cMy chief concern is to protect the interests of Welsh students and Welsh higher education institutions.

A DfE spokesperson said: \u201cWe will shortly be setting out further details on how the student number controls will be implemented, including how they will work in the devolved administrations.\u201d The DfE said its aim was to bring stability to the higher education sector, during \u201can incredibly difficult time for universities and their students\u201d since the UK\u2019s Covid-19 lockdown closed campuses.

      "body": "<p>Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Sandoval has been Fuenlabrada\u2019s manager for 11 weeks but hasn\u2019t taken charge of a single game. He has led only two full training sessions at the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n club, has barely met his players and never even got presented to the media, let alone the fans. He has suffered coronavirus and his timing could hardly have been worse, but he\u2019s wearing a huge grin. Not that you can see it under the Fuenlabrada face mask he ordered himself. \u201cThis period has been a like doing a master\u2019s,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Sandoval had just overcome a hernia operation when Fuenlabrada, based on the outskirts of Madrid, called him. He had been out of work for 16 months, since the second of two short-lived spells with C\u00f3rdoba. His appointment was announced on 11 March and there was a brief session that evening, his first contact with the entire squad. The following morning, 15 hours into the job, he had his second. And, it turned out, his last. That day, Spain\u2019s football teams were sent home and told not to come back. His presentation was cancelled: this was not the time, the club decided. A state of alarm was declared two days later, the country locked down. \u201cI\u2019m a tsunami, taking everything with it, but after a day the tsunami was stopped,\u201d says the 52-year-old, who made his way into management via amateur clubs starting in the mid-90s, having made little impression as a player.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f67c452ab35023ecc4aa4aa2a7582bf85d89ac13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f67c452ab35023ecc4aa4aa2a7582bf85d89ac13/0_74_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Sandoval, in his club mask, watches his Fuenlabrada players go through their paces in training\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Sandoval, in his club mask, watches his Fuenlabrada players go through their paces in training.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CF Fuenlabrada</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fuenlabrada\u2019s players didn\u2019t come back until 11 May, two months on, and even then it was for individual sessions, arriving and leaving in their kits, not allowed to loiter or gather together. La Liga hopes the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n can return on 12 June but full training won\u2019t begin until this coming week. Competition will get under way without Sandoval seeing them play a game. They return in 13th, just four points above the relegation zone (though also just seven off the play-offs). Yet one thing is clear: the enthusiasm.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think this has happened to anyone, ever,\u201d he says. \u201cMy first task was to win them over from home, empathise. \u201cI asked for a video of the good moments this season, edited it and put it to music. They went into lockdown having not won in 13 and I didn\u2019t want that lingering. I wanted positivity. We\u2019ve been working towards that idea for nine weeks.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You do a Zoom call and the same guy always connects first. Some exercise with their kids clambering on their backs</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe had a programme to maintain strength and avoid injuries and created a daily structure so their biorhythms didn\u2019t change: up at nine, breakfast, connect. They had to send a photo of their scales: by 9.15 every day, I had everyone\u2019s weight. The idea wasn\u2019t to police them, but show we\u2019re with them, they\u2019re not alone. We had group sessions every morning, then the two fitness coaches rang half each in the afternoon, reporting back every night. I called them all individually: long chats, asking how they\u2019re getting on, their families. You don\u2019t have that relationship managers have built with players but you get to know them.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, Sandoval says, he might know them even better than under normal circumstances. \u201cYou\u2019re talking every day, you chat before each session: jokes, what politicians are up to now. Some managers wouldn\u2019t need all that but I\u2019d only just arrived. I watched them work. You see things: how they position the camera, how they interact. You do a Zoom call and the same guy always connects first. Some exercise with their kids clambering on their backs. A cat walks past the camera. Someone\u2019s doing press-ups and the dog licks his face. That tells you about personalities, sensibilities, and gives you ways of reaching them which are helpful.</p> <p>\u201cWe wanted them to have a dose of reality too. I asked the doctor, who works in a hospital and is close to them, to connect after being in ICU. Show them there are people on the front line, this isn\u2019t a story. Every day people are dying, as if two or three planes are falling out the sky. That helps motivate them: \u2018We\u2019re stuck at home, sure, but that\u2019s as bad as it\u2019ll be.\u2019 And it works in reverse too: when things improved, I rang the doctor: \u2018Tell them the truth, there\u2019s light at the end of the tunnel. Don\u2019t give up, nearly there. It\u2019s been worth it.\u2019</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and thebiggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks</figcaption> </figure>  <p>&nbsp;\u201cThey returned in good shape, physically and mentally and the last two weeks have been so enriching.\u201d There\u2019s a laugh. \u201cThey\u2019re exactly as I thought.

      "bodyText": "Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Sandoval has been Fuenlabrada\u2019s manager for 11 weeks but hasn\u2019t taken charge of a single game. He has led only two full training sessions at the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n club, has barely met his players and never even got presented to the media, let alone the fans. He has suffered coronavirus and his timing could hardly have been worse, but he\u2019s wearing a huge grin. Not that you can see it under the Fuenlabrada face mask he ordered himself. \u201cThis period has been a like doing a master\u2019s,\u201d he says. Sandoval had just overcome a hernia operation when Fuenlabrada, based on the outskirts of Madrid, called him. He had been out of work for 16 months, since the second of two short-lived spells with C\u00f3rdoba. His appointment was announced on 11 March and there was a brief session that evening, his first contact with the entire squad. The following morning, 15 hours into the job, he had his second. And, it turned out, his last. That day, Spain\u2019s football teams were sent home and told not to come back. His presentation was cancelled: this was not the time, the club decided. A state of alarm was declared two days later, the country locked down. \u201cI\u2019m a tsunami, taking everything with it, but after a day the tsunami was stopped,\u201d says the 52-year-old, who made his way into management via amateur clubs starting in the mid-90s, having made little impression as a player. Fuenlabrada\u2019s players didn\u2019t come back until 11 May, two months on, and even then it was for individual sessions, arriving and leaving in their kits, not allowed to loiter or gather together. La Liga hopes the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n can return on 12 June but full training won\u2019t begin until this coming week. Competition will get under way without Sandoval seeing them play a game. They return in 13th, just four points above the relegation zone (though also just seven off the play-offs). Yet one thing is clear: the enthusiasm. \u201cI don\u2019t think this has happened to anyone, ever,\u201d he says. \u201cMy first task was to win them over from home, empathise. \u201cI asked for a video of the good moments this season, edited it and put it to music. They went into lockdown having not won in 13 and I didn\u2019t want that lingering. I wanted positivity. We\u2019ve been working towards that idea for nine weeks. \u201cWe had a programme to maintain strength and avoid injuries and created a daily structure so their biorhythms didn\u2019t change: up at nine, breakfast, connect. They had to send a photo of their scales: by 9.15 every day, I had everyone\u2019s weight. The idea wasn\u2019t to police them, but show we\u2019re with them, they\u2019re not alone. We had group sessions every morning, then the two fitness coaches rang half each in the afternoon, reporting back every night. I called them all individually: long chats, asking how they\u2019re getting on, their families. You don\u2019t have that relationship managers have built with players but you get to know them.\u201d In fact, Sandoval says, he might know them even better than under normal circumstances. \u201cYou\u2019re talking every day, you chat before each session: jokes, what politicians are up to now. Some managers wouldn\u2019t need all that but I\u2019d only just arrived. I watched them work. You see things: how they position the camera, how they interact. You do a Zoom call and the same guy always connects first. Some exercise with their kids clambering on their backs. A cat walks past the camera.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s not fashion shopping as we know it: shoppers provide details of their age, gender, size and colour preferences, and hand over \u00a339. A few weeks later a box arrives on your doorstep containing at least three items, with full ticket prices adding up to at least \u00a370, that were once destined for stores like Topshop.</p> <p>This is coronavirus crisis fashion shopping. The fashions come direct from the Bangladesh factory where the items were made and the mystery boxes are designed to provide a financial lifeline to the businesses and workers who supply big high street names.</p> <p>After fashion stores were forced to close their doors in the government shutdown, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/15/arcadia-group-cancels-over-100m-of-orders-as-garment-industry-faces-ruin\">western brands including Sir Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia</a>, owner of the Topshop and Dorothy Perkins chains, as well as Primark and Edinburgh Woollen Mill cancelled or suspended <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/02/fashion-brands-cancellations-of-24bn-orders-catastrophic-for-bangladesh\">\u00a32.4bn of orders from factories in Bangladesh</a> as they scrambled to reduce their losses.</p> <p>In total, an estimated \u00a310bn of clothing has piled up in warehouses during the lockdown. Some retailers have also been accused of demanding hefty discounts from suppliers, cancelling orders or withholding payment for goods already shipped.</p> <p>More than a million Bangladeshi garment workers were sent home without pay or lost their jobs, while factories were left with mountains of excess stock which could be destined for landfill.</p> <p>Lost Stock, set up by Edinburgh-based entrepreneur <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2015/jun/06/leader-of-the-year-2014-callyrussell\">Cally Russell, the founder of fashion shopping app Mallzee</a>, allows shoppers to buy a box of clothing directly from the manufacturers, with almost 40% of the proceeds of each box donated to Bangladesh through a non-profit organisation based in the country. It is enough to feed a Bangladeshi family for a week.</p> <p>\u201cWe can connect consumers directly to manufacturers and workers, while the middle bit of the supply chain isn\u2019t working just now because stores are closed and they can\u2019t take in that stock,\u201d Russell said.</p> <p>The response to the mystery boxes, he says, has been \u201cmind-blowing\u201d. Lost Stock\u2019s goal was to sell 10,000 boxes by the end of May, to help 10,000 garment workers\u2019 families, and hopefully 50,000 by the end of the year.</p> <p>Instead more than 68,000 consumers have bought a box since the initiative was launched less than a fortnight ago.</p> <p>Russell thanks word-of-mouth for helping them to surpass their target, and says Facebook has been the biggest driver of sales.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people like buying clothes, but at the moment some of them don\u2019t want to buy clothes as they feel guilty.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s not fashion shopping as we know it: shoppers provide details of their age, gender, size and colour preferences, and hand over \u00a339. A few weeks later a box arrives on your doorstep containing at least three items, with full ticket prices adding up to at least \u00a370, that were once destined for stores like Topshop. This is coronavirus crisis fashion shopping. The fashions come direct from the Bangladesh factory where the items were made and the mystery boxes are designed to provide a financial lifeline to the businesses and workers who supply big high street names. After fashion stores were forced to close their doors in the government shutdown, western brands including Sir Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia, owner of the Topshop and Dorothy Perkins chains, as well as Primark and Edinburgh Woollen Mill cancelled or suspended \u00a32.4bn of orders from factories in Bangladesh as they scrambled to reduce their losses. In total, an estimated \u00a310bn of clothing has piled up in warehouses during the lockdown. Some retailers have also been accused of demanding hefty discounts from suppliers, cancelling orders or withholding payment for goods already shipped. More than a million Bangladeshi garment workers were sent home without pay or lost their jobs, while factories were left with mountains of excess stock which could be destined for landfill. Lost Stock, set up by Edinburgh-based entrepreneur Cally Russell, the founder of fashion shopping app Mallzee, allows shoppers to buy a box of clothing directly from the manufacturers, with almost 40% of the proceeds of each box donated to Bangladesh through a non-profit organisation based in the country. It is enough to feed a Bangladeshi family for a week. \u201cWe can connect consumers directly to manufacturers and workers, while the middle bit of the supply chain isn\u2019t working just now because stores are closed and they can\u2019t take in that stock,\u201d Russell said. The response to the mystery boxes, he says, has been \u201cmind-blowing\u201d. Lost Stock\u2019s goal was to sell 10,000 boxes by the end of May, to help 10,000 garment workers\u2019 families, and hopefully 50,000 by the end of the year. Instead more than 68,000 consumers have bought a box since the initiative was launched less than a fortnight ago. Russell thanks word-of-mouth for helping them to surpass their target, and says Facebook has been the biggest driver of sales. \u201cA lot of people like buying clothes, but at the moment some of them don\u2019t want to buy clothes as they feel guilty. People love the fact they don\u2019t know what\u2019s in the box, someone said to me today they feel like they have bought their future self a present,\u201d he says. A Lost Stock box costs \u00a335, plus \u00a33.99 postage, and will contain at least three tops with a recommended retail price of \u00a370. The clothing boxes will contain tops, T-shirts and shirts rather than trousers \u2013 because a perfect fit isn\u2019t necessary. Over a third of the cost of each box (37%), almost \u00a313, is then directly donated to Bangladesh though the Sajida Foundation, which has been donating food and hygiene parcels in the country during the Covid-19 outbreak. Lost Stock will pay $11 (\u00a39) for the garments in each box, but provides a breakdown of the cost of each box on its website, including logistics and marketing. Russell isn\u2019t saying exactly which high street retailers had ordered the items which will end up in the boxes. The brand labels will be removed in Bangladesh, before the items are shipped to Europe, to be picked, packed and sent to consumers in six to eight weeks. \u201cIt is all spring summer stock so we want it to get to people for summer. If you order a box now chances are you will have it towards the end of June or start of July, we are doing everything we can to make it as fast as possible.\u201d Shoppers returning goods bought online poses a logistical challenge even for established retailers. Under the UK\u2019s distance selling regulations, Lost Stock will have to refund any customers who are not satisfied with the contents of their box. However Russell hopes that shoppers will swap items they do not want to keep with other users, or donate them to charity. Lost Stock says it is not certain if it will make a profit from the venture, but given the success so far, it is considering introducing boxes of childrenswear. Russell adds: \u201cWe are quite far from our upper limit, there is so much stock out there.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Death has been headline news for so long now, I am beginning to feel like a plague doctor. My next patient, an 89-year-old from a care home, is perilously ill. Despite the highest flow of oxygen we can deliver through his face mask, he is gasping for air at a rate of 40 breaths per minute, two or three times the norm. Swiftly, I search his hospital record for a glimpse of the man he used to be before coronavirus so violently reduced him.</p> <p>In my mind, the voices from this morning\u2019s car radio linger. Listening to the politicians and journalists talk \u2013 loftily, from afar, an Olympian perspective \u2013 coronavirus can feel like a mathematical abstraction, an intellectual exercise played out in curves and peaks and troughs and modelling. But here in the hospital, the pandemic is a matter of flesh and blood. It unfolds one human being at a time. And when the statistics threaten to throw me off balance \u2013 the unprecedented number of deaths for peacetime \u2013 I try to keep things as small as I can. Winston used to work in the local glass factory. His wife died three years ago. He has two sons called Michael and Robert.</p> <p>Usually I work in a hospice as a palliative care doctor. But now, with the wards of my local hospital filling with patients dying from coronavirus, the need is there instead. I\u2019m already wearing my mask. I\u2019ve pressed the metal strip down hard on to my nose and cheekbones, endeavouring to make it airtight. Now I layer on more protection. Apron, gloves and visor, the minimum with which we approach our patients these days.</p> <p>In PPE, everything is sticky and stifling. Voices are muffled and smiles obscured. Sweat starts trickling into your underwear. Even breathing takes more effort. Behind our masks, we strain to hear each other speak and are forced to second guess our colleagues\u2019 expressions. Being protected entails being dehumanised.</p> <p>Entering the antechamber to Winston\u2019s side room, I\u2019m dismayed to discover his sons are here. Someone has helped them into their own protection, but one mask, I can see, is on inside out and both men look limp and bewildered. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how close we\u2019re allowed to get to him,\u201d says one. \u201cCan you tell us how long he has?\u201d asks the other, in a voice made hard by fear.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5131649ecb188af47a433f35781f5e08919c945f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5131649ecb188af47a433f35781f5e08919c945f/0_342_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Sometimes I fret that most people don\u2019t not know how very close the NHS came to being overwhelmed.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Sometimes I fret that most people don\u2019t not know how very close the NHS came to being overwhelmed.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Visoot Uthairam/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I fight for a second to maintain my composure. The sons have been permitted to visit only because their father is dying. I am a doctor with neither a name nor a face.

And in the bleakness and tenderness of the next four words, I think I understand for the first time the true cost of a pandemic. \u201cHe\u2019s my best friend.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022<br></p> <p>There was a moment in mid-March when the mood at work, the newspaper headlines and even the heavens themselves aligned in mutinous harmony. A couple of nursing colleagues and I had just arrived at the local hospital to be trained in how to take our PPE on and off. We squinted up at the glowering sky, dark and steely with the threat of thunder, and laughed at the aptness of the weather.</p> <p>The evening before, Boris Johnson had delivered an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/boris-johnson-uk-can-turn-tide-of-coronavirus-in-12-weeks\">unexpectedly jaunty press conference</a> in which he assured an anxious nation we would \u201cturn the tide within the next 12 weeks\u201d and \u201csend coronavirus packing in this country\u201d, like some unwanted door-to-door salesman. He made the comments on the same day the number of Britons known to have died from the disease rose by 40% to 144. The deaths, of course, were just getting started.</p> <p>For NHS staff, the speech felt a little like prime ministerial gaslighting. At this point in the pandemic, the Cheltenham races had just been allowed to go ahead, some 250,000 people jamming into the stands over four days, and schools were still open. Government discussions about abandoning community testing for herd immunity had just been leaked, to great consternation. And PPE guidance for frontline staff had just been mysteriously downgraded so that most of us now were (indeed, still are) advised to wear equipment that fell short of World Health Organisation and EU standards. Meanwhile, friends working in intensive care in London were describing unfolding horrors in their ICUs. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much longer I can take it without lockdown,\u201d one of my colleagues murmured as we walked towards the hospital. \u201cI mean, have they actually decided to just ignore what\u2019s going on in Italy?\u201d</p> <p>We passed a security guard who took one look at our faces and told us to bloody well cheer up. We laughed and I asked him what the mood was like in the hospital. He pointed up at the thunderclouds above. \u201cSee that?\u201d he told us. \u201cThat\u2019s what it feels like. It\u2019s not like London here yet. But it will be. It hasn\u2019t arrived yet but it\u2019s coming for us. We\u2019re waiting for it to hit.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>When the hit finally came \u2013 those daily hospital death tolls nearing a thousand \u2013 the population was, at last, in lockdown. Time, the one commodity we tend to crave more than anything, stretched out in enforced, unnerving abundance. The quarantined population tried to manage its fears and listlessness using the unconventional strategies of baking bread and stockpiling toilet rolls.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Our society may be endemically unequal, but no one in Britain is expendable</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Doctors, nurses and allied health professionals, on the other hand, were reeling. From top to bottom, with dizzying alacrity, the NHS had transformed itself into a single-minded, pandemic-focused, pared-down field service. For armchair critics of the \u201clumbering\u201d, \u201cmonolithic\u201d, \u201cbureaucratic\u201d NHS, it was a stunning example of local teams working with fearlessness, urgency and vision to deliver high quality pandemic medicine. Operating theatres, recovery areas, normal wards and even conference rooms were transformed into makeshift ICUs. Psychiatrists, surgeons, dermatologists and medical students were co-opted from their day jobs to staff them day and night. In nine days, a London conference hall mutated into a 4,000-bed hospital. Everyone, everywhere threw themselves into action. We were proud and eager to do our part. We tried not to think about catching coronavirus. The trickle of dead colleagues began.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Amid all this frenetic activity it took time to realise that something glaring \u2013 and terrible \u2013 had been overlooked. The whole country was repeatedly assured that although efforts to contain the disease were now abandoned, the most vulnerable would be \u201cshielded\u201d from harm. On 11 March, for example, David Halpern, the head of No 10\u2019s \u201cnudge unit\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/herd-immunity-will-the-uks-coronavirus-strategy-work\">stated in a BBC interview</a>:</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a point, assuming the epidemic flows and grows as it will do, where you want to cocoon, to protect those at-risk groups so they don\u2019t catch the disease. By the time they come out of their cocooning, herd immunity has been achieved in the rest of the population.\u201d</p> <p>At the time we knew full well \u2013 because the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-51540981\">data from China had already told us</a> \u2013 that those most at risk from coronavirus were elderly patients, such as Winston, plus those with underlying comorbidities. But far from being cocooned, he and the other 400,000 residents of UK care homes were being quietly incarcerated. No testing. No contact tracing. No proper PPE, even, for care-home staff. Pitiful stories began to circulate of care workers wearing bin bags for protection, while begging local builders and veterinary practices for masks. Worse, care-home residents were being sent to homes from hospitals without knowing they were not infected.</p> <p>When, therefore, at the end of April I watched the prime minister <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-cases-deaths-peak-briefing-latest-a9492906.html\">declare our coronavirus strategy a \u201csuccess\u201d</a>, I felt physically sick. We had \u201cavoided the tragedy that engulfed other parts of the world\u201d, he insisted, \u201cbecause at no stage has our NHS been overwhelmed\u201d. How very cheap \u2013 how spectacularly expendable \u2013 one human life must be, I thought, if the avoidance of tragedy is consistent with the deaths of 27,000 people, as the toll then stood.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3867d17f3fdc32df86723941dad1431ca2392ca4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3867d17f3fdc32df86723941dad1431ca2392ca4/0_330_5537_3324/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chelsea and Westminster hospital staff and members of the public applaud the NHS.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I fear most people are unaware of how exhausted some NHS staff and care workers are.\u2019 Hospital staff and members of the public applaud the health service.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Bell/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Does it matter that 400,000 of our most vulnerable citizens were promised shielding while being effectively abandoned? That for them, even the most basic measures of protection were at best overlooked, at worst deliberately ignored? That the alleged \u201csuccess\u201d of April came at such stupendous cost to those too elderly, frail or disabled to live in their own homes?</p> <p>You could argue \u2013 indeed, some commentators have essentially done so \u2013 that there was little point to a man like Winston. He was 89 years old, after all, and probably hadn\u2019t been economically productive for three decades. He was lucky, frankly, to have had an innings like that. Of course the young must come first. You might even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/hes-just-a-wonderful-man-how-captain-tom-became-a-superstar-fundraiser\">champion another old man\u2019s exploits</a> \u2013 the charm and determination and ebullience of Captain Tom \u2013 while being secretly at peace with the expendability of certain parts of the herd.</p> <p>But to those of us up close with this dreadful disease \u2013 who see, as we do, the way it suffocates the life from you \u2013 such judgments are grotesque. The moment we rank life according to who most \u201cdeserves\u201d it, we have crossed into a realm I don\u2019t want to be a part of \u2013 and I struggle to believe many other Britons do either. The way out of this pandemic cannot, surely, entail the sacrifice of those deemed less worth saving?</p> <p>Like many in the NHS just now, I keep my head by looking down \u2013 at one patient and then another. I am lucky in this respect: I have focus. Sometimes I fret that most people don\u2019t know how very close the NHS came to being overwhelmed this Easter \u2013 how we avoided the hellishness of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-italy-lombardy-province-at-centre-of-outbreak-offers-glimmer-of-hope\">Lombardy</a> or New York City only by superhuman efforts. I fear, too, that most people are unaware of how exhausted, stunned \u2013 shellshocked, even \u2013 some NHS staff and care workers are. How daunted we feel as we watch lockdown being relaxed before proper testing, tracing and isolation infrastructure are in place. How incredulous we are as we see government figures breaking the rules they wrote, that so many others have lived and died by.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The point of our response to Covid-19 is not to flatten curves and protect the NHS: it is to prevent unnecessary dying</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In my darkest moments, I worry that the televised coronavirus press conferences are increasingly being used to distract us from what is really at stake. That the flood of pseudoscientific statistics is intended to bamboozle \u2013 to leave the population dazed and bemused. When you are invited daily to celebrate supersized statistics \u2013 100,000 tests a day, no, make that 250,000 \u2013 it is easy to lose sight of what matters.</p> <p>Sir David Spiegelhalter, professor of the public understanding of risk at Cambridge University, <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/david-spiegelhalter-covid19-statistics-coronavirus-government-a4436471.html\">suggested earlier this month</a> that Downing Street is using \u201cnumber theatre\u201d to manipulate the message rather than actually inform people. The chair of the UK Statistics Authority, Sir David Norgrove, has even been forced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/uk-statistics-chief-calls-for-clarity-over-daily-covid-19-test-count\">to write to the health secretary, Matt Hancock</a>, urging him to improve the \u201ctrustworthiness\u201d of the way he presents data on coronavirus testing.</p> <p>The true metric of success in a pandemic is simple, the overall number of deaths prevented. The point of our response to coronavirus is not to flatten curves, ramp up headlines, protect the NHS or invent mathematically nonsensical equations: it is the prevention of unnecessary dying.</p> <p>As we reel, punch drunk, from press conference to press conference, we must not allow those standing at their lecterns on the podium to gloss over recent history. It is a fact that a whole swath of our most vulnerable citizens, those residing in care homes, have already been abandoned once to coronavirus. And no matter what any government figure implies \u2013 no matter how distracting or persuasive their abstractions \u2013 this is entirely and inexcusably wrong. Our society may be endemically unequal, but noone in Britain is expendable. Winston, though vulnerable, was loved and cherished. His death was not inevitable, his time hadn\u2019t come. He was no more disposable than any of us.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Dr Rachel Clarke is the author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/12/dear-life-rachel-clarke-review\">Dear Life</a>, published by Little, Brown.

      "bodyText": "Death has been headline news for so long now, I am beginning to feel like a plague doctor. My next patient, an 89-year-old from a care home, is perilously ill. Despite the highest flow of oxygen we can deliver through his face mask, he is gasping for air at a rate of 40 breaths per minute, two or three times the norm. Swiftly, I search his hospital record for a glimpse of the man he used to be before coronavirus so violently reduced him. In my mind, the voices from this morning\u2019s car radio linger. Listening to the politicians and journalists talk \u2013 loftily, from afar, an Olympian perspective \u2013 coronavirus can feel like a mathematical abstraction, an intellectual exercise played out in curves and peaks and troughs and modelling. But here in the hospital, the pandemic is a matter of flesh and blood. It unfolds one human being at a time. And when the statistics threaten to throw me off balance \u2013 the unprecedented number of deaths for peacetime \u2013 I try to keep things as small as I can. Winston used to work in the local glass factory. His wife died three years ago. He has two sons called Michael and Robert. Usually I work in a hospice as a palliative care doctor. But now, with the wards of my local hospital filling with patients dying from coronavirus, the need is there instead. I\u2019m already wearing my mask. I\u2019ve pressed the metal strip down hard on to my nose and cheekbones, endeavouring to make it airtight. Now I layer on more protection. Apron, gloves and visor, the minimum with which we approach our patients these days. In PPE, everything is sticky and stifling. Voices are muffled and smiles obscured. Sweat starts trickling into your underwear. Even breathing takes more effort. Behind our masks, we strain to hear each other speak and are forced to second guess our colleagues\u2019 expressions. Being protected entails being dehumanised. Entering the antechamber to Winston\u2019s side room, I\u2019m dismayed to discover his sons are here. Someone has helped them into their own protection, but one mask, I can see, is on inside out and both men look limp and bewildered. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how close we\u2019re allowed to get to him,\u201d says one. \u201cCan you tell us how long he has?\u201d asks the other, in a voice made hard by fear. I fight for a second to maintain my composure. The sons have been permitted to visit only because their father is dying. I am a doctor with neither a name nor a face. My hospital badge is hidden from view and my eyes \u2013 the only part of my face still visible \u2013 are obscured by a layer of Perspex. So much for the healing presence of the bedside physician. I scarcely look human. All those arcs and sweeps and projections and opinions \u2013 the endless, esoteric, disorientating debates about whether flattening or crushing the curve is more desirable \u2013 arrive, in the end, at precisely this point, this moment of cold simplicity. Six feet away, a father, a man I am yet to lay eyes on, is dying of a disease only named a month ago. \u201cHello Michael, Robert,\u201d I say warmly, though doubtful any warmth will carry. \u201cMy name is Rachel. I\u2019m one of the doctors caring for your father. Forgive me for not knowing which of you is which.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m Michael,\u201d says the brother with the stony edge to his voice. \u201cNo one\u2019s told us anything. Can he even hear us?\u201d Everything about this is wrong. The physical barriers between us. The harsh and jarring words that conceal rising panic. The glaring need \u2013 that can\u2019t be met \u2013 to rip off the masks and gloves and shake hands, sit down, read each other\u2019s expressions and begin, inch by inch, to cross the gulf that divides us. The sons step aside to allow me in closer. And there, palms turned upwards, chest heaving and trembling, is their father, spreadeagled in tangled cotton. Winston\u2019s mask clamps down on skin slick with sweat. His lips are grey, fingertips the colour of bruises. An intravenous line drips antibiotics into one arm. A catheter drains urine the colour of mud into a bag left lying on the bedclothes. His arms and legs, barely more than bones, are twitching and scything. The only part of his body not in motion, I realise, are his eyes, white-rimmed and fixed on the ceiling. The radio programme crosses my mind again. The language of war has been rife during the pandemic but never more so than when the prime minister was rushed to intensive care. Since then, battle tropes have dominated the national conversation. Cabinet members assured us Boris Johnson would beat the disease because he\u2019s a fighter, as though survival is somehow a test of character, a matter primarily of valour. The reality, of course, is more banal. People do not die from this illness \u2013 or from any other \u2013 because they lack grit. Nor do they live by sheer pugnaciousness. I look down at the bedsheets, stained with sweat, and the coil of limbs squirming in fear. It could not be plainer to anyone here that Winston is no participant in a battle. He is, instead, merely the battlefield. His body, worn out to begin with, is being methodically disposed of by a virus so primitive it scarcely qualifies as life. Character has precisely nothing to do with it. It never does in the real world of the hospital where the good, the bad, the brave and the timid all kneel alike before cancers and microbes. I move closer. Speaking sufficiently loudly to be audible above the thrum of the oxygen, I say his name. Nothing. No flicker of response. Still closer. Again, almost shouting: \u201cWinston.\u201d His eyes remain locked on the ceiling. I can feel those of his sons fixed on mine. In this alien time when even breathing the same air as your patient is heavy with risk, physical contact is permitted only when strictly necessary. I observe the muscles on Winston\u2019s neck bulging to drag a little more air into his waterlogged lungs, and reach forwards, inching nearer. Gently, I take his hand in both of mine. His pulse flutters so faintly, it is barely there. No warmth from his flesh creeps through my gloves. I am holding the hand of a man who is dying and who knows it as surely as I do. Behind closed doors, with neither fanfare nor drama, he has been quietly drowning all night. I squeeze Winston\u2019s fingers, repeat his name once again, and now, at last, his eyelids flicker. Our gazes meet for the first time. \u201cAre you in any pain?\u201d I ask. A barely perceptible shake of his head.

I explain that yes, time is short, yes, he is probably in his last few hours of his life.

He made the comments on the same day the number of Britons known to have died from the disease rose by 40% to 144. The deaths, of course, were just getting started. For NHS staff, the speech felt a little like prime ministerial gaslighting. At this point in the pandemic, the Cheltenham races had just been allowed to go ahead, some 250,000 people jamming into the stands over four days, and schools were still open. Government discussions about abandoning community testing for herd immunity had just been leaked, to great consternation. And PPE guidance for frontline staff had just been mysteriously downgraded so that most of us now were (indeed, still are) advised to wear equipment that fell short of World Health Organisation and EU standards. Meanwhile, friends working in intensive care in London were describing unfolding horrors in their ICUs. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much longer I can take it without lockdown,\u201d one of my colleagues murmured as we walked towards the hospital. \u201cI mean, have they actually decided to just ignore what\u2019s going on in Italy?\u201d We passed a security guard who took one look at our faces and told us to bloody well cheer up. We laughed and I asked him what the mood was like in the hospital. He pointed up at the thunderclouds above. \u201cSee that?\u201d he told us. \u201cThat\u2019s what it feels like. It\u2019s not like London here yet. But it will be. It hasn\u2019t arrived yet but it\u2019s coming for us. We\u2019re waiting for it to hit.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 When the hit finally came \u2013 those daily hospital death tolls nearing a thousand \u2013 the population was, at last, in lockdown. Time, the one commodity we tend to crave more than anything, stretched out in enforced, unnerving abundance. The quarantined population tried to manage its fears and listlessness using the unconventional strategies of baking bread and stockpiling toilet rolls. Doctors, nurses and allied health professionals, on the other hand, were reeling. From top to bottom, with dizzying alacrity, the NHS had transformed itself into a single-minded, pandemic-focused, pared-down field service. For armchair critics of the \u201clumbering\u201d, \u201cmonolithic\u201d, \u201cbureaucratic\u201d NHS, it was a stunning example of local teams working with fearlessness, urgency and vision to deliver high quality pandemic medicine. Operating theatres, recovery areas, normal wards and even conference rooms were transformed into makeshift ICUs. Psychiatrists, surgeons, dermatologists and medical students were co-opted from their day jobs to staff them day and night. In nine days, a London conference hall mutated into a 4,000-bed hospital. Everyone, everywhere threw themselves into action. We were proud and eager to do our part. We tried not to think about catching coronavirus. The trickle of dead colleagues began. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Amid all this frenetic activity it took time to realise that something glaring \u2013 and terrible \u2013 had been overlooked. The whole country was repeatedly assured that although efforts to contain the disease were now abandoned, the most vulnerable would be \u201cshielded\u201d from harm. On 11 March, for example, David Halpern, the head of No 10\u2019s \u201cnudge unit\u201d, stated in a BBC interview: \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a point, assuming the epidemic flows and grows as it will do, where you want to cocoon, to protect those at-risk groups so they don\u2019t catch the disease. By the time they come out of their cocooning, herd immunity has been achieved in the rest of the population.\u201d At the time we knew full well \u2013 because the data from China had already told us \u2013 that those most at risk from coronavirus were elderly patients, such as Winston, plus those with underlying comorbidities. But far from being cocooned, he and the other 400,000 residents of UK care homes were being quietly incarcerated. No testing. No contact tracing. No proper PPE, even, for care-home staff. Pitiful stories began to circulate of care workers wearing bin bags for protection, while begging local builders and veterinary practices for masks. Worse, care-home residents were being sent to homes from hospitals without knowing they were not infected. When, therefore, at the end of April I watched the prime minister declare our coronavirus strategy a \u201csuccess\u201d, I felt physically sick. We had \u201cavoided the tragedy that engulfed other parts of the world\u201d, he insisted, \u201cbecause at no stage has our NHS been overwhelmed\u201d. How very cheap \u2013 how spectacularly expendable \u2013 one human life must be, I thought, if the avoidance of tragedy is consistent with the deaths of 27,000 people, as the toll then stood. Does it matter that 400,000 of our most vulnerable citizens were promised shielding while being effectively abandoned? That for them, even the most basic measures of protection were at best overlooked, at worst deliberately ignored? That the alleged \u201csuccess\u201d of April came at such stupendous cost to those too elderly, frail or disabled to live in their own homes? You could argue \u2013 indeed, some commentators have essentially done so \u2013 that there was little point to a man like Winston. He was 89 years old, after all, and probably hadn\u2019t been economically productive for three decades. He was lucky, frankly, to have had an innings like that. Of course the young must come first. You might even champion another old man\u2019s exploits \u2013 the charm and determination and ebullience of Captain Tom \u2013 while being secretly at peace with the expendability of certain parts of the herd. But to those of us up close with this dreadful disease \u2013 who see, as we do, the way it suffocates the life from you \u2013 such judgments are grotesque. The moment we rank life according to who most \u201cdeserves\u201d it, we have crossed into a realm I don\u2019t want to be a part of \u2013 and I struggle to believe many other Britons do either. The way out of this pandemic cannot, surely, entail the sacrifice of those deemed less worth saving? Like many in the NHS just now, I keep my head by looking down \u2013 at one patient and then another. I am lucky in this respect: I have focus. Sometimes I fret that most people don\u2019t know how very close the NHS came to being overwhelmed this Easter \u2013 how we avoided the hellishness of Lombardy or New York City only by superhuman efforts. I fear, too, that most people are unaware of how exhausted, stunned \u2013 shellshocked, even \u2013 some NHS staff and care workers are. How daunted we feel as we watch lockdown being relaxed before proper testing, tracing and isolation infrastructure are in place. How incredulous we are as we see government figures breaking the rules they wrote, that so many others have lived and died by. In my darkest moments, I worry that the televised coronavirus press conferences are increasingly being used to distract us from what is really at stake. That the flood of pseudoscientific statistics is intended to bamboozle \u2013 to leave the population dazed and bemused. When you are invited daily to celebrate supersized statistics \u2013 100,000 tests a day, no, make that 250,000 \u2013 it is easy to lose sight of what matters. Sir David Spiegelhalter, professor of the public understanding of risk at Cambridge University, suggested earlier this month that Downing Street is using \u201cnumber theatre\u201d to manipulate the message rather than actually inform people. The chair of the UK Statistics Authority, Sir David Norgrove, has even been forced to write to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, urging him to improve the \u201ctrustworthiness\u201d of the way he presents data on coronavirus testing. The true metric of success in a pandemic is simple, the overall number of deaths prevented. The point of our response to coronavirus is not to flatten curves, ramp up headlines, protect the NHS or invent mathematically nonsensical equations: it is the prevention of unnecessary dying. As we reel, punch drunk, from press conference to press conference, we must not allow those standing at their lecterns on the podium to gloss over recent history. It is a fact that a whole swath of our most vulnerable citizens, those residing in care homes, have already been abandoned once to coronavirus. And no matter what any government figure implies \u2013 no matter how distracting or persuasive their abstractions \u2013 this is entirely and inexcusably wrong. Our society may be endemically unequal, but noone in Britain is expendable. Winston, though vulnerable, was loved and cherished. His death was not inevitable, his time hadn\u2019t come. He was no more disposable than any of us. \u2022 Dr Rachel Clarke is the author of Dear Life, published by Little, Brown. Names and other identifying details have been changed to protect anonymity.",

Here's what the science tells us | Devi Sridhar and Ines Hassan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Organisation is everything when it comes to children. One of the biggest shocks to your system, once your offspring start moving around by themselves, is how much life admin you suddenly have to do. How many of your conversations with other adults, especially your beloved, revolve around regulating and facilitating your children\u2019s lives. You\u2019re not just a taxi driver, but a PA, cook, cleaner, butler. Organisation is 90% of your job, as a parent. What of love, you may cry. But love also means making sure they\u2019re there, on time, in shoes, with sandwiches.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been trying to teach my nine-year-old during lockdown, and my efforts have not been up to Ofsted standards. This is in no way due to my teaching skills, which are exemplary, but due to my pre-teaching prep, which is not. We do the work on the kitchen table, which isn\u2019t always completely clear. She needs to use my laptop. (No, she doesn\u2019t have her own computer. She\u2019s nine.) As I have to work, this can present problems, and as a result, my daughter has become very good at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/fortnite\" title=\"\">Fortnite</a>, which she can play on another screen. Still, she made a little book with pictures of flowers in it, labelled, of her own accord, so my non-organised approach is clearly working. So sweet! I thought. So Cath Kidston (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/21/cath-kidston-to-close-all-60-uk-stores-with-loss-of-900-jobs\" title=\"\">RIP</a>)! Who needs teachers? For her next homemade book, she announced, she is going to draw and label all the Fortnite guns. Hashtag cute.</p> <p>Her school will be open next week but, as it\u2019s an inner city school, with not much room, social distancing is not easy. Each year has two classes of 30, and the only way such numbers can be accommodated is for the classes to attend on alternate weeks. They\u2019ll be divided into groups of 15, each child sitting on a separate desk, with sterilised equipment and pens. Each year group will enter by a different entrance, and will move around the school separately, with different areas in the playground. Shared equipment will be disinfected, hand sanitisers provided, regular handwashing supervised. PPE has been sourced for situations \u2013 such as dealing with children with disabilities \u2013 where \u201csocial distancing cannot be guaranteed\u201d. Lunch will not be a bunfight.</p> <p>None of this has happened by magic. I hate to break it to you, but no fairies worked the overnight shift to help sort this out. I\u2019m a school governor, so I know the government issued its final guidance just 16 days before they wanted school doors to open, at a time when there were already key workers\u2019 children to teach, plus online work being set for all year groups. The organisation this has required is immense. Could it be that the big guys of government haven\u2019t quite grasped the scale of what they\u2019re asking schools to do?</p> <p>Though I understand why others aren\u2019t, I\u2019m happy for my nine-year-old to return to class, when she\u2019s allowed. I know the towering effort that has gone into making it possible. Like I said: the teaching is the nice bit.</p>",

He was keen and wanted to make regular visits, but it took so much time and effort to get the kids into protective romper suits and wellies (which the school had to buy), and then out of them afterwards, that it meant any other activity wouldn\u2019t happen for the whole morning. And, as we all know, three- and four-year-olds have a curriculum to complete. Organisation is everything when it comes to children. One of the biggest shocks to your system, once your offspring start moving around by themselves, is how much life admin you suddenly have to do. How many of your conversations with other adults, especially your beloved, revolve around regulating and facilitating your children\u2019s lives. You\u2019re not just a taxi driver, but a PA, cook, cleaner, butler. Organisation is 90% of your job, as a parent. What of love, you may cry. But love also means making sure they\u2019re there, on time, in shoes, with sandwiches. I\u2019ve been trying to teach my nine-year-old during lockdown, and my efforts have not been up to Ofsted standards. This is in no way due to my teaching skills, which are exemplary, but due to my pre-teaching prep, which is not. We do the work on the kitchen table, which isn\u2019t always completely clear. She needs to use my laptop. (No, she doesn\u2019t have her own computer. She\u2019s nine.) As I have to work, this can present problems, and as a result, my daughter has become very good at Fortnite, which she can play on another screen. Still, she made a little book with pictures of flowers in it, labelled, of her own accord, so my non-organised approach is clearly working. So sweet! I thought. So Cath Kidston (RIP)! Who needs teachers? For her next homemade book, she announced, she is going to draw and label all the Fortnite guns. Hashtag cute. Her school will be open next week but, as it\u2019s an inner city school, with not much room, social distancing is not easy. Each year has two classes of 30, and the only way such numbers can be accommodated is for the classes to attend on alternate weeks. They\u2019ll be divided into groups of 15, each child sitting on a separate desk, with sterilised equipment and pens. Each year group will enter by a different entrance, and will move around the school separately, with different areas in the playground. Shared equipment will be disinfected, hand sanitisers provided, regular handwashing supervised. PPE has been sourced for situations \u2013 such as dealing with children with disabilities \u2013 where \u201csocial distancing cannot be guaranteed\u201d. Lunch will not be a bunfight. None of this has happened by magic. I hate to break it to you, but no fairies worked the overnight shift to help sort this out. I\u2019m a school governor, so I know the government issued its final guidance just 16 days before they wanted school doors to open, at a time when there were already key workers\u2019 children to teach, plus online work being set for all year groups. The organisation this has required is immense. Could it be that the big guys of government haven\u2019t quite grasped the scale of what they\u2019re asking schools to do? Though I understand why others aren\u2019t, I\u2019m happy for my nine-year-old to return to class, when she\u2019s allowed. I know the towering effort that has gone into making it possible. Like I said: the teaching is the nice bit.",

Yet as Mexico\u2019s daily death toll rises to become one of the highest in the world \u2013 a record 501 fatalities were reported on Tuesday alone \u2013 the country is simultaneously preparing to reopen and weathering a politically charged battle over the true scale of the crisis. \u201cWe\u2019re doing well, the pandemic has been tamed,\u201d Mexico\u2019s populist president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, claimed on Thursday as he announced he would resume touring the country when a period of nationwide quarantine was wound down next week.

About 8.4 million workers have been furloughed, tens of thousands have lost their jobs and many self-employed workers\u2019 incomes have taken a hit.</p> \n<p>Even the lives of those who are still in work may have changed dramatically. Working from home has become the norm for many, and employees at some firms have already been told this will carry on until at least the autumn. Meanwhile, physical distancing measures are likely to remain for many more months and a whole swathe of events, from holidays to festivals to weddings, have been cancelled. And behind all of this is a virus that can be deadly.</p> \n<p>With all of this in mind, it\u2019s possible your financial set-up no longer matches your lifestyle and needs. Guardian Money has put together a guide to getting everything in order as we all adapt to new ways of going about our daily lives.</p> \n<h2><strong>Reducing household costs</strong></h2> \n<ul> \n <li>Wholesale <strong>energy prices</strong> have dropped as a result of factories and businesses being closed and demand for fuel falling across the world. The very cheapest dual gas and electricity tariffs cost \u00a3750 a year for a medium-sized house with average consumption. Households on their supplier\u2019s capped standard tariff will typically save more than \u00a3300 a year by switching. Tonik Energy\u2019s green super power v4 tariff is arguably the pick of the cheapest deals and it\u2019s fixed for a year. Prices have fallen so much that those on fixed deals bought before March should consider moving supplier too and pay any exit fees. Use <a href=\"http://energyhelpline.com/\">Energyhelpline.com</a> to find out what your household can save. </li> \n <li>Housing is likely to be your biggest outlay. If you have a <strong>mortgage</strong> and have taken a three-month payment holiday, you may be aware that on 22 May the government said people can extend this for a further three months (the first ones were due to come to an end in June). Meanwhile, those who are struggling but have not yet taken a mortgage payment holiday will have until 31 October to apply. However, there are also other options available to borrowers, either now or at the end of the holiday. Two of the main ones are temporarily switching to interest-only payments and increasing the length of the mortgage term. Both will reduce your monthly payments but there\u2019s a price to pay. For example, increasing the mortgage term will ultimately mean paying a lot more interest. </li> \n <li>Most local authorities are offering <strong>council tax</strong> payment holidays to those struggling but you have to ask for one, and there is no guarantee the answer will be yes. Those on universal credit or low incomes may be able to get their bill reduced, or in some cases waived. The amount of reduction depends on your circumstances and the council. On top of the discount, in England, you may also get an extra \u00a3150 off your bill, backed by a \u00a3500m Covid-19 hardship fund. </li> \n</ul> \n<h2><strong>Making up for lost income</strong></h2> \n<ul> \n <li>You may be entitled to <strong>benefits</strong> to top up your earnings. Anna Stevenson from the advice charity Turn2Us says it is \u201cvery difficult to talk in specific sums because each household\u2019s claim is different, depending on the rent they pay and a host of other factors, including the number of children etc\u201d. The charity has <a href=\"https://benefits-calculator.turn2us.org.uk/AboutYou\">a benefits calculator</a> on its website, which will help you work out what you can claim.Households who receive working tax credits and whose annual income is expected to be more than \u00a32,500 different to the previous tax year should contact HM Revenue &amp; Customs and declare a change of circumstances, which should bring a change in payments. Stevenson says some people on working tax credits, which are typically no longer available to new claimants, may be better off switching to universal credit but they should use a calculator to check before they make a claim. </li> \n <li>Are you a higher earner with children who has suffered a drop in income due to the pandemic? If your income is set to be less than \u00a360,000, then get your <strong>child benefit</strong> restarted. It\u2019s worth \u00a31,820 a year for a family with two children. Under the high-income child benefit charge (HICBC), if you or your partner earn more than \u00a350,000 a year, the benefit is progressively clawed back through the tax system until it is worth nothing on incomes over \u00a360,000. Thousands of parents who opted out of receiving child benefit, or never started claiming in the first place, because they had to pay the HICBC will be eligible to claim or restart the payments. To restart child benefit, either fill in an online form or call <a href=\"tel:0300%20200%203100\">0300 200 3100</a>. For more information go to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-tax-charge/restart-child-benefit\">gov.uk/child-benefit-tax-charge/restart-child-benefit</a>. </li> \n <li>If your salary has dropped below \u00a350,000 as a result of the crisis, there could be \u00a3250 with your name on it, courtesy of the <strong>marriage allowance</strong>. This tax break lets one partner transfer \u00a31,250 of his or her personal allowance to their other half, thereby reducing that person\u2019s tax by up to \u00a3250 in the current tax year. You can claim it provided all of the following apply: you are married or in a civil partnership; one partner\u2019s income is below \u00a312,500, or nothing; and the other partner\u2019s income is between \u00a312,501 and \u00a350,000, or \u00a343,430 in Scotland. HMRC will typically give the recipient partner their extra allowance either by changing their tax code or via the self-assessment system. Applying online is simple \u2013 go to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/apply-marriage-allowance\">gov.uk/apply-marriage-allowance</a>.</li> \n</ul> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"74a2e58f68b990acad151eb159e954356d4d729c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74a2e58f68b990acad151eb159e954356d4d729c/84_10_1403_1403/1000.png\" alt=\"car\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">car</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Ryan Gillert</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Travel and transport</h2> \n<ul> \n <li>If your <strong>car</strong> has not moved for the past few months, why not furlough it? Insurers generally won\u2019t let you pause your car insurance but you can cancel it and take a refund of the remaining months. You can tell the DVLA you are taking the car off the road with a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/make-a-sorn\">statutory off road notification (Sorn)</a> and cancel the policy. Check the savings and fees you will have to pay before you go ahead. You will also save the car tax for any full months it is off the road. But be aware that the vehicle has to be physically off the highway, on a driveway or similar. The big downside, of course, is that it will not be covered if it is stolen. </li> \n <li>Even if you still need a car, you may be using it less than when you bought your policy. Churchill and Direct Line are among the <strong>insurers</strong> offering refunds to drivers who are in this position. You need to get in touch with your new mileage during lockdown and they will give you cash back based on the difference between that number and the figure you declared when you bought the policy. Check if your insurer is doing the same. If it isn\u2019t but your policy is coming to an end, don\u2019t let it renew without adjusting the mileage you are paying for. </li> \n <li>If you no longer need a car you are buying on <strong>finance</strong>, you can hand it back, provided you have paid back at least half the money owed on it. Section 99 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 sets out how you can voluntarily terminate a regulated hire purchase or personal contract purchase (PCP) agreement. With a PCP, the buyer puts down a deposit, makes perhaps three or four years\u2019 monthly payments, and then a final balloon payment at the end of the term if they wish to keep the car. If you have paid half the value of the vehicle, you can ask for a voluntary termination. If you are near 50%, you can opt to pay the difference to get you there. You hand the car back and escape the rest of the payments. Be aware that no refunds are given if you paid more than 50%. Those with HP agreements can hand the car back sooner, typically halfway through the term, as there are no balloon payments. The <a href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/cut-your-car-finance-hire-purchase-and-other-finance-costs#when-should-i-end-my-finance-deal-early\">Money Advice Service website</a> has some good advice on the process. A voluntary termination will show up on your credit file but should not negatively affect your <a href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/how-to-improve-your-credit-rating\">credit score</a>, it says.</li> \n <li><strong>Bike</strong> sales have been soaring during the pandemic. You may want to consider buying a bike through your employer\u2019s cycle to work scheme, which will allow you to save 25-39% of the cost. Employees who sign up get a voucher, which they take to their local bike shop and use to buy their chosen equipment, including lights and clothing. The savings come through the fact that you don\u2019t pay income tax or national insurance on the purchase price. In reality, your employer buys a bike for you, and you \u201chire\u201d it back, making monthly payments from your gross (pre-tax) salary, typically over four years. Basic-rate taxpayers save a quarter on the cost of the bike and accessories. Higher-rate taxpayers save about 40%. Technically, the bike belongs to your employer until the end of the four years, at which point there is an ownership fee payable. Buy a decent lock and insurance, as the payments must still be made even if the machine has been stolen. You don\u2019t have to ride the bike to work to use the scheme but most new applicants will be planning to do just that. </li> \n <li><strong>Rail</strong> commuters who expect to carry on working from home can still apply for a rail season ticket refund, backdated up to 56 days. Passengers have to go back to the rail company that sold them it, either in person at the ticket office or online. Be aware that you will not get the cost of the annual ticket divided by 12, with each unused month returned. Refunds are calculated as the difference between the season ticket\u2019s cost, and that of the cheapest way to make the same journeys without it, using monthly, weekly or daily tickets. Use a refund calculator, such as<a href=\"https://www.southeasternrailway.co.uk/help-and-contact/get-in-touch/coronavirus-refund-information\"> the one</a> from Southeastern. Some passengers have received in excess of \u00a32,500 back. </li> \n</ul> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"522231a534ff172aa32810c8555c92908639f5ef\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/522231a534ff172aa32810c8555c92908639f5ef/0_0_1359_2552/533.png\" alt=\"money\" width=\"533\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">money</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Ryan Gillert</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Change the way you pay</strong><br></h2> \n<ul> \n <li>Millions of older people left trapped in their homes after the coronavirus struck found that without an online <strong>bank account</strong>, day-to-day banking has been near-impossible. Halifax said the numbers of over-65s signing up for online banking has jumped by 63% and their use of contactless has also soared. Santander says the over-55s have flocked online during the pandemic, with numbers up 54%. Signing up for an online bank account is relatively easy. You don\u2019t have to have a smartphone but it helps. If not, use a home computer instead. Either try your existing bank or set up an account with one of the app-based providers such as Monzo, Starling and Revolut. </li> \n <li>The pandemic and physical distancing have already forced many of us to adapt our <strong>payment</strong> habits. If you haven\u2019t already, check out <a href=\"https://paym.co.uk/\">Paym</a>, the free service launched in 2014 that allows you to send or receive money with any UK mobile phone number without sharing your bank details. Industry body Pay.UK says it is safe and efficient, with 15 banks and building societies offering the service, including all the big ones. Watch out for fake messages, which have recently been impersonating Paym and asking customers to follow a link to receive money.</li> \n <li>We are highly likely to see many businesses closing their doors for good because of the coronavirus. From a consumer point of view, remember that paying by <strong>credit card</strong> gives you added legal protection if the company you are buying from goes bust. If you use your credit card to buy something costing more than \u00a3100 and up to \u00a330,000, you are covered by section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. This means the card company has equal responsibility with the seller if the company you bought from fails. If you pay with a debit card, you might be able to make a claim later for a refund under the <a href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/how-youre-protected-when-you-pay-by-card\">chargeback</a> scheme. This is an agreement the likes of Visa and Mastercard have signed up to. The card company will try to claim your money back from the company you have paid by reversing the transaction. Be aware that time limits apply for making a claim.</li> \n <li>Even though the lockdown is easing (with outdoor markets and car showrooms in England reopening from 1 June, and other non-essential retailers from 15 June), going to the <strong>shops</strong> is likely to remain a rigmarole. Physical distancing rules will restrict the number of people who can be in a store at any one time and shoppers will have to contend with closed changing rooms, restrictions on touching merchandise and one-way systems. If there are things you buy every time you go and you can afford to pay slightly more for them, you could consider looking into a subscription from an independent retailer. You can arrange regular deliveries of all kinds of foods, including ground coffee, cheese, bacon and wine. Away from the kitchen, some small book stores are offering to send you a book a month for a year. This is not likely to be a way to save money but will prevent you having to visit a shop and could help save a small business. </li> \n <li>Similarly, a <strong>milkman</strong> can help you cut out trips to the shops. Many deliver non-dairy substitutes as well as the traditional pint. The website <a href=\"https://www.findmeamilkman.net/\">Findmeamilkman.net</a> can help you find one that covers your area but it doesn\u2019t seem to be exhaustive so ask neighbours or use Google. Some of the larger companies such as <a href=\"https://www.milkandmore.co.uk/\">Milk &amp; More</a> carry other products, including bread, vegetables and drinks. </li> \n <li>In terms of <strong>returns and refunds</strong>, retailers have generally updated their policies since the start of the outbreak, allowing customers to return items after physical stores reopen and extending online returns periods. This is typically between one and two months. The consumer group Which? put pressure on laggard retailers, which were not being quite so generous. Your consumer rights are not affected by the disruption to retail caused by the outbreak, although refunds are taking longer to process as stores and their customer services staff buckle under the strain. </li> \n</ul> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cc39d63feea95b7a65b3b0e6de10757b8075f1d0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc39d63feea95b7a65b3b0e6de10757b8075f1d0/0_0_1463_1508/970.png\" alt=\"hide\" width=\"970\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">hide</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Ryan Gillert</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Stashing your savings</strong></h2> \n<ul> \n <li>While the coronavirus crisis has been a financial disaster for many people, the bald truth is that many others are feeling better off at the moment because they are spending so little. If that is you, now\u2019s the time to build a <strong>financial safety cushion</strong> with some of the money you have saved as a result of the lockdown. Financial planners typically suggest we need three to six months\u2019 worth of expenses as a <a href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/emergency-savings-how-much-is-enough\">rainy day fund</a> but a study in 2018 found 70% of the UK\u2019s workers were \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jan/25/uk-workers-chronically-broke-study-economic-insecurity\">chronically broke</a>\u201d, with almost no proper savings. If you are lucky enough to have spare cash, channel it towards a savings account. The interest rate may not be great but by separating it from your everyday spending account, you will make it harder to access and force yourself to think twice before using the money. Check out <a href=\"https://moneyfacts.co.uk/savings-accounts/\">Moneyfacts.co.uk for the best rates on different types of accounts</a>. </li> \n <li>Rebuild your <strong>pension</strong> with some of that money you are not spending. According to adviser Kirsty Stone of The Private Office, if you are in your mid-40s and can afford to put an extra \u00a3100 a month into your pension, it could be worth an extra \u00a342,000 in terms of your pension pot by the time you are 65. If you can set aside an additional \u00a3250 a month, it could be worth an extra \u00a3100,000, using standard assumptions. You could also contact your HR department at work and ask them to increase the contributions that are taken from your pay. That way, you will receive either 20% or 40% tax relief, depending on your pay. If you are fortunate, you may find your company offers an additional voluntary contribution (AVC) scheme where it will match or partially match whatever you put in. But remember it\u2019s a pension so you can\u2019t access the money until you are at least 55. </li> \n</ul> \n<h2><strong>Catastrophe planning</strong></h2> \n<ul> \n <li>Make sure you have a <strong>will</strong> and it is up to date. Check in with older relatives too. The majority of Britons haven\u2019t made a will. However, some trade unions offer members free will-writing. So do several charities, including Cancer Research and the British Heart Foundation. These will work if your family setup is quite straightforward. If your financial or family situations are at all complicated, it will be worth paying for legal advice. Use the Law Society website <a href=\"https://solicitors.lawsociety.org.uk/\">solicitors.lawsociety.org.uk</a> to find a local solicitor. </li> \n <li>With foreign holidays and many other trips on hold, those lucky enough to have a garden will be spending a lot of time in it this year so it is not surprising that people are flocking to garden centres to invest in their outdoor space. But if you are splashing out on expensive barbecues, patio furniture and children\u2019s play equipment, dig out your <strong>home insurance</strong> to check you are covered. The average British garden contains \u00a31,457 worth of valuable items, according to MoneySuperMarket. But financial information firm Defaqto says about 10% of home insurance policies did not cover items left in the garden as standard. Of the policies that do offer cover, many have low limits for these items, typically \u00a31,000 or less, as outdoor space cannot be secured in the same way that a home is. Minimise the risk by bringing items inside or storing them in a locked shed or garage, where possible. If you have had to splash out on new technology to teach the kids, make sure your kit is covered by your home insurance policy. Lots of home insurance will cover all but the most expensive equipment as a matter of course but check the small print in case you need to increase your cover. If you are a renter and have never bothered to buy insurance for your belongings before, it may be worth doing so now. The price comparison sites will help you find a policy that suits you. </li> \n <li>The pandemic and its fallout have prompted many people to take another look at how much <strong>life insurance</strong> cover they have, with some companies saying many more younger people are buying it. Straightforward life insurance is still widely available and nearly all policies, even those taken out today, will pay out if the death is due to coronavirus. Note that the price rises steeply as you get older. We obtained a quote from Aviva this week where the cost was \u00a38.42 a month for a 37-year-old seeking a payout of \u00a3100,000 should they die in the next 15 years. But if the person was 57, the premium shot up to \u00a345.22 a month.</li> \n <li>If your concern is about losing your job and not being able to pay the monthly bills, things have become a lot tougher. Many of the big price comparison sites that sell insurance have stopped providing quotes for <strong>unemployment cover</strong>. You can in theory still obtain income protection cover that pays out if you become sick with coronavirus. We got quotes for an office worker aged in his mid- to late 30s, on an income of \u00a340,000 a year, which would pay an income of \u00a31,650 a month for the next 12 months. LV=, Royal London and Legal &amp; General all came back with quotes at about \u00a320-\u00a322 a month. It\u2019s crucial to check what the minimum amount of time is that you would have to be off sick to get a payout. Most policies don\u2019t cover short periods of illness \u2013 the minimum period can be a month, or a lot longer \u2013 so you would probably have to be ill with coronavirus for a very long time to get a payout.</li> \n</ul> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7a1579f1bf1bca83376d6cf83d335f648f95e3ae\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a1579f1bf1bca83376d6cf83d335f648f95e3ae/0_0_959_2746/349.png\" alt=\"Coron\" width=\"349\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coron</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Ryan Gillert</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Other spending</strong></h2> \n<ul> \n <li>Review <strong>memberships and subscriptions</strong> to check you can still afford to pay them and are getting what you want.

Royal Bank of Scotland said this month it will distribute additional gear such as office chairs, folding desks and screens to those who need it.

You can\u2019t claim for things you use for both your work and in a private capacity, such as your broadband. Accountants Blick Rothenberg point out HMRC allows employees who don\u2019t already complete a self-assessment tax return to make claims of up to \u00a32,500 on employment-related expenses incurred in a tax year by using form P87. Check out HMRC\u2019s website for more information.

      "bodyText": "The coronavirus crisis has had a huge impact on all of us. About 8.4 million workers have been furloughed, tens of thousands have lost their jobs and many self-employed workers\u2019 incomes have taken a hit. Even the lives of those who are still in work may have changed dramatically. Working from home has become the norm for many, and employees at some firms have already been told this will carry on until at least the autumn. Meanwhile, physical distancing measures are likely to remain for many more months and a whole swathe of events, from holidays to festivals to weddings, have been cancelled. And behind all of this is a virus that can be deadly. With all of this in mind, it\u2019s possible your financial set-up no longer matches your lifestyle and needs. Guardian Money has put together a guide to getting everything in order as we all adapt to new ways of going about our daily lives. Reducing household costs Wholesale energy prices have dropped as a result of factories and businesses being closed and demand for fuel falling across the world. The very cheapest dual gas and electricity tariffs cost \u00a3750 a year for a medium-sized house with average consumption. Households on their supplier\u2019s capped standard tariff will typically save more than \u00a3300 a year by switching. Tonik Energy\u2019s green super power v4 tariff is arguably the pick of the cheapest deals and it\u2019s fixed for a year. Prices have fallen so much that those on fixed deals bought before March should consider moving supplier too and pay any exit fees. Use Energyhelpline.com to find out what your household can save. Housing is likely to be your biggest outlay. If you have a mortgage and have taken a three-month payment holiday, you may be aware that on 22 May the government said people can extend this for a further three months (the first ones were due to come to an end in June). Meanwhile, those who are struggling but have not yet taken a mortgage payment holiday will have until 31 October to apply. However, there are also other options available to borrowers, either now or at the end of the holiday. Two of the main ones are temporarily switching to interest-only payments and increasing the length of the mortgage term. Both will reduce your monthly payments but there\u2019s a price to pay. For example, increasing the mortgage term will ultimately mean paying a lot more interest. Most local authorities are offering council tax payment holidays to those struggling but you have to ask for one, and there is no guarantee the answer will be yes. Those on universal credit or low incomes may be able to get their bill reduced, or in some cases waived. The amount of reduction depends on your circumstances and the council. On top of the discount, in England, you may also get an extra \u00a3150 off your bill, backed by a \u00a3500m Covid-19 hardship fund. Making up for lost income You may be entitled to benefits to top up your earnings. Anna Stevenson from the advice charity Turn2Us says it is \u201cvery difficult to talk in specific sums because each household\u2019s claim is different, depending on the rent they pay and a host of other factors, including the number of children etc\u201d. The charity has a benefits calculator on its website, which will help you work out what you can claim.Households who receive working tax credits and whose annual income is expected to be more than \u00a32,500 different to the previous tax year should contact HM Revenue &amp; Customs and declare a change of circumstances, which should bring a change in payments. Stevenson says some people on working tax credits, which are typically no longer available to new claimants, may be better off switching to universal credit but they should use a calculator to check before they make a claim. Are you a higher earner with children who has suffered a drop in income due to the pandemic? If your income is set to be less than \u00a360,000, then get your child benefit restarted. It\u2019s worth \u00a31,820 a year for a family with two children. Under the high-income child benefit charge (HICBC), if you or your partner earn more than \u00a350,000 a year, the benefit is progressively clawed back through the tax system until it is worth nothing on incomes over \u00a360,000. Thousands of parents who opted out of receiving child benefit, or never started claiming in the first place, because they had to pay the HICBC will be eligible to claim or restart the payments. To restart child benefit, either fill in an online form or call 0300 200 3100. For more information go to gov.uk/child-benefit-tax-charge/restart-child-benefit. If your salary has dropped below \u00a350,000 as a result of the crisis, there could be \u00a3250 with your name on it, courtesy of the marriage allowance. This tax break lets one partner transfer \u00a31,250 of his or her personal allowance to their other half, thereby reducing that person\u2019s tax by up to \u00a3250 in the current tax year. You can claim it provided all of the following apply: you are married or in a civil partnership; one partner\u2019s income is below \u00a312,500, or nothing; and the other partner\u2019s income is between \u00a312,501 and \u00a350,000, or \u00a343,430 in Scotland. HMRC will typically give the recipient partner their extra allowance either by changing their tax code or via the self-assessment system. Applying online is simple \u2013 go to gov.uk/apply-marriage-allowance. Travel and transport If your car has not moved for the past few months, why not furlough it? Insurers generally won\u2019t let you pause your car insurance but you can cancel it and take a refund of the remaining months. You can tell the DVLA you are taking the car off the road with a statutory off road notification (Sorn) and cancel the policy. Check the savings and fees you will have to pay before you go ahead. You will also save the car tax for any full months it is off the road. But be aware that the vehicle has to be physically off the highway, on a driveway or similar. The big downside, of course, is that it will not be covered if it is stolen. Even if you still need a car, you may be using it less than when you bought your policy. Churchill and Direct Line are among the insurers offering refunds to drivers who are in this position. You need to get in touch with your new mileage during lockdown and they will give you cash back based on the difference between that number and the figure you declared when you bought the policy. Check if your insurer is doing the same. If it isn\u2019t but your policy is coming to an end, don\u2019t let it renew without adjusting the mileage you are paying for. If you no longer need a car you are buying on finance, you can hand it back, provided you have paid back at least half the money owed on it. Section 99 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 sets out how you can voluntarily terminate a regulated hire purchase or personal contract purchase (PCP) agreement. With a PCP, the buyer puts down a deposit, makes perhaps three or four years\u2019 monthly payments, and then a final balloon payment at the end of the term if they wish to keep the car. If you have paid half the value of the vehicle, you can ask for a voluntary termination. If you are near 50%, you can opt to pay the difference to get you there. You hand the car back and escape the rest of the payments. Be aware that no refunds are given if you paid more than 50%. Those with HP agreements can hand the car back sooner, typically halfway through the term, as there are no balloon payments. The Money Advice Service website has some good advice on the process. A voluntary termination will show up on your credit file but should not negatively affect your credit score, it says. Bike sales have been soaring during the pandemic. You may want to consider buying a bike through your employer\u2019s cycle to work scheme, which will allow you to save 25-39% of the cost. Employees who sign up get a voucher, which they take to their local bike shop and use to buy their chosen equipment, including lights and clothing. The savings come through the fact that you don\u2019t pay income tax or national insurance on the purchase price. In reality, your employer buys a bike for you, and you \u201chire\u201d it back, making monthly payments from your gross (pre-tax) salary, typically over four years. Basic-rate taxpayers save a quarter on the cost of the bike and accessories. Higher-rate taxpayers save about 40%. Technically, the bike belongs to your employer until the end of the four years, at which point there is an ownership fee payable. Buy a decent lock and insurance, as the payments must still be made even if the machine has been stolen. You don\u2019t have to ride the bike to work to use the scheme but most new applicants will be planning to do just that. Rail commuters who expect to carry on working from home can still apply for a rail season ticket refund, backdated up to 56 days. Passengers have to go back to the rail company that sold them it, either in person at the ticket office or online. Be aware that you will not get the cost of the annual ticket divided by 12, with each unused month returned. Refunds are calculated as the difference between the season ticket\u2019s cost, and that of the cheapest way to make the same journeys without it, using monthly, weekly or daily tickets. Use a refund calculator, such as the one from Southeastern. Some passengers have received in excess of \u00a32,500 back. Change the way you pay Millions of older people left trapped in their homes after the coronavirus struck found that without an online bank account, day-to-day banking has been near-impossible. Halifax said the numbers of over-65s signing up for online banking has jumped by 63% and their use of contactless has also soared. Santander says the over-55s have flocked online during the pandemic, with numbers up 54%. Signing up for an online bank account is relatively easy. You don\u2019t have to have a smartphone but it helps. If not, use a home computer instead. Either try your existing bank or set up an account with one of the app-based providers such as Monzo, Starling and Revolut. The pandemic and physical distancing have already forced many of us to adapt our payment habits. If you haven\u2019t already, check out Paym, the free service launched in 2014 that allows you to send or receive money with any UK mobile phone number without sharing your bank details. Industry body Pay.UK says it is safe and efficient, with 15 banks and building societies offering the service, including all the big ones. Watch out for fake messages, which have recently been impersonating Paym and asking customers to follow a link to receive money. We are highly likely to see many businesses closing their doors for good because of the coronavirus. From a consumer point of view, remember that paying by credit card gives you added legal protection if the company you are buying from goes bust. If you use your credit card to buy something costing more than \u00a3100 and up to \u00a330,000, you are covered by section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. This means the card company has equal responsibility with the seller if the company you bought from fails. If you pay with a debit card, you might be able to make a claim later for a refund under the chargeback scheme. This is an agreement the likes of Visa and Mastercard have signed up to. The card company will try to claim your money back from the company you have paid by reversing the transaction. Be aware that time limits apply for making a claim. Even though the lockdown is easing (with outdoor markets and car showrooms in England reopening from 1 June, and other non-essential retailers from 15 June), going to the shops is likely to remain a rigmarole. Physical distancing rules will restrict the number of people who can be in a store at any one time and shoppers will have to contend with closed changing rooms, restrictions on touching merchandise and one-way systems. If there are things you buy every time you go and you can afford to pay slightly more for them, you could consider looking into a subscription from an independent retailer. You can arrange regular deliveries of all kinds of foods, including ground coffee, cheese, bacon and wine. Away from the kitchen, some small book stores are offering to send you a book a month for a year. This is not likely to be a way to save money but will prevent you having to visit a shop and could help save a small business. Similarly, a milkman can help you cut out trips to the shops. Many deliver non-dairy substitutes as well as the traditional pint. The website Findmeamilkman.net can help you find one that covers your area but it doesn\u2019t seem to be exhaustive so ask neighbours or use Google. Some of the larger companies such as Milk &amp; More carry other products, including bread, vegetables and drinks. In terms of returns and refunds, retailers have generally updated their policies since the start of the outbreak, allowing customers to return items after physical stores reopen and extending online returns periods. This is typically between one and two months. The consumer group Which? put pressure on laggard retailers, which were not being quite so generous. Your consumer rights are not affected by the disruption to retail caused by the outbreak, although refunds are taking longer to process as stores and their customer services staff buckle under the strain. Stashing your savings While the coronavirus crisis has been a financial disaster for many people, the bald truth is that many others are feeling better off at the moment because they are spending so little. If that is you, now\u2019s the time to build a financial safety cushion with some of the money you have saved as a result of the lockdown. Financial planners typically suggest we need three to six months\u2019 worth of expenses as a rainy day fund but a study in 2018 found 70% of the UK\u2019s workers were \u201cchronically broke\u201d, with almost no proper savings. If you are lucky enough to have spare cash, channel it towards a savings account. The interest rate may not be great but by separating it from your everyday spending account, you will make it harder to access and force yourself to think twice before using the money. Check out Moneyfacts.co.uk for the best rates on different types of accounts. Rebuild your pension with some of that money you are not spending. According to adviser Kirsty Stone of The Private Office, if you are in your mid-40s and can afford to put an extra \u00a3100 a month into your pension, it could be worth an extra \u00a342,000 in terms of your pension pot by the time you are 65. If you can set aside an additional \u00a3250 a month, it could be worth an extra \u00a3100,000, using standard assumptions. You could also contact your HR department at work and ask them to increase the contributions that are taken from your pay. That way, you will receive either 20% or 40% tax relief, depending on your pay. If you are fortunate, you may find your company offers an additional voluntary contribution (AVC) scheme where it will match or partially match whatever you put in. But remember it\u2019s a pension so you can\u2019t access the money until you are at least 55. Catastrophe planning Make sure you have a will and it is up to date. Check in with older relatives too. The majority of Britons haven\u2019t made a will. However, some trade unions offer members free will-writing. So do several charities, including Cancer Research and the British Heart Foundation. These will work if your family setup is quite straightforward. If your financial or family situations are at all complicated, it will be worth paying for legal advice. Use the Law Society website solicitors.lawsociety.org.uk to find a local solicitor. With foreign holidays and many other trips on hold, those lucky enough to have a garden will be spending a lot of time in it this year so it is not surprising that people are flocking to garden centres to invest in their outdoor space. But if you are splashing out on expensive barbecues, patio furniture and children\u2019s play equipment, dig out your home insurance to check you are covered. The average British garden contains \u00a31,457 worth of valuable items, according to MoneySuperMarket. But financial information firm Defaqto says about 10% of home insurance policies did not cover items left in the garden as standard. Of the policies that do offer cover, many have low limits for these items, typically \u00a31,000 or less, as outdoor space cannot be secured in the same way that a home is. Minimise the risk by bringing items inside or storing them in a locked shed or garage, where possible. If you have had to splash out on new technology to teach the kids, make sure your kit is covered by your home insurance policy. Lots of home insurance will cover all but the most expensive equipment as a matter of course but check the small print in case you need to increase your cover.

But if the person was 57, the premium shot up to \u00a345.22 a month. If your concern is about losing your job and not being able to pay the monthly bills, things have become a lot tougher. Many of the big price comparison sites that sell insurance have stopped providing quotes for unemployment cover. You can in theory still obtain income protection cover that pays out if you become sick with coronavirus. We got quotes for an office worker aged in his mid- to late 30s, on an income of \u00a340,000 a year, which would pay an income of \u00a31,650 a month for the next 12 months. LV=, Royal London and Legal &amp; General all came back with quotes at about \u00a320-\u00a322 a month. It\u2019s crucial to check what the minimum amount of time is that you would have to be off sick to get a payout. Most policies don\u2019t cover short periods of illness \u2013 the minimum period can be a month, or a lot longer \u2013 so you would probably have to be ill with coronavirus for a very long time to get a payout. Other spending Review memberships and subscriptions to check you can still afford to pay them and are getting what you want.

With some teetering on the edge of bankruptcy and no guarantee there will not be another lockdown later in the year, you may want to opt for monthly payments rather than paying for a year upfront. David Lloyd, which has 100 tennis and racquet clubs in the UK, is gradually reopening but only for outdoor tennis. It has decided to maintain its freeze on membership fees until its clubs are fully open but has not announced what will happen next. The National Trust is a charity and is keen for members to continue to donate to support its work. It says for a limited period only, it is letting members have a 25% discount when they renew their annual membership.

The older childcare vouchers cannot be refunded but if you have this type of account, you can suspend payments while you are not using it. To stay in the scheme, you need to start them again within 52 weeks. The new workplace If you are going to be working from home for several more months, as seems to be the case for many of us, it\u2019s vital you have the right equipment, such as a suitable chair and desk, to ensure a healthy and productive work environment. Research from the Institute of Workplace and Facilities Management earlier this month found just under a quarter (24%) of the employees it questioned had a separate home office, with almost two-thirds (64%) resorting to makeshift workstations on dining room tables, sofas and beds. Some employers are going as far as couriering a van full of kit to their home-working staff, while others are doing little or nothing. Royal Bank of Scotland said this month it will distribute additional gear such as office chairs, folding desks and screens to those who need it. Meanwhile, the BBC said staff can apply for an interest-free loan of up to \u00a3250 (with repayments deducted from net salary), which they can use to buy modest equipment to help them work from home more comfortably. Ask your employer what it can do to help you. Which? has published a helpful list of tips, which also includes recommendations for home office chairs and desks. You may be able to claim tax relief for your job expenses now that you are working from home. You can typically only claim for things that are solely related to your work \u2013 for example, business phone calls or the extra cost of gas and electricity for your \u201coffice\u201d area. You can\u2019t claim for things you use for both your work and in a private capacity, such as your broadband.

The gov.uk/tax-relief-for-employees page includes sections on working from home and buying substantial equipment that you have to have to do your work. This page on form P87 may also be useful. Is your home broadband up to scratch? Don\u2019t put up with a shoddy service. If yours is limping along at the moment, there are things you can do. You may want to ask your existing provider whether it can upgrade you to a faster fibre package without any loss of service or the need for an engineer visit. And there are various tips and gadgets that might help. Switching broadband provider is of course an option, and may be the best bet for some. Most people won\u2019t require a home visit from an engineer. Comparethemarket.com recently said there had been considerable demand for faster broadband packages since the lockdown restrictions began. In terms of other homeworking costs, try to make use of the technology available for business calls and meetings \u2013 Zoom, Skype and so on \u2013 rather than racking up phone costs that, with all the chaos, you may never get around to claiming back. Strictly speaking, everyone should probably notify their buildings and contents insurer(s) if they are going to be working at home for a while \u2013 particularly if they have bought expensive new gear to help them do their job. Similarly, you are responsible for checking that working from home will not cause any problems with your mortgage or tenancy agreement.",

Later on Friday the former vice-president in a video address called for national unity and serious police reform, saying: \u201cThis is no time for incendiary tweets. This is no time to encourage violence. This is a national crisis, and we need real leadership right now.\u201d</p> \n<p>Shortly afterward at a separate press conference in the Rose Garden where the president seemed poised to follow up and further address Floyd\u2019s death and the riots, Trump instead announced that the US would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/trump-who-china-white-house-us\">withdraw from the World Health Organization</a>.</p> \n<p>He did not mention the riots or Floyd\u2019s death.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Biden revealed he had already spoken to Floyd\u2019s grieving family and spoke emotionally of the shock at his killing and society\u2019s racial problems. \u201cWe\u2019re a country with an open wound.

At the same time, Walz also stressed the importance that he and other officials maintain order during the protests. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"92e6b8aecce86f47c1bf941b91d03413c00f36d0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92e6b8aecce86f47c1bf941b91d03413c00f36d0/0_104_3500_2395/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters gather outside the Hennepin county government center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on 28 May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"684\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters gather outside the Hennepin county government center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on 28 May.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Miller/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But that was not the uniform reaction among other major political figures. The Delaware senator Chris Coons, a member of the Senate judiciary committee, argued on Fox News that that panel should \u201clook into the whole string of tragic killings, of incidents that are deeply wounding to our country, of police violence and then of response by communities\u201d.</p> \n<p>Some members of Congress <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chiproytx/status/1266332408493805568\">tweeted</a> dismay at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/black-cnn-reporter-arrested-on-air-minneapolis-protests-george-floyd-killing\">arrest of a CNN crew</a> on Thursday night.

      "bodyText": "Riots in Minneapolis and across the US triggered by video footage showing George Floyd, a black man, killed under the knee of a police officer, has caused a dramatic shift in the national political debate in America and thrust race to the center of the stage. Donald Trump and Joe Biden offered divergent responses that point to an even more divisive political debate on race relations and between Democrats and Republicans playing out in the months ahead. The president, in a tweet in the early hours of Friday, warned that \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts\u201d. Later on Friday the former vice-president in a video address called for national unity and serious police reform, saying: \u201cThis is no time for incendiary tweets. This is no time to encourage violence. This is a national crisis, and we need real leadership right now.\u201d Shortly afterward at a separate press conference in the Rose Garden where the president seemed poised to follow up and further address Floyd\u2019s death and the riots, Trump instead announced that the US would withdraw from the World Health Organization. He did not mention the riots or Floyd\u2019s death. Meanwhile, Biden revealed he had already spoken to Floyd\u2019s grieving family and spoke emotionally of the shock at his killing and society\u2019s racial problems. \u201cWe\u2019re a country with an open wound. None of us any longer can hear the words \u2018I can\u2019t breathe\u2019 and do nothing,\u201d he said. The wildly different responses by the two men battling for the White House under the ongoing cloud of the coronavirus pandemic has left party leaders unsure of what exactly the final months of the presidential election will now look like. But leaders and strategists agree on one thing: the months ahead are likely to be a bareknuckle brawl over what the most pressing problems facing the US are. \u201cThe question is whether Democrats are going to adjust to the reality of what is going to be a brutal, vicious and mean campaign cycle and if we don\u2019t, we\u2019re going to lose,\u201d said the former Atlanta mayor Kasim Reed. Bakari Sellers, a former member of the South Carolina house of representatives, said: \u201cThe president usually thrives on culture wars. But I think this flame is probably going to engulf his presidency.\u201d Leah Daughtry, a veteran Democratic political operative, warned Trump\u2019s late-night tweet on shooting looters was a deliberate attempt to incite his base of supporters rather than push for unity or any kind of de-escalation of tensions. \u201cI think the president\u2019s tweet does what it\u2019s intended to do and [was] directed to the audience it\u2019s intended for him to reach \u2026 it\u2019s clearly intended to incite and engage a particular part of his audience,\u201d Daughtry said. On Friday, Minnesota\u2019s governor, Tim Walz, visibly frustrated, held an extended press conference where he called for healing and tried to address the long-simmering tensions that have erupted over Floyd\u2019s death. At the same time, Walz also stressed the importance that he and other officials maintain order during the protests. But that was not the uniform reaction among other major political figures. The Delaware senator Chris Coons, a member of the Senate judiciary committee, argued on Fox News that that panel should \u201clook into the whole string of tragic killings, of incidents that are deeply wounding to our country, of police violence and then of response by communities\u201d. Some members of Congress tweeted dismay at the arrest of a CNN crew on Thursday night. But other lawmakers were silent. On Friday afternoon, the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, issued a statement bashing Trump for his \u201cpathetic\u201d Rose Garden event. \u201cOur communities are hurting from senseless murders and years of racism and injustice. But President Trump is only interested in scapegoating and divisiveness when he should be leading,\u201d Schumer said. The lack of anything close to a unified national response highlights the frustration people are feeling, said Wisconsin\u2019s lieutenant governor, Mandela Barnes. \u201cPeople are frustrated and rightfully so. There\u2019s a lot of righteous anger out there and a lot of it is from being ignored, not taken seriously and the allowing of these types of things to continue,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cWhat it feels like is that it\u2019s desensitized people, and I think that it has in a way.\u201d That\u2019s only exacerbated by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, argued the Democratic activist Abdul El-Sayed. \u201cLook, the police have been executing black men in this country for a long time. We\u2019re just now understanding it in the last five to 10 years because everybody\u2019s got a camera in their pocket,\u201d El-Sayed said. \u201cI think people are sick of it but then it\u2019s not just that, it\u2019s the fact that you look at Covid-19, which has been the story for the past four months, rightly so, 100,000 lives lost. Those lives are disproportionately black folks\u2019 lives. As a function of the same exact structural forces that have allowed black people to be executed by law enforcement.\u201d The intense national focus on Floyd\u2019s death and the responses by top political figures comes about a week after Biden\u2019s campaign had to do damage control after the former vice-president suggested during an interview that anyone who supported Trump isn\u2019t really black. At the time, it seemed like Biden was at risk of losing some African American support. But since then that narrative has shifted dramatically. Jim Clyburn, the highest-ranking black Democratic member of Congress, said Friday that the riots damaged the Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar\u2019s chances of being picked as Biden\u2019s running mate due to her record as a prosecutor in the city. Clyburn has argued that Biden should pick an African American woman, which would certainly draw a sharp contrast with Trump. \u201cI think right now what you\u2019re seeing is black voters get to see how Donald Trump reacts to things like this. It\u2019s a reminder of his history, his history of calling on law enforcement to be more aggressive, to be more brutal in their enforcement of the law,\u201d said the Democratic strategist Brandon Davis.

And in Phoenix, highs this weekend are expected to approach or exceed 110F.&nbsp;</p> <p>This year is on track to be one of the hottest on record, and public health officials worry that in cities across the US, summer heatwaves will collide with the coronavirus pandemic, with deadly consequences for poor, minority and older populations.&nbsp;</p> <p>Even before the pandemic hit, heat was killing more Americans than all other natural disasters combined. People who live in cities are especially vulnerable to heatwaves because of a phenomenon called the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/feb/21/urban-heat-islands-cooling-things-down-with-trees-green-roads-and-fewer-cars\">\u201curban heat island effect\u201d</a> \u2013&nbsp;cities with populations of 1 million or more can be up to 5F hotter than surrounding areas due to high population density, a lack of greenery and shade, and because materials like steel, concrete and asphalt tend to absorb more heat.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/feb/21/urban-heat-islands-cooling-things-down-with-trees-green-roads-and-fewer-cars\">Urban heat islands: cooling things down with trees, green roads and fewer cars</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/09/03/754044732/as-rising-heat-bakes-u-s-cities-the-poor-often-feel-it-most\">Analyses</a> have also found that cities\u2019 poorest neighborhoods tend to be <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/12/htm\">hotter</a>, and that many low-income families have been struggling to cope for years. In some neighborhoods of Los Angeles, New York and Chicago, up to a third or more of households lack air conditioning. Due to the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, many more are unable to pay to run their ACs. And even as cities begin reopening after lockdown, many of the malls, public libraries and recreation centers where overheated Americans traditionally went to cool down remain risky, especially for older people and others with a heightened risk of dying from Covid-19.&nbsp;</p> <p>Throughout the country, public health officials told the Guardian they were scrambling to find ways to protect the most vulnerable from the dual threats of heat and coronavirus. \u201cThis summer is definitely not going to be like any other summer,\u201d said Deanne Criswell, the commissioner of New York City Emergency Management. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to have the same level of facilities open that New Yorkers typically go to all the time to stay cool. It\u2019s a big concern.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>New York is in the process of installing 74,000 air conditioners in the homes of low-income seniors, according to Criswell. The city is also seeking to help more people pay for electricity this summer, as the unemployment crisis leaves thousands of New Yorkers without the means to make rent and utilities.

      "bodyText": "Temperatures in some California cities this week broke decades-old records. The heatwave that cooked Las Vegas over the past few days brought temperatures over 100F. And in Phoenix, highs this weekend are expected to approach or exceed 110F. This year is on track to be one of the hottest on record, and public health officials worry that in cities across the US, summer heatwaves will collide with the coronavirus pandemic, with deadly consequences for poor, minority and older populations. Even before the pandemic hit, heat was killing more Americans than all other natural disasters combined. People who live in cities are especially vulnerable to heatwaves because of a phenomenon called the \u201curban heat island effect\u201d \u2013 cities with populations of 1 million or more can be up to 5F hotter than surrounding areas due to high population density, a lack of greenery and shade, and because materials like steel, concrete and asphalt tend to absorb more heat. Analyses have also found that cities\u2019 poorest neighborhoods tend to be hotter, and that many low-income families have been struggling to cope for years. In some neighborhoods of Los Angeles, New York and Chicago, up to a third or more of households lack air conditioning. Due to the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, many more are unable to pay to run their ACs. And even as cities begin reopening after lockdown, many of the malls, public libraries and recreation centers where overheated Americans traditionally went to cool down remain risky, especially for older people and others with a heightened risk of dying from Covid-19. Throughout the country, public health officials told the Guardian they were scrambling to find ways to protect the most vulnerable from the dual threats of heat and coronavirus. \u201cThis summer is definitely not going to be like any other summer,\u201d said Deanne Criswell, the commissioner of New York City Emergency Management. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to have the same level of facilities open that New Yorkers typically go to all the time to stay cool. It\u2019s a big concern.\u201d New York is in the process of installing 74,000 air conditioners in the homes of low-income seniors, according to Criswell. The city is also seeking to help more people pay for electricity this summer, as the unemployment crisis leaves thousands of New Yorkers without the means to make rent and utilities. Other cities across the US have asked utility companies not to shut off service this summer, even if customers can\u2019t pay bills, so that they have access to water, cooling and refrigeration through the hottest days. \u201cEvery summer we worry about the heat when it ramps up \u2013 especially in April and May before people have a chance to acclimatize,\u201d said Carolyn Levering, the emergency management administrator for Las Vegas. \u201cI think it just gives us extra concern this year because of the pandemic.\u201d In Las Vegas, Phoenix and Los Angeles, officials are keeping some cooling centers \u2013 designated public buildings where residents come for cold water and a respite from the heat \u2013 open, at a reduced capacity so people can maintain social distancing while seeking relief from the heat.

      "body": "<p>In April 1936, three years before his death, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/28/irish-poet-wb-yeats-150th-birthday-celebrations\">WB Yeats</a> received a letter from the writer and activist Ethel Mannin. The 70-year-old Yeats was a Nobel prize-winning poet of immense stature and influence, not to mention Mannin\u2019s former lover, and she asked him to join a campaign to free a German pacifist incarcerated by the Nazis. Yeats responded instead with a reading recommendation: \u201cIf you have my poems by you, look up a poem called \u2018The Second Coming\u2019,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt was written some sixteen or seventeen years ago &amp; foretold what is happening. I have written of the same thing again &amp; again since. This will seem little to you with your strong practical sense for it takes fifty years for a poet\u2019s weapons to influence the issue.\u201d</p> <p>Yeats was justified in taking the long view. Written in 1919 and published in 1920, \u201cThe Second Coming\u201d has become perhaps the most plundered poem in the English language. At 164 words, it is short and memorable enough to be famous <em>in toto</em> but it has also been disassembled into its constituent parts by books, albums, movies, TV shows, comic books, computer games, political speeches and newspaper editorials. While many poems in Yeats\u2019s corpus have contributed indelible lines to the storehouse of the cultural imagination (\u201cno country for old men\u201d; \u201cthe foul rag and bone shop of the heart\u201d), \u201cThe Second Coming\u201d consists of almost nothing <em>but</em> such lines. Someone reading it for the first time in 2020 might resemble the apocryphal theatregoer who complained that <em>Hamlet</em> was nothing but a bunch of quotations strung together. Whether or not it is Yeats\u2019s greatest poem, it is by far his most useful. As Auden wrote in \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2007/apr/18/poemoftheday10\">In Memory of WB Yeats</a>\u201d (1939), \u201cThe words of a dead man / Are modified in the guts of the living.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c9f04b8eba3f37b20c08b014a091bb9165c4448e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9f04b8eba3f37b20c08b014a091bb9165c4448e/0_10_2992_1795/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vision of crisis \u2026 south Vietnamese flee Saigon in 1975.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Visions of crisis \u2026 south Vietnamese flee Saigon in 1975.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dirck Halstead/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the world is wrenched out of joint by the coronavirus pandemic, many people are turning to poetry for wisdom and consolation, but \u201cThe Second Coming\u201d fulfils a different role, as it has done in crisis after crisis, from the Vietnam war to 9/11 to the election of Donald Trump: an opportunity to confront chaos and dread, rather than to escape it. <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/fintan-o-toole-yeats-test-criteria-reveal-we-are-doomed-1.3576078\">Fintan O\u2019Toole has proposed the \u201cYeats Test\u201d</a>: \u201cThe more quotable Yeats seems to commentators and politicians, the worse things are.\u201d</p> <blockquote> <p>Turning and turning in the widening gyre<br>The falcon cannot hear the falconer;<br>Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;<br>Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,<br>The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere<br>The ceremony of innocence is drowned;<br>The best lack all conviction, while the worst<br>Are full of passionate intensity.</p> <p>Surely some revelation is at hand;<br>Surely the Second Coming is at hand.<br>The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out<br>When a vast image out of<em> Spiritus Mundi</em><br>Troubles my sight: somewhere in the sands of the desert<br>A shape with lion body and the head of a man,<br>A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,<br>Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it<br>Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.<br>The darkness drops again; but now I know<br>That twenty centuries of stony sleep<br>Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,<br>And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,<br>Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?</p> </blockquote> <p>The first stanza is a series of punchy declarations about a crisis of authority, almost as if Yeats were an op-ed writer in full thunder. The oracular second stanza asks why this is happening and imagines what might follow the phase of anarchy: the second coming will be a reversal of the first. </p> <p>Yeats began \u201cThe Second Coming\u201d during the tense, eventful month of January 1919. The first world war was barely over and the Russian Revolution, which dismayed him, still unfolding, while another war was brewing on his doorstep. On 21 January, the revolutionary Irish parliament met in Dublin to declare independence while, in a quarry in Tipperary, members of the IRA killed two officers of the Royal Irish Constabulary. The birth of Yeats\u2019s daughter, Anne, in February was also freighted with danger. During her pregnancy, his young wife Georgie Hyde-Lees had been stricken by the Spanish flu that was burning through Europe. Events conspired to put Yeats in an apocalyptic frame of mind.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2a3cbd890c54aa8ca775d562c80f4cc544a2eb57\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a3cbd890c54aa8ca775d562c80f4cc544a2eb57/15_0_3570_3571/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Inspired by Yeats \u2026 Joni Mitchell.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inspired by Yeats \u2026 Joni Mitchell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Redfern/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He found the metaphors to express it via hundreds of automatic writing sessions, during which Georgie convinced her husband that she was channelling the wisdom of \u201cControls\u201d and \u201cInstructors\u201d from the spirit realm. From these sessions, Yeats constructed an elaborate, world-explaining \u201cSystem\u201d, which he eventually laid out in bewildering detail in <em>A Vision</em> (1925). Crucial to \u201cThe Second Coming\u201d was the symbol of the gyre (a cone or spiral) and Yeats\u2019s conviction that history moved in 2,000-year cycles. The age of Christ (\u201ctwenty centuries of stony sleep\u201d) was coming to an end and a new era \u2013\u2013 antithetical to progress and reason \u2013\u2013 would begin with the birth of the rough beast in Bethlehem.</p> <p>Early drafts of the poem illustrate Yeats\u2019s dedication to universalising his message, as he deletes specific references to the French Revolution and the first world war and replaces terrestrial images of judges and tyrants with figures from dreams and myths. This \u201cproductive vagueness\u201d, says David Dwan, an associate professor of English at Oxford University, is what makes the poem ever-relevant.<strong> </strong>Evident, too, in the drafts is Yeats\u2019s painstaking refinement of each line. \u201cAll things have begun to break and fall apart\u201d is distilled into \u201cThings fall apart\u201d; \u201cThe centre has lost\u201d becomes \u201cThe centre cannot hold\u201d. The beast that has blandly \u201cset out\u201d for Bethlehem \u201cslouches\u201d instead. In the final version, every phrase has vigour and weight.

      "bodyText": "In April 1936, three years before his death, WB Yeats received a letter from the writer and activist Ethel Mannin. The 70-year-old Yeats was a Nobel prize-winning poet of immense stature and influence, not to mention Mannin\u2019s former lover, and she asked him to join a campaign to free a German pacifist incarcerated by the Nazis. Yeats responded instead with a reading recommendation: \u201cIf you have my poems by you, look up a poem called \u2018The Second Coming\u2019,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt was written some sixteen or seventeen years ago &amp; foretold what is happening. I have written of the same thing again &amp; again since. This will seem little to you with your strong practical sense for it takes fifty years for a poet\u2019s weapons to influence the issue.\u201d Yeats was justified in taking the long view. Written in 1919 and published in 1920, \u201cThe Second Coming\u201d has become perhaps the most plundered poem in the English language. At 164 words, it is short and memorable enough to be famous in toto but it has also been disassembled into its constituent parts by books, albums, movies, TV shows, comic books, computer games, political speeches and newspaper editorials. While many poems in Yeats\u2019s corpus have contributed indelible lines to the storehouse of the cultural imagination (\u201cno country for old men\u201d; \u201cthe foul rag and bone shop of the heart\u201d), \u201cThe Second Coming\u201d consists of almost nothing but such lines. Someone reading it for the first time in 2020 might resemble the apocryphal theatregoer who complained that Hamlet was nothing but a bunch of quotations strung together. Whether or not it is Yeats\u2019s greatest poem, it is by far his most useful. As Auden wrote in \u201cIn Memory of WB Yeats\u201d (1939), \u201cThe words of a dead man / Are modified in the guts of the living.\u201d As the world is wrenched out of joint by the coronavirus pandemic, many people are turning to poetry for wisdom and consolation, but \u201cThe Second Coming\u201d fulfils a different role, as it has done in crisis after crisis, from the Vietnam war to 9/11 to the election of Donald Trump: an opportunity to confront chaos and dread, rather than to escape it. Fintan O\u2019Toole has proposed the \u201cYeats Test\u201d: \u201cThe more quotable Yeats seems to commentators and politicians, the worse things are.\u201d Turning and turning in the widening gyre The falcon cannot hear the falconer; Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world, The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere The ceremony of innocence is drowned; The best lack all conviction, while the worst Are full of passionate intensity. Surely some revelation is at hand; Surely the Second Coming is at hand. The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi Troubles my sight: somewhere in the sands of the desert A shape with lion body and the head of a man, A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun, Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds. The darkness drops again; but now I know That twenty centuries of stony sleep Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle, And what rough beast, its hour come round at last, Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born? The first stanza is a series of punchy declarations about a crisis of authority, almost as if Yeats were an op-ed writer in full thunder. The oracular second stanza asks why this is happening and imagines what might follow the phase of anarchy: the second coming will be a reversal of the first. Yeats began \u201cThe Second Coming\u201d during the tense, eventful month of January 1919. The first world war was barely over and the Russian Revolution, which dismayed him, still unfolding, while another war was brewing on his doorstep. On 21 January, the revolutionary Irish parliament met in Dublin to declare independence while, in a quarry in Tipperary, members of the IRA killed two officers of the Royal Irish Constabulary. The birth of Yeats\u2019s daughter, Anne, in February was also freighted with danger. During her pregnancy, his young wife Georgie Hyde-Lees had been stricken by the Spanish flu that was burning through Europe. Events conspired to put Yeats in an apocalyptic frame of mind. He found the metaphors to express it via hundreds of automatic writing sessions, during which Georgie convinced her husband that she was channelling the wisdom of \u201cControls\u201d and \u201cInstructors\u201d from the spirit realm. From these sessions, Yeats constructed an elaborate, world-explaining \u201cSystem\u201d, which he eventually laid out in bewildering detail in A Vision (1925). Crucial to \u201cThe Second Coming\u201d was the symbol of the gyre (a cone or spiral) and Yeats\u2019s conviction that history moved in 2,000-year cycles. The age of Christ (\u201ctwenty centuries of stony sleep\u201d) was coming to an end and a new era \u2013\u2013 antithetical to progress and reason \u2013\u2013 would begin with the birth of the rough beast in Bethlehem. Early drafts of the poem illustrate Yeats\u2019s dedication to universalising his message, as he deletes specific references to the French Revolution and the first world war and replaces terrestrial images of judges and tyrants with figures from dreams and myths. This \u201cproductive vagueness\u201d, says David Dwan, an associate professor of English at Oxford University, is what makes the poem ever-relevant. Evident, too, in the drafts is Yeats\u2019s painstaking refinement of each line. \u201cAll things have begun to break and fall apart\u201d is distilled into \u201cThings fall apart\u201d; \u201cThe centre has lost\u201d becomes \u201cThe centre cannot hold\u201d. The beast that has blandly \u201cset out\u201d for Bethlehem \u201cslouches\u201d instead. In the final version, every phrase has vigour and weight. The poem is built to last. \u201cThe Second Coming\u201d was published in both The Nation and The Dial in November 1920 and then in Yeats\u2019s collection Michael Robartes and the Dancer (1921). Yet it did not attain what Dwan calls its \u201cproblematic ubiquity\u201d until some time after the second world war. By 1963, the aphoristic couplet about the best and the worst was enough of a cliche to irritate the critic Raymond Williams. \u201cThe lines are regularly used as rhetorical tactics in the defence of anybody\u2019s sanity against anybody else\u2019s enthusiasm,\u201d he complained. One reason for the poem\u2019s booming popularity was its supporting role in two influential masterpieces. Chinua Achebe\u2019s Things Fall Apart (1958) enshrined it in the vocabulary of African independence. By 1971, the Guardian observed, the title had become \u201can African catchphrase\u201d. Joan Didion\u2019s essay collection Slouching Towards Bethlehem (1968) had a similar effect in the US at a time of stomach-churning flux. Didion opened her book with the poem because its lines had \u201creverberated in my inner ear as if they were surgically implanted there \u2026 the only images against which much of what I was seeing and hearing and thinking seemed to make any pattern.\u201d After Achebe and Didion, lines from the poem popped up with growing frequency in coverage of China, India, Africa, Indonesia, Northern Ireland and Britain. There was apparently no geopolitical drama to which it could not be applied. In 2007, after the Brookings Institute called its report on Iraq \u201cThings Fall Apart\u201d, the New York Times claimed: \u201cThe Second Coming is fast becoming the official poem of the Iraq war.\u201d You could find similar claims being made regarding the financial crisis, the Arab spring and, now, the age of rightwing populism. In August 2016, as Trump slouched towards Washington, the Wall Street Journal declared: \u201cTerror, Brexit and US Election Have Made 2016 the Year of Yeats\u201d, after the research company Factiva found that phrases from the poem had already notched up more appearances in the press than in any other year in the previous three decades. Since then, the poem has been invoked by Jordan Peterson and Slavoj \u017di\u017eek, ransacked for anti-Trump song titles by Moby and Sleater-Kinney, recited in the season finale of Alex Garland\u2019s Devs, and quoted six times in parliament. The post-2016 turn to Yeats is no surprise, because the image of the centre not holding has long made the poem a touchstone for anxious centrists. Shortly before running for president in 1968, Robert F Kennedy warned: \u201cIndeed, we seem to fulfil the vision of Yeats.\u201d In 1979, Labour grandee Roy Jenkins quoted it at the climax of his celebrated Dimbleby lecture about \u201cthe radical centre\u201d, a speech that paved the way for the launch of the SDP.

Since that first show it\u2019s had a few different makeovers, from doing round-tables and covering news stories to speaking with authors and exploring a single scientific topic in depth. It\u2019s even done a (really spectacular) mini-series, exploring the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2019/may/03/oceans-of-noise-episode-one-science-weekly-podcast\">sonic environment of the ocean</a>. Under each new guise, the podcast is always trying to find the best format to share science and engage its listeners. That\u2019s why we changed things up a bit with Covid-19 \u2013 making our episodes shorter and bringing them out more frequently than usual, so we could delve into the rapidly developing pandemic and discuss the science as it was happening.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>How do you decide which topics and experts to include?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nicola </strong>When it comes to the Covid-19 outbreak, it\u2019s about being very specific. The story has different aspects, and is fast moving, so it can be hard for people to find answers to the questions they care about. With the podcast we wanted to zoom in on key issues in a concise way. Our listeners have been a huge help, sending in fantastic questions to steer our coverage. What I particularly like about that is that it means we as a team are delving into the things that really matter to our listeners, whether that\u2019s unpicking if Covid-19 poses a particular risk to pregnant women (happily the answer appears to be no), or delving into our understanding of immunity. We carefully research which scientists are leaders in the field, and can share not just what\u2019s known about Covid-19, but also what remains to be unpicked.</p> <h2><strong>What have been your highlights of the podcasts you\u2019ve produced so far \u2013 especially the ones launched during lockdown?</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6e750f5324ce504c0ea3049a7ce908d051779dff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e750f5324ce504c0ea3049a7ce908d051779dff/0_0_3000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Science Weekly has been on air since 2006.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Science Weekly has been on air since 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Egle Kazdailyte</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Nicola</strong><em> </em>I have so many favourite episodes.

It\u2019s a different responsibility.\u201d</p> \n<p>Pope says that goalkeepers&nbsp;almost&nbsp;have to learn how to let&nbsp;in&nbsp;goals. \u201cBefore I went to York on loan [in 2013-14], the Charlton manager at the time, Chris Powell, said something like: \u2018I want you to go there and make mistakes,\u2019\u201d Pope says. \u201cIt was a really strange line and something that stuck in my head but I completely know what he means.

However good or bad things were, the closer you can stay to that line, the less drastic things will be, the less of a rollercoaster.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe could score in the 89th&nbsp;minute to go 2-1 up and, for me personally, you&nbsp;don\u2019t want to run round doing knee-slides. At that point, I\u2019m thinking about getting over the line. That\u2019s the feeling I want. The game is done and you\u2019ve got the three points. I don\u2019t really have a temper and I like to be very relaxed. I\u2019ve found it\u2019s the best way for me to perform at my best. If a goalkeeper can have a calming influence, it\u2019s something that can run through a team.\u201d</p> \n<p>Pope\u2019s top-level breakthrough came in 2017-18 when he stepped up for the seriously injured Heaton to play&nbsp;35 Premier League games, keeping 12 clean sheets and being named as Burnley\u2019s player and players\u2019 player of the season. He made his England debut as a substitute against Costa Rica in a World Cup warm-up and was the third-choice goalkeeper at the finals in Russia. There was injury last season \u2013 and frustration behind Hart and Heaton \u2013&nbsp;but&nbsp;the temptation is to&nbsp;think that everything has happened&nbsp;relatively&nbsp;quickly for him.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5dc0fa8334d862e687e6c338edefe196eea2e6ad\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5dc0fa8334d862e687e6c338edefe196eea2e6ad/0_0_1875_1125/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Pope turns a shot around the post during Burnley\u2019s 1-1 draw with Tottenham on 7 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nick Pope turns a shot around the post during Burnley\u2019s 1-1 draw with Tottenham on 7 March.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt West/BPI/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cExperience is so important and, if you\u2019re at a higher club,&nbsp;it\u2019s often a massive risk for them to play a young goalkeeper,\u201d Pope says. \u201cThe manager might not have the time to let you develop and make mistakes at that level. So you go on loan and, as horrible as it sounds, you make those mistakes elsewhere. Then, you come back to your parent club&nbsp;with a grounding behind you, rather than just playing under-23s, and it gives the manager faith to chuck you in.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re a young winger, for example, you can go out there, be as carefree as possible and you are less likely to be at fault for a goal. In terms of the evolution of the game, I\u2019d be interested to see if more young goalkeepers&nbsp;do&nbsp;get thrust in rather than taking the loan route.\u201d</p> \n<p>Pope\u2019s thoughts are on the Premier League restart, on extending Burnley\u2019s five-match unbeaten sequence, on finishing in a European position. He has not thought about the postponed European Championship, in which the majority of England\u2019s games are scheduled for Wembley but, when it is brought up, the excitement is palpable.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cAlthough I didn\u2019t play a game at the World Cup, to be part of that was still one of the greatest things of my life,\u201d Pope says. \u201cThe biggest moment? Eric Dier scoring the winning penalty against Colombia. As one of the goalkeepers, I\u2019d done a lot of work with Eric and the other lads on the penalties, so to see them perform as they did was incredible. If you could stop time and rerun the adrenaline and everything you had for those couple of moments, it would be unbelievable.\u201d</p> \n<p>So one last thing. What does Pope have to do to dislodge Pickford? \u201cHa ha, good question,\u201d he replies. \u201cBut one of my main things is not to look too far ahead. I\u2019m really looking after myself at Burnley. England is so far away, even though being the No 1 is something that I want. It\u2019s a real dream of mine to play at Wembley and to represent England as many times as possible.\u201d</p>",

What shines through, though, is his equilibrium. \u201cOne of my goalkeeper coaches at Charlton, Lee Turner, would speak about having this middle line,\u201d Pope says. \u201cHe used to point his arm out straight and say that you had to stay on this line as much as possible. However good or bad things were, the closer you can stay to that line, the less drastic things will be, the less of a rollercoaster. \u201cWe could score in the 89th minute to go 2-1 up and, for me personally, you don\u2019t want to run round doing knee-slides. At that point, I\u2019m thinking about getting over the line. That\u2019s the feeling I want. The game is done and you\u2019ve got the three points. I don\u2019t really have a temper and I like to be very relaxed. I\u2019ve found it\u2019s the best way for me to perform at my best. If a goalkeeper can have a calming influence, it\u2019s something that can run through a team.\u201d Pope\u2019s top-level breakthrough came in 2017-18 when he stepped up for the seriously injured Heaton to play 35 Premier League games, keeping 12 clean sheets and being named as Burnley\u2019s player and players\u2019 player of the season. He made his England debut as a substitute against Costa Rica in a World Cup warm-up and was the third-choice goalkeeper at the finals in Russia. There was injury last season \u2013 and frustration behind Hart and Heaton \u2013 but the temptation is to think that everything has happened relatively quickly for him. \u201cExperience is so important and, if you\u2019re at a higher club, it\u2019s often a massive risk for them to play a young goalkeeper,\u201d Pope says. \u201cThe manager might not have the time to let you develop and make mistakes at that level. So you go on loan and, as horrible as it sounds, you make those mistakes elsewhere. Then, you come back to your parent club with a grounding behind you, rather than just playing under-23s, and it gives the manager faith to chuck you in. \u201cIf you\u2019re a young winger, for example, you can go out there, be as carefree as possible and you are less likely to be at fault for a goal. In terms of the evolution of the game, I\u2019d be interested to see if more young goalkeepers do get thrust in rather than taking the loan route.\u201d Pope\u2019s thoughts are on the Premier League restart, on extending Burnley\u2019s five-match unbeaten sequence, on finishing in a European position. He has not thought about the postponed European Championship, in which the majority of England\u2019s games are scheduled for Wembley but, when it is brought up, the excitement is palpable. \u201cAlthough I didn\u2019t play a game at the World Cup, to be part of that was still one of the greatest things of my life,\u201d Pope says. \u201cThe biggest moment? Eric Dier scoring the winning penalty against Colombia. As one of the goalkeepers, I\u2019d done a lot of work with Eric and the other lads on the penalties, so to see them perform as they did was incredible. If you could stop time and rerun the adrenaline and everything you had for those couple of moments, it would be unbelievable.\u201d So one last thing. What does Pope have to do to dislodge Pickford? \u201cHa ha, good question,\u201d he replies. \u201cBut one of my main things is not to look too far ahead. I\u2019m really looking after myself at Burnley. England is so far away, even though being the No 1 is something that I want. It\u2019s a real dream of mine to play at Wembley and to represent England as many times as possible.\u201d",

Tourists are not usually interested in seeing the rest of the country, or even much of the city. The average length of stay is just 2.4 days, and the majority of tourists crowd into the city\u2019s old town, which over the years has pushed out much local life from the area.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a great opportunity for us to rebuild and restart tourism in the city differently. We want a different type of visitor who visits more than the most famous monuments in the centre,\u201d said Hrub\u00e1.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/jun/20/budapest-guide-hungary-restaurants-bars-hotels\">Budapest</a>, officials are having similar thoughts. \u201cLike in so many other big European tourist destinations, people have been getting exhausted by the scale of tourism,\u201d said the city\u2019s mayor, Gergely Kar\u00e1csony, in a recent interview at his office. \u201cWe want to spread out the spots in the city that are touristically interesting, and change the type of people who come. It shouldn\u2019t only be bachelor parties and booze \u2013 we want to rebrand ourselves a bit,\u201d he said.</p> <p>These sentiments are not new, and there has been frequent talk of reclaiming cities for the locals across central Europe over the past few years. But the pandemic has provided the kind of opportunity for a rethink that would have been much more difficult when the usual flows of visitors were still arriving.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ec952658275cc34bb596d0120b5760e569d8386d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec952658275cc34bb596d0120b5760e569d8386d/0_186_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Budapest\u2019s normally busy Zrinyi street\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Budapest\u2019s normally busy Zrinyi street, dominated by St Stephen\u2019s Basilica, during Hungary\u2019s Covid-19 lockdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tam\u00e1s Kov\u00e1cs/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI really hope that Budapest can build up a new face of tourism when this is over. Sometimes we surrendered to tourists, with local interests pushed back, and it definitely isn\u2019t sustainable,\u201d said G\u00e1bor Manek, who owns a number of restaurants and bars in Budapest and runs an electronic music festival.</p> <p>\u201cThere are parks in Prague where all of the infrastructure was designed with tourists in mind, rather than locals, and we need to change that,\u201d said Hrub\u00e1.</p> <p>This summer, there will be a new focus on domestic tourism. The central European nations implemented some of Europe\u2019s earliest and strictest lockdowns, and have largely avoided the overwhelming numbers of coronavirus cases seen in western Europe. Already, most countries in the region are well on their way out of lockdown, but strict travel restrictions on foreign arrivals are likely to stay in place for some time.</p> <p>Budapest is looking into exchanges with other Hungarian cities, while Prague has launched a series of offers to tempt Czechs to discover their own capital. Previously, visitors would come to Prague for concerts or events but usually would not even stay the night, due to the crowds of tourists and inflated prices.</p> <p>In Poland, the government is mulling handing out 1,000 z\u0142oty (\u00a3202) vouchers for those in full-time employment to use on domestic travel, to help kickstart the tourism economy. Employers would have to contribute just 10% of the value of the voucher.</p> <p>For some older residents of central Europe, the deserted streets have provided a semi-nostalgic window back to their youth during the Communist period, before the arrival of mass tourism. But while many people have enjoyed seeing the sights of their own cities, the novelty has worn off as the severity of the economic impact of losing tourism becomes clear.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u201cA lot of people I know who wouldn\u2019t dream of going to Market Square on a weekend because of the crowds had the initial reaction that it\u2019s really nice now. But after a while, they admit it\u2019s just eerie,\u201d said Piotr Krasnowolski, a Krak\u00f3w-based translator.</p> <p>In Budapest, Manek said that, from conversations with fellow owners, he estimates that between 25% to 30% of bars and restaurants will simply not reopen. Many were only profitable due to the custom of passing tourists.</p> <p>The hope is that by taking some time to rethink tourism strategies with the locals at the forefront, the cities will also become more satisfying destinations for tourists. \u201cWhen the locals are happy, the visitors will be as well,\u201d said Hrub\u00e1.</p>",

Budget flights and low prices have been a mixed blessing for these places, as a trickle of tourists turned to a flood in the decades since the Iron Curtain fell. \u201cThe residents have been complaining for a very long time that the city doesn\u2019t belong to them any more,\u201d said Barbora Hrub\u00e1 of Prague City Tourism, a municipal body that works on the Czech capital\u2019s tourism strategy. With 9 million international visitors a year, Prague has become Europe\u2019s fourth most visited city, after Paris, London and Rome. Tourists are not usually interested in seeing the rest of the country, or even much of the city. The average length of stay is just 2.4 days, and the majority of tourists crowd into the city\u2019s old town, which over the years has pushed out much local life from the area. \u201cThis is a great opportunity for us to rebuild and restart tourism in the city differently. We want a different type of visitor who visits more than the most famous monuments in the centre,\u201d said Hrub\u00e1. In Budapest, officials are having similar thoughts. \u201cLike in so many other big European tourist destinations, people have been getting exhausted by the scale of tourism,\u201d said the city\u2019s mayor, Gergely Kar\u00e1csony, in a recent interview at his office. \u201cWe want to spread out the spots in the city that are touristically interesting, and change the type of people who come. It shouldn\u2019t only be bachelor parties and booze \u2013 we want to rebrand ourselves a bit,\u201d he said. These sentiments are not new, and there has been frequent talk of reclaiming cities for the locals across central Europe over the past few years. But the pandemic has provided the kind of opportunity for a rethink that would have been much more difficult when the usual flows of visitors were still arriving. \u201cI really hope that Budapest can build up a new face of tourism when this is over. Sometimes we surrendered to tourists, with local interests pushed back, and it definitely isn\u2019t sustainable,\u201d said G\u00e1bor Manek, who owns a number of restaurants and bars in Budapest and runs an electronic music festival. \u201cThere are parks in Prague where all of the infrastructure was designed with tourists in mind, rather than locals, and we need to change that,\u201d said Hrub\u00e1. This summer, there will be a new focus on domestic tourism. The central European nations implemented some of Europe\u2019s earliest and strictest lockdowns, and have largely avoided the overwhelming numbers of coronavirus cases seen in western Europe. Already, most countries in the region are well on their way out of lockdown, but strict travel restrictions on foreign arrivals are likely to stay in place for some time. Budapest is looking into exchanges with other Hungarian cities, while Prague has launched a series of offers to tempt Czechs to discover their own capital. Previously, visitors would come to Prague for concerts or events but usually would not even stay the night, due to the crowds of tourists and inflated prices. In Poland, the government is mulling handing out 1,000 z\u0142oty (\u00a3202) vouchers for those in full-time employment to use on domestic travel, to help kickstart the tourism economy. Employers would have to contribute just 10% of the value of the voucher. For some older residents of central Europe, the deserted streets have provided a semi-nostalgic window back to their youth during the Communist period, before the arrival of mass tourism. But while many people have enjoyed seeing the sights of their own cities, the novelty has worn off as the severity of the economic impact of losing tourism becomes clear. \u201cA lot of people I know who wouldn\u2019t dream of going to Market Square on a weekend because of the crowds had the initial reaction that it\u2019s really nice now. But after a while, they admit it\u2019s just eerie,\u201d said Piotr Krasnowolski, a Krak\u00f3w-based translator. In Budapest, Manek said that, from conversations with fellow owners, he estimates that between 25% to 30% of bars and restaurants will simply not reopen. Many were only profitable due to the custom of passing tourists. The hope is that by taking some time to rethink tourism strategies with the locals at the forefront, the cities will also become more satisfying destinations for tourists. \u201cWhen the locals are happy, the visitors will be as well,\u201d said Hrub\u00e1.",

In 2019, a Facebook spokesperson declined to clarify the company\u2019s policy around violence and hate speech by state actors on the record to the Guardian. The Guardian has contacted Facebook for comment. </p> \n  <p>This is not the first time that Facebook\u2019s exemption of state actors from content rules has been questioned. During the campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya in Myanmar, Facebook banned an insurgent group fighting to defend the Muslim minority while allowing Myanmar\u2019s military, the Tatmadaw, to continue using its platform to spread its propaganda. </p> \n  <p>Facebook subsequently banned a number of ethnic armed organizations in Myanmar, designating the officially recognized groups as the equivalent to terrorist organizations. The move prompted an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/07/facebook-myanmar-genocide-violence-hate-speech\">outcry from human rights experts</a> who said the company\u2019s decision to favor state actors over non-state actors in armed conflict was inconsistent with both international law and human rights. </p> \n  <p>In his lengthy post, Zuckerberg also appeared to suggest that if Facebook had decided Trump\u2019s post was intended to incite violence by civilians, they would have taken it down, writing, \u201cUnlike Twitter, we do not have a policy of putting a warning in front of posts that may incite violence because we believe that if a post incites violence, it should be removed regardless of whether it is newsworthy, even if it comes from a politician.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Zuckerberg also criticized Trump, saying: \u201cI\u2019ve been struggling with how to respond to the President\u2019s tweets and posts all day. Personally, I have a visceral negative reaction to this kind of divisive and inflammatory rhetoric.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He added: \u201cI disagree strongly with how the President spoke about this, but I believe people should be able to see this for themselves, because ultimately accountability for those in positions of power can only happen when their speech is scrutinized out in the open.\u201d </p>

reports on the criminal complaint against Derek Chauvin, which provides new details on the killing of George Floyd. </strong></p> \n  <p>Derek Chauvin, the ex-Minneapolis police officer charged today with third-degree murder and manslaughter in connection with the killing of George Floyd, had his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds total, according to the <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/read-the-complaint-charging-derek-chauvin-in-the-death-of-george-floyd/570870791/\">complaint</a>.</p> \n  <p>For two minutes and 53 seconds, Floyd was \u201cnon-responsive\u201d.</p> \n  <p>\u201cPolice are trained that this type of restraint with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous,\u201d the complaint states. </p> \n  <p>As captured in the now-viral video, Floyd repeatedly told the officers \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d before pleading with them, saying \u201cMama\u201d and \u201cplease\u201d. One of the officers responded, \u201cYou are talking fine\u201d as he struggled. </p> \n  <p>The other three officers, identified by authorities as Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J Alexander Kueng, were also fired. According to the complaint, Lane had asked, \u201cShould we roll him on his side?\u201d </p> \n  <p>Chauvin responded, \u201cNo, staying put where we got him.\u201d </p> \n  <p>\u201cI am worried about excited delirium or whatever,\u201d Lane said. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we have him on his stomach,\u201d Chauvin said. </p> \n  <p>The medical examiner\u2019s autopsy report is still pending, but preliminary findings have determined that a combination of the police hold on Floyd, his underlying health conditions of coronary artery disease and hypertensive heart disease, as well as \u201cany potential intoxicants\u201d likely contributed to his death. </p> \n  <p>Floyd ended up on the ground after Lane pointed his gun at him and instructed him to step out of a car. Lane and Kueng had been responding to a report that someone had used a counterfeit $20 bill at a nearby store, and the store owner identified the person as sitting in a parked car around the corner. There were three people in the car. </p> \n  <p>The officers had handcuffed Floyd and were walking him to their police cruiser when he \u201cstiffened up, fell to the ground, and told the officers he was claustrophobic.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Chauvin and Thoa arrived at about 8:14pm. Within five minutes, Chauvin had his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck.</p> \n  <p>At 8:25pm, the video \u201cappears to show Mr Floyd ceasing to breathe or speak\u201d.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWant to roll him on his side?\u201d Lane asked. Kueng then checked Floyds wrist for a pulse. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find one.\u201d </p> \n  <p>\u201cNone of the officers moved from their positions,\u201d the complaint states. </p> \n  <p>At 8:27pm, Chauvin removed his knee. <br><br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed192938f087122eca52364\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T23:05:02.715Z\">12.05am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>While the imagery of fires and broken windows have dominated the news, reporters in the Twin Cities have also been documenting acts of community, solidarity and mutual aid. </strong></p> \n  <p>Chris McGreal is in Minneapolis reporting for the Guardian, where he has spoken with community members volunteering to clean up the neighborhood or keep watch over their neighbors. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisMcGreal/status/1266428976723111938\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Ayanle Hashi who spent Thursday night guarding his Minneapolis apartment building as crowds looted shops below and neighbouring stores. \u201cThere are disabled and old people in this building.

Our Saturday blog covering the George Floyd killing and protests can be found here: This blog is now closing, and will soon be replaced by new coverage led by our team in New York. One final link, to a piece that puts last night\u2019s unrest across the United States in context: Thank you for reading. The mayor of Portland, Oregon, has imposed a curfew after what he described as a \u2018riot\u2019 in the city overnight. Ted Wheeler decried scenes of unrest in Portland in a series of tweets and, in the past hour, has declared that citizens must stay home between 8pm and 6am. Earlier, in an interview with with local radio station KGW , Wheeler, a Democrat, described the situation in his city: \u201cThis is a riot. It\u2019s a full-on riot. We see people burning cars, we see people damaging businesses large and small, including some businesses I believe which are owned by local African-American business owners. We\u2019re seeing looting.\u201d A summary of events on the streets of Oakland on Friday night, posted by a reporter from the local Mercury News The leader of the opposition Labour party in the UK, Sir Keir Starmer, has said George Floyd\u2019s death \u201cmust be a catalyst for change\u201d. He posted the following message on Twitter after a night of protests across the United States. US diplomats in Africa have said they are \u201cprofoundly troubled\u201d by the death of George Floyd, in response to outrage from across the continent. According to reporting by the Associated Press, ambassadors and embassies in five different African countries have issued statements following the death of 46-year-old Floyd this week at the hands of Minneapolis police. Diplomats spoke up as the head of the African Union Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, condemned the \u201cmurder\u201d of Floyd and said his organisation rejects the \u201ccontinuing discriminatory practices against black citizens of the USA\u201d. The US ambassador to Congo, Mike Hammer, highlighted a tweet from a local media entrepreneur who addressed him saying, \u201cDear ambassador, your country is shameful. Proud America, which went through everything from segregation to the election of Barack Obama, still hasn\u2019t conquered the demons of racism. How many black people must be killed by white police officers before authorities react seriously?\u201d The ambassador\u2019s response, in French, said: \u201cI am profoundly troubled by the tragic death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The Justice Department is conducting a full criminal investigation as a top priority. Security forces around the world should be held accountable. No one is above the law.\u201d Similar statements were tweeted by the US embassies in Kenya and Uganda, while the embassies in Tanzania and Kenya tweeted a joint statement from the Department of Justice office in Minnesota on the investigation. The musician Killer Mike has given an impassioned address to the citizens of his home town of Atlanta, calling for an end to looting. The rapper was invited to speak at a press conference held by the mayor of Atlanta, Keisha Lance Bottoms, and used his speech to point out the successes of African-Americans in the city, as well as calling for structural change to combat racism. Killer Mike, one half of the group Run the Jewels, was a leading voice during the Ferguson protests of 2014. His speech today has been widely shared on social media. A DC based photographer, Matthew Rodier, has been streaming live pictures from protests outside the White House. Crowds had been gathered outside the presidential residence for many hours. Earlier there were reports of some protesters hurling missiles at police, the police responding with pepper spray. Police later declared the gathering \u201cunlawful\u201d and ordered everyone to leave Lafayette Square, a 7 acre public park located directly north of the White House. Rodier brought his live stream to an end as the protesters dissipated. \u201cFor everyone that was on when the live stream cut out I\u2019m good\u201d, he wrote on Twitter. \u201cI didn\u2019t get arrested, all the protesters left so I did as well. Just got pepper sprayed a lot but that is a regular occurrence if you cover protests.\u201d I\u2019m handing over to my colleague Paul MacInnes now. I\u2019ll leave you with some images from the past few hours: There is a lot of damage in downtown LA, where police are still trying to get protesters off the streets. The Associated Press reports that police in Louisville, Kentucky, have apologised for targeting a news crew during protests. A crew from WAVE-TV was downtown in the Kentucky city Friday night, covering demonstrations over the death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed by police in her own home in March. Police presence intensified around 9:45pm, as officers in riot gear stood shoulder-to-shoulder moving people down a key street near City Hall, the Courier Journal reported. As WAVE-TV was on air, reporter Kaitlin Rust is heard yelling off-camera: I\u2019ve been shot! I\u2019ve been shot!\u201d Video shows a police officer aiming directly at the camera crew, as Rust describes the projectiles as pepper bullets. \u201cI want to apologize\u201d, Louisville police spokeswoman Jessie Halladay told the Courier Journal. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that should have occurred if she was singled out as a reporter.\u201d Halladay said she couldn\u2019t tell who the officer was at this time, but that police would review the video again and \u201cif we need to do any investigation for discipline, we will do that\u201d. Here\u2019s a look at the treatment that the events of Friday have been given by a couple of the US papers: Some good news: it sounds from reporters on the ground that the protests in Oakland tonight are dwindling. A post office is now on fire in Minneapolis: Earlier on Friday night, Atlanta\u2019s police chief said she understood the anger of African American communities across the United States over the repeated deaths of black men at the hands of police forces in the county. \u201cWhether it\u2019s by police or other individuals, the reality is we\u2019ve diminished the value on their life,\u201d Erika Shields said. Here\u2019s our full story: Portland\u2019s mayor says he is returning to the city after having left to be with his dying mother. Our reporter on the ground in Minneapolis has this update: After Thursday night\u2019s occupation and destruction of the 3rd precinct police station, protesters turned their attention to the 5th precinct station on Friday. Thousands of people defied the city-wide curfew to surround the station. Mostly, the protest was peaceful, with chants and signs denouncing the police. But groups broke away to burn down a bank and attack other buildings. The police watched from the station roof and decided there would be no repeat of the previous evening at the 3rd precinct. After midnight, a large column of officers in riot gear moved into the street and pushed back the crowd with rubber bullets and tear gas. People stampeded to get away. Others turned and tried to push back but were overwhelmed by the hundreds of officers. About 50 people were arrested. The police said officers were shot at. The city police chief, Medaria Arradondo, said more than 1,000 officers had been pulled in to defend the station. \u201cWe will not have another repeat of what happened at the 3rd precinct,\u201d he said. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear if this marked a shift in the police approach to begin to enforce the curfew after it was widely defied, or a move solely to defend the police station. Protests in Oakland are ongoing - businesses have been targeted and fires lit. More national guard troops are preparing to deploy to Minneapolis: Meanwhile, there are ongoing clashes between police and protesters outside the White House, where demonstrators have removed some barricades. Governor Walz is back. He says supports the federal government\u2019s move to put the army on standby. He calls the situation \u201can unprecedented threat to our state\u201d. \u201cOur goal is to do everything we can to start to restore order.\u201d Now he is answering questions. Now a public safety official is speaking, calling protesters an \u201carmed and more more entrenched group of rioters\u201d. He is calling for more police officers and more national guard support. A request has been made for more national guard officers, he says. He says police officers have been shot at today and some have been injured. Frey is giving an emotional performance: \u201cIf you have a friend who is out now, call them and tell them to come home, it is not safe. Do the right thing now.\u201d Mayor Jacob Frey is now talking: \u201cMinneapolis I know you are reeling ... I\u2019m reeling too. We as a city are so much more than this. We can be so much better than this. There is no honour in burning down your city. There is no pride in looting.\u201d \u201cIt needs to stop.\u201d Minnesota governor Tim Walz is talking about the protests: \u201cThis is not about George\u2019s death, this is not about inequities that are real, this is about chaos.\u201d He says his priority is to protect lives, property and maintain law and order. He says the same scenes will play out tomorrow unless something changes. \u201cThe folks out there now want nothing more than to entice conflict.\u201d He says he is in touch with neighbouring states and the federal government and warns the situation tomorrow will be \u201cmore difficult\u201d because the protests have spread across the country. And what a night it\u2019s been, and there\u2019s more to come. Derek Chauvin, the ex-Minneapolis police officer shown on video with his knee on George Floyd\u2019s neck, was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in connection with Floyd\u2019s death. Mayor Jacob Frey set an 8pm curfew for Minneapolis, which protesters promptly defied. The Pentagon issued a rare order that raises questions about a possible military presence in Minneapolis in the coming days. Protests in Washington DC resulted in a brief lockdown of the White House, with demonstrators still outside sparring with secret service over barricades into the wee hours of the morning. Protesters damaged the CNN headquarters in Atlanta and set a police car ablaze, prompting governor Brian Kemp to declare a state of emergency and activate the Georgia National Guard. In Brooklyn, protesters and police clashed, with a state senator and state assemblymember getting pepper-sprayed and handcuffed. In Louisville, Kentucky, where protesters set the Hall of Justice on fire, police aimed and fired projectiles at a reporter and her cameraman during a live shot. In California, protesters across the state shut down four freeways: two in Oakland, one in San Jose and one in Los Angeles. A 19-year-old man was shot and killed in Detroit, Michigan after someone fired multiple times into a crowd of protesters. That\u2019s it from me tonight, my colleague Martin Farrer in Australia will be taking over from here. Portland\u2019s mayor has called on protesters to refrain from violence: The Minnesota governor is due to give an update in the coming minutes: In Detroit, Michigan, where hundreds marched, a 19-year-old man was killed after someone in an SUV fired multiple times into a crowd of protesters, the Associated Press is reporting. The shooting occurred at about 11:30pm Friday, near the Greektown entertainment district, according to Detroit police. The victim died at a hospital. No details on the victim or the suspect were immediately available. The day\u2019s march was relatively peaceful, but as events continued into the night, tensions grew. A Detroit police commander was struck by a rock and hospitalized. Officers in riot gear held off protesters across streets, eventually shooting canisters of gas into the crowd. The Guardian\u2019s indefatigable Chris McGreal continues with his coverage on the ground in Minneapolis: Many of the protesters who broke through the police lines near the 3rd precinct station earlier in the day and kept marching, regrouped in a Latino section of the city where the looting of what was reputed to be the biggest liquor store in the city turned into a big street party. But there were still those determined to keep the focus on George Floyd and the demand for justice. \u201dWe\u2019re going to keep this going until all those cops are in jail,\u201d said a young white woman dressed entirely in black who would only give her name as Serena. \u201cIt\u2019s not good enough to charge one with third degree murder. That\u2019s saying he didn\u2019t mean to do it. It was first degree murder. He chose to kill George Floyd. And we want those other three cops arrested and convicted too. That\u2019s what justice looks like.\u201d Another woman on a bike held aloft a sign: \u201c3 cops left\u201d. The National Guard finally made an appearance around midnight but only to protect a group of firefighters dousing a blaze at a Shell gas station. The crowd was relaxed, sensing that the soldiers were not there to interrupt their protests or their party. Some attempted to debate the shortcomings of policing in Minneapolis. Others posed for pictures next to the armoured vehicles. But the protesters sensed that they owned the streets, at least in this part of the city and for this night. The Associated Press is reporting that the Pentagon is ordering the Army to put several active-duty military police units on the ready to deploy to Minneapolis. This comes after Donald Trump tweeted that he told Minnesota governor Tim Walz that \u201cthe Military is with him all the way\u201d. Twitter hid that tweet behind a warning that it \u201cglorifies violence\u201d - Trump had ended that tweet with \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts,\u201d a nod to former Miami police chief Walter Headley, who in December 1967 promised violent reprisals to protests over stop-and-frisk tactics. It\u2019s incredibly rare for the Pentagon to order something of this sort, the AP noted. In Phoenix, Arizona, protesters marched for not just George Floyd, but for Dion Johnson, a 28-year-old black man who was shot and killed by an Arizona Department of Public Safety officer in a \u201cstruggle\u201d in which there are scant details. A large group gathered peacefully for hours, discussing how the officer did not have his body camera on and chanting \u201cBlack lives matter\u201d. They then marched to Phoenix police headquarters, where the situation devolved. It is past 1am in Washington DC right now, and a whole new day, and protests are still going strong in front of the White House. Protesters have spent the past hours tussling with secret service and law enforcement over barricades. Some said on the live stream that they had been tear-gassed. Others threw water on the secret service. Georgia governor Brian Kemp declared a state of emergency in Fulton County, where Atlanta is located, because of the protests. The emergency declaration allows him to activate up to 500 Georgia National Guard to \u201cprotect people and property in Atlanta\u201d. From the Guardian\u2019s Mario Koran, on the ground in Oakland: Police formed a line outside the Oakland police headquarters, where demonstrators gathered, chanting \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d and \u201cyou are the virus\u201d to the officers. A black protester stepped forward toward the line of police, shouting \u201c400 years!\u201d. Jesse and Jessica Hurtado, a husband and wife dressed in Brown Beret fatigues, joined the protest in solidarity with black protesters. They had just been to another protest in San Jose. \u201cThey\u2019re not just killing African Americans. They\u2019re killing black and brown together,\u201d said Jesse. One man in the crowd stood atop the median as the remains of an American flag burned, while around him boomed flash grenades and fireworks. The night remained largely peaceful after a fight broke out between a white and black protester, but tension mounted as some protestors began to hurl cans and bottles at law enforcement. Police announced: \u201cYou have the right assemble peacefully but be advised this is now an unlawful protest. Please disperse from this area.\u201d Moments later, they fired teargas into the crowd. Across California, police were declaring unlawful assemblies at their respective protests: In Oakland, it appeared the police had added tear gas to the projectiles they fired into the crowd: The Guardian\u2019s Chris McGreal is speaking with local business owners in Minneapolis who express fears for their livelihood amid the growing unrest: Sergio Pineda stood guard over his used car lot as a gas station burned a block away and crowds looted a liquor store and partied in the street. \u201cIt\u2019s all Latino businesses around here. I don\u2019t support what the cops did but I don\u2019t support what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said. \u201cThe National Guard should be here protecting. A lot of these are minority owned businesses that aren\u2019t insured.\u201d He said he was prepared to defend his business.\u201cI don\u2019t want to kill nobody but if somebody disrespects my business... \u201d he said. Jackie Renzetti reports for the Guardian on the scene in Minneapolis earlier on Friday afternoon, shortly after Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman announced he would charge Derek Chauvin with third-degree murder and manslaughter in the killing of George Floyd: Demonstrators Friday focused their messages on continuing to hold the other three officers accountable, with chants including \u201call four\u201d and \u201cone down, three to go.\u201d Around 150 people were present during demonstrations following Freeman\u2019s announcement. The crowd swelled to about 200 throughout the afternoon, where a steady stream of speakers gave talks and led chants. Kenney Daniels, 57, is African American and has lived in Minneapolis for most of his life, including 22 years in the city\u2019s southern neighborhoods. He expressed concern over the destruction and violence that took place during the last few nights of protests. \u201cIt\u2019s just terrible,\u201c he said, \u201cbut people are just fed up with it .. It just gets more intense every 20, 30 years.\u201d Aside from the general danger of destroying properties, he said he worried how the resulting increased presence of law enforcement would affect the conflict. \u201cI hope these officers can be held accountable so that this can stop,\u201d he said. \u201cThis could go a whole another ugly way, for everybody.\u201d Aggie Heart, 59, has lived in south Minneapolis for 40 years. She came Friday with her 29-year-old daughter, Celia Thomas, and Thomas\u2019 four and 12-year-old daughters. Thomas said she hadn\u2019t attended the week\u2019s previous protests because of danger, but wanted to bring her children to the safe environment of the intersection. \u201cI think the charges were a little bit lenient,\u201d said Thomas, who is a person of color, \u201cand I just hope they stick.\u201d She expressed dismay at the destruction over the past few days. \u201cI cried for the last few nights, just looking at this place I grew up in \u2013 it\u2019s ruined,\u201d she said. \u201cBut maybe if something is actually happening, maybe it\u2019s for good.\u201d Brett Davis, 60, is African American and grew up in south Minneapolis, where he has lived for most of his life. He said he thought that the protests, including ones that became destructive, provided necessary pressure for a relatively swift charging decision compared to previous police misconduct cases. \u201cWhat they did made this happen,\u201d he said, adding that some of the destruction was done by people simply taking a \u201cbadge of opportunity\u201d rather than for the cause. He knows young men involved with some of the destruction well, he said. A history of feeling discriminated against for jobs by area businesses, combined with anger over the pandemic\u2019s disproportionate impact on people of color, contributed to their decisions, he said. \u201cThey say, we\u2019re not going to do it your old way. We\u2019re not doing the peaceful marches. We\u2019re not going to do all that ... We\u2019re gonna go out and destroy and destruct, because that\u2019s the only time they listen,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been hearing a lot from these young guys.\u201d He said he\u2019s been injured by police multiple times over the years. \u201cNow, you have cameras to show you what the Minneapolis police have been doing for a long time.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like a ticking time bomb,\u201d he said. In Oakland, California, protesters began with a downtown gathering as others shut down the Bay Bridge. The large group met in front of City Hall in Frank Ogawa Plaza, which during the Occupy protests of 2011, was renamed for Oscar Grant, a 22-year-old local black man who was killed when a transit police officer shot him in the back while he laid handcuffed on the ground. Protesters went on to block another freeway, this time Interstate 880. For those keeping track, in California alone, protesters on Friday blocked four separate freeways: the 101 south in San Jose, Interstate 80 on the Bay Bridge at the Oakland/San Francisco border, Interstate 880 in Oakland and Freeway 110 in Los Angeles. Outside Oakland police headquarters, protesters set off fireworks and threw bottles at police. Police responded by firing projectiles into the crowd. In Los Angeles, protesters marched through the downtown area before shutting the 110 freeway. Some protesters apparently smashed some police car windows, prompting a scuffle in which other protesters tried to fend off an arresting officer by hitting him with signs. Some protesters also appeared to make a road block out of scooters. Here are some more images from the protest: Kellie Chauvin, the wife of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer charged with killing George Floyd, is divorcing her husband because of his role in Floyd\u2019s death. New York state senator Zellnor Myrie and state assemblymember Diana Richardson were \u201cpepper sprayed and handcuffed\u201d tonight, apparently during the protests. From the Guardian\u2019s Chris McGreal, on the ground in Minneapolis: Once again the police retreated. Once again the protesters took control. Minnesota\u2019s governor had pledged that Friday would be different to the previous night when the police abandoned the area around the 3rd precinct to thousands of people angry over the death of George Floyd. But as the curfew came into force at 8pm, the protesters were back out in force and not giving ground. Defying repeated orders, and waves of tear gas, they kept pushing forward until the police gave way. Within half an hour the police station, the symbol of what the protesters saw as their victory the previous evening, was back in their hands. They celebrated with selfies and tours of it wrecked interior. As the sun went down, the protesters kept pushing the police back. The governor had threatened to send in the National Guard but they were nowhere to be seen. But neither, for now, was there a repeat of the looting and burning of buildings. Still a long evening lay ahead. Back in Louisville, Kentucky, local TV reporter Kaitlin Rust was on the air when police began firing projectiles at her and her cameraman. Rust screamed, yelling, \u201cI\u2019m getting shot!\u201d before correcting herself to note that they were either rubber bullets or pepper balls. \u201cWho are they aiming that at?\u201d the anchor asked, as the police officer pointed the gun at camera. \u201cIt\u2019s directly at us,\u201d Rust said. \u201cWhy are they doing that?\u201d the anchor asked. The earlier protest in Washington DC that led to a lockdown of the White House consisted of several hundred demonstrators gathering and shutting down an intersection at U and 14th streets. One man briefly clashed with secret service officers, but the lockdown was quickly lifted and the overall protest remained small in scope. More protests are scheduled in the capital on Saturday. In San Jose, California, protesters blocked a major freeway and chanted George Floyd\u2019s name in the downtown area. Mayor Sam Liccardo reported that protesters damaged at least one police car and that law enforcement deployed tear gas. One officer was hurt, and several protesters were arrested, he said. Video showed a police officer apparently instigating a physical confrontation with a protester that ended in that protester\u2019s arrest. Former New York mayor and current Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani waded into the action to criticize Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey the \u201ccriminal friendly policies\u201d of all \u201cso-called Progressive Democrat mayors and governors\u201d. Some photos from the protests: Outside the White House: The scene in New York: In Kentucky, demonstrators are protesting the death of Breonna Taylor: In Louisville, Kentucky, demonstrators gathered again to protest the killing of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was shot by police while sleeping in her apartment. The plainclothes officers had been serving a no-knock search warrant, searching for a suspect in a narcotics investigation who Taylor\u2019s family believes was already in custody at the time of her death. Tonight in Louisville, protesters burned flags outside the Hall of Justice before shattering windows and setting fire. Police responded with tear gas. This came after hours of peaceful marching. Hey all, Vivian Ho taking over the blog tonight, as demonstrations over the killing of George Floyd continue to rage across the country. In Brooklyn, we have voting rights editor Ankita Rao on the ground, and she is reporting that the police were clashing with protesters, forcing people - including multiple minors - onto sidewalks and arresting them. Later, despite no apparent violence other than some thrown water bottles, police fired a smoking projectile into the crowd. Some black protesters were urging white protesters to form a barrier between the police, who were trying to push them back. Guardian reporter Vivian Ho has this update on the demonstrations in Atlanta: Protests turned chaotic in downtown Atlanta, with some demonstrators defacing the CNN headquarters and others smashing police vehicles. Protesters threw objects at the CNN building while chanting \u201cno more police\u201d and \u201cfuck CNN\u201d. Someone set a police car on fire. Later, video showed law enforcement entering the fray and smoking projectiles being shot into the screaming crowd. Thousands of protesters remained at Minneapolis\u2019s third precinct police station as the curfew began at 8pm central time, the Guardian\u2019s Chris McGreal reports. The protesters have defied police orders to disperse in advance of the curfew, and police have fired tear gas. The third precinct was the site of Thursday\u2019s night\u2019s fiery riot, when police abandoned their station and it was set on fire. Star Tribune reporter Ryan Faircloth reports that community leaders say they won\u2019t leave until all four of the officers involved are arrested and charged. The Ramsey County jail has released former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin\u2019s booking photo, according to KSTP. Chauvin was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in connection with the death of George Floyd. Jackie Renzetti reports for the Guardian from Minneapolis, where she has just interviewed some of George Floyd\u2019s friends. \u201cHe put his arm around me and embraced myself and other brothers to really bring a change,\u201d Nijalon Dunn told the Guardian while wearing a t-shirt bearing the last message he received from his friend \u201cBig Floyd\u201d. Michael Staley said that his longtime friend was \u201can uplifting person\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s probably the only person who takes time out of his day to let you know how good you are, how great you are,\u201d Staley said. Follow Jackie on Twitter @JackieRenzetti for further updates as the protests continue. Mark Zuckerberg has defended Facebook\u2019s decision to allow Donald Trump to post the threat, \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts,\u201d in a blog post on Friday evening by arguing that Facebook has a policy to allow warnings of the use of force by state actors. \u201cAlthough the post had a troubling historical reference, we decided to leave it up because the National Guard references meant we read it as a warning about state action, and we think people need to know if the government is planning to deploy force,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote in a post on his Facebook page. \u201cOur policy around incitement of violence allows discussion around state use of force, although I think today\u2019s situation raises important questions about what potential limits of that discussion should be,\u201d he added. It was not immediately clear if that policy had ever been articulated by Facebook before. In 2019, a Facebook spokesperson declined to clarify the company\u2019s policy around violence and hate speech by state actors on the record to the Guardian. The Guardian has contacted Facebook for comment. This is not the first time that Facebook\u2019s exemption of state actors from content rules has been questioned. During the campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya in Myanmar, Facebook banned an insurgent group fighting to defend the Muslim minority while allowing Myanmar\u2019s military, the Tatmadaw, to continue using its platform to spread its propaganda. Facebook subsequently banned a number of ethnic armed organizations in Myanmar, designating the officially recognized groups as the equivalent to terrorist organizations. The move prompted an outcry from human rights experts who said the company\u2019s decision to favor state actors over non-state actors in armed conflict was inconsistent with both international law and human rights. In his lengthy post, Zuckerberg also appeared to suggest that if Facebook had decided Trump\u2019s post was intended to incite violence by civilians, they would have taken it down, writing, \u201cUnlike Twitter, we do not have a policy of putting a warning in front of posts that may incite violence because we believe that if a post incites violence, it should be removed regardless of whether it is newsworthy, even if it comes from a politician.\u201d Zuckerberg also criticized Trump, saying: \u201cI\u2019ve been struggling with how to respond to the President\u2019s tweets and posts all day. Personally, I have a visceral negative reaction to this kind of divisive and inflammatory rhetoric.\u201d He added: \u201cI disagree strongly with how the President spoke about this, but I believe people should be able to see this for themselves, because ultimately accountability for those in positions of power can only happen when their speech is scrutinized out in the open.\u201d Guardian voting rights editor Ankita Rao reports from the protest in Brooklyn, New York. Hundreds of protestors gathered at Barclays Center in Brooklyn on Friday evening chanting, \u201cFuck the police,\u201d and \u201cNo justice no peace.\u201d Protestors wore masks though many police did not. \u201cPolice violence is one of the biggest health issues in our country,\u201d said Kimberly Sue, a physician who has also been treating coronavirus patients. \u201cWhether it\u2019s Covid or cops it lowers the life expectancy of black people in this country.\u201d Atlanta native Jabari also said he thought about the risks of Covid-19 when coming but said police brutality and Covid-19 were \u201ctwo viruses killing black people.\u201d Guardian reporter Vivian Ho reports: With protesters outside the gates, it appears that the White House is now under lockdown orders from the Secret Service. Though CNN reporter Jim Acosta used the word \u201cvolatile\u201d to describe the protest, video that he tweeted from outside the White House shows protesters gathered calmly outside, some chanting \u201cBlack lives matter\u201d and others chanting, \u201cNo justice, no peace\u2019. Guardian reporter Vivian Ho reports on the criminal complaint against Derek Chauvin, which provides new details on the killing of George Floyd. Derek Chauvin, the ex-Minneapolis police officer charged today with third-degree murder and manslaughter in connection with the killing of George Floyd, had his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds total, according to the complaint. For two minutes and 53 seconds, Floyd was \u201cnon-responsive\u201d. \u201cPolice are trained that this type of restraint with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous,\u201d the complaint states. As captured in the now-viral video, Floyd repeatedly told the officers \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d before pleading with them, saying \u201cMama\u201d and \u201cplease\u201d. One of the officers responded, \u201cYou are talking fine\u201d as he struggled. The other three officers, identified by authorities as Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J Alexander Kueng, were also fired. According to the complaint, Lane had asked, \u201cShould we roll him on his side?\u201d Chauvin responded, \u201cNo, staying put where we got him.\u201d \u201cI am worried about excited delirium or whatever,\u201d Lane said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have him on his stomach,\u201d Chauvin said. The medical examiner\u2019s autopsy report is still pending, but preliminary findings have determined that a combination of the police hold on Floyd, his underlying health conditions of coronary artery disease and hypertensive heart disease, as well as \u201cany potential intoxicants\u201d likely contributed to his death. Floyd ended up on the ground after Lane pointed his gun at him and instructed him to step out of a car. Lane and Kueng had been responding to a report that someone had used a counterfeit $20 bill at a nearby store, and the store owner identified the person as sitting in a parked car around the corner. There were three people in the car. The officers had handcuffed Floyd and were walking him to their police cruiser when he \u201cstiffened up, fell to the ground, and told the officers he was claustrophobic.\u201d Chauvin and Thoa arrived at about 8:14pm. Within five minutes, Chauvin had his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck. At 8:25pm, the video \u201cappears to show Mr Floyd ceasing to breathe or speak\u201d. \u201cWant to roll him on his side?\u201d Lane asked. Kueng then checked Floyds wrist for a pulse. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find one.\u201d \u201cNone of the officers moved from their positions,\u201d the complaint states. At 8:27pm, Chauvin removed his knee. While the imagery of fires and broken windows have dominated the news, reporters in the Twin Cities have also been documenting acts of community, solidarity and mutual aid. Chris McGreal is in Minneapolis reporting for the Guardian, where he has spoken with community members volunteering to clean up the neighborhood or keep watch over their neighbors. A reporter for the local newspaper, the Star Tribune, has also just retweeted this video of a local mental health clinic that is distributing food to the community. Hunger in the US has spiked in recent months, as the coronavirus pandemic has ravaged the economy, putting more than 40 million people out of work. The Star Tribune has also reported on the owner of a local restaurant, Gandhi Mahal, that was damaged by fire in the rioting on Thursday night. Hafsa Islam wrote on Facebook that her father, Ruhel Islam, responded to news that the restaurant was damaged by staying, \u201cLet my building burn. Justice needs to be served. Put those officers in jail.\u201d As Trump touted hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine Covid-19 cures, prescriptions for the drugs shot up to 214 times higher than normal, according to a new analysis the Journal of the American Medical Association. The number of short-term prescriptions for the dug spied even more: from 2,208 prescriptions over a week in March 2019, to 45,858 from 15 to 21 March this year, according to the research by researchers at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, the Boston Veteran\u2019s Administration Healthcare System and GoodRx. The president has repeatedly promoted hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for Covid-19, despite spotty early evidence that it\u2019s effective. France this week banned the used of Trump\u2019s favorite coronavirus drug after preliminary research suggested that hydroxychloroquine didn\u2019t seem to improve outcomes for Covid-19 patients. The WHO also discontinued the drug\u2019s use in a clinical trial. Although the antimalarial drug is often safely prescribed to treat conditions including lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, it can have serious side effects, including life-threatening heart rhythm problems. Trump said he took a short course of the drug as a preventative measure abasing the coronavirus, despite any evidence that it works. The FDA has warned against using the drug to treat Covid-19 outside hospital settings or as part of clinical trials. Protests are taking place in cities across the US over the alleged police murder of George Floyd. It\u2019s the fourth straight night of protest in Minneapolis, the site of Floyd\u2019s killing and demonstrations are also underway in cities including New York, Atlanta, San Jose, Houston, and elsewhere. Protesters in Atlanta are facing off against police in front of the CNN headquarters, while in New York a large demonstration has convened at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. In San Jose, it appears that protesters have marched onto the highway. We\u2019ll be doing our best to stay on top of the news from around the country as we head into the evening hours. The Trump administration\u2019s new national intelligence chief declassified transcripts of the 2016 phone call between Michael Flynn and then Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. The phone call took place during the transition period between the Trump and Obama administrations, and Flynn pleaded guilty to lying about the details of the call to the FBI. More from the Associated Press: The extraordinary decision to release transcripts of Flynn\u2019s calls with a foreign country\u2019s ambassador, a closely guarded secret for more than three years, is part of an ongoing Trump administration effort to disclose information from the Russia investigation in hopes of painting Obama-era officials in a bad light and suggesting they acted improperly. The transcripts of calls with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador at the time, provide opportunities for partisans on both sides to advance their perspectives of the investigation. They appear to show, as prosecutors have alleged, that Flynn urged Kislyak to refrain from escalating tensions with the US in response to newly imposed sanctions against Russia. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about that call. But Republicans who maintain that Flynn was simply trying to avoid aggravating the situation with the Kremlin quickly pointed to the transcripts to say the calls were proper. Trump\u2019s Justice Department dismissed the case this month, saying the FBI didn\u2019t have a basis to question Flynn in the first place. The documents were released Friday by Senate Republicans after being declassified by John Ratcliffe, a former Texas congressman and loyalist of President Donald Trump who was sworn into the job earlier this week. Donald Trump claimed ignorance about the racist origins of the threat he used last night, \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts,\u201d in a response to a reporter\u2019s question at an event at the White House. Asked how he could \u201cknow that phrase and not know it\u2019s racially charged history,\u201d Trump claimed that the phrase was common and has a different, non-threatening meaning. \u201cWell I\u2019ve heard that phrase for a long time. I don\u2019t know where it came from or where it originated \u2026 I\u2019ve heard it for a long time as most people have \u2026 and frankly it means when there\u2019s looting people get shot and they die. And if you look at what happened last night and the night before, you\u2019ll see that it\u2019s very common and that\u2019s the way that was meant ... It\u2019s very accurate in the sense that when you do have looting like last night people often get shot and that\u2019s not good and we don\u2019t want that to happen.\u201d As has been reported widely today, the phrase has a specific historical origin that is not consistent with the interpretation Trump is now claiming. It was used by Walter Headly, police chief of Miami in the 1960s, as a threat against black residents during times of racial unrest. Representative Jim Clyburn appears to have responded to the new video showing three officers kneeling on George Floyd by calling for \u201ceveryone involved\u201d to be \u201cbrought to justice immediately\u201d. Clyburn is the House Majority Whip and an influential African American Democratic politician. Though all four officers involved in Floyd\u2019s arrest have been fired, only one, Derek Chauvin, has been arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Do Facebook\u2019s rules against incitement to violence apply to Donald Trump? While Twitter has for the second time this week taken an unprecedented action against a tweet by Donald Trump that violate its rules, Facebook has declined to take any enforcement action against the president\u2019s inflammatory threat against grieving protesters reacting to the alleged police murder of George Floyd. Trump\u2019s threatening statement on Thursday night, \u201cAny difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,\u201d echoed a racist 1960s police chief known for ordering patrols of black neighborhoods with shotguns and dogs. It has been widely interpreted as a threat and potential incitement to violence against residents of the Twin Cities who have erupted in protest against the alleged police killing of Floyd, a black man who begged for his life as a white police officer knelt on his neck for several minutes. Twitter responded by invoking a policy it enacted in June 2019 to address the then-hypothetical situation of a major world leader violating its rules in a way that could cause real world harm. The policy allows the company to maintain the tweet for the purpose of accountability and the public record, but hide it behind a warning label. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken action in the interest of preventing others from being inspired to commit violent acts, but have kept the Tweet on Twitter because it is important that the public still be able to see the Tweet given its relevance to ongoing matters of public importance,\u201d the company explained. Facebook also has explicit rules against speech that could inspire or incite violence, but it has taken no action against Trump\u2019s statement, which was also published on his Facebook and Instagram accounts. As of midday Friday, the Facebook post had been shared more than 53,000 times and received 186,000 likes, 31,000 heart emojis, and 6,300 laughing emojis. The text was also overlaid on a photo of Trump for the president\u2019s Instagram account, where it has received more than 380,000 likes. And while Facebook has made a controversial decision to exempt politicians from its third-party fact-checking process, there is no such exception for incitement to violence. \u201cEven for politicians we don\u2019t allow content that incites violence or risks imminent harm \u2014 and of course we don\u2019t allow voter suppression,\u201d Zuckerberg said in a speech on the company\u2019s philosophy about free expression in October 2019. Facebook has not responded to multiple requests for comment. The company has a catastrophic track record in handling incitement to violence by government officials. Facebook was used by Buddhist extremists and military officials in Myanmar to incite hatred and violence against that country\u2019s Muslim minority, the Rohingya, in 2017 \u2013 a campaign of ethnic cleansing that culminated in the killing of 25,000 Rohingya and the forced displacement of 700,000 more. Facebook admitted to failings in Myanmar in 2018 and eventually banned many of the hate preachers and military leaders who had used the platform to inspire genocide. Hello everyone, this is Julia Carrie Wong in Oakland picking up the blog. CNN has just published video with a new angle of George Floyd\u2019s final moments. The footage appears to show three officers kneeling on Floyd. Floyd can be heard begging for the officers to let him up and stating that he cannot breath. Derek Chauvin, the officer who was captured on video shot from another angle kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck for several minutes, allegedly killing him, was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter today. Three other officers present at the incident were fired earlier this week, but have not yet been charged with any crimes. The video is posted on CNN and can be found here. Warning: many people will find the footage upsetting. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Julia Carrie Wong, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The police officer who put his knee on the back of George Floyd\u2019s neck was charged with murder. The Hennepin county attorney announced Derek Chauvin had been charged with third-degree murder and mansalughter in connection to Floyd\u2019s death. The Minneapolis mayor issued a curfew order starting at 8 pm tonight. Mayor Jacob Frey said the curfew would be enforced from 8 pm to 6 am starting tonight, although the order exempts law enforcement officers, medical personnel and the National Guard (among others) from the curfew. Barack Obama said Americans needed to create a \u201cnew normal\u201d to address structural racism. \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be \u2018normal\u2019 in 2020 America,\u201d the former president said of Floyd\u2019s death. \u201cIt can\u2019t be \u2018normal.\u2019\u201d Trump said the US was terminating its relationship with the World Health Organization. The president made the announcement during a Rose Garden press conference, but he took no questions from the press about the protests breaking out in response to Floyd\u2019s death, prompting criticism from Democrats. Trump denied that his tweet about the Minneapolis protests was threatening violence against the demonstrators. The president wrote in a widely criticized tweet, \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d Twitter later hid the tweet because the platform said it glorified violence against protesters. Julia will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Trump said he has spoken to George Floyd\u2019s family, as protests continue in response to Floyd\u2019s death while in police custody. Opening a roundtable on reopening the US economy, the president said Floyd\u2019s family members were \u201cterrific people,\u201d and he emphasized that \u201clooters\u201d should not become the focus of the protests. \u201cThe looters should not be allowed to drown out the voices of peaceful protesters,\u201d Trump said. Of course, Trump himself put the focus on looting when he said in a tweet about the protests, \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d Twitter later hid the tweet because the platform said it glorified violence against the protesters. Senate judiciary committee chairman Lindsey Graham announced the panel would hold a hearing on police use of force. In a statement, Graham said both he and Democratic ranking member Dianne Feinstein were \u201cappalled\u201d by the video of a police officer putting his knee on George Floyd\u2019s neck and decided they needed to hold a hearing \u201cas soon as possible as to how to combat this outrage.\u201d \u201cThe Committee intends to call a wide variety of witnesses on the topics of better policing, addressing racial discrimination regarding the use of force, as well as building stronger bonds between communities and police,\u201d Graham said. \u201cWe intend to shine a bright light on the problems associated with Mr. Floyd\u2019s death, with the goal of finding a better way forward for our nation.\u201d Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey has issued a curfew order that goes into effect at 8pm tonight after days of protests in response to the death of George Floyd. Between 8pm tonight and 6am Saturday morning, residents may not travel on any public street or in any public place, according to Frey\u2019s order. The curfew will also be in effect Saturday night to Sunday morning. The order exempts law enforcement officers, medical personnel, the national guard, and \u201cindividuals seeking exempt care, fleeing dangerous circumstances, or experiencing homelessness\u201d from the curfew. The initial order did not exempt journalists, but Frey said that oversight would quickly be resolved. For more updates on the situation in Minneapolis, follow the Guardian\u2019s Chris McGreal, who is tweeting from the city as it grapples with this crisis: Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said Trump\u2019s Rose Garden press conference this afternoon was \u201cpathetic,\u201d arguing the event demonstrated the president\u2019s \u201cinability to lead when our nation needs it most.\u201d \u201cThe only question is whether President Trump is afraid to lead or just doesn\u2019t know how,\u201d the New York Democrat said in a statement. \u201cAmerica is reeling from 100,000 deaths and rising. 40 million have filed for unemployment. Our communities are hurting from senseless murders and years of racism and injustice. But President Trump is only interested in scapegoating and divisiveness when he should be leading.\u201d Trump left the Rose Garden event, which was billed as a press conference, without taking any questions from reporters about the death of George Floyd or the protests breaking out across the country. Derek Chauvin had his knee on George Floyd\u2019s neck for nearly three minutes after Floyd was non-responsive, according to the criminal complaint against the former Minneapolis police officer. \u201cThe defendant had his knee on Mr. Floyd\u2019s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds in total,\u201d the complaint reads. \u201cTwo minutes and 53 seconds of this was after Mr. Floyd was non-responsive.\u201d The Hennepin county attorney announced this afternoon that Chauvin had been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter and that more charges may be forthcoming. A tearful California governor Gavin Newsom reflected in his biweekly press conference on the death of George Floyd and the protests across the county. Newsom recounted the conversations he\u2019s been having with his children around the events, explaining his daughter first encountered the video of Floyd\u2019s killing on TikTok and has been deeply distraught about the incident since. Newsom argued that the US needs a fundamental culture change to deal with structural racism and the meaningless loss of life. \u201cI sit here deeply humbled, a bit emotional, and deeply resolved to do more and do better,\u201d Newsom said. The Trump campaign accused Democrats and the media of twisting the president\u2019s words about the Minneapolis protesters, even though news outlets (including this one) have been directly quoting from the president\u2019s tweets. \u201cWe have witnessed again the media\u2019s relentless twisting of President Trump\u2019s words, and the Democrats seizing on that, to take the entire nation down the worst road imaginable,\u201d Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement. \u201cTwitter also played a role by mislabeling the President\u2019s tweet and fueling the misinformation.\u201d Trump wrote in a tweet about the demonstrators who are protesting in response to the death of George Floyd, \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d Twitter hid the tweet from the president\u2019s timeline with the warning that it glorified violence against the protesters. \u201cThe facts show that the President expressed horror over the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis and ordered the Department of Justice to get involved,\u201d Parscale said. \u201cWhen riots erupted in that city and elsewhere, he warned on Twitter that looting could quickly turn into violence.\u201d But Trump\u2019s warning about looting was a direct quote from former Miami police chief Walter Headley, who said his officers \u201cknow what to do\u201d when unrest broke out in black neighborhoods during the 1968 Republican National Convention. \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts,\u201d Headley told his officers. So the expression that Trump repeated was less of a warning and more of a directive. Donald Trump has announced he is pulling the US out of the World Health Organisation, three weeks ahead of an ultimatum he laid down earlier this month. On May 19, Trump sent a four-page letter to the WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warning he would permanently cut US funding of the WHO and reconsider US membership if the organisation did \u201cnot commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days.\u201d He has made the break only ten days later, falsely claiming that \u201cChina has total control over\u201d the global health body. Trump said: \u201cWe have detailed the reforms that it must make and engage with them directly, but they have refused to act because they have failed to make the requested and greatly needed reforms. We will be today terminating our relationship with the World Health Organization and redirecting those funds to other worldwide and deserving urgent global public health needs.\u201d The move will confirm the suspicions of many in the WHO and in western capitals that the US was seeking reforms and a dialogue was a smokescreen for a politically-motivated break with the WHO. Beth Cameron, a biologist and former senior official in the National Security Council said on Twitter: \u201cThere aren\u2019t words for how much this decision will hurt the US, our global partners, and our ability to to impact the #COVID19 pandemic that is a threat to our national and global peace and security.\u201d Civil rights leaders say they warned Minnesota authorities many times about community anger building at unfair policing, inequalities. At an impassioned, measured and powerful rally earlier, Leslie Redmond, president of NAACP Minneapolis, said civil rights leaders in the city had succeeded many times in stopping anger boiling over into violence. \u201cI cannot tell you how many governors and how many mayors we have sat down with and warned them that Minneapolis was going to burn. We stoped it from burning so many times,\u201d she said. But she protested that the \u201cpoverty and oppression\u201d that too many black residents are subjected to did not change. She raged against \u201cdisrupters in our midst\u201d who marred what she termed an uprising by turning instead to looting. And Redmond addressed the US president. \u201cTrump, you have not sent resources to Minnesota [to assist in tackling the coronavirus crisis] but you were quick to send in troops. This is not just a black people\u2019s issue, this is a human right issue.\u201d Tamika Mallory, co-founder of the Women\u2019s March, said America was \u201cin a state of emergency.\u201d She accused Donald Trump of promoting white nationalism and even police bias and brutality by declaring himself a nationalist at election rallies and, during the 2016 campaign, encouraging violence against protesters at his rallies. Democratic lawmakers criticized Trump after he left his press conference without taking any questions about George Floyd\u2019s death or the protests breaking out across the country. Congressman Bobby Rush said Trump has \u201cobjectively failed as a leader\u201d and congressman Danny Davis referenced the proverb, \u201cWithout vision, the people perish.\u201d Trump made another announcement during his Rose Garden event, expanding upon secretary of state Mike Pompeo\u2019s announcement earlier this week that the US no longer considers Hong Kong to be autonomous of China. The president said his administration will begin the process of eliminating policy exemptions that give Hong Kong \u201cdifferent and special treatment.\u201d After making his two announcements, Trump left the event without taking any questions, an unusual choice for a president who has consistently answered reporters\u2019 queries since the start of the coronavirus crisis. Trump opened the event by saying, \u201cI am here to talk about China,\u201d indicating he would not be addressing the death of George Floyd or the protests breaking out across the country. As the president departed, he ignored questions about the protests and whether he has spoken to Floyd\u2019s family, as Joe Biden has. Trump has just announced that the US will be \u201cterminating\u201d its relationship with the World Health Organization. The president blamed China for the spread of coronavirus and accused the WHO of failing to hold China accountable. \u201cWhen was murder ever worth it?\u201d Retired NBA basketball player Stephen Jackson, who was such a close friend of the late George Floyd that he described the man as his twin, spoke out fiercely at a rally in Minneapolis a little earlier. He said of the police in a killing like Floyd\u2019s: \u201cThe first thing they try to do is cover it up and bring up your background, to make it seem like the bullshit that they did was worth it. When was murder ever worth it?\u201d He added: \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me that when that man had his knee on my brother\u2019s neck, taking his life away, with his hand in his pocket and a smirk on his face that I\u2019m protected.\u201d Trump\u2019s original tweet about looting was hidden by Twitter because the platform said the message glorified violence against the Minneapolis protesters. The president said of the original tweet, \u201cNobody should have any problem with this other than the haters, and those looking to cause trouble on social media.\u201d But the president\u2019s warning was met with widespread shock and horror, and Trump did not offer any kind of apology for the tweet. The president will soon hold a press conference on China at the White House, where he will almost certainly be bombarded with questions from reporters about the tweet. Trump has sent another tweet about his menacing warning to Minneapolis protesters last night that, \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d \u201cLooting leads to shooting, and that\u2019s why a man was shot and killed in Minneapolis on Wednesday night - or look at what just happened in Louisville with 7 people shot. I don\u2019t want this to happen, and that\u2019s what the expression put out last night means,\u201d Trump said. The president added, \u201cIt was spoken as a fact, not as a statement.\u201d However, former Miami police chief Walter Headley absolutely meant the expression as a statement when he first used it in 1967, as unrest broke out in black neighborhoods. When violence started up again in 1968, Headley said his officers \u201cknow what to do\u201d and repeated, \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d The expression was a clear directive to police officers on how to respond to unrest. The Hennepin county attorney said Derek Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. \u201cThere may be subsequent charges later,\u201d Mike Freeman told reporters at a press conference. He said a detailed complaint would be made available this afternoon. When asked why the other three fired police officers had not yet been arrested, Freeman said, \u201cWe felt it appropriate to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator.\u201d He later said he anticipated charges to be filed against them, but he did not get into details. Freeman noted Chauvin was arrested less than four days after George Floyd\u2019s death. \u201cThat\u2019s extraordinary,\u201d said Freeman, who has been criticized for not arresting Chauvin more quickly. \u201cWe have never charged a case in that kind of time frame.\u201d Freeman emphasized he and his team would not have moved ahead with the case if they were not confident they had evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the officer was guilty. \u201cAs of right now, we have that,\u201d Freeman said. Joe Biden called for justice in the death of George Floyd and warned that silence in the wake of his death amounted to complicity. \u201cThe original sin of this country still stains our nation today and sometimes we managed to overlook it,\u201d Biden said, speaking from a lectern at his home in Wilmington, Delaware. \u201cBut it\u2019s always there. And in weeks like this, we see it plainly that we are a country with an open wound.\u201d \u201cNone of us can be silent,\u201d he continued. \u201cNone of us can \u2026 hear the words \u2018I can\u2019t breathe\u2019 and do nothing.\u201d During his nearly six-minute remarks, which were hastily arranged on Friday, Biden announced that he had spoken to Floyd\u2019s family and vowed to do \u201ceverything in our power to see to it that justice is had.\u201d Biden never mentioned Trump by name, but he assailed the president\u2019s response on Twitter, which called the protestors \u201cthugs\u201d and warned that additional violence could ensue: \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d \u201cThis is no time for incendiary tweets. It\u2019s no time to encourage violence,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a national crisis. We need real leadership right now.\u201d Quoting Martin Luther King, who warned of the \u201cappalling silence\u201d of good people, Biden urged the nation to imagine the pain and fear felt by many black Americans on a daily basis. \u201cWith our complacency, our silence, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence. Nothing about this will be easy or comfortable. But if we simply allow this wound to scab over once more without treating the underlying injury, we\u2019re never truly heal. \u201cWe need justice for George Floyd,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe need real police reform that holds cops to a higher standard that so many of them actually meet, that holds bad cops accountable.\u201d Senator Kamala Harris said the other three police officers who were fired over George Floyd\u2019s death must also be brought to justice. The California senator said of the arrest of Derek Chauvin, \u201cA start, but every single officer involved must be held accountable for George Floyd\u2019s murder.\u201d Harris has been named as a potential running mate to Joe Biden, but some progressives have expressed concern about her criminal justice record, citing her tenure as California\u2019s attorney general. Senator Amy Klobuchar confirmed Derek Chauvin has been arrested in connection to the death of George Floyd and is in the custody of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. The Minnesota senator called Chauvin\u2019s arrest \u201cthe first step towards justice.\u201d Klobuchar has been criticized for not prosecuting police officers involved in fatal encounters while she was serving as Hennepin county attorney. Kenya Evelyn reported yesterday: Between 1999 and 2007, Klobuchar, the state\u2019s then top prosecutor, declined to press charges against more than a dozen officers accused of killing civilians. In 2006, Chauvin was one of several officers involved in the shooting death of a man who stabbed others before turning on the police. Although Klobuchar was the Hennepin county attorney at the time of an October 2006 police shooting involving Chauvin, she did not prosecute and instead the case went to a grand jury that declined to charge the officers with wrongdoing in 2008. In an interview with MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell this afternoon, Klobuchar said it was \u201cabsolutely false\u201d she declined to prosecute Chauvin. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who has been identified as the man who put his knee on George Floyd\u2019s neck, has been arrested in connection to Floyd\u2019s death. John Mark Harrington, the Minnesota department of public safety commissioner, announced the news shortly after a press conference about the Minneapolis protests ended. Harrington did not offer any information about the specific charges filed against Chauvin, and it\u2019s unclear whether the three other officers who were also fired after Floyd\u2019s death will be arrested. Despite his strong words condemning structural racism, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell dodged a question about Trump\u2019s tweet threatening violence against the Minneapolis protesters. \u201cI generally don\u2019t comment on the President\u2019s tweets,\u201d McConnell told reporters on Capitol Hill. \u201cI can speak for myself.\u201d In contrast, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer condemned Trump\u2019s tweet, which read in part, \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d \u201cPresident Trump is pouring gasoline on the flames by quoting a racist police chief,\u201d Schumer wrote in a tweet. Trump\u2019s tweet appeared to be referencing a quote from former Miami police chief Walter Headley during unrest among black residents in 1967. Headley repeated the quote when violence broke out in a black neighborhood as Miami hosted the Republican National Convention. In response to criticism of his policies, Headley said, \u201cDon\u2019t these people know that most of the crimes in the Negro districts are against Negroes? Don\u2019t they know we\u2019re trying to protect Negroes as well as whites?\u201d Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell released a statement condemning violence amid the protests and demanding structural change to avoid more deaths like George Floyd\u2019s. \u201cThe killings of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, George Floyd in Minneapolis, and Breonna Taylor in my hometown of Louisville, Kentucky have shaken our nation,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cFor millions and millions of outraged Americans, these tragedies do not appear as isolated incidents, but as the latest disturbing chapters in our long, unfinished American struggle to ensure that equal justice under law is not conditional on the color of one\u2019s skin.\u201d But the Kentucky Republican stressed that the protests in response to the deaths of Arbery, Floyd and Taylor should remain peaceful. McConnell expressed dismay about seven people being shot in Louisville last night during a protest over Taylor\u2019s death. \u201cOur city, our state, and our country have to pull together,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cViolence does not make our streets safer. Injustice does not promote justice. Destruction does not build a better society. We will only be able to chart the future we want if we do it together.\u201d Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Twitter said Trump\u2019s tweet threatening Minneapolis protesters glorified violence. The platform has hidden the president\u2019s tweet about the protests in reaction to the death of George Floyd, which read in part, \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d Barack Obama said Americans needed to create a \u201cnew normal\u201d to address structural racism. \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be \u2018normal\u2019 in 2020 America,\u201d the former president said of Floyd\u2019s death. \u201cIt can\u2019t be \u2018normal.\u2019\u201d Minnesota governor Tim Walz pledged \u201cswift\u201d justice for Floyd. Walz said the four police officers who were fired over Floyd\u2019s death must be held accountable, but he argued the state needed to \u201crestore order\u201d before addressing the issues that led to Floyd\u2019s death. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Leading civil rights attorneys Ben Crump and Lee Merritt have called on the US Congress and the United Nations to become involved in addressing the killings of black Americans in recent weeks that have further inflamed deep-seated anger and grief in the country over entrenched racism and systemic inequality. The two lawyers held a virtual press conference this morning with representatives of three families who recently lost their loved ones - George Floyd in Minnesota, Breonna Taylor in Kentucky and Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia. The first two victims were killed by police while Arbery was gunned down by two white men as he went jogging in their neighborhood. \u201cWe need a national response. Civil rights attorneys around the country say we can no longer do this on a case by case basis,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cWe know there are, on average, 1,000 police officer involved shootings a year. We live in the most incarcerated nation on planet Earth,\u201d he said, adding there was a weariness of getting mere \u201ctrickles of justice\u201d. Merritt said he would be requesting that the United Nations Human Rights Committee hear the cases of the three killings. The lawyers plan to present a case to the UN calling for sweeping changes to America\u2019s criminal justice system - which Crump earlier in the week equated to two, far from equal, systems \u201cone for black America and one for white America\u201d. The two lawyers called for a congressional hearing and the creation of a national task force to craft bipartisan legislation aimed at \u201cending racial violence and increasing police accountability\u201d in the US. Crump said it was \u201cso necessary that we have this action today to finally address this national pandemic. We have coronavirus, but communities of color have been dealing with another pandemic for far too long.\u201d He said Breonna Taylor, an EMT, was killed for \u201csleeping while black in the sanctity of her own apartment\u201d, after police shot wildly during a plain-clothes raid on her address in March; Ahmaud Arbery was cut down for \u201cjogging while black\u201d and George Floyd died \u201cjust trying to breathe while black\u201d. Floyd was pinned to the street with a white police officer\u2019s knee on his neck for almost nine minutes on Monday, with him losing consciousness about halfway through, according to witnesses. Merritt concluded: \u201cEvery other modern nation in the world has figured out a way of policing its citizens without killing so many of them and without incarcerating so many of them.\u201d The White House has just announced Trump will hold a press conference in the Rose Garden at 2 pm ET. The president said yesterday that he would hold a press conference on China, as Trump has tried to blame the country for the spread of coronavirus. Trump has also involved China in his ongoing spat with Twitter, accusing the platform of targeting him for fact-checking while ignoring false claims from Chinese officials. (Twitter has since added fact-check labels to some tweets from Chinese officials.) Even though the press conference is meant to focus on China, the president will almost certainly be bombarded with questions from reporters about his tweet threatening violence against the Minneapolis protesters. Echoing Barack Obama\u2019s words, Minnesota governor Tim Walz said the pre-coronavirus normal is not neessarily a place the state should return to. \u201cNormal was not working for many communities,\u201d Walz said at his press conference. \u201cNormal was not working for George Floyd.\u201d A number of state and local officials have talked about the need to \u201cbuild back better,\u201d as New York governor Andrew Cuomo has said, as states start to reopen their economies. Former president Barack Obama has issued a statement on the death of George Floyd, saying the country needed to create a new normal for Americans of color. Obama said that despite many Americans\u2019 desire to return to \u201cnormal\u201d amid the coronavirus pandemic, racial discrimination is \u201cmaddeningly\u201d normal for people of color. \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be \u2018normal\u2019 in 2020 America,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt can\u2019t be \u2018normal.\u2019\u201d The former president called on Americans to come together to create a \u201cnew normal\u201d in order to root out institutional racism. Minnesota governor Tim Walz said justice would be served for George Floyd, saying he was \u201cconfident\u201d in the prosecutors involved in the case. \u201cIt is my expectation that justice for the officers involved in this will be swift, that it will come in a timely manner, that it will be fair,\u201d Walz said. \u201cThat is what we\u2019ve asked for.\u201d The Democratic governor said he had been in contact with the Hennepin county attorney to ensure the officers will be held accountable. Musician Taylor Swift has now weighed in on the president\u2019s tweet threatening violence against protesters in Minnesota, vowing to help defeat Trump in November. \u201cAfter stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism your entire presidency, you have the nerve to feign moral superiority before threatening violence?\u201d Swift wrote in a tweet to her 86 million followers. \u201cWe will vote you out in November.\u201d The pop star has been relatively quiet about politics in the past, but she has recently gotten more involved, endorsing Democratic Senate candidate Phil Bredesen in 2018. Minnesota governor Tim Walz said the state had to \u201crestore order\u201d to Minneapolis, which has been rocked by protests, before addressing the structural issues that led to the death of George Floyd. \u201cWe have to restore order to our society before we can start addressing the issues,\u201d Walz said at a press conference. The Democratic governor said he would not \u201cpatronize you as a white man,\u201d but he asked the protesters to help restore peace to the city. Walz also apologized for the arrests of CNN reporter Omar Jimenez and his camera crew, saying he had spoken to CNN president Jeff Zucker moments after learning of the incident. \u201cI take full responsibility,\u201d Walz said, emphasizing that the arrests should never have occurred. The National Association of Black Journalists condemned the Minneapolis police for arresting CNN reporter Omar Jimenez while he was covering the George Floyd protests. NABJ president Dorothy Tucker said in a tweet that it was \u201cunfathomable and upsetting to witness this structural racism in real time.\u201d Tucker later added, \u201cWe are relieved to see Omar has been released, but we are still disturbed by the apparent violation of First Amendment rights that are the bedrock of journalism.\u201d Democratic senator Bob Casey said he has tested positive for coronavirus antibodies, indicating he had a mild case of the virus and recovered. \u201cEarlier this spring, I experienced a low-grade fever and some mild flu-like symptoms for a number of days. I consulted my physician over the phone, who suggested that I quarantine at home in Scranton for a period of two weeks,\u201d Casey said in a statement. The Pennsylvania senator noted he intends to donate blood plasma, which has been used to help treat coronavirus patients. Casey\u2019s announcement comes a day after senator Tim Kaine said he had also tested positive for coronavirus antibodies, and senator Rand Paul tested positive for the virus in March. The two announcements indicate several more senators may have become infected with the virus several weeks ago. Congresswoman Val Demings, a former police chief, wrote a Washington Post op-ed calling for the officers who were fired over the death of George Floyd to be held accountable. Demings wrote: We all know that the level of force must meet the level of resistance. We all can see that there was absolutely zero resistance from George Floyd. He posed no threat to anyone, especially law enforcement. ... In Minnesota, we have no choice but to hold the officers accountable through the criminal-justice system. But we cannot only be reactive. We must be proactive. We must work with law enforcement agencies to identify problems before they happen. Demings has been named as a potential running mate to Joe Biden, who said this morning that he was \u201cfurious\u201d at Trump for threatening violence against the protesters in Minneapolis. Melania Trump struck a notably calmer note about the George Floyd protests than her husband, urging the demonstrators in Minneapolis to avoid engaging in violence. \u201cI\u2019ve seen our citizens unify &amp; take care of one another through COVID19 &amp; we can\u2019t stop now,\u201d the first lady wrote in a tweet, going on to offer condolences to Floyd\u2019s family. The tweet was a rather stark contrast from Trump, who threatened violence against the protesters and said, \u201cWhen looting starts, shooting starts.\u201d Joe Biden has weighed in on Trump\u2019s tweet glorifying violence against protesters and the arrest of a CNN reporter in Minneapolis. \u201cThis is not abstract: a black reporter was arrested while doing his job this morning, while the white police officer who killed George Floyd remains free. I am glad swift action was taken, but this, to me, says everything,\u201d the presumptive Democratic nominee wrote in a tweet. Biden said he would not \u201clift\u201d Trump\u2019s tweet that partly reads, \u201cWhen looting starts, shooting starts.\u201d \u201cI will not give him that amplification. But he is calling for violence against American citizens during a moment of pain for so many. I\u2019m furious, and you should be too,\u201d Biden wrote. Before his death beneath a Minneapolis police officer\u2019s knee on Monday, George Floyd was suffering the same fate as millions of Americans during the coronavirus pandemic: out of work and looking for a new job. Floyd moved to Minneapolis from his native Houston several years ago in hopes of finding work and starting a new life, Christopher Harris, Floyd\u2019s lifelong friend, told the Associated Press. As a teen in Texas he was a football star many nicknamed \u201cgentle giant\u201d. But he lost his job as a bouncer at a restaurant when Minnesota\u2019s governor issued a stay-at-home order. Floyd, 46, grew up in Houston\u2019s Third Ward, one of the city\u2019s predominantly black neighborhoods, where he and Harris met in middle school. At 6 feet, 6 inches, Floyd emerged as a star football player, positioned as the tight end for Jack Yates High School team, and played in the 1992 state championship game in the Houston Astrodome. Donnell Cooper, one of Floyd\u2019s former classmates, said he remembered watching Floyd score touchdowns. Floyd towered over everyone and earned the nickname \u201cgentle giant.\u201d \u201cQuiet personality but a beautiful spirit,\u201d Cooper said. His life later took a different turn and in 2007 Floyd was charged with armed robbery in a home invasion in Houston and in 2009 was sentenced to five years in prison as part of a plea deal, according to court documents. Harris, Floyd\u2019s childhood friend, said he and some of their mutual friends had moved to Minneapolis in search of jobs around 2014. Harris said he talked Floyd into moving there as well after he got out of prison. \u201cHe was looking to start over fresh, a new beginning,\u201d Harris said. \u201cHe was happy with the change he was making.\u201d Just hours after being arrested while covering the Minneapolis protests, CNN reporter Omar Jimenez and his crew are back on the air, reporting live about the death of George Floyd. Twitter has hidden a White House tweet for glorifying violence, applying the same label to an official government account that it did to Trump\u2019s account. The White House account had reshared the president\u2019s tweet about the Minneapolis protests, which read in part, \u201cWhen the looting starts, shooting starts.\u201d Twitter hid Trump\u2019s original tweet and has now taken the same course of action with the White House\u2019s tweet, a disappointing illustration of the current state of affairs. A Democratic congressman from Minnesota criticized police officers for arresting a CNN crew amid the Minneapolis protests. \u201cI can neither understand nor accept that a crew of credentialed reporters were arrested for doing their jobs while a crew of officers have not been arrested for the killing of a defenseless man by violating the most fundamental responsibility of their jobs,\u201d wrote Dean Phillips, who represents the Minneapolis suburbs. The arrests of Omar Jimenez and his crew, wbo have since been released, appear to have heightened pressure on Minnesota officials to press charges against the four police officers who were fired over the death of George Floyd. This is Joan Greve, taking over for Tom McCarthy. CNN reporter Omar Jimenez, who was arrested while live on air in Minneapolis, described his ordeal after being released from police custody. Jimenez said he and his crew had been in \u201cverbal contact\u201d with some of the police officers before he was arrested to determine where they should stand as they reported. He noted there had been no police presence shortly before the arrest, but another person had raced past the crew and been apprehended before officers turned to Jimenez and his crew. When Jimenez asked the officer why he was placing him under arrest, the officer said, \u201cI\u2019m just following orders.\u201d Dan Scavino Jr, Trump\u2019s longtime social media director, has come out swinging against Twitter after the site hid a tweet by Trump overnight that it said violated its rules against glorifying violence. Tweeting on Twitter, Scavino accuses the site of \u201ctargeting the president\u201d. In a further escalation of the social media sideshow, the White House twitter account, which Scavino runs, has re-posted the president\u2019s posts blocked by Twitter. Trump signed an executive order yesterday that could erode legal protections for Twitter and other social media platforms against liability for content posted on their sites. That followed an unprecedented action by Twitter in which the company slapped a fact-check on Trump lies about the integrity of mail-in voting. Beneath it all is the question of who needs whom more: the US president, or Twitter? The Trump campaign has weighed in on the arrest by Minnesota law enforcement of CNN journalist Omar Jimenez and his crew. In a cynical somersault, for a campaign trying to reelect a president who has done more to undermine trust in the American media including CNN than any public figure in memory, the Trump campaign comes down on CNN\u2019s side, calling the arrest \u201coutrageous.\u201d The Trump campaign accuses the local and state Democratic elected leaders of failed leadership. There is visible daylight between this campaign statement, which spotlights the federal investigation of Floyd\u2019s killing, and Trump\u2019s own statements, including his tweet overnight about shooting protesters. The Minnesota state patrol releases a statement suggesting there was some doubt as to whether Jimenez and his crew were journalists at the time of their arrest. That\u2019s hard to square with the footage. Jimenez was holding out his press credentials, identified himself as a journalist and his crew had a professional TV camera as they broadcast the scene live. CNN reporter Omar Jimenez has been released from police custody in Minneapolis and is describing his ordeal on air. He says that arresting officers told him, \u201cI\u2019m just following orders.\u201d In video of his arrest he asks officers where they want him to be and identifies himself as a journalist. No charges were filed and the governor of Minnesota has apologized to Jimenez: Hello and welcome to our continuing coverage of protests across the United States at the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota this week. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died in police custody after a white officer handcuffed him and kneeled on his neck for several minutes as Floyd pleaded that he could not breathe. The protests spread across the nation Thursday night, with people taking the streets from Denver to Kentucky to Oakland to New York. Donald Trump poured fuel on the conflagration with a late-night tweet threatening protesters with a violent military crackdown: \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts,\u201d Trump tweeted. Twitter responded by hiding the tweet behind a warning saying the message violated the site\u2019s \u201crules about glorifying violence.\u201d The center of protest activity remained in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St Paul, where prosecutors have declined so far to bring charges in Floyd\u2019s killing. Both the FBI and the US attorney\u2019s office are investigating the killing, and charges could result. Protesters demanding justice for Floyd set fire to a police precinct building and local businesses, with some reports of looting. The city\u2019s mayor, Jacob Frey, ordered the precinct evacuated. No injuries were reported. Police in Minneapolis arrested a CNN reporter live on air overnight. The reporter, Omar Jimenez, had just shown a protester being arrested when about half a dozen white police officers surrounded him. \u201cWe can move back to where you like,\u201d he told the officers wearing gas masks and face shields, before explaining that he and his crew were members of the press. \u201cWe\u2019re getting out of your way.\u201d The governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz, a Democrat, said he \u201cdeeply apologizes\u201d for the arrest. Walz mobilized the state\u2019s National Guard on Thursday to respond in Minneapolis.",

For starters, there is the famous early 20th century case of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/10/typhoid-mary-super-spreader-history\">\u201cTyphoid Mary\u201d,</a> a cook who infected 53 people in various households in the US with typhoid fever despite displaying no symptoms herself. In fact, all bacterial, viral and parasitic infections \u2013 ranging from malaria to HIV \u2013 have a certain proportion of asymptomatic carriers. Research has even shown that at any one time, all of us are infected <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X16302403#bib1\">with between eight and 12 viruses</a>, without showing any symptoms.</p> <p>From the microbe\u2019s perspective, this makes perfect evolutionary sense. \u201cFor any virus or bacteria, making people infectious but not ill is an excellent way to spread and persist in populations,\u201d says Rein Houben, an infectious diseases researcher at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical medicine.</p> <p>However, when Covid-19 was identified at the start of the year, many public health officials both in the UK and around the world failed to account for the threat posed by asymptomatic transmission. This is largely because they were working on models based on influenza, where some estimates suggest that only 5% of people infected are asymptomatic. As a result, the large scale diagnostic testing regimes required to pick up asymptomatic Covid-19 cases were not in place until too late.</p> <p>\u201cI warned on 24 January to <a href=\"https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-news-reports-that-the-china-coronavirus-may-spread-before-symptoms-show/\">consider asymptomatic cases</a> as a transmission vehicle for Covid-19, but this was ignored at the time,\u201d says Bill Keevil, professor of environmental healthcare at the University of Southampton. \u201cSince then, many countries have reported asymptomatic cases, never showing obvious symptoms, but shedding virus.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Finding the real number of asymptomatic patients</strong></h2> <p>The <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762028\">first identified case</a> of asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 occurred in early January, when a traveller from Wuhan passed on the virus to five family members in different parts of the city of Anyang. After testing positive, she then remained asymptomatic for the entire 21-day follow-up period.</p> <p>While scientists still don\u2019t know whether asymptomatic people are as contagious as those who display symptoms, there are still many ways in which they can pass on Covid-19. \u201cWe know that you don\u2019t need to be coughing to transmit a respiratory infection like Sars-CoV-2,\u201d says Houben. \u201cTalking, singing, even <a href=\"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0020086\">blowing instruments like a vuvuzela</a> \u2013 in the past all of those have been shown to transmit respiratory viruses in some way.\u201d</p> <p>Since January, the race has been on to try and identify just how many asymptomatic cases are out there, with <a href=\"https://www.scripps.edu/science-and-medicine/translational-institute/about/news/sarc-cov-2-infection/\">varying findings</a>. <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20053157v1\">One study</a> in the Italian town of Vo reported that 43% of the town\u2019s cases of Covid-19 were asymptomatic, while initial reports from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention investigation into <a href=\"https://www.scripps.edu/science-and-medicine/translational-institute/about/news/sarc-cov-2-infection/\">the spread of Covid-19 </a>on the Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier in March, suggest that as many as 58% of cases were asymptomatic. Some 48% of the 1,046 cases of Covid-19 on the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier proved to be asymptomatic while, of the 712 people who tested positive for Covid-19 on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, 46% had no symptoms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"45ff4acdd93a9952c70ff07af74cb8b19cdb6fbf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45ff4acdd93a9952c70ff07af74cb8b19cdb6fbf/0_94_3887_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"French navy sailors wearing face masks seen through a porthole.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two thirds of the nearly 2,000 sailors on this French aircraft carrier tested positive, but 48% of those were asymptomatic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christophe Simon/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAlmost all evidence seems to point to a proportion of asymptomatic infections of around 40%, with a wide range,\u201d says Houben. \u201cThe proportion is also highly variable with age. Nearly all infected children seem to remain asymptomatic, whereas the reverse seems to hold for the elderly.\u201d</p> <p>Houben points out that, because most asymptomatic people have no idea they are infected, they are unlikely to be self-isolating, and studies have shown this has contributed to the rampant spread of the virus in facilities such as <a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2020/04/14/coronavirus-boston-homeless-testing\">homeless shelters</a> and <a href=\"http://physiciansweekly.com/covid-19-asymptomatic-transmission-fueled-nursing-home-death-toll/\">care homes</a>. He says this means there is a need for regular diagnostic testing of almost all people in such closed environments, including prisons and psychiatric facilities.</p> <p>\u201cWhen it comes to controlling Covid-19, this really shows that we cannot rely on self-isolation of symptomatic cases only,\u201d he says. \u201cGoing forwards we need trace and test approaches to account for individuals who are not reporting any symptoms.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Following Korea\u2019s example</strong></h2> <p>Since February, the country that has arguably had the greatest success in suppressing asymptomatic spread of Covid-19 is South Korea. Armed with a rigorous contact tracing and diagnostic testing regime, which involved dozens of drive-through testing centres across major cities enabling tests to be carried out at a rate of one every 10 minutes, they put specific policies in place to offset the threat of asymptomatic carriers from the moment the virus began to spread out of control in Daegu.</p> <p>\u201cOnce identified, all asymptomatic people are asked to self quarantine in their house until they test negative, with health service officials checking on them twice daily, and monitoring their symptoms,\u201d says Eunha Shim, an epidemiologist at Soongsil University in Seoul.</p> <p>As Korea attempts to prevent a second wave of infections while reopening schools and allowing people to return to offices, preventing asymptomatic spread is one of their main priorities. This is being done by a mass public health campaign advocating the wearing of masks at all times outside the home. In Seoul, it is not possible to access the subway without a mask.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e970424f4acbcbeece7846768dd414c410488578\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e970424f4acbcbeece7846768dd414c410488578/0_47_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People queue at an outdoor clinic testing clinic in Bucheon, South Korea.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People queue at an outdoor clinic testing clinic in Bucheon, South Korea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yonhap/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many scientists are increasingly calling for this policy to be officially introduced in the UK, especially as more and more people resume commuting in the coming months. Keevil says: \u201cThere is a strong case to be made for the public wearing appropriate face covers in confined areas such as stations, trains, metro carriages and buses, where it is extremely difficult to maintain the two-metre gap, considered essential to allow respiratory droplets from infected people to fall down before making contact with other people.</p> <p>\u201cThe argument is that face covers may not protect the wearer, but might significantly reduce transmission of virus particles to adjacent people in the closed environment. If there is any benefit to be gained, then everyone should wear a mask, which is why some countries are fining people who do not wear a mask and preventing them travelling.\u201d</p> <p>Some have argued that masks may pose a risk of harm to the wearer because of their potential to become an infectious surface, but Keevil says this can be avoided through proper cleaning.</p> <p>\u201cThere would need to be policies such as, when arriving at work, place the mask immediately in a plastic bag and wash your hands,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then, when returning home, carefully take off the mask and place it immediately in a washing machine for a 60C wash and wash your hands.\u201d</p> <p>It remains to be seen whether the UK government endorses this as an official recommendation, but a <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2020/may/hospitals-are-safer-places-you-might-think-new-covid-19-research-finds\">recent study</a> across Barts NHS Trust hospitals in London has illustrated how regular testing and social distancing combined with use of facial protection \u2013 in this case PPE \u2013 can prevent asymptomatic spread of the virus.

When people see something like the Cummings affair \u2026 that\u2019s not a recipe for trust.\u201d</p> \n<p>West predicted there would be an increase in infection rates and a second wave of the virus once the lockdown was eased, accusing the government of playing politics during a health crisis.</p> \n<p>\u201cPut all this together and you have a huge risk, and it\u2019s not just me saying that, that there will be an increase in infection rates. The government is not taking its responsibilities for political leadership seriously.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis should not be treated as a political crisis but as a health crisis: if you treat it as a political crisis it\u2019s all about managing your reputation; if you treat it as a health crisis it\u2019s about saving lives.\u201d</p> \n<p>Separately, Prof Peter Horby said on Saturday that, while thousands of people a day are still becoming infected with coronavirus, lockdown measures may be being eased too soon.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6424c9eb492319f4b715bbc6c1bab92499080801\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6424c9eb492319f4b715bbc6c1bab92499080801/0_39_417_521/400.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Horby.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Horby.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nuffield department of medicine</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Horby, of the University of Oxford, joined Sir Jeremy Farrar and Prof John Edmunds, all members of Sage, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/29/covid-19-spreading-too-fast-to-lift-uk-lockdown-sage-adviser\">warning that ministers were taking risks</a>.</p> \n<p>Boris Johnson has announced a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/groups-up-to-six-people-allowed-meet-england-monday-coronavirus-lockdown-easing\">gradual easing of the lockdown in England from Monday</a>, when friends and relatives will be able to meet in parks and gardens in physically distanced groups of six.</p> \n<p>\u201cHappy Monday\u201d will also signal the reopening of schools \u2013 allowing children in nurseries, early-years settings, reception, year 1 and year 6 to return to class \u2013 as well as more shops, with outdoor retail and car showrooms able to resume operations.</p> \n<p>Horby told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cYou know, we have still got 8,000 cases a day. We have been very successful in bringing it down, decreasing the numbers because of the social distancing.\u201d</p> \n<p>But he said it was vital \u201cwe don\u2019t lose control again\u201d.</p> \n<p>He highlighted the scientific advisers\u2019 advice regarding the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/what-is-the-test-track-and-trace-system-in-england-coronavirus\">NHS </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/what-is-the-test-track-and-trace-system-in-england-coronavirus\">test and </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/what-is-the-test-track-and-trace-system-in-england-coronavirus\">trace system</a>, which is being rolled out across England with the help of 25,000 contact tracers.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are entering a period where there is a risk of increasing transmission, but we don\u2019t yet have that safety net fully in place.

      "bodyText": "The government is facing increasing pressure from its scientific advisers over the decision to ease England\u2019s lockdown, with one warning that the Dominic Cummings affair has eroded trust in its authority. Prof Robert West, a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours (SPI-B) that advises the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), emphasised on Saturday that about 8,000 infections, and 400 deaths, are still happening each day. West said the decision by Cummings, the prime minister\u2019s key adviser, to travel from London to Durham during the full lockdown would have an impact on people adhering to the latest rules. The University College London scientist said: \u201cTrust in authority telling you to do things is very important when it comes to people adhering to those rules. When people see something like the Cummings affair \u2026 that\u2019s not a recipe for trust.\u201d West predicted there would be an increase in infection rates and a second wave of the virus once the lockdown was eased, accusing the government of playing politics during a health crisis. \u201cPut all this together and you have a huge risk, and it\u2019s not just me saying that, that there will be an increase in infection rates. The government is not taking its responsibilities for political leadership seriously. \u201cThis should not be treated as a political crisis but as a health crisis: if you treat it as a political crisis it\u2019s all about managing your reputation; if you treat it as a health crisis it\u2019s about saving lives.\u201d Separately, Prof Peter Horby said on Saturday that, while thousands of people a day are still becoming infected with coronavirus, lockdown measures may be being eased too soon. Horby, of the University of Oxford, joined Sir Jeremy Farrar and Prof John Edmunds, all members of Sage, in warning that ministers were taking risks. Boris Johnson has announced a gradual easing of the lockdown in England from Monday, when friends and relatives will be able to meet in parks and gardens in physically distanced groups of six. \u201cHappy Monday\u201d will also signal the reopening of schools \u2013 allowing children in nurseries, early-years settings, reception, year 1 and year 6 to return to class \u2013 as well as more shops, with outdoor retail and car showrooms able to resume operations. Horby told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cYou know, we have still got 8,000 cases a day. We have been very successful in bringing it down, decreasing the numbers because of the social distancing.\u201d But he said it was vital \u201cwe don\u2019t lose control again\u201d. He highlighted the scientific advisers\u2019 advice regarding the NHS test and trace system, which is being rolled out across England with the help of 25,000 contact tracers. \u201cWe are entering a period where there is a risk of increasing transmission, but we don\u2019t yet have that safety net fully in place. Returning to a situation where we lost control again is far worse than another week or two of social measures,\u201d he said. The test-and-trace programme will not be operational at a local level until the end of June, and an accompanying app has been delayed by several weeks. Farrar also said the test-and-trace system needed to be \u201cfully working\u201d before measures were eased. He wrote on Twitter: \u201cC-19 spreading too fast to lift lockdown in England. Agree with John &amp; clear science advice. \u201cTTI (test, trace and isolate) has to be in place, fully working, capable dealing any surge immediately, locally responsive, rapid results &amp; infection rates have to be lower. And trusted.\u201d A poll conducted by the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) of 2,000 of its members revealed that nine out of 10 plan to open their schools on 1 June, but with fewer children than the government has advised, despite opposition from teaching unions. Johnson has said the government\u2019s five key tests required for easing lockdown have been met and schools can admit more pupils from Monday. The 450,000-member strong National Education Union (NEU) has said the date is \u201cnot viable\u201d. Other unions, including the NAHT and the NASUWT, raised their concerns about reopening schools on 1 June with the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, on Thursday. Minutes of Sage meetings released by the government on Friday revealed a sense of rising anxiety as scientists saw the number of cases grow faster than expected at the start of the outbreak, with the experts recommending on 13 March that household isolation and the protection of older and more vulnerable people should happen \u201csoon\u201d. Three days later, the advice changed: the committee heard there could be 10,000 new cases a day, prompting them to recommend further physical distancing \u201cas soon as possible\u201d adding that a \u201csignificant increase in testing\u201d was needed. Sage also considered documents on the track-and-trace system, with one report from behavioural scientists saying they anticipated \u201cmajor behavioural barriers\u201d to people using the NHS contact-tracing app, which would prevent it from being the primary method of containing outbreaks.",

Jason Leitch, the Scottish government\u2019s national clinical director, said it depended on \u201ca fair wind and the virus behaving itself, and of course the population behaving itself\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/30/premier-league-clubs-told-depleted-squads-will-not-delay-restart\">Premier League clubs told depleted squads will not delay restart</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Frankie Dettori was among the first to welcome the government\u2019s announcement. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic news,\u201d said the veteran jockey, who believes his sport is now well placed to hog the limelight for a short time. \u201cWe\u2019ve got two weeks\u2019 start on football, the whole country\u2019s starved of sport and racing in this country is of the highest quality. People will be able to enjoy our sport on the box and I have no doubt we can put on a good show for everyone.\u201d</p> \n<p>Monday\u2019s resumption of racing at Newcastle was so over-subscribed that 198 entrants had to be turned away. Dettori will make his own return to action at Kempton the next day but is already looking forward to Friday at Newmarket, when he will ride Stradivarius in the Coronation Cup, taking on last year\u2019s Derby winner, Anthony Van Dyck. It is one of 21 races due to be screened by ITV next weekend.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like, wow,\u201d said Dettori, relishing the imminence of such quality racing. \u201cGreat horses are ready to go. If everything goes smooth, we\u2019ll be able to catch up on the Classics and by the end of July the programme of horse racing will be back to normal.\u201d</p> \n<p>The lobbying methods and public pronouncements of racing\u2019s ruling body, the British Horseracing Authority, have been criticised, but Dettori was happy to give them credit. \u201cWe put a great proposal to the government. The BHA and the horsemen have worked tirelessly. We\u2019re going to be taking precautions on top of precautions.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been riding out with a mask on, to get used to it. I\u2019ve been talking to my French colleagues, they told me it\u2019s a little bit of a hindrance, it\u2019s stopping your air-flow, but I\u2019m getting my body used to it and I have no problem at all.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked if the news was a relief, Dettori said: \u201cI think more for my wife and kids, they\u2019ll be happy to see the back of me, to be honest. We are arguing about stupid things at the moment, who did not empty the dishwasher, who took the last ice cream. I\u2019m getting the sign that it\u2019s about time for me to leave the house and go to work.\u201d</p>",

A third of the Premier League\u2019s remaining 92 games will be broadcast free to air, which Dowden said followed his own intervention. \u201cThis is an open invitation for all fans to be part of this significant moment in our sporting history,\u201d he said, adding that it would also encourage fans to stay at home to watch. He included encouraging words for women\u2019s sport, saying he would try to identify ways to recover the momentum lost along with some major events. \u201cVisibility matters and our daughters deserve to see female athletes on the main stage.\u201d Richard Masters, chief executive of the Premier League, welcomed the news but described the 17 June restart as provisional. \u201cThere is still much work to be done to ensure the safety of everyone involved,\u201d he said. \u201cThis includes consulting with our clubs, players and managers - along with all our other stakeholders - as the health and welfare of our participants and supporters is our priority.\u201d Dowden\u2019s news does not apply to Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland and there was a warning that Scottish football might struggle to meet the 1 August date set for its own return. Jason Leitch, the Scottish government\u2019s national clinical director, said it depended on \u201ca fair wind and the virus behaving itself, and of course the population behaving itself\u201d. Frankie Dettori was among the first to welcome the government\u2019s announcement. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic news,\u201d said the veteran jockey, who believes his sport is now well placed to hog the limelight for a short time. \u201cWe\u2019ve got two weeks\u2019 start on football, the whole country\u2019s starved of sport and racing in this country is of the highest quality. People will be able to enjoy our sport on the box and I have no doubt we can put on a good show for everyone.\u201d Monday\u2019s resumption of racing at Newcastle was so over-subscribed that 198 entrants had to be turned away. Dettori will make his own return to action at Kempton the next day but is already looking forward to Friday at Newmarket, when he will ride Stradivarius in the Coronation Cup, taking on last year\u2019s Derby winner, Anthony Van Dyck. It is one of 21 races due to be screened by ITV next weekend. \u201cIt\u2019s like, wow,\u201d said Dettori, relishing the imminence of such quality racing. \u201cGreat horses are ready to go. If everything goes smooth, we\u2019ll be able to catch up on the Classics and by the end of July the programme of horse racing will be back to normal.\u201d The lobbying methods and public pronouncements of racing\u2019s ruling body, the British Horseracing Authority, have been criticised, but Dettori was happy to give them credit. \u201cWe put a great proposal to the government. The BHA and the horsemen have worked tirelessly. We\u2019re going to be taking precautions on top of precautions. \u201cI\u2019ve been riding out with a mask on, to get used to it. I\u2019ve been talking to my French colleagues, they told me it\u2019s a little bit of a hindrance, it\u2019s stopping your air-flow, but I\u2019m getting my body used to it and I have no problem at all.\u201d Asked if the news was a relief, Dettori said: \u201cI think more for my wife and kids, they\u2019ll be happy to see the back of me, to be honest. We are arguing about stupid things at the moment, who did not empty the dishwasher, who took the last ice cream. I\u2019m getting the sign that it\u2019s about time for me to leave the house and go to work.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Pubs, clubs, hotels and restaurants are facing an uncertain future. Social distancing requirements mean there is little chance of returning to anything like normal trade and profits. They now face <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/29/rishi-sunak-confirms-coronavirus-furlough-scheme-to-be-gradually-withdrawn\">having to pay towards the government\u2019s furlough scheme</a> when some will not even be able to open their doors. We spoke to enterprises ranging from a Glasgow nightclub to an upmarket London restaurant chain to ask how \u2013 or if \u2013 they can get back to work.</p> <h2>Mike Grieve <br>Owner, Sub Club, Glasgow</h2> <p>\u201cI\u2019m right in the eye of the storm at the moment,\u201d says Grieve. His club has been at the forefront of Scotland\u2019s electronic dance scene since the 80s, but is battling for survival after being denied access to the furlough scheme on a&nbsp;technicality.</p> <p>The club, which has been shut since mid-March and has little prospect of reopening for months to come, has paid out thousands in wages to its 33 staff but may not be able to claim that back.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really hard at the moment, we are really on our knees,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Rent payments are on hold and the club has got a business rates holiday under the government-backed scheme, but other government initiatives have proved inaccessible, as Grieve has found it difficult navigating their&nbsp;complexities.</p> <p>Getting back to business is even more uncertain. The club can hold just over 400 people and Grieve says it needs to operate at near capacity to pay the bills: \u201cWe operate on fairly tight margins.\u201d</p> <p>Under physical distancing rules, which require 2 metres between dancers, Grieve reckons he could fit 100 people in the venue \u2013 and there would be questions about how they would be able to get in to the basement premises, queue up, or be served at the bar.</p> <p>He reckons businesses like his would have no chance of contributing to the furlough scheme: \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any possibility of paying 20% of people\u2019s salaries when we literally have no income. They will have to make exceptions for businesses that are unable to trade.\u201d</p> <p>He is confident Glasgow\u2019s dance music fans will continue to support the venue whatever happens, but doesn\u2019t expect to reopen until the need for physical distancing ends.</p> <p>\u201cWe couldn\u2019t survive even if we opened 10 nights a week. A hundred people would never cover the additional staff costs or spend on personal protective equipment. In my view we can\u2019t reopen until we can operate at full capacity.</p> <p>\u201cThe very nature of what we do is about people being up close and personal. It\u2019s about shared emotion and euphoria \u2013 that\u2019s the nature of the electronic music scene.\u201d</p> <h2>Martin Williams <br>Chief executive, Gaucho and M restaurant chains</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15e162d13350c79de7e82227bc5242449ef5d116\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15e162d13350c79de7e82227bc5242449ef5d116/0_9_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martin Williams outside an M restaurant\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martin Williams: \u2018If the government fails to allow all restaurants to open by August, up to a million workers may lose their jobs\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vianney Le Caer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gaucho and M restaurants furloughed 850 of its 880 staff when the group closed its 16 outlets in March and since then has only been operating an online wine store.</p> <p>Williams has been working on plans for reopening \u2013 if allowed \u2013 in July. He says doing so with two-metre distancing will be tough. Capacity in the restaurants will plummet, bars will remain closed and it\u2019s not clear how much demand there will be. He says: \u201cPeople have got so used to antisocial ways of working and living they\u2019re going to take a bit of time to get back to \u2018new normal\u2019 habits.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Williams believes he\u2019ll see less competition when he does reopen because many restaurants are likely to collapse when rents are due at the end of June. \u201cAny problems a restaurant or brand had will be amplified,\u201d he says. \u201cIt will be extreme.\u201d</p> <p>He reckons most restaurants did not pay quarterly rents due in March and could face a cash crunch next month. \u201cThere could be a lot of winding-up orders without government help,\u201d he says.</p> <p>In some areas \u2013 such as Canary Wharf, where offices could remain nearly empty for months as staff work from home \u2013 he says there will be no point opening until autumn.</p> <p>He also believes the furlough tapering could cost many jobs: \u201cIf the government is easing support, it needs to move much more quickly at easing restrictions and allow businesses to come back to profitability by opening, in a safe manner, as soon as possible.</p> <p>\u201cIt is crucial that safe, sociable, mindful dining is permitted. If the government fails to allow all restaurants to open by August [when the taper starts] up to a million hospitality workers may lose their jobs.\u201d</p> <p>Where it does reopen, Gaucho and M will add measures including foot-powered hand sanitisers at the door, and temperature checks and face masks for staff, who will change into uniforms only once they arrive. Leather-bound menus will be replaced by disposable ones and salt and pepper shakers by sachets on request.</p> <p>Williams has also contacted landlords and councils about extending terraces and moving tables into parks or squares. \u201cLandlords and councils have a responsibility to support business if they can. They can all play a part in relaxing rules on licensing and opening hours.\u201d</p> <h2>Des Gunewardena <br>Restaurateur, D&amp;D London</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83d75b9e1e3cbd35e0baacbe2f99684f498696a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83d75b9e1e3cbd35e0baacbe2f99684f498696a7/0_139_8171_4902/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Des Gunewardena seated in a venue\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Des Gunewardena: \u2018It will be hard enough to make a profit paying staff who are working without forking out for those still on furlough.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Alexander/PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After two months with the shutters down, Gunewardena says his number one task is to get as many of his 2,000 staff \u2013 currently on furlough \u2013 back to work as possible.</p> <p>That will be tough, as his high-end restaurant group is predicting that capacity could drop by more than 60% and turnover could be halved thanks to physical distancing and potentially slower trade. And Gunewardena admits even that may be \u201cbeing too optimistic\u201d if diners are too afraid to go out or if London stays quiet because of reduced public transport capacity.</p> <p>The group expects a maximum of two-thirds of its UK venues to re\u00adopen in July, depending on demand and distancing regulations. Those in New York and Paris are unlikely to open until the autumn. If the government continues to insist on two-metre distancing between diners, Gunewardena says D&amp;D will open fewer restaurants, as some would not be able to turn a profit.&nbsp;</p> <p>He says the changes to the furlough scheme, which mean businesses must make a contribution to employments costs from August, could make it even harder to get back to business. \u201cIt will be hard enough to make a profit paying staff who are working without forking out for those still on furlough. This is really challenging for us,\u201d he says.</p> <p>But Gunewardena is also bubbling with plans about how to get back to business. \u201cA lot of people are whingeing and not many are coming up with great ideas,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The group is preparing to test home delivery from a number of London restaurants, including meal kits to be cooked at home. Some outlets are set to open for take<em>\u00ad</em>away only. Once restaurants can fully reopen, they may try to counteract reduced capacity by opening for longer hours, and reduce waste by asking people to pre-book their menu. He says the booking of tables will have to be done more strictly \u2013 possibly with times to leave by as well as times to arrive.</p> <p>D&amp;D is determined to find \u00adcreative ways to implement social distancing. Plans drawn up for the group\u2019s 14 Hills restaurant in Fenchurch Street include classy dividing screens that imitate vintage glass houses, wicker fences or futuristic visors. Banquettes, beaded curtains and indoor trees are used to create the feeling of privacy while separating guests.</p> <p>Gunewardena is talking to landlords about extending al fresco dining and planning to use \u201cdining pods\u201d \u2013 already used for outdoor entertaining in winter \u2013 for socially distanced meals.</p> <p>He has even been talking to \u00adfashion designers about making high-end protective masks to help staff feel stylish as well as protected while on duty.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly important that people feel good,\u201d he says.</p> <h2>John Crooks <br>Hotelier, Derbyshire</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e55e280b0eb8e63eb820ade0540ba18c0b565b45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e55e280b0eb8e63eb820ade0540ba18c0b565b45/0_624_2058_1234/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Crooks with, from left, daughter Gabrielle Saint, wife Gail Crooks and daughter Victoria Crooks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Crooks (with, from left, daughter Gabrielle Saint, wife Gail Crooks and daughter Victoria Crooks): \u2018Somewhere along the line he has to let us open up.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claire Meldrum/HANDOUT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 36 years of running the Boars Head hotel in the Derbyshire village of Draycott-in-the-Clay, John Crooks had not once closed the doors for a night, even over Christmas. Then the pandemic hit.</p> <p>Crooks, 74, saw the revenue from guest rooms, restaurants and bars at the Boars Head and the two other hotels in the county that he runs with his wife Gail and his five children, plummet from up to \u00a390,000 a week to zero.</p> <p>\u201cIt went from nicely steady and looking forward to the summer, to cancellation, cancellation, cancellation,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the Boars Head, the customers are very longstanding. They come every week and, in all honesty, are getting quite old, like me. They got frightened.\u201d</p> <p>The Crooks family has continued working during lockdown, but has furloughed almost all of the 147 staff at the Boars Head, the Lion Hotel in Belper, and Littleover Lodge in Littleover, near Derby.&nbsp;</p> <p>He says the scheme has been \u201cwonderful and very helpful\u201d, but welcomed the chancellor\u2019s announcement last Friday of changes to the furlough scheme, agreeing that the government \u201ccan\u2019t go on forever paying this\u201d.</p> <p>But tapering needs to be accompanied by an opening-up, he says. He hopes his businesses will have been able to reopen by the time he has to contribute more: employers are expected to start contributing from August. \u201cSomewhere along the line he has to let us open up and hopefully we will get a chance to get a bit of trade back in.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, costs are mounting. Despite taking in no money during the lockdown, Crooks says he has still had to find up to \u00a320,000 a week to cover overheads such as electricity and gas.</p> <p>Crooks had a \u00a3200,000 loan from Lloyds Bank <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/19/coronavirus-loans-large-firms-dividends\">under the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS)</a>, which he hopes will last him until September \u201cor we\u2019ll have to do something drastic, not sure what\u201d. He doesn\u2019t rule out putting one of the hotels up for sale.</p> <p>The family hope to reopen their 60 rooms in three hotels and their respective 100-seater restaurants simultaneously, but social distancing measures mean they will only be able to serve a third of the customers they have capacity for, which isn\u2019t enough to break even.</p> <p>\u201cI will have to look at it carefully,\u201d says Crooks. \u201cIt\u2019s a big unknown, how many will come through the door.\u201d</p> <h2>End of the furlough</h2> <p><strong>1.</strong> Until August, the government will pay 80% of wages up to a cap of \u00a32,500, plus employer national insurance (ER NICs) and pension contributions. Employers are not required to pay anything. The scheme closes to new entrants on 30 June. After that, employers can bring furloughed staff back part-time, paying for hours worked.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> In August, the government will still pay 80% of wages up to \u00a32,500, but employers will have to pay ER NICs and pension contributions.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>3</strong>. In September, employers will have to pay 10% of wages plus ER NICs and pension contributions. The government will pay 70% of wages up to a cap of \u00a32,190.</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> From October, the government will pay 60% of wages up to a cap of \u00a31,875. Employers must pay 20%, plus ER NICs and pension contributions, or about 23% of pre-furlough employment costs.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Pubs, clubs, hotels and restaurants are facing an uncertain future. Social distancing requirements mean there is little chance of returning to anything like normal trade and profits. They now face having to pay towards the government\u2019s furlough scheme when some will not even be able to open their doors. We spoke to enterprises ranging from a Glasgow nightclub to an upmarket London restaurant chain to ask how \u2013 or if \u2013 they can get back to work. Mike Grieve Owner, Sub Club, Glasgow \u201cI\u2019m right in the eye of the storm at the moment,\u201d says Grieve. His club has been at the forefront of Scotland\u2019s electronic dance scene since the 80s, but is battling for survival after being denied access to the furlough scheme on a technicality. The club, which has been shut since mid-March and has little prospect of reopening for months to come, has paid out thousands in wages to its 33 staff but may not be able to claim that back. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard at the moment, we are really on our knees,\u201d he says. Rent payments are on hold and the club has got a business rates holiday under the government-backed scheme, but other government initiatives have proved inaccessible, as Grieve has found it difficult navigating their complexities. Getting back to business is even more uncertain. The club can hold just over 400 people and Grieve says it needs to operate at near capacity to pay the bills: \u201cWe operate on fairly tight margins.\u201d Under physical distancing rules, which require 2 metres between dancers, Grieve reckons he could fit 100 people in the venue \u2013 and there would be questions about how they would be able to get in to the basement premises, queue up, or be served at the bar. He reckons businesses like his would have no chance of contributing to the furlough scheme: \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any possibility of paying 20% of people\u2019s salaries when we literally have no income. They will have to make exceptions for businesses that are unable to trade.\u201d He is confident Glasgow\u2019s dance music fans will continue to support the venue whatever happens, but doesn\u2019t expect to reopen until the need for physical distancing ends. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t survive even if we opened 10 nights a week. A hundred people would never cover the additional staff costs or spend on personal protective equipment. In my view we can\u2019t reopen until we can operate at full capacity. \u201cThe very nature of what we do is about people being up close and personal. It\u2019s about shared emotion and euphoria \u2013 that\u2019s the nature of the electronic music scene.\u201d Martin Williams Chief executive, Gaucho and M restaurant chains Gaucho and M restaurants furloughed 850 of its 880 staff when the group closed its 16 outlets in March and since then has only been operating an online wine store. Williams has been working on plans for reopening \u2013 if allowed \u2013 in July. He says doing so with two-metre distancing will be tough. Capacity in the restaurants will plummet, bars will remain closed and it\u2019s not clear how much demand there will be. He says: \u201cPeople have got so used to antisocial ways of working and living they\u2019re going to take a bit of time to get back to \u2018new normal\u2019 habits.\u201d Williams believes he\u2019ll see less competition when he does reopen because many restaurants are likely to collapse when rents are due at the end of June. \u201cAny problems a restaurant or brand had will be amplified,\u201d he says. \u201cIt will be extreme.\u201d He reckons most restaurants did not pay quarterly rents due in March and could face a cash crunch next month. \u201cThere could be a lot of winding-up orders without government help,\u201d he says. In some areas \u2013 such as Canary Wharf, where offices could remain nearly empty for months as staff work from home \u2013 he says there will be no point opening until autumn. He also believes the furlough tapering could cost many jobs: \u201cIf the government is easing support, it needs to move much more quickly at easing restrictions and allow businesses to come back to profitability by opening, in a safe manner, as soon as possible. \u201cIt is crucial that safe, sociable, mindful dining is permitted. If the government fails to allow all restaurants to open by August [when the taper starts] up to a million hospitality workers may lose their jobs.\u201d Where it does reopen, Gaucho and M will add measures including foot-powered hand sanitisers at the door, and temperature checks and face masks for staff, who will change into uniforms only once they arrive. Leather-bound menus will be replaced by disposable ones and salt and pepper shakers by sachets on request. Williams has also contacted landlords and councils about extending terraces and moving tables into parks or squares. \u201cLandlords and councils have a responsibility to support business if they can. They can all play a part in relaxing rules on licensing and opening hours.\u201d Des Gunewardena Restaurateur, D&amp;D London After two months with the shutters down, Gunewardena says his number one task is to get as many of his 2,000 staff \u2013 currently on furlough \u2013 back to work as possible. That will be tough, as his high-end restaurant group is predicting that capacity could drop by more than 60% and turnover could be halved thanks to physical distancing and potentially slower trade. And Gunewardena admits even that may be \u201cbeing too optimistic\u201d if diners are too afraid to go out or if London stays quiet because of reduced public transport capacity. The group expects a maximum of two-thirds of its UK venues to reopen in July, depending on demand and distancing regulations. Those in New York and Paris are unlikely to open until the autumn. If the government continues to insist on two-metre distancing between diners, Gunewardena says D&amp;D will open fewer restaurants, as some would not be able to turn a profit. He says the changes to the furlough scheme, which mean businesses must make a contribution to employments costs from August, could make it even harder to get back to business. \u201cIt will be hard enough to make a profit paying staff who are working without forking out for those still on furlough. This is really challenging for us,\u201d he says. But Gunewardena is also bubbling with plans about how to get back to business. \u201cA lot of people are whingeing and not many are coming up with great ideas,\u201d he says. The group is preparing to test home delivery from a number of London restaurants, including meal kits to be cooked at home. Some outlets are set to open for takeaway only. Once restaurants can fully reopen, they may try to counteract reduced capacity by opening for longer hours, and reduce waste by asking people to pre-book their menu. He says the booking of tables will have to be done more strictly \u2013 possibly with times to leave by as well as times to arrive. D&amp;D is determined to find creative ways to implement social distancing. Plans drawn up for the group\u2019s 14 Hills restaurant in Fenchurch Street include classy dividing screens that imitate vintage glass houses, wicker fences or futuristic visors. Banquettes, beaded curtains and indoor trees are used to create the feeling of privacy while separating guests. Gunewardena is talking to landlords about extending al fresco dining and planning to use \u201cdining pods\u201d \u2013 already used for outdoor entertaining in winter \u2013 for socially distanced meals. He has even been talking to fashion designers about making high-end protective masks to help staff feel stylish as well as protected while on duty. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly important that people feel good,\u201d he says. John Crooks Hotelier, Derbyshire In 36 years of running the Boars Head hotel in the Derbyshire village of Draycott-in-the-Clay, John Crooks had not once closed the doors for a night, even over Christmas. Then the pandemic hit. Crooks, 74, saw the revenue from guest rooms, restaurants and bars at the Boars Head and the two other hotels in the county that he runs with his wife Gail and his five children, plummet from up to \u00a390,000 a week to zero. \u201cIt went from nicely steady and looking forward to the summer, to cancellation, cancellation, cancellation,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the Boars Head, the customers are very longstanding. They come every week and, in all honesty, are getting quite old, like me. They got frightened.\u201d The Crooks family has continued working during lockdown, but has furloughed almost all of the 147 staff at the Boars Head, the Lion Hotel in Belper, and Littleover Lodge in Littleover, near Derby. He says the scheme has been \u201cwonderful and very helpful\u201d, but welcomed the chancellor\u2019s announcement last Friday of changes to the furlough scheme, agreeing that the government \u201ccan\u2019t go on forever paying this\u201d. But tapering needs to be accompanied by an opening-up, he says. He hopes his businesses will have been able to reopen by the time he has to contribute more: employers are expected to start contributing from August. \u201cSomewhere along the line he has to let us open up and hopefully we will get a chance to get a bit of trade back in.\u201d Meanwhile, costs are mounting. Despite taking in no money during the lockdown, Crooks says he has still had to find up to \u00a320,000 a week to cover overheads such as electricity and gas. Crooks had a \u00a3200,000 loan from Lloyds Bank under the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS), which he hopes will last him until September \u201cor we\u2019ll have to do something drastic, not sure what\u201d. He doesn\u2019t rule out putting one of the hotels up for sale. The family hope to reopen their 60 rooms in three hotels and their respective 100-seater restaurants simultaneously, but social distancing measures mean they will only be able to serve a third of the customers they have capacity for, which isn\u2019t enough to break even. \u201cI will have to look at it carefully,\u201d says Crooks. \u201cIt\u2019s a big unknown, how many will come through the door.\u201d End of the furlough 1. Until August, the government will pay 80% of wages up to a cap of \u00a32,500, plus employer national insurance (ER NICs) and pension contributions. Employers are not required to pay anything. The scheme closes to new entrants on 30 June. After that, employers can bring furloughed staff back part-time, paying for hours worked. 2. In August, the government will still pay 80% of wages up to \u00a32,500, but employers will have to pay ER NICs and pension contributions. 3. In September, employers will have to pay 10% of wages plus ER NICs and pension contributions. The government will pay 70% of wages up to a cap of \u00a32,190. 4. From October, the government will pay 60% of wages up to a cap of \u00a31,875. Employers must pay 20%, plus ER NICs and pension contributions, or about 23% of pre-furlough employment costs.",

      "body": "<p>In addition to washing your hands while singing the first two verses of The Internationale, it might be a good time also to clean out your Twitter feed. According to a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/05/20/859814085/researchers-nearly-half-of-accounts-tweeting-about-coronavirus-are-likely-bots?t=1590582560153\">recent report</a> of a research study by Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/\">Center for Computational Analysis of Social and Organizational Systems</a>, about 45% of the false narratives about Covid-19 on Twitter are sent by bots.</p> <p>The study examined more than 100 false Covid narratives (including the 5G conspiracy theories) pushed in over 200m tweets since January. If you\u2019re a reader of this newspaper, the likelihood is that you never saw any of these. But that\u2019s because you are \u2013 like me \u2013 cheerfully encased in your own filter bubble. I write with feeling on this matter, because on the morning after the Brexit referendum I went through the list of about 800 people whom I follow on Twitter, and I could not locate a single one who seemed to have been in favour of Brexit in the run-up to the vote. The shock felt by them after the vote was palpable. But it was also a salutary reminder that anyone who uses social media lives in a digital echo chamber.</p> <p>To those who study computational propaganda, the findings will come as no surprise. Philip Howard\u2019s group at the <a href=\"https://comprop.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/working-papers/bots-strongerin-and-brexit-computational-propaganda-during-the-uk-eu-referendum/\">Oxford Internet Institute</a> has been doing great work in this field for several years. It would be nice to think that the mainstream media might have learned a thing or two from this work. If it had, it might have learned that just as you cannot believe anything you read in a British tabloid newspaper, you should never regard what\u2019s \u201ctrending\u201d on Twitter as anything other than an artefact of robotic amplification.</p> <p>But bots are not the only problem facing Twitter. An equally difficult challenge is that presented by Donald J Trump, currently the president of the US. Twitter was a medium made for Trump, and he has exploited it masterfully ever since he contemplated running for public office. Although his campaign adroitly exploited targeted advertising on Facebook, Twitter was always how Trump directly communicated with his base. He currently has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump\">80.3 million followers</a> and has tweeted over 52,000 times. And while nobody was surprised that he campaigned using Twitter, nobody in the liberal (or even the conservative) establishment dreamed that, once elected, he would <em>govern</em> by tweet. Which is why the ingenious <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RealPressSecBot\">@RealPressSecBot</a> bot that transforms Trump tweets into the proper presidential White House statement format is both such a good joke, and so depressing.</p> <p>The fact that Twitter has allowed Trump to abuse the service by spreading lies, libels, conspiracy theories, nonsense and racist abuse continuously since he was elected has infuriated many people. Anyone else doing that kind of stuff would long ago have been banned from the platform. But to date, the company\u2019s executives have shrunk from doing anything about the tweeter-in-chief. They have two reasons for their forbearance, one good and one bad. The good reason is fear for their lives. There are <a href=\"http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/de/weapons-and-markets/tools/global-firearms-holdings.html\">an estimated 392m </a><a href=\"http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/de/weapons-and-markets/tools/global-firearms-holdings.html\">unregistered firearms</a> in the US, and my hunch is that banning Trump would eventually result in a <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/charlie-hebdo\">Charlie</a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/charlie-hebdo\"> Hebdo</a></em>-type attack on the company by alt-right fanatics. The bad reason is that Trump is good for \u201cuser engagement\u201d, which is the holy grail of all social media platforms.</p> <p>This week, though, they took a baby step towards trying to rein him in. After <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1265255835124539392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1265255845358645254%7Ctwgr%5E&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2020%2Fmay%2F26%2Ftrump-twitter-fact-check-warning-label\">he tweeted</a>: \u201cThere is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent. Mail boxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged &amp; even illegally printed out &amp; fraudulently signed.

      "bodyText": "In addition to washing your hands while singing the first two verses of The Internationale, it might be a good time also to clean out your Twitter feed. According to a recent report of a research study by Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Center for Computational Analysis of Social and Organizational Systems, about 45% of the false narratives about Covid-19 on Twitter are sent by bots. The study examined more than 100 false Covid narratives (including the 5G conspiracy theories) pushed in over 200m tweets since January. If you\u2019re a reader of this newspaper, the likelihood is that you never saw any of these. But that\u2019s because you are \u2013 like me \u2013 cheerfully encased in your own filter bubble. I write with feeling on this matter, because on the morning after the Brexit referendum I went through the list of about 800 people whom I follow on Twitter, and I could not locate a single one who seemed to have been in favour of Brexit in the run-up to the vote. The shock felt by them after the vote was palpable. But it was also a salutary reminder that anyone who uses social media lives in a digital echo chamber. To those who study computational propaganda, the findings will come as no surprise. Philip Howard\u2019s group at the Oxford Internet Institute has been doing great work in this field for several years. It would be nice to think that the mainstream media might have learned a thing or two from this work. If it had, it might have learned that just as you cannot believe anything you read in a British tabloid newspaper, you should never regard what\u2019s \u201ctrending\u201d on Twitter as anything other than an artefact of robotic amplification. But bots are not the only problem facing Twitter. An equally difficult challenge is that presented by Donald J Trump, currently the president of the US. Twitter was a medium made for Trump, and he has exploited it masterfully ever since he contemplated running for public office. Although his campaign adroitly exploited targeted advertising on Facebook, Twitter was always how Trump directly communicated with his base. He currently has 80.3 million followers and has tweeted over 52,000 times. And while nobody was surprised that he campaigned using Twitter, nobody in the liberal (or even the conservative) establishment dreamed that, once elected, he would govern by tweet. Which is why the ingenious @RealPressSecBot bot that transforms Trump tweets into the proper presidential White House statement format is both such a good joke, and so depressing. The fact that Twitter has allowed Trump to abuse the service by spreading lies, libels, conspiracy theories, nonsense and racist abuse continuously since he was elected has infuriated many people. Anyone else doing that kind of stuff would long ago have been banned from the platform. But to date, the company\u2019s executives have shrunk from doing anything about the tweeter-in-chief. They have two reasons for their forbearance, one good and one bad. The good reason is fear for their lives. There are an estimated 392m unregistered firearms in the US, and my hunch is that banning Trump would eventually result in a Charlie Hebdo-type attack on the company by alt-right fanatics. The bad reason is that Trump is good for \u201cuser engagement\u201d, which is the holy grail of all social media platforms. This week, though, they took a baby step towards trying to rein him in. After he tweeted: \u201cThere is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent. Mail boxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged &amp; even illegally printed out &amp; fraudulently signed. The Governor of California is sending Ballots to millions of people, anyone.....\u201d a label in blue lettering appeared underneath it urging people to \u201cget the facts\u201d about voting by mail. The links led to a CNN story that said Trump\u2019s claims were unsubstantiated and to a list of bullet points that Twitter had compiled rebutting the inaccuracies. In any normally run polity, this would have been an unremarkable step for a platform to take. In the crazily polarised society that the US has become, though, it will be seen by Trump and his fans as an affront to his Supreme Leadership. Not quite on the Charlie Hebdo scale of publishing cartoons of the Prophet, perhaps, but an affront nonetheless. At best, legions of bots will now be enlisted to pump abuse at the Twitter bosses and pump more misinformation about postal voting to ordinary users of the platform. More dangerous \u2013 not only to Twitter but to the business models of all social-media companies \u2013 would be a move by a vengeful Trump to use the nuclear option\u2019 of removing the shelter provided by Section 230 of the 1996 Telecommunications Act which frees online platforms from legal liability for what users post on their platforms. Ironically, though, if Trump did deploy that weapon, then the rest of us would be free to sue Twitter for what the president tweets! What I\u2019ve been reading Bringing it all back home \u201cHow to fix globalisation \u2013 for Detroit, not Davos\u201d is a really fascinating interview on the American Interest site with Lawrence Summers, a former US treasury secretary.

      "bodyText": "Thousands of people ignored a curfew in Minneapolis to protest for a fourth night in a row, as anger around police brutality and the death of George Floyd erupted into violence across the US, from New York to California. Although multiple demonstrations started peacefully many turned volatile overnight, with crowds in Minneapolis overwhelming law enforcement, taking over a police station and smashing and burning shops. In Atlanta, people set a police car ablaze and broke windows at CNN\u2019s headquarters, an attack that prompted Georgia\u2019s governor to declare a state of emergency. An unidentified assailant in Detroit fired shots from an SUV into a crowd of demonstrators, killing a 19-year-old man. The shooting came hours after Donald Trump was criticised for inciting violence against protesters when he threatened people he called \u201cthugs\u201d on Twitter: \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d Derek Chauvin, the Minneapolis police officer captured on video kneeling on Floyd for nine minutes, was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. But three other officers involved in the arrest had not yet been charged, and the announcement did little to end what has descended into regular nightly clashes. In the capital, the White House was put under lockdown as demonstrators tussled with the Secret Service into the early hours. Protesters threw bricks and bottles but failed to get over the barricades. Police dispersed the crowds with pepper spray. On Saturday morning, in a series of intimidating tweets, the president lauded the Secret Service, saying they \u201cwould quickly come down on [the protesters], hard \u2013 didn\u2019t know what hit them\u201d. \u201cBig crowd, professionally organized, but nobody came close to breaching the fence. If they had they would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019s when people would have been really badly hurt, at least.\u201d Secret Service agents, he warned, were \u201cjust waiting for action\u201d. He also appeared to call for a counter-demonstration by his supporters on Saturday night. In Oakland, San Jose and Los Angeles, protesters blocked highways and police fired teargas. In Louisville, Kentucky, police fired projectiles at a reporter and her cameraman during a live shot. Authorities later apologised. The mayor of Portland, in Oregon, imposed a curfew on Saturday morning and declared a state of emergency after what he described as a \u201criot\u201d overnight. Ted Wheeler said citizens must stay home between 8pm and 6am, starting immediately. \u201cThis isn\u2019t calling for meaningful change in our communities, this is disgusting,\u201d he tweeted. Amid reports that the Pentagon ordered the army to put military police units on alert to head to Minneapolis, the focus of the current wave of protests, the Minnesota governor said authorities had been overwhelmed. Many protesting in Minneapolis have done so without violence, chanting and holding signs denouncing the police. But other groups broke away overnight to burn down a bank and attack other buildings. Governor Tim Walz had earlier pledged to restore calm after Thursday when officers abandoned the area around the third police precinct to thousands of angry demonstrators who set fire to the building. But on Friday, thousands gathered there again and retook control of the gutted police station, despite waves of teargas. \u201cQuite candidly, right now, we do not have the numbers,\u201d Walz told a late-night news conference. \u201cWe cannot arrest people when we\u2019re trying to hold ground because of the sheer size, the dynamics and the wanton violence that\u2019s coming out there.\u201d In a different part of the city, officers had been deployed to defend another police station. \u201cWe will not have another repeat of what happened at the third precinct,\u201d said the city police chief, Medaria Arradondo. On Saturday morning, Walz announced the largest national guard deployment in state history, saying the violence was \u201cno longer, in any way, about the murder of George Floyd\u201d and suggesting \u201cdomestic terrorists\u201d were involved. Protests have raged in the wake of Floyd\u2019s death, with people calling for an end to police violence and justice for black Americans.

      "body": "<p><strong>The Archers</strong> (BBC Radio 4) | <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000jfzc\">BBC Sounds</a></p> <p>Back in late March, lockdown caught many of us on the hop. The changes to work and life were swift and devastating. Some professions could adapt fairly easily, others couldn\u2019t. Drama is an industry that\u2019s suffered greatly; many great theatres have already had to close down for ever. But audio drama has a few advantages. It\u2019s not TV, it\u2019s not a full theatre production. No need for costumes or cameras, to learn lines or adjust lighting. The audience is still there, stuck at home\u2026</p> <p>Which brings me to <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000jfzc\">The Archers</a></strong>. A well-oiled, beautifully run, wonderfully staffed ship that\u2019s not built for turning, let alone pivoting to WFH, <em>The Archers</em> has found the lockdown difficult. Usually, the writing is done weeks in advance, with the storylines worked out even earlier. Each episode is recorded in the studio as live, the cast acting the whole thing without stopping. Sound effects are played in at the same time, with some added later.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>David seemed as worked up about Ruth's lasagne as he did about not getting on with his son</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Because of these pre-recorded episodes, for a long while after lockdown life in Ambridge continued with no reference to coronavirus at all. Lynda Snell and workman Blake were in hospital, post-hotel explosion, with various family, friends and foes popping in and out at will. Social distancing was most definitely not observed. PPE was never mentioned, nary a hint of a hand-sanitiser shortage. But then, in early May, the pre-records ran out, and for the past three weeks, <em>The Archers</em> has been reduced to replaying old episodes. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000j7b2\">The Flower and Produce Show</a>\u201d was one; \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05410wn\">Floods Hit Ambridge</a>\u201d another. During this time, entire storylines were mothballed (bye bye, Kirsty\u2019s marriage to dodgy Philip), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/19/the-archers-episodes-lockdown-ambridge-radio-4-rural-soap-coronavirus\">12</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/19/the-archers-episodes-lockdown-ambridge-radio-4-rural-soap-coronavirus\"> scripts were binned</a>, and the decision was made for actors to record monologues at home.</p> <p>Though I understand the reasoning, I\u2019m not convinced this was the right decision. The new-style episodes began last week, and they were pretty poor fare. The first, which consisted of David\u2019s moaning about his son Josh, intercut with Josh moaning about David, was a shocker. Beautifully recorded (well done, Tim Bentinck and Angus Imrie), the super-clean voices meant that the added farm atmosphere (David got cows, Josh, geese) sounded ridiculous. Far worse, though, was the spectacularly boring writing. No mention of the frustrations of coronavirus, the alterations to farm work, being cooped up with family, new worries or irritations. Just some waffle about silage and lasagne, with some rousing \u201cwe\u2019ll all get through this together\u201d at the end. (David seemed exactly as worked up about Ruth\u2019s lasagne as he did about not getting on with his son. Maybe it\u2019s an <em>Archers</em> stoicism thing.)</p> <p>The second episode had a couple of nods towards how people actually live, with Tracy making a \u201cvlog\u201d, according to son Brad (who uses that word, in 2020?) about what she thinks the cricket team should be doing during lockdown, and Harrison, policeman and actual cricket captain, responding. Both Harrison and Tracy were heard making phone calls. Unfortunately these were as realistic as a toddler holding up a banana to her ear and saying \u201cHewoh\u201d. When people make phone calls, you can hear the other person on the line! There was nothing in the audio to distinguish between them talking to themselves, talking to a selfie camera, or talking to another person on the phone. No background noise of other people in the house. No one Zooming their family. Everything happening somewhere else.</p> <p>I\u2019m sure the shows will improve as all involved get used to the new way, but these episodes were lame, and revealed the lack of flexibility in how <em>The Archers</em> gets made. No real outdoor atmosphere, no actual phone calls, no moving out of a studio. TV has made a couple of successful forays into drama that acknowledge lockdown\u2019s restrictions and make use of them. Why can\u2019t the actors\u2019 parts be recorded&nbsp;as live, simultaneously (like podcasts have been doing during lockdown), so they interact&nbsp;in real&nbsp;time? The tech is there.

      "bodyText": "The Archers (BBC Radio 4) | BBC Sounds Back in late March, lockdown caught many of us on the hop. The changes to work and life were swift and devastating. Some professions could adapt fairly easily, others couldn\u2019t. Drama is an industry that\u2019s suffered greatly; many great theatres have already had to close down for ever. But audio drama has a few advantages. It\u2019s not TV, it\u2019s not a full theatre production. No need for costumes or cameras, to learn lines or adjust lighting. The audience is still there, stuck at home\u2026 Which brings me to The Archers. A well-oiled, beautifully run, wonderfully staffed ship that\u2019s not built for turning, let alone pivoting to WFH, The Archers has found the lockdown difficult. Usually, the writing is done weeks in advance, with the storylines worked out even earlier. Each episode is recorded in the studio as live, the cast acting the whole thing without stopping. Sound effects are played in at the same time, with some added later. Because of these pre-recorded episodes, for a long while after lockdown life in Ambridge continued with no reference to coronavirus at all. Lynda Snell and workman Blake were in hospital, post-hotel explosion, with various family, friends and foes popping in and out at will. Social distancing was most definitely not observed. PPE was never mentioned, nary a hint of a hand-sanitiser shortage. But then, in early May, the pre-records ran out, and for the past three weeks, The Archers has been reduced to replaying old episodes. \u201cThe Flower and Produce Show\u201d was one; \u201cFloods Hit Ambridge\u201d another.

      "body": "<p>A conversation with a girlfriend when I was in Italy a few weeks ago got me thinking about the latest new norm of the post-coronavirus society: enhanced eye contact. She had told me how, standing in the endless queue for the supermarket, wearing her mask, she had caught the eye of a handsome man in another loop of the queue and found herself engaged in a wordless flirtation carried out just with the eyes from a distance. After this, she had taken to piling on extra eyeliner and mascara.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I am saving in not buying lipstick I am spending on those full-volume mascaras,\u201d she said, laughing.</p> <p>Italians are masters of unabashed eye contact, but I wondered how this would work in London \u2013 my other home \u2013 where we do all we can to avoid gazing at each other. I have spent years passing colleagues along corridors, all of us flashing a smile then hastily looking down lest awkwardness should arise. But if the smile is covered by a mask and cannot be seen, it falls to the eyes to communicate that smile and that will mean \u2013 heavens forfend \u2013 that we will have to look up and meet each others\u2019 eyes. How will we cope?</p> <p>Adults are used to reading faces as a whole and if society is suddenly going to be masked up, then we will have to adapt quickly, making more use of prolonged eye contact. And yet this is not natural behaviour. Most animals look at each other only to signal threat or interest. In humans, social interaction is usually punctuated with very brief periods of mutual eye contact and deviations from this make us uncomfortable.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is our new normal. Everyone was wearing a face covering</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A British study found that people look at each other only 30-60% of the time when talking, let alone gazing into each other\u2019s eyes. Surely this will change if we are all wearing masks and there is less on show to offer those all-important non-verbal clues to how we are feeling. After all, 55% of communication is non-verbal, and our facial expressions are a great part of that.</p> <p>I had masks on my mind. Seven weeks into our lockdown in Italy and the province of Tuscany had just made it obligatory for everyone to wear masks and had issued each household with a quota of free ones. They had even made it out to our remote rural home in the foothills of the Apennine mountains: three masks per person. And I was about to wear one for an extended period for the first time, for a trip to Florence thanks to a broken filling.</p> <p>Never has a journey to the dentist been so keenly anticipated. I had not been to the city \u2013 any city \u2013 since 29 February when I had come back home to Italy and self-isolated. As my fortnight of self isolation ended, the whole of Italy was placed in lockdown \u2013 the first European country to take such drastic measures. Any regret I felt for not having visited the hairdresser and the dentist while I could receded in the light of the national tragedy we saw unfolding on our televisions every night. As daily decrees restricted our movements ever more, I became accustomed to not nipping out for a favourite ingredient, to signing off emails with \u201cstay well\u201d, to scraping off the dried soap that clung to my wedding ring.

      "bodyText": "A conversation with a girlfriend when I was in Italy a few weeks ago got me thinking about the latest new norm of the post-coronavirus society: enhanced eye contact. She had told me how, standing in the endless queue for the supermarket, wearing her mask, she had caught the eye of a handsome man in another loop of the queue and found herself engaged in a wordless flirtation carried out just with the eyes from a distance. After this, she had taken to piling on extra eyeliner and mascara. \u201cWhat I am saving in not buying lipstick I am spending on those full-volume mascaras,\u201d she said, laughing. Italians are masters of unabashed eye contact, but I wondered how this would work in London \u2013 my other home \u2013 where we do all we can to avoid gazing at each other. I have spent years passing colleagues along corridors, all of us flashing a smile then hastily looking down lest awkwardness should arise. But if the smile is covered by a mask and cannot be seen, it falls to the eyes to communicate that smile and that will mean \u2013 heavens forfend \u2013 that we will have to look up and meet each others\u2019 eyes. How will we cope? Adults are used to reading faces as a whole and if society is suddenly going to be masked up, then we will have to adapt quickly, making more use of prolonged eye contact. And yet this is not natural behaviour. Most animals look at each other only to signal threat or interest. In humans, social interaction is usually punctuated with very brief periods of mutual eye contact and deviations from this make us uncomfortable. A British study found that people look at each other only 30-60% of the time when talking, let alone gazing into each other\u2019s eyes. Surely this will change if we are all wearing masks and there is less on show to offer those all-important non-verbal clues to how we are feeling. After all, 55% of communication is non-verbal, and our facial expressions are a great part of that. I had masks on my mind. Seven weeks into our lockdown in Italy and the province of Tuscany had just made it obligatory for everyone to wear masks and had issued each household with a quota of free ones. They had even made it out to our remote rural home in the foothills of the Apennine mountains: three masks per person. And I was about to wear one for an extended period for the first time, for a trip to Florence thanks to a broken filling. Never has a journey to the dentist been so keenly anticipated. I had not been to the city \u2013 any city \u2013 since 29 February when I had come back home to Italy and self-isolated. As my fortnight of self isolation ended, the whole of Italy was placed in lockdown \u2013 the first European country to take such drastic measures. Any regret I felt for not having visited the hairdresser and the dentist while I could receded in the light of the national tragedy we saw unfolding on our televisions every night. As daily decrees restricted our movements ever more, I became accustomed to not nipping out for a favourite ingredient, to signing off emails with \u201cstay well\u201d, to scraping off the dried soap that clung to my wedding ring. By the time the filling in my tooth fell out, I had not left home for seven weeks. But my tooth qualified as a medical emergency \u2013 one of only three reasons for which we were allowed out. I made the appointment, my dentist sent an email confirming my appointment, and I bundled this paper together with my self-declaration certificate and passport, packing the car with sanitising gel, several pairs of latex gloves and a spare mask. I donned my mask. We had ordered several from a friend whose factory had switched from stitching clothes for Armani.

      "body": "<p>In exhausting and anxious times, a text message last week brought Emma Parker a welcome moment of light relief. \u201cA colleague sent me an ad for the Barnard Castle Eye Test beer, the one that BrewDog has brought out,\u201d says the Durham-based teacher. \u201cI had a bit of a giggle at that, I have to admit. I tried to buy some, but the demand was so great the website kept crashing.\u201d</p> <p>The now infamous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/28/dominic-cummings-potentially-broke-lockdown-rules-say-durham-police\">60-mile round trip</a> by Dominic Cummings to one of the north-east\u2019s best-known tourist spots has entered political folklore. Cummings\u2019 explanation \u2013 that the visit to Barnard Castle, on which he was accompanied by his wife and child, was undertaken to test his eyesight \u2013 has launched countless internet memes. But as Parker, a district organiser for the National Education Union (NEU), points out, the danger is that people may come to see the joke as having been at their expense, drawing their own conclusions. \u201cI have a 14-year-old son who is autistic,\u201d she says. \u201cHis grandparents are a vital part of his life and routines, but he hasn\u2019t seen them for months. It was my son\u2019s birthday last week, and, for the first time in his life, he wasn\u2019t able to spend it with them. He had to accept the rules of lockdown. But what Cummings did undermined the basis of the discipline we need to keep up. You could see it on the beaches round here on bank holiday weekend, after the story came out. A lot more people were just thinking: \u2018We\u2019re going to get on with living.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The fury over the Cummings affair, and its disastrous timing as the country attempts to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/groups-up-to-six-people-allowed-meet-england-monday-coronavirus-lockdown-easing\">ease lockdown restrictions</a> without triggering a second Covid wave, prompted three local Conservative MPs to voice their concerns in a joint statement. Richard Holden, MP for North West Durham, Paul Howell, MP for Sedgefield and Dehenna Davison, MP for Bishop Auckland wrote: \u201cLike many of our constituents, we have spent the last few days with a feeling of disappointment, anger and frustration. The last thing we want to see is an enormous collective effort being undermined by the irresponsible actions of individuals.\u201d But the reckless travels of Boris Johnson\u2019s maverick adviser, and the fact that the Durham-born Cummings remains in post, are only the latest, most high-profile, grounds for local concern.</p> <p>The north-east currently has the <a href=\"https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/nhs-test-trace-absolutely-critical-18330238\">highest rate</a> of Covid infection in Britain and the transition to a safe, socially distancing new normal will be complicated, fraught and risky. Last week, as he battled to move on from the Cummings episode, Johnson announced in Thursday\u2019s Downing Street press conference that the government\u2019s five tests for easing lockdown were being met. But it is becoming increasingly clear that, in regions such as the north-east, the government\u2019s authority is not what it was at the beginning of the crisis. In the words of Martin Gannon, the leader of Gateshead\u2019s Labour-run council: \u201cUntil now, in just about every single area, everything that has been co-ordinated by the centre has been a complete and unmitigated disaster.\u201d Somewhat under the radar, a low-key regional rebellion has begun to take place on the basis that London doesn\u2019t always know best. For many in a region that was deindustrialised without a proper plan for its future, that has been true for more than 30 years.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Cut to the bone\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Two weeks ago, Gannon joined the leader of Newcastle city council, Nick Forbes, in rejecting Johnson\u2019s decision <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-52667492\">to drop the government\u2019s \u201cStay at home\u201d slogan</a> in favour of the new \u201cStay alert\u201d formulation. \u201cI listened to the prime minister on that Sunday night and then talked with senior colleagues,\u201d he told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cWe decided that, given the higher R rate in the north-east, the time wasn\u2019t right to move to that message. If we had possessed the same legislative powers as Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, then we would have done as they did and stayed with the lockdown as it was.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are disproportionately high levels of deprivation in the north-east, so we have to be ultra-cautious in terms of advice and guidance</p> <footer> <cite>Alice Wiseman, Gateshead director of public health</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>According to Alice Wiseman, Gateshead\u2019s director of public health: \u201cThere are disproportionately high levels of deprivation and poverty here and elsewhere in the north-east. We know that, where that is the case, there will be existing public health problems and we know that the Covid disease targets people with pre-existing conditions. So we have to be ultra-cautious here in terms of advice and guidance.\u201d</p> <p>The willingness to defy government advice in order to, as Gannon puts it, \u201cdo what\u2019s best for Gateshead\u201d, is born of bitter experience. For those on the frontline of local government, particularly in poorer areas, the coronavirus crisis has been a sometimes searing experience that has laid bare the flaws in a dysfunctional relationship with central government. Bluntly, and in common with other local authorities, Gateshead has felt neglected, bypassed and forced to pick up the pieces as things have gone wrong.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cTen years of austerity had already damaged local resilience,\u201d says Gannon. \u201cGateshead has lost 56% of its grant from central government. We\u2019ve made cuts of \u00a3170m. Every part of our budget is cut to the bone now. Over 75% of it goes on care packages. We used to have a big environmental health department. That\u2019s been cut to the bone, too.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>As the epidemic took hold in March, Gannon and his team experienced the consequences of strategic mistakes at a national level. Promises \u2013 particularly in relation to protective equipment \u2013 were not kept. \u201cWe were flagging up the absence of PPE on a daily basis,\u201d says Wiseman. \u201cNo care home in the region had adequate access to the equipment needed to protect their residents. PPE was absolutely critical at that stage and we just didn\u2019t have enough. It\u2019s still a very fragile system now. In the end, we made more plastic masks locally \u2013 working ad hoc, using any 3D printers we could find \u2013 than we got through the national system.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>To the council\u2019s astonishment, a government list of people in Gateshead who would need to be shielded and provided with food contained only 150 names. After consultation with local GPs, the council identified 15,000 locals who would need to be protected; it went deep into debt to get them provisions.</p> <p>There was exasperation when, as belated moves were made in April to boost capacity to test for the virus, Whitehall contracted Deloitte to set up a drive-in test centre in the local Ikea car park. The town\u2019s Queen Elizabeth hospital announced in the same month that it had established one of the biggest testing units in the country, but as the Deloitte centre was flooded with requests, locals reported they had been redirected to Barrow-in-Furness, more than 100 miles away. Swabs from the Ikea centre were sent 240 miles south to Milton Keynes to be analysed; by the time results came back, they were out of date and useless for slowing the spread of infection. \u201cThere just wasn\u2019t a clear, defined purpose behind the testing,\u201d says Wiseman. \u201cIt was just about getting to a high number and wasn\u2019t useful locally. Why not focus resources on the Queen Elizabeth?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f8ef4944ef7b809dc5aa57f342f9527ca16e4c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f8ef4944ef7b809dc5aa57f342f9527ca16e4c6/755_0_4717_2830/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dominic Cummings in London last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dominic Cummings in London last week after answering allegations that he and his family broke lockdown rules.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the most disturbing episodes came as pressure was being exerted on the council and the local foundation trust to discharge untested patients back into the community and into care homes.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cDuring the Easter weekend,\u201d says Gannon, \u201cI was contacted by a member of the council, whose father was in a care home. We had a situation. This was when there was great pressure to vacate beds in NHS hospitals to cope with a coming Covid surge. People were being discharged into care homes without being tested. We were pushed by government to increase the fees to care providers to encourage them to take people. This had led to a stand-off in the car park between the NHS and the home. Some homes were saying, \u2018Yes, we\u2019ll take anyone\u2019; some were saying, \u2018No, we\u2019re not taking anyone, unless they have a certificate that they are Covid-free\u2019. At this particular home, paramedics, family and managers from the home were arguing in the car park about it.\u201d</p> <p>This was happening across the country, Wiseman points out, at a point when \u201chomes were not getting the resources they needed to be able to fully protect residents\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>\u2018We need regional responses\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Scarred by experience, many north-east local authorities will be determinedly going at their own pace this week, as England moves into the next phase of the Covid ordeal. Over the past fortnight, from Hartlepool to Newcastle, the region has become <a href=\"https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/north-east-schools-reopen-when-18278114\">a hub of resistance</a> to the government\u2019s drive to impose a one-size-fits-all approach to reopening primary schools. Parker has organised petitions, held meetings with parents and lobbied her county council, which last week pushed the provisional start date in Durham back <a href=\"https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/durham-county-council-outlines-plan-18317615\">to the middle of next month</a>. In Newcastle and Gateshead, the earliest reopening date will be 8 June. \u201cDifferent parts of the country are at different phases of this epidemic,\u201d says Parker. \u201cThe R rate here seems to be significantly higher and that is weighing on people\u2019s minds a lot.

      "bodyText": "In exhausting and anxious times, a text message last week brought Emma Parker a welcome moment of light relief. \u201cA colleague sent me an ad for the Barnard Castle Eye Test beer, the one that BrewDog has brought out,\u201d says the Durham-based teacher. \u201cI had a bit of a giggle at that, I have to admit. I tried to buy some, but the demand was so great the website kept crashing.\u201d The now infamous 60-mile round trip by Dominic Cummings to one of the north-east\u2019s best-known tourist spots has entered political folklore. Cummings\u2019 explanation \u2013 that the visit to Barnard Castle, on which he was accompanied by his wife and child, was undertaken to test his eyesight \u2013 has launched countless internet memes. But as Parker, a district organiser for the National Education Union (NEU), points out, the danger is that people may come to see the joke as having been at their expense, drawing their own conclusions. \u201cI have a 14-year-old son who is autistic,\u201d she says. \u201cHis grandparents are a vital part of his life and routines, but he hasn\u2019t seen them for months. It was my son\u2019s birthday last week, and, for the first time in his life, he wasn\u2019t able to spend it with them. He had to accept the rules of lockdown. But what Cummings did undermined the basis of the discipline we need to keep up. You could see it on the beaches round here on bank holiday weekend, after the story came out. A lot more people were just thinking: \u2018We\u2019re going to get on with living.\u2019\u201d The fury over the Cummings affair, and its disastrous timing as the country attempts to ease lockdown restrictions without triggering a second Covid wave, prompted three local Conservative MPs to voice their concerns in a joint statement. Richard Holden, MP for North West Durham, Paul Howell, MP for Sedgefield and Dehenna Davison, MP for Bishop Auckland wrote: \u201cLike many of our constituents, we have spent the last few days with a feeling of disappointment, anger and frustration. The last thing we want to see is an enormous collective effort being undermined by the irresponsible actions of individuals.\u201d But the reckless travels of Boris Johnson\u2019s maverick adviser, and the fact that the Durham-born Cummings remains in post, are only the latest, most high-profile, grounds for local concern. The north-east currently has the highest rate of Covid infection in Britain and the transition to a safe, socially distancing new normal will be complicated, fraught and risky. Last week, as he battled to move on from the Cummings episode, Johnson announced in Thursday\u2019s Downing Street press conference that the government\u2019s five tests for easing lockdown were being met. But it is becoming increasingly clear that, in regions such as the north-east, the government\u2019s authority is not what it was at the beginning of the crisis. In the words of Martin Gannon, the leader of Gateshead\u2019s Labour-run council: \u201cUntil now, in just about every single area, everything that has been co-ordinated by the centre has been a complete and unmitigated disaster.\u201d Somewhat under the radar, a low-key regional rebellion has begun to take place on the basis that London doesn\u2019t always know best. For many in a region that was deindustrialised without a proper plan for its future, that has been true for more than 30 years. \u2018Cut to the bone\u2019 Two weeks ago, Gannon joined the leader of Newcastle city council, Nick Forbes, in rejecting Johnson\u2019s decision to drop the government\u2019s \u201cStay at home\u201d slogan in favour of the new \u201cStay alert\u201d formulation. \u201cI listened to the prime minister on that Sunday night and then talked with senior colleagues,\u201d he told the Observer. \u201cWe decided that, given the higher R rate in the north-east, the time wasn\u2019t right to move to that message. If we had possessed the same legislative powers as Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, then we would have done as they did and stayed with the lockdown as it was.\u201d According to Alice Wiseman, Gateshead\u2019s director of public health: \u201cThere are disproportionately high levels of deprivation and poverty here and elsewhere in the north-east. We know that, where that is the case, there will be existing public health problems and we know that the Covid disease targets people with pre-existing conditions. So we have to be ultra-cautious here in terms of advice and guidance.\u201d The willingness to defy government advice in order to, as Gannon puts it, \u201cdo what\u2019s best for Gateshead\u201d, is born of bitter experience.

Certainly, something must be done to take the pressure off both inmates and staff. \u2022Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist",

All that steam got let out.\u201d Sergio Pineda, 46, stood guard over his used car lot, a block down from the burning Shell station. \u201cI don\u2019t want to kill nobody,\u201d he said, \u201cbut if somebody disrespects my business \u2026 \u201cWe want justice too. Third-degree murder, manslaughter, is not going to cut it. But that\u2019s not what this is about. It\u2019s a lot of people just looking for an opportunity to loot and steal. The national guard should be here protecting. A lot of these are minority-owned businesses that aren\u2019t insured.\u201d Local elected officials warned that if the violence went on the economic life of the area could be destroyed. Some residents were in fear of their lives. The owners of a coffee shop sprayed on the outside: \u201cKids live downstairs.\u201d Ayanle Hashi, a Somali migrant, stood guard in front of his building, afraid someone would set a fire after the shops at street level were looted. \u201cThere are disabled and elderly people in here,\u201d he said. \u201cThey would never get out. People are taking advantage of a bad situation. But I get it. People here have been protesting for so long and nothing happens. The government doesn\u2019t do anything. They\u2019re angry.\u201d A large crowd marched on another police station, the fifth precinct. The city police chief, Medaria Arradondo, said he feared a repeat of the storming of the third precinct station and sent hundreds of officers in riot gear to charge the crowd around midnight. People stampeded to get away. About 50 were arrested. The police station was secure. But that remained the limit of the authorities control and, for another night, the streets belonged to whoever wanted to claim them.",

Five Sage experts warned that relaxing lockdown restrictions at this time risked a second surge. Their concerns were shared by the mayors of London and Greater Manchester, and by the deputy chief medical officer for England, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, who said: \u201cThis is a very dangerous moment\u201d. He said the R will only stay below 1 if people continue to adhere to physical distancing as the lockdown eases and people play their part to ensure the contact tracing system works well.</li> \n   <li><strong>The UK death toll rose by 215 to 38,376.</strong> And in the 24-hour period up to 9am today, another 2,445 positive results were recorded.</li> \n   <li><strong>Competitive sport will be allowed to resume from Monday at the earliest.</strong> The culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, said the government has published guidance to allow elite sport, including football, horse racing and tennis to resume behind closed doors (only when safe to do so) from Monday at the earliest. He said there will be guidance on how to get athletes back into physically distanced training and then back into close-contact training.</li> \n   <li><strong>People in England will be able to exercise with up to five others from different households from Monday.</strong> With this further relaxation of measures people from different households must remain two metres apart.</li> \n   <li><strong>And Prof Jonathan Van-Tam became the first scientific adviser to break ranks and comment on the Dominic Cummings affair</strong>. Asked if people in power should follow the rules he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> In my opinion the rules are clear and they have always been clear.</p> \n   <p>In my opinion they are for the benefit of all.</p> \n   <p>In my opinion they apply to all.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Make of that what you will.</p> \n  <p>That\u2019s it from me today from the UK side.

      "bodyText": "Five scientific advisers warned it is too risky to begin easing lockdown measures in England. As temperatures soar this weekend, the R is still dangerously close to 1 (it is currently estimated to be between 0.7 and 0.9) and incidence of the virus is still high. Five Sage experts warned that relaxing lockdown restrictions at this time risked a second surge. Their concerns were shared by the mayors of London and Greater Manchester, and by the deputy chief medical officer for England, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, who said: \u201cThis is a very dangerous moment\u201d. He said the R will only stay below 1 if people continue to adhere to physical distancing as the lockdown eases and people play their part to ensure the contact tracing system works well. The UK death toll rose by 215 to 38,376. And in the 24-hour period up to 9am today, another 2,445 positive results were recorded. Competitive sport will be allowed to resume from Monday at the earliest. The culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, said the government has published guidance to allow elite sport, including football, horse racing and tennis to resume behind closed doors (only when safe to do so) from Monday at the earliest. He said there will be guidance on how to get athletes back into physically distanced training and then back into close-contact training. People in England will be able to exercise with up to five others from different households from Monday. With this further relaxation of measures people from different households must remain two metres apart. And Prof Jonathan Van-Tam became the first scientific adviser to break ranks and comment on the Dominic Cummings affair. Asked if people in power should follow the rules he replied: In my opinion the rules are clear and they have always been clear. In my opinion they are for the benefit of all. In my opinion they apply to all. Make of that what you will. That\u2019s it from me today from the UK side. Thank you to all who got in touch and read along. If you\u2019d like to continue following the Guardian\u2019s coverage of the coronavirus pandemic, head over to the global live blog for the worldwide picture. Q. Will the prime minister and the government listen to the public and sack Dominic Cummings or will it simply ignore them? Dowden says: Dominic Cummings gave a very extensive explanation of his behaviour on Monday and answered all questions in relation to that. The prime minister accepted that explanation and on that basis kept him in post and that remains the position. Q. Should people in authority give a lead and obey the rules above all? Van-Tam says: In my opinion the rules are clear and they have always been clear. In my opinion they are for the benefit of all. In my opinion they apply to all. And with that, the press conference is over. Q. How can you stop tens of thousands of healthy people from unnecessarily self-isolating after contact tracing? Dowden says we can\u2019t, and this is part of the cost of track-and-trace. The government made the decision that this is the trade-off, he says, to help facilitate the wider easing of lockdown, which will benefit everyone. Van-Tam says taking people who are infected and who they may have already infected out of the system through isolation at home is crucial. There is a risk window of 14 days, and people will have to take that on the chin and self-isolate for the sake of others, he says. It is going to be painful for some people, but the alternative is going back to stopping those contacts occurring through the whole of society isolating, ie lockdown, he says. Q. How will people know they\u2019re being contacted by a contact tracer [from the NHS] and not a scammer? Dowden says there\u2019s been a lot of progress with recruiting 25,000 contact tracers. Van-Tam adds that malicious interference has been carefully considered. It would become apparent quite quickly that this is a professional, he adds. Q. Are the free-to-air matches designed to stop fans from gathering at other people\u2019s houses or at stadia? Dowden says yes, however it\u2019s a matter for the local authority and police to decide where best to hold matches. Q. Should clubs and fans accept neutral venues if police express public health fears? Dowden says: It is up to each individual sport to apply [government] guidelines and determine the way in which they do so. He adds that police and local authorities will determine together which venues are appropriate for matches. Van-Tam says fans congregating outside stadiums as football returns is \u201cclearly a police matter\u201d. He says: There has to be enough understanding that the venue can cope with the segregation and the organisation and the social distancing right up until ... the final whistle to make that the safest possible experience for everybody there. And that\u2019s going to be a crucial factor as well, in choosing these venues. Q. Do you agree with Prof John Edmunds, who says: the government is pretending they\u2019re not making the decisions and it\u2019s us scientists making the decisions, but that\u2019s not the case? Dowden interjects that ministers take responsibility for decisions and they take scientific advice in doing so. Van-Tam says our advice has been so far that the ways in which lockdown is being eased are consistent with keeping the R below 1. The measures in place from Monday should also keep the R below 1 and we will watch this closely, he adds. It\u2019s a matter of advice for us and decision for the politicians, he says. Q. With 8,000 new infections every day in England, who is catching coronavirus and how, given we\u2019re 10 weeks into lockdown? Van-Tam says this is a difficult question; he can only say the kinds of people who are more at risk of catching it. People who are elderly, have underlying chronic conditions or are obese are more at risk of catching it, he says. The ONS has shown the death rate is higher in elementary occupations where social distancing is more difficult he says. And we\u2019re in the middle of a very large inquiry into the impact on the BAME community, he says. We need to get to the bottom of that, he adds. Q. Scotland and Wales have been more cautious about lifting their lockdowns. What is it about England that makes you more confident to lift more measures? Dowden says each nation has to make its own decisions. He says it\u2019s threefold: meeting the five tests, ensuring the R remains below 1, and ensuring a track-and-trace system is in place. Van-Tam says Sir Patrick Vallance already said the R is between 0.7 and 0.9, so there isn\u2019t an enormous amount of headroom and we have to go slowly and cautiously. There are dangers if we go too fast, he says. Q. Is this government still being led by the science? Dowden says yes, and today\u2019s announcement is evidence of that. Van-Tam adds that the return of elite sport isn\u2019t relevant to the R value. Q. Are we really ready, given it may take contact tracing another few weeks to really kick in? Van-Tam says the system is ready and they have to move forwards on that basis. Q. Do you think it will be trickier to get people to comply if you have to reimpose restrictions than it was at earlier stages of the lockdown? Dowden says yes, that\u2019s correct, which is why they\u2019re moving with extreme caution. The need to maintain physical distancing remains, he says. Van-Tam says infections pass on in a moment and the incubation period is five days, so the next round of infections appears quite quickly. It will get out of control quickly if you allow it to, and it takes many weeks to get the brakes on it, he adds. People need to follow the advice to the letter, he says. They\u2019re now taking questions from the media. Q. What do you say to those scientists and others who say you\u2019re easing the lockdown in England too quickly? Dowden says Sage consists of more than 50 scientists who will all have their different views, and the government takes a collective view. They are right to urge caution, he says, because with the R between 0.7 and 0.9 we haven\u2019t got that much headroom. At each stage of the roadmap, we\u2019re not going to proceed if we\u2019re not confident it will be safe, he says. If we\u2019re not confident we will delay measures or even reimpose measures, he adds. So the government is broadly in agreement with what they\u2019re saying, he says. Van-Tam adds that scientific opinions always vary to some extent. Sage is very clear that the easing of lockdown has to go painstakingly slowly and we must be extremely cautious, he says. The scientists will continue to give that advice to the government, with no apologies for that, he says. He says he believes this is also a very dangerous moment. We have to get this right, he adds. Sage has taken a view that it is likely that with good compliance from the public and contact tracing goes well, these [measures on Monday] will not result in R going above one, he says. It\u2019s not a guarantee but it\u2019s a high degree of confidence, providing contact tracing goes well and the public adhere to the limits of the easement in lockdown, he adds. Contact tracing has to go well but the public also have to engage with it seriously and isolate if told to, he says. People have to be sensible and proportionate with the freedoms we\u2019re giving to them, he says. Don\u2019t go further than the guidance says, he adds. Leslie from Whitstable asked why the four nations have their own track-and-trace systems and how these will interact with each other to capture everyone who has been in contact with someone who has the virus. Dowden says testing, tracking and tracing infected people and their contacts and asking them to self-isolate will be important to keeping the number of cases down. Van-Tam adds the NHS is a nationwide service, configured differently across the four nations. It\u2019s therefore logical that there are different systems for each nation, he says. Identifying cases and tracing contacts is absolutely bread-and-butter for the health protection agencies of the UK in the case of other diseases, so they are used to working together, he says. They\u2019re taking questions from members of the public now. Kim from County Durham asked when more access would be allowed to public toilets. Dowden says: People who suffer from disabilities do need to have access to public toilets when they go out. As soon as we are able to do so, consistent with ensuring that we can do so in a safe way in accordance with public health guidance, we will do that. There is a continued long-term decline in deaths following a Covid-19 positive test, Van-Tam says. Hospital admissions and mechanical ventilator beds occupied by patients with Covid-19 both continue to fall, Van-Tam says. Prof Van-Tam is going through the slides now. There has been some increase in positive cases in the last few days, he says, but this is a trend that has been seen before. What\u2019s important is the seven-day rolling average, which remains a clear downward trend, he says. The British sporting recovery has begun, Dowden says. In a further relaxation of lockdown measures, from Monday, people will be able to exercise with up to five others from different households, so long as they remain two metres apart, Dowden announces. This means people who play team sports can train together, he says, and can do things like fitness sessions that don\u2019t involve physical contact. Dowden set two challenges for football\u2019s return, he says. First, a reasonable number of remaining Premier League games will be broadcast free-to-air, he says. Second, the financial benefits of returning will be shared with the entire football family, he says. A third of matches to finish the season will now be free to view, including the Liverpool v Everton derby, and live Premier League football will be on the BBC for the first time in its history, he confirms. Football is coming back, he says. The mental health of staff and athletes is just as important as physical health and this is also in the guidance, he adds. The return of live sport has been eagerly awaited by many people, Dowden says. The government has published guidance allowing competitive sport to resume behind closed doors (only when safe to do so) from Monday at the earliest, he says. It\u2019s up to each individual sport to decide when to resume competition, he adds. Football, tennis, horse racing, Formula One, cricket, golf, rugby, snooker and others are all set to return to screens shortly, he says. First out of the gate will be horse racing, set to return in the north-east of England next week, he adds. There will be guidance on how to get athletes back into socially distanced training and then back into close-contact training, he says. The guidance outlines measures that need to be in place for an event to go ahead safely, including a screening process for coronavirus in place at venues, a one-way system for people and vehicles, minimal use of dressing rooms and maintaining social distancing wherever possible, he says. The culture secretary is speaking now. Of those tested positive, across all settings in the UK, 38,376 people have now died, an increase of 215 since yesterday, he says. In the 24-hour period up to 9am on Saturday, 127,722 tests were carried out or dispatched with 2,445 positive results. Overall, a total of 4,171,408 tests have been carried out and 272,826 cases have been confirmed positive. The digital, culture, media and sport secretary will lead this afternoon\u2019s daily coronavirus news briefing, due to begin shortly. He will be joined by Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England. A growing number of scientific advisers on the government\u2019s scientific advisory body, Sage, have warned that it is too soon to be lifting lockdown measures in England. A growing number of expert advisers to the government on the coronavirus crisis have expressed concern about plans to ease lockdown restrictions in England from Monday. As people flocked to beaches and beauty spots in the sweltering heat over the weekend, Prof Peter Horby, of the University of Oxford, joined scientists Sir Jeremy Farrar and Prof John Edmunds, all members of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), to warn that ministers are taking risks. Another Sage member, Prof Calum Semple, insisted that a \u201cbrave\u201d political decision had been taken on schools reopening \u201cwere everything normal\u201d, but cautioned that high levels of transmission were still being seen, according to the BBC. He said: Essentially we\u2019re lifting the lid on a boiling pan and it\u2019s just going to bubble over. We need to get it down to simmer before we take the lid off, and it\u2019s too early. From Monday in England, friends and families can meet in parks and gardens in socially distanced groups of six. But Prof Robert West, a participant in the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours (SPI-B) which advises Sage, emphasised on Saturday that some 8,000 infections, and 400 deaths, a day are still occurring. Speaking in a personal capacity, he told the PA news agency the situation should be treated not as a political crisis, but a health crisis. He said: Put all this together and you have a huge risk, and it\u2019s not just me saying that, that there will be an increase in infection rates. Because we don\u2019t have track and trace in place, we won\u2019t know whether this easing of the lockdown has caused (an) increase in infections for some time, by which time it will be well under way, the second peak will be well under way. The government is not taking its responsibilities for political leadership seriously. This should not be treated as a political crisis but as a health crisis, if you treat it as a political crisis it\u2019s all about managing your reputation, if you treat it as a health crisis it\u2019s about saving lives. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has joined the members of Sage who have said there is a risk in lifting lockdown measures too soon in England. An education union has called for the government to draw back from reopening primary schools in England from Monday. National Education Union (NEU) joint general secretaries Kevin Courtney and Dr Mary Bousted spoke out after four members of the government\u2019s Sage scientific advisory committee expressed concerns about the pace of easing of lockdown. In a statement, they said: This public break by four prominent members of the government\u2019s Sage committee changes everything. No one can now confidently assert that it is safe to open schools more widely from Monday. All four of these independent members of Sage agree that there must be a lower number of cases and an efficient system of contact tracing working before there is a relaxation of lockdown measures. Both these measures are included in the NEU\u2019s five tests. Opening schools more widely runs the risk of increasing the R rate and therefore the level of risk to staff and to parents. That risk can only be mitigated if contact tracing is running successfully. We have made that case strongly to government \u2013 and we have been supported by the BMA and by the Independent Sage group in our concerns. Government replies that it is following the science. But this public break by senior members of Sage, including by the chair of the Nervtag committee, undermines that claim. School leaders, their staff, and pupils\u2019 families deserve better than this. Even at this late stage, we call on the government to draw back from wider opening of primary schools from Monday. Instead we urge government to engage in talks with the profession and the unions, including the NEU, about how to open schools more widely once the contact tracing system is shown to be working. Testing at a hospital that closed to new admissions because of a high number of coronavirus cases has found approximately 6% of staff are infected without showing symptoms. Weston general hospital in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, stopped accepting new patients from 8am last Monday to maintain patient and staff safety. All inpatients have been tested for Covid-19 and no new cases have been identified, the hospital said. The majority of the 1,700 staff working at the hospital have been tested, with results indicating that approximately 6% are asymptomatic and infected. Any members of staff who tested positive have self-isolated and it is hoped that those who have not yet been tested will be by the end of Saturday. Dr William Oldfield, medical director at University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS foundation trust, said: The signs are encouraging. The results from our inpatient testing have identified no new cases of Covid-19, which suggests the actions we have taken to control the situation are working. We will retest all our inpatients again next week, and if the results continue to show no new cases, this would indicate no in-hospital transmission of the infection. We will also repeat testing of all staff at the hospital again next week. The results from this will indicate whether the staff working in the hospital are remaining free of infection. We are continuing to safely discharge patients as appropriate when they no longer need our care, and as patients are discharged areas are being deep-cleaned to get the hospital ready to reopen. In an interview with BBC Points West on Friday, Dr Oldfield said it was too early to say what the root cause of the outbreak was. John Penrose, the MP for Weston-super-Mare, tweeted: North Somerset council contacted all schools in the area, advising them to delay reopening until 8 June as a precautionary measure. It said a comprehensive data set on the hospital outbreak and completed analysis on it was required before schools in North Somerset could reopen to wider groups of pupils. NHS England has announced 146 more deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 26,529. Of the 146 new deaths announced on Saturday: 20 occurred on 29 May 51 occurred on 28 May 14 occurred on 27 May The figures also show 48 of these took place between 1 and 26 May, and the remaining 13 deaths occurred in April, with the earliest on 3 April. NHS England releases updated figures each day showing the dates of every coronavirus-related death in hospitals in England, often including previously uncounted deaths that took place several days or even weeks ago. This is because of the time it takes for deaths to be confirmed as testing positive for Covid-19, for postmortem examinations to be processed and for data from the tests to be validated. The figures published on Saturday by NHS England show 8 April continues to have the highest number for the most hospital deaths on a single day, with a current total of 893. Northern Ireland has recorded one more Covid-related death since Friday, taking the total there to 522. And in the last 24 hours, another 13 individuals tested positive for Covid-19, bringing that tally to 4,709. Public Health Wales has said a further 14 people have died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths in Wales to 1,331. Another 86 people have tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed cases there to 13,913. Prof Robert West, a participant in the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours (SPI-B) which advises Sage, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, has echoed growing concerns among government advisers about the easing of lockdown and criticised the official response to Dominic Cummings\u2019 travels. Speaking in a personal capacity, he told PA: The way that we\u2019re moving to easing of this dreadful lockdown \u2013 but it has been working \u2013 at a time when we have still something like 8,000 infections a day, and we\u2019re still looking at something in the region of probably 400 deaths a day, and before we have the track, trace and isolate system properly running. Put all this together and you have a huge risk, and it\u2019s not just me saying that, that there will be an increase in infection rates. Because we don\u2019t have track and trace in place, we won\u2019t know whether this easing of the lockdown has caused [an] increase in infections for some time, by which time it will be well under way, the second peak will be well under way. He said the government was not taking its responsibilities for political leadership seriously and that the pandemic should be treated as a health crisis. This should not be treated as a political crisis but as a health crisis. If you treat it as a political crisis it\u2019s all about managing your reputation, if you treat it as a health crisis it\u2019s about saving lives. Asked whether he thought the behaviour of Dominic Cummings would have an impact on people sticking to the lockdown rules, the UCL scientist said: \u201cwhen people see something like the Cummings affair... that\u2019s not a recipe for trust.\u201d Trust in authority telling you to do things is very important when it comes to people adhering to those rules. This is going to become even more important as we move to a situation where it\u2019s not everybody having to do it, it\u2019s people who have drawn the short straw. So they will be seeing other people out there being able to engage in activities which they can\u2019t do for up to 14 days. People will feel really cheesed off about it and they must, absolutely must, feel that what they are doing they are doing it because it\u2019s the right thing to do, so anyone who was in their position would do that. Labour\u2019s shadow health minister Justin Madders said: It is crucial for all of us that the Government gets this right. Easing lockdown must be done as safely as possible. It will only work if there are effective, flexible and local systems in place that have the confidence of the public to ensure that we avoid a second peak of infections The Conservative MP Anthony Mangnall has apologised for leaving the instruction \u201cinsert if there has been a bereavement\u201d in an email to one of his constituents. The words were left by mistake in a response to one of hundreds of emails Mangnall received about No 10 aide Dominic Cummings\u2019 controversial lockdown trip to Durham in recent days. An extract shared on social media of an email sent by the Totnes MP shows the third paragraph of his response read: [Insert if there has been a bereavement: May I add my condolences to the recent loss of your family member. The current situation has made the ability to mourn the passing of loved ones all the more difficult. I send my best wishes to you and your family.] Mangnall, who was elected last year, has said he \u201cshares many of the concerns\u201d of his constituents regarding Cummings\u2019 stay in Durham and would not have taken the same course of action himself, but did not call for his resignation. He wrote in a statement on Facebook: The anger and dissatisfaction at Mr Cummings\u2019 behaviour is no surprise at all. Spending time defending an adviser is not a good use of time, especially given the many fears and concerns about people\u2019s future and their livelihoods. A \u201csmall number\u201d of Extinction Rebellion protesters in central London have been arrested for breaching coronavirus regulations, with others issued fines. The group said 150 people demonstrated on Parliament Square \u2013 keeping three metres apart from one another \u2013 against government incompetence and to demand a citizens\u2019 assembly on the recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. A spokesperson called into question the public health rationale behind the protesters being arrested for breaking Covid-19 regulations and not dispersing after being told to leave by police who were not wearing masks. The political institutions we have in place are not fit to deal with the huge challenges in front of us, both Covid-19 and the climate crisis are interconnected and need to be dealt with in tandem if we\u2019re going to secure our future. We need a citizens assembly now to redesign the way we live and let people decide how we move forward. For police to arrest peaceful protestors distanced at 3m apart and wearing masks is ridiculous, especially as they were not socially distancing themselves or wearing masks, therefore putting people at risk. Protests have also taken place in Bournemouth, Sheffield, Wellingborough, Birmingham, Worcester, Bristol and elsewhere. The Labour deputy leader, Angela Rayner, has renewed calls for NHS staff to receive a pay rise after reported falls in nurses\u2019 salaries of 8% based on the consumer prices index since the Tories came to power in 2010. As lockdown is relaxed, many in the NHS are left reeling. In this powerful, unmissable read, palliative care doctor Rachel Clarke shares her experience working with patients with Covid-19 and her fears of a second wave. An extract: Sometimes I fret that most people don\u2019t know how very close the NHS came to being overwhelmed this Easter \u2013 how we avoided the hellishness of Lombardy or New York City only by superhuman efforts. I fear, too, that most people are unaware of how exhausted, stunned \u2013 shellshocked, even \u2013 some NHS staff and care workers are. How daunted we feel as we watch lockdown being relaxed before proper testing, tracing and isolation infrastructure are in place. The deputy mayor of Liverpool has stepped down while an inquiry takes place into footage of a gathering in her garden during lockdown. The city\u2019s Labour group is investigating after video emerged on social media of at least 12 people at the home of Lynnie Hinnigan, where a number of chairs were laid out. Councillor Hinnigan said that no party took place because of the Covid-19 lockdown restrictions, and guests had just dropped off gifts in a surprise event for her 50th birthday, organised by her daughter. She told the Liverpool Echo: I really wasn\u2019t aware that it was happening, it was genuinely a surprise. Everyone is finding lockdown hard, not seeing family and friends, but everyone should still follow the rules, stay alert, stay safe and socially distance, which is exactly what I told my daughter and the reason I never left the house. I am sorry if this has hurt anyone as it was never mine or my daughter\u2019s intention. Many other families in our city have struggled throughout this period. We still need to follow the guidance until we can meet face-to-face again. The Labour group said Hinnigan had \u201cvoluntarily and temporarily\u201d stepped down from her duties. Some more upbeat news! Thousands of people have pledged to take up daily \u201crandom acts of wildness\u201d throughout June, through a campaign by the Wildlife Trust. With activities ranging from walking barefoot on the grass in a local park to making bird feeders, people are being encouraged to enjoy and appreciate a different aspect of nature on their doorsteps during the 30 days of June. With so many simple joys to be had, here are some wonderful examples of what people will be doing to get closer to nature: The Liberal Democrat health spokesperson, Munira Wilson, has said the decision by key members of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) to go public with their concerns about easing lockdown measures shows \u201cministers are no longer following the science\u201d. Echoing the words of the mayor for Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, (see 9.44am), the Twickenham MP said lifting lockdown seemed \u201cpremature\u201d. The test, trace, isolate system that we need to keep people safe is not yet fully functional. The NHSX app is delayed for an unknown period. For seven days straight, the government has been unable to provide even basic data about the number of people tested. On top of these failings, public health messaging has been badly undermined as people see it\u2019s one rule for the Tory elite and another for everyone else. Given this chaos, measures to lift lockdown appear premature. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced on Friday that the furlough scheme will come to an end at the end of October. From August, businesses will have to pay national insurance and pension contributions, then 10% of salaries in September, rising to 20% in October. But the lack of protections for shielded workers is a \u201cmajor missing piece\u201d of the furlough scheme, according to Citizens Advice. Analysis of around 2,000 of all employment cases Citizens Advice has seen since 14 April showed that more than 70% of those who are shielding or are at higher risk from coronavirus \u2013 such as those who are pregnant or have diabetes \u2013 were not furloughed. Further research from the charity found that four in 10 (41%) of those in the shielded group have lost at least 20% of their income since the coronavirus outbreak began, more than a quarter (27%) have lost 60% of their income, and as many as one in 10 (12%) are working outside the home despite this potentially putting their health at risk. Responding to the chancellor\u2019s changes to the job retention scheme, Dame Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: The furlough scheme has protected millions of jobs and incomes, but the failure to give additional protection for the shielded group means there is still a major missing piece of the puzzle. Many in this group fear their jobs will be the first to go as the scheme starts to wind down. One in 10 people who are clinically extremely vulnerable are continuing to work outside the home despite the risk to their health, and thousands more are struggling to make ends meet because they have been denied furlough. No one should face this impossible choice. As long as the shielded group are asked to remain at home, they and those they live with should have a right to be furloughed and employers should be exempt from contributing to the cost of the scheme for these employees. The UK government released more than 50 documents on Friday \u2013 including the minutes of 34 meetings of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). The documents set out how scientists tracked \u2013 and reacted to \u2013 the pandemic. By mid-March, a sense of panic was setting in. Good morning. Government advisers have voiced concerns that the easing of lockdown measures from Monday will come too soon and could cause a surge in the spread of coronavirus. The R level is currently between 0.7 and 0.9 and, with 8,000 new daily infections in England alone, they warn this is \u201ca very high level of incidence\u201d. Prof John Edmunds, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has said the lifting of lockdown measures, at a time when the test, track and trace system has only been in place for a few days, is \u201crisky\u201d. He told Sky News: I think it\u2019s risky for a couple of reasons. One, I think the reproduction number is only just below one and so there\u2019s not a lot of room for manoeuvre and so small changes can put that reproduction number up above one. I think the other more important thing is that we still have a lot of cases here in this country. The numbers of infections that we have is about 8,000 new infections every day in England alone. Asked if he agreed with some fellow members of Sage that it was too soon to ease lockdown restrictions, Prof Peter Horby of the University of Oxford, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: Actually, I do. You know, we have still got 8,000 cases a day. We have been very successful in bringing it down, decreasing the numbers because of the social distancing. But, you will have heard that the R level is between 0.7 and 0.9, so it\u2019s only a bit below one, so we have got very little headroom, actually. And, it\u2019s really important that we use that headroom very wisely and we don\u2019t lose control again. The mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, said this morning he feels restrictions are being eased too soon. He told the Today programme that, with the R number still quite high, easing the lockdown was \u201cpremature\u201d. He said: I think we have arrived at quite a dangerous moment. This is premature, this easing of the lockdown. Test and trace is not fully operational and it should be, in my view, before these steps are taken. The R number ... is still quite high. I\u2019ll be taking you through all the latest coronavirus-related developments in the UK. Please do feel free to get in touch with me throughout the day as I work.

      "body": "<p>Foreigners can sometimes see a country with the greatest clarity. British politicians and journalists, who think themselves sophisticated, watched Dominic Cummings\u2019 press conference in the Downing Street rose garden on Monday \u2013 along with countless citizens outraged by elite double standards. To my knowledge, only one viewer saw the trick Cummings was pulling. It wasn\u2019t an opposition MP or hot-shot reporter but Jens Wiechers, a data protection consultant from Cologne.</p> <p>Wiechers had the wit to do what the Cummingses of this world hate above all else: check. He found that, for all his inflated reputation, Cummings is nothing more than a sneaky little cheat.</p> <p>The context of his charlatanism matters because it connects the Cummings-Johnson administration to the global attempt to delegitimise criticism. A section of the UK right is desperate <a href=\"https://rsf.org/en/news/uk-press-freedom-under-threat-lockdown-government-dismisses-reporting-campaigning-newspapers\">to shift blame</a> for this government\u2019s inability to govern to \u201cthe media\u201d. Online mobs hounded television reporters last week, as government loyalists rallied behind the banner of #scummedia.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Cummings\u2019 evidence that the media were running \u2018false stories\u2019 against him was a false story</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Cummings gave them the marching orders. He wanted Tories to believe he was not a hypocrite who broke the lockdown his government instructed others to obey. Rather he was <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/dominic-cummings-statement-speech-transcript-durham-full-text-read-lockdown-a9531856.html\">the victim</a> of \u201cnumerous false stories in the media about my actions and statements regarding Covid\u201d. Journalists, he continued, claimed he had opposed the lockdown and \u201cdid not care\u201d about the mass deaths. Nothing could be further from the truth, the radical disrupter of the stodgy status quo explained. He possessed a prescience that bordered on the magical. He could prove he cared because as long ago as last year he \u201cwrote about the possible threat of coronaviruses and the urgent need for planning\u201d.</p> <p>Viewers might have wondered why, if Cummings was warning about coronaviruses in 2019, his government had failed so abjectly to protect the British in 2020. You saw it coming, and still messed up? They might have thought twice before believing the man who gave us the outright falsehood that <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/europe/350-million-week-boris-johnson-statistics-authority-misuse/\">Brexit would deliver \u00a3350m</a> to the NHS in the 2016 referendum campaign.</p> <p>They didn\u2019t doubt him because lies are so common in contemporary politics they blow past us like dust in the wind. No one checked, apart from Wiechers. \u201cIn retrospect, I could pretend I knew not to believe Cummings and Johnson,\u201d he told me from Germany, where he watches British and American public life with a horrified fascination. \u201cBut I began by wondering what he had written on his blog last year.\u201d</p> <p>He found that Cummings had <a href=\"https://dominiccummings.com/2019/03/04/the-most-secure-bio-labs-routinely-make-errors-that-could-cause-a-global-pandemic-are-about-to-re-start-experiments-on-pathogens-engineered-to-make-them-mammalian-airborne-transmissible/\">posted on 4 March 2019</a> on the dangers of the Sars coronavirus in a wider piece on pandemics. Or so he wanted us to believe. The post struck Wiechers as a lazy piece of writing filled with extracts from the work of others. The now suspicious Wiechers checked Cummings\u2019 blog on <a href=\"https://archive.org/web/\">the Wayback Machine</a>, a digital library that tracks changes to billions of web pages. It showed Cummings had added the reference to coronaviruses between 9 April and 3 May 2020. Further research showed Cummings\u2019 own site recorded that the post was edited at 8:55pm on 14 April precisely, the day Cummings told the public he had returned from his trip to Durham.</p> <p>The man\u2019s deviousness was breathtaking. His evidence that the media were running \u201cfalse stories\u201d against him was a false story. As striking was his ridiculous vanity: Cummings cared so neurotically about his reputation as a prophet that he forged the record so it appeared that he was warning of the \u201curgent need\u201d to plan for a corona pandemic while the minds of lesser men and women were elsewhere.</p> <p>The vanity is more than striking, it is essential to the right\u2019s attempt to maintain its power. Supporters of strongmen do not want populist leaders who are \u201cjust like us\u201d. They want to believe their heroes are smarter and better. The manufacture of the myth of exceptional talent is as important to the strongman as the ability to turn their voters against journalists, judges and any other independent group that might check them. Liberals should not laugh at Trump\u2019s boast that he is a \u201cvery stable genius\u201d. Trump has persuaded his core supporters to believe that he is a superman, who can master any problem and cut any deal, ever since he first ran for president.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Now more than ever, Johnson wants Conservatives to believe in the illusion of his talent</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Boris Johnson spent years showing off his superficial understanding of the classics by picking up Latin phrases from his well-thumbed dictionary of quotations and dropping them into his articles. A little learning was not a dangerous thing for him but a smart career move. It convinced conservative-inclined voters that Johnson had enjoyed the education of the old imperial ruling class and was not the lightweight he appeared to be. The fact that hardly any educated person studies Latin and Greek today made it easier for Johnson to bluff his way to the top when so few could see the vacuity behind the pose.</p> <p>His administration has presided over thousands of needless deaths. It has never got on top of the virus. A terrible recession is all but upon us, and it\u2019s likely that Tory zealotry will destroy the chance of a decent deal with the European Union that a broken country needs. Now more than ever, Johnson wants Conservatives to believe in the illusion of his talent.</p> <p>Unlike Trump and Johnson, Cummings is not trying to fool the public but fool the fool who employs him \u2013 not the hardest of tasks, I grant you. He sinks to the level of the petty cheat because he must convince Johnson that he is a political mastermind.</p> <p>Don\u2019t be fooled as well. Too many liberals see Cummings as a manipulative demon with supernatural powers, when the most frightening thing about him, and Johnson, is their pathetic inability to control events. They are not evil geniuses but lazy, dogmatic and incompetent men, whose shabbiness is revealed as much by their little deceits as grand blunders. Don\u2019t inflate them into monsters, who can never be beaten. Draw courage from their littleness.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist</p>",

To my knowledge, only one viewer saw the trick Cummings was pulling. It wasn\u2019t an opposition MP or hot-shot reporter but Jens Wiechers, a data protection consultant from Cologne. Wiechers had the wit to do what the Cummingses of this world hate above all else: check. He found that, for all his inflated reputation, Cummings is nothing more than a sneaky little cheat. The context of his charlatanism matters because it connects the Cummings-Johnson administration to the global attempt to delegitimise criticism. A section of the UK right is desperate to shift blame for this government\u2019s inability to govern to \u201cthe media\u201d. Online mobs hounded television reporters last week, as government loyalists rallied behind the banner of #scummedia. Cummings gave them the marching orders. He wanted Tories to believe he was not a hypocrite who broke the lockdown his government instructed others to obey. Rather he was the victim of \u201cnumerous false stories in the media about my actions and statements regarding Covid\u201d. Journalists, he continued, claimed he had opposed the lockdown and \u201cdid not care\u201d about the mass deaths. Nothing could be further from the truth, the radical disrupter of the stodgy status quo explained. He possessed a prescience that bordered on the magical. He could prove he cared because as long ago as last year he \u201cwrote about the possible threat of coronaviruses and the urgent need for planning\u201d. Viewers might have wondered why, if Cummings was warning about coronaviruses in 2019, his government had failed so abjectly to protect the British in 2020. You saw it coming, and still messed up? They might have thought twice before believing the man who gave us the outright falsehood that Brexit would deliver \u00a3350m to the NHS in the 2016 referendum campaign. They didn\u2019t doubt him because lies are so common in contemporary politics they blow past us like dust in the wind. No one checked, apart from Wiechers. \u201cIn retrospect, I could pretend I knew not to believe Cummings and Johnson,\u201d he told me from Germany, where he watches British and American public life with a horrified fascination. \u201cBut I began by wondering what he had written on his blog last year.\u201d He found that Cummings had posted on 4 March 2019 on the dangers of the Sars coronavirus in a wider piece on pandemics. Or so he wanted us to believe. The post struck Wiechers as a lazy piece of writing filled with extracts from the work of others. The now suspicious Wiechers checked Cummings\u2019 blog on the Wayback Machine, a digital library that tracks changes to billions of web pages. It showed Cummings had added the reference to coronaviruses between 9 April and 3 May 2020. Further research showed Cummings\u2019 own site recorded that the post was edited at 8:55pm on 14 April precisely, the day Cummings told the public he had returned from his trip to Durham. The man\u2019s deviousness was breathtaking. His evidence that the media were running \u201cfalse stories\u201d against him was a false story. As striking was his ridiculous vanity: Cummings cared so neurotically about his reputation as a prophet that he forged the record so it appeared that he was warning of the \u201curgent need\u201d to plan for a corona pandemic while the minds of lesser men and women were elsewhere. The vanity is more than striking, it is essential to the right\u2019s attempt to maintain its power. Supporters of strongmen do not want populist leaders who are \u201cjust like us\u201d. They want to believe their heroes are smarter and better. The manufacture of the myth of exceptional talent is as important to the strongman as the ability to turn their voters against journalists, judges and any other independent group that might check them. Liberals should not laugh at Trump\u2019s boast that he is a \u201cvery stable genius\u201d. Trump has persuaded his core supporters to believe that he is a superman, who can master any problem and cut any deal, ever since he first ran for president. Boris Johnson spent years showing off his superficial understanding of the classics by picking up Latin phrases from his well-thumbed dictionary of quotations and dropping them into his articles. A little learning was not a dangerous thing for him but a smart career move. It convinced conservative-inclined voters that Johnson had enjoyed the education of the old imperial ruling class and was not the lightweight he appeared to be. The fact that hardly any educated person studies Latin and Greek today made it easier for Johnson to bluff his way to the top when so few could see the vacuity behind the pose. His administration has presided over thousands of needless deaths. It has never got on top of the virus. A terrible recession is all but upon us, and it\u2019s likely that Tory zealotry will destroy the chance of a decent deal with the European Union that a broken country needs. Now more than ever, Johnson wants Conservatives to believe in the illusion of his talent. Unlike Trump and Johnson, Cummings is not trying to fool the public but fool the fool who employs him \u2013 not the hardest of tasks, I grant you. He sinks to the level of the petty cheat because he must convince Johnson that he is a political mastermind. Don\u2019t be fooled as well. Too many liberals see Cummings as a manipulative demon with supernatural powers, when the most frightening thing about him, and Johnson, is their pathetic inability to control events. They are not evil geniuses but lazy, dogmatic and incompetent men, whose shabbiness is revealed as much by their little deceits as grand blunders. Don\u2019t inflate them into monsters, who can never be beaten. Draw courage from their littleness. \u2022Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist",

Prof Robert West, a member of the scientific pandemic influenza group on behaviours (SPI-B) that advises Sage (the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies), said the decision by Cummings to travel from London to Durham during the full lockdown would have an impact on people adhering to the latest rules. The UCL scientist said: \u201cTrust in authority telling you to do things is very important when it comes to people adhering to those rules. When people see something like the Cummings affair \u2026 that\u2019s not a recipe for trust.\u201d It came as the culture secretary Oliver Dowden announced that football, tennis, horseracing, Formula One, cricket, golf, rugby and snooker would start up again. Groups of up to six people from different households will be able to exercise together from Monday, while maintaining a distance of 2 metres, he said. Billed as the recovery of British sport, the move will allow teams to play together and take part in conditioning and fitness sessions which do not involve physical contact. \u201cToday I am also glad to confirm that we are relaxing the rules on exercise further so that from Monday people will be able to exercise with up to five others from different households, crucially, so long as they remain two metres apart,\u201d he said. \u201cThe British sporting recovery has begun.\u201d Dowden added that the government has published guidance to allow elite sport to resume behind closed doors, with guidelines on how to get athletes back into socially distanced training and then back into close-contact training. Boris Johnson has announced a gradual easing of the lockdown in England from Monday, when friends and relatives will be able to meet in parks and gardens in socially distanced groups of six. \u201cHappy Monday\u201d will also signal the reopening of schools \u2013 allowing children in nurseries, early-years settings, reception, year 1 and year 6 to return to class \u2013 as well as more shops, with outdoor retail and car showrooms able to resume operations. Van-Tam agreed that it was a \u201cdangerous moment\u201d and that scientists were right to urge caution but he added that scientific opinions always vary to some extent \u201cacross the piste\u201d. He went on to urge the public to continue to comply with the guidance saying that otherwise the virus could get out of control. \u201cDon\u2019t see this as a curve that\u2019s the same going up as it is down, it\u2019s quite easy for it to go up, [but] it\u2019s quite hard to get the brakes on to go back down,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I really hope that people will follow the advice that\u2019s given to the letter, and not any further than that, to make sure we\u2019re never in that position again.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s top public health leaders and scientists have warned Boris Johnson that trust in the government has been shattered by the Dominic Cummings affair and now poses real danger to life when lockdown measures are lifted this week. In a letter sent to No 10 on Friday, 26 senior UK academics and health administrators warn that public faith in the government is essential if the Covid-19 crisis is to be tackled effectively. However, they make clear that trust has been \u201cbadly damaged by the recently reported actions of Dominic Cummings, including his failure to stand down or resign in the public interest\u201d, and by the prime minister\u2019s refusal to dismiss him. In their extraordinary intervention, published in full in the Observer, the group also warns there has been a failure to set up an effective test, trace and isolate system to pinpoint and then quarantine newly infected people. As a result, they are now \u201cvery concerned for the safety and wellbeing of the general public\u201d as the lockdown measures are relaxed. The warnings came as the government\u2019s deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam went out of his way at the daily coronavirus briefing to make clear that people in positions of authority had a duty to lead by example and obey lockdown rules. In the clearest criticism yet by a top government figure of Cummings\u2019 actions in driving with his wife and child from London to Durham in late March, Van-Tam said: \u201cIn my opinion the rules are clear and have always been clear. In my opinion they are for the benefit of all and they apply to all.\u201d An Opinium poll for the Observer shows 81% of people believe Cummings broke the rules, and 68% think he should resign, including 52% of Conservative supporters. The poll, conducted on Thursday and Friday, also shows the Conservatives\u2019 lead over Labour has crashed from 26 points at the end of March to just four points now. Last week alone the lead was cut from 12 to four points. Just days after the health secretary, Matt Hancock, unveiled the new test, trace and isolate scheme to combat Covid-19, the top health experts say the public mood is \u201ctoo fragile to cope with another over-optimistic target-based strategy\u201d, and urge transparency over timescales and risks for the national scheme. They say people need \u201cto see with their own eyes that the necessary infrastructure and effective systems are put in place not just rapidly, but effectively\u201d. They also say there is now a high risk of an uncontrolled spike in new infections, hospitalisations and deaths from Covid-19 over the summer. One of the letter\u2019s main authors, Prof David McCoy, director of the centre for public health at Queen Mary University, London, described the test, trace and isolate system \u2013 which aims to quarantine people with Covid-19 and those who have been in contact with them \u2013 as \u201ca mess\u201d. \u201cIt is not a system,\u201d he told the Observer. \u201cIt is just a fragmented collection of different programmes with nothing really holding them together.

      "bodyText": "A federal government scientific report has issued a warning about chemicals used in unconventional gas drilling in the sensitive wild rivers of the Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre basin. As the government weighs up recommendations to expand the gas industry for a post-coronavirus recovery, the western rivers of Queensland loom as a significant test for how authorities will balance economics with the environment. The rivers and floodplains that fracture and snake towards the great inland lake are largely unaffected by the sort of developments and other interventions that have made a mess of the Murray-Darling system. At the same time, the channel country area is considered to have significant potential for the rapid expansion of gas drilling. The federal government\u2019s bioregional assessments program this month released a report on the region, in which it identified several significant \u201cknowledge gaps\u201d about the geology and the impact of gas development on the waterways, which require further study. These gaps include whether surface infrastructure could divert floodwaters; the potential for unconventional gas developments to affect the migration of groundwater between different formations; and the potential for the extraction of water from shallow aquifers to impact ground and surface water. \u201cFurther work is required to develop conceptual models that explicitly link risks due to shale, tight and deep coal gas development with individual threatened species, other important ecological assets and other extant threatening processes,\u201d the report said. It said of 116 chemicals known to be used in drilling and fracking, 33 were assessed as being of \u201cpotentially high concern\u201d and 41 were of \u201cpotential concern\u201d. Last month, the Guardian reported that a leaked Queensland government scientific report \u2013 made confidential and ignored by the state \u2013 recommended a ban on fracking in the channel country and the exclusion of all gas wells from floodplain areas. Concerns about gas development in the channel country are not necessarily related to the broader debate about the safety of practices such as fracking, which advocates say cause little harm with proper regulation, but which remains a controversial and often unpopular practice. Rather, there are specific concerns in the channel country, where no two flood events are the same and locals say water flows can be diverted or blocked by the most minor artificial structure in the floodplain channels. \u201c[An obstruction] 10 inches or a foot [30cm] high can block floodwater back for some distance,\u201d says Peter Douglas, a grazier from the Barcoo shire. Douglas said the wild rivers protections in place in Queensland \u2013 overhauled by the Newman government in 2014 \u2013 had changed the regulatory situation from one where \u201cyou couldn\u2019t turn a bulldozer around\u201d to an open-slather arrangement with no real restrictions. Gas drilling \u2013 and fracking \u2013 has taken place in the area since 1969 and the industry says it has not yet had a detrimental impact. Douglas said his concern about the expansion of the industry, and potential for unconventional gas drilling in the area, was that it would likely require larger infrastructure. \u201cYou stick a couple of pads in line across the Cooper it will change the flow of the Cooper.

In Sydney the quality of the housing is so bad.\u201d</p> <p>Will a pandemic that thrives in urban density combined with ridiculous house prices in Melbourne and Sydney and a revolution in working from home result in a surge of people moving to Australia\u2019s regions?</p> <p>Instagram says yes!</p> <p>This season\u2019s favoured aesthetic on visual-based platforms such as Instagram and Pinterest is <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/cottagecore-isolation-aesthetic-tumblr-explained-social-distancing-2020-4\">#cottagecore</a>: think cute little houses in the country, walks in the woods, collecting flowers and making jam.</p> <p>But the data in Australia is not backing up the cottagecore trend \u2013 yet.&nbsp;</p> <p>John Daley, the chief executive of the Grattan Institute, says it\u2019s too early to know whether the pandemic and a shift towards working from home will create a population boom in regional areas.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThe housing market is frozen but it\u2019s absolutely inevitable that more people are going to work from home, more often,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople have set themselves up and got a second screen. They have got Zoom and learnt how to use that. Now that we have done it for three months, we can see that it works.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What\u2019s a city got that I need anymore?</p> <footer> <cite>Rebecca Andrews</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But more people working from home doesn\u2019t necessarily translate as more people leaving cities.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThere are not that many jobs that are true freelance jobs \u2013 your clients are disproportionately in the big cities,\u201d he says.</p> <p>If many offices move to a hybrid mix of working-from-home and in the office, \u201cthe regions that will do well out of this are within striking distance of major cities \u2013 because companies will want a presence in the office some of the time\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>Cameron Kusher, head of economic research at REA Group \u2013 which includes realestate.com.au \u2013 says that although anecdotally he has heard of people wanting to move to the country, \u201cit\u2019s not showing up much in the data in Victoria and New South Wales\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>Searches for regional properties jumped 11% in Victoria for April compared with March and there was a 16% jump in searches in regional NSW for the corresponding period.&nbsp;But this is down on a year ago, with a 2% fall in Victoria and 1%.</p> <p>Bucking this trend is an overall increase in searches for properties in rural Queensland and Tasmania.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/12/regional-australians-are-just-as-deserving-of-support-as-those-suffering-the-consequences-of-covid-19\">Regional Australians are just as deserving of support as those suffering the consequences of Covid-19 | Pete Mailler</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s too early to tell but it\u2019s logical that people will start to look for houses in regional areas,\u201d Kusher says. \u201cHowever, most businesses will still want people to come into offices a couple of days a week.\u201d</p> <p>That means that towns up to 90 minutes from the CBD with good connections will be more popular than regions such as Warrnambool in Victoria and Orange in NSW, which are both around three hours from capital cities.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cIn Sydney, people will push out to outer areas such as the Blue Mountains and Central Coast. In Victoria, Ballarat, Geelong and Mornington Peninsula could be popular.</p> <p>\u201cPeople from Sydney and Melbourne might also start considering Brisbane and Adelaide because they get on a plane pretty quickly to offices in Melbourne and Sydney.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Rebecca Andrews, 40, of Collingwood, will trial regional living with her boyfriend when overnight stay restrictions lift in Victoria. They have short stays lined up in the Dandenongs, Yarra Valley and Castlemaine \u2013 all places within 90 minutes of the Melbourne CBD. If it works, they\u2019ll move out of the city.&nbsp;</p> <p>Andrews runs a popular events newsletter called The Sprinkler and works as a freelance journalist. She is usually out at several events around Melbourne five or more times a week but the pandemic brought on a major life shift for her. </p> <p>\u201cCovid has definitely influenced my decision to live in the country,\u201d she says. \u201cHaving spent three months in isolation, I\u2019ve been winding down and not feeling the pressure of having to go to social functions and catch up with mates. Since I\u2019ve been at home all the time and slowing down, I\u2019ve found there\u2019s not much need to get energy from huge social things.\u201d</p> <p>Now she wants to spend more time in nature. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge difference between being in a city park and out in the wilderness. You can\u2019t even compare. What\u2019s a city got that I need anymore? I mean I\u2019m 40, I\u2019m not in my 20s \u2013 and although I\u2019m still an extrovert, I\u2019m getting really nice benefits from iso.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CAwFW8chn9T/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

We are using the next few months as a trial in various country towns to see what will work best.\u201d</p> <p>As Andrew\u2019s boyfriend still works in the city, any move will have to be commutable.&nbsp;</p> <p>Daley says one of the common problems with relocation is that it has to work for everyone in the household.</p> <p>\u201cProblems that most households face is that they need to solve two people\u2019s employment and that\u2019s why we have seen much faster growth in major cities than regional centres.\u201d</p> <p>The bulk of households with two people working are more likely to move to the more convenient outer suburbs than a country town, he says.&nbsp;</p> <p>Daley isn\u2019t convinced that regional areas will see a big boost post-pandemic, due in part to migration growth, which is currently negative.</p> <p>Overall , he says, \u201cif regions even held their share of population, they are doing better than they are doing for a long time\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>Those who do move will do so out of financial distress: the unemployed or under-employed who cannot afford to live in a big city.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/research-debunks-claim-australia-may-face-coronavirus-food-shortages\">Research debunks claim Australia may face coronavirus food shortages</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe one thing that may mitigate this [stagnation in regional areas] is unemployment. People live in regions because money goes further. We may see these people either staying in regions \u2013 or perhaps people will move from city to regions because they have less money to spend on rent. And when the economy comes back, they move back to the cities.\u201d</p> <p>So is #cottagecore largely an online fantasy? Daley thinks it\u2019s a normal reaction to an old problem.</p> <p>\u201cIn every plague in human history, the impetus was to escape to the country where there\u2019s lots of space,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Ultimately while some people will be tempted by country life, the numbers will be small \u201ccompared to population growth in Melbourne, which has been huge\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CAwJd5FJgkM/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "It was bang in the middle of the pandemic and Elfy Scott lived \u201cin a dank house\u201d in Sydney\u2019s inner west with housemates. \u201cWe were locked down and having to look at those same four mouldy walls,\u201d she says. The lease was coming to an end, and Scott, 27, and her partner were planning their next move \u2013 to Bondi where rentals were about $600 to $700 a week. But really, they wondered, what was keeping them in Sydney? \u201cWe made the decision to leave because Sydney had shut down and there would be so few social outlets,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a good time to leave, especially since we weren\u2019t sure what would happen with our jobs.\u201d For now, Scott is working from home as a podcast producer and presenter for Junkee media. Scott and her partner made the leap and moved to Austinmer \u2013 about 70km south of Sydney \u2013 and for $480 a week, got a house with absolute beachfront. Now, six weeks into her new regional life, Scott is loving the change. She is getting to know her neighbours and says, \u201cI feel as though being surrounded by nature is so much better for my mental health. In Sydney the quality of the housing is so bad.\u201d Will a pandemic that thrives in urban density combined with ridiculous house prices in Melbourne and Sydney and a revolution in working from home result in a surge of people moving to Australia\u2019s regions? Instagram says yes! This season\u2019s favoured aesthetic on visual-based platforms such as Instagram and Pinterest is #cottagecore: think cute little houses in the country, walks in the woods, collecting flowers and making jam. But the data in Australia is not backing up the cottagecore trend \u2013 yet. John Daley, the chief executive of the Grattan Institute, says it\u2019s too early to know whether the pandemic and a shift towards working from home will create a population boom in regional areas. \u201cThe housing market is frozen but it\u2019s absolutely inevitable that more people are going to work from home, more often,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople have set themselves up and got a second screen. They have got Zoom and learnt how to use that. Now that we have done it for three months, we can see that it works.\u201d But more people working from home doesn\u2019t necessarily translate as more people leaving cities. \u201cThere are not that many jobs that are true freelance jobs \u2013 your clients are disproportionately in the big cities,\u201d he says. If many offices move to a hybrid mix of working-from-home and in the office, \u201cthe regions that will do well out of this are within striking distance of major cities \u2013 because companies will want a presence in the office some of the time\u201d. Cameron Kusher, head of economic research at REA Group \u2013 which includes realestate.com.au \u2013 says that although anecdotally he has heard of people wanting to move to the country, \u201cit\u2019s not showing up much in the data in Victoria and New South Wales\u201d. Searches for regional properties jumped 11% in Victoria for April compared with March and there was a 16% jump in searches in regional NSW for the corresponding period. But this is down on a year ago, with a 2% fall in Victoria and 1%. Bucking this trend is an overall increase in searches for properties in rural Queensland and Tasmania. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to tell but it\u2019s logical that people will start to look for houses in regional areas,\u201d Kusher says. \u201cHowever, most businesses will still want people to come into offices a couple of days a week.\u201d That means that towns up to 90 minutes from the CBD with good connections will be more popular than regions such as Warrnambool in Victoria and Orange in NSW, which are both around three hours from capital cities. \u201cIn Sydney, people will push out to outer areas such as the Blue Mountains and Central Coast. In Victoria, Ballarat, Geelong and Mornington Peninsula could be popular. \u201cPeople from Sydney and Melbourne might also start considering Brisbane and Adelaide because they get on a plane pretty quickly to offices in Melbourne and Sydney.\u201d Rebecca Andrews, 40, of Collingwood, will trial regional living with her boyfriend when overnight stay restrictions lift in Victoria. They have short stays lined up in the Dandenongs, Yarra Valley and Castlemaine \u2013 all places within 90 minutes of the Melbourne CBD. If it works, they\u2019ll move out of the city. Andrews runs a popular events newsletter called The Sprinkler and works as a freelance journalist. She is usually out at several events around Melbourne five or more times a week but the pandemic brought on a major life shift for her. \u201cCovid has definitely influenced my decision to live in the country,\u201d she says. \u201cHaving spent three months in isolation, I\u2019ve been winding down and not feeling the pressure of having to go to social functions and catch up with mates. Since I\u2019ve been at home all the time and slowing down, I\u2019ve found there\u2019s not much need to get energy from huge social things.\u201d Now she wants to spend more time in nature. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge difference between being in a city park and out in the wilderness. You can\u2019t even compare. What\u2019s a city got that I need anymore? I mean I\u2019m 40, I\u2019m not in my 20s \u2013 and although I\u2019m still an extrovert, I\u2019m getting really nice benefits from iso.\u201d In isolation she has transformed her inner-Melbourne house to resemble the nature she\u2019s starting to crave. \u201cMy house is full of plants, it\u2019s like a nursery.\u201d For Andrews and her boyfriend, the \u201cpandemic was a circuit breaker. We are using the next few months as a trial in various country towns to see what will work best.\u201d As Andrew\u2019s boyfriend still works in the city, any move will have to be commutable. Daley says one of the common problems with relocation is that it has to work for everyone in the household. \u201cProblems that most households face is that they need to solve two people\u2019s employment and that\u2019s why we have seen much faster growth in major cities than regional centres.\u201d The bulk of households with two people working are more likely to move to the more convenient outer suburbs than a country town, he says. Daley isn\u2019t convinced that regional areas will see a big boost post-pandemic, due in part to migration growth, which is currently negative. Overall , he says, \u201cif regions even held their share of population, they are doing better than they are doing for a long time\u201d. Those who do move will do so out of financial distress: the unemployed or under-employed who cannot afford to live in a big city. \u201cThe one thing that may mitigate this [stagnation in regional areas] is unemployment. People live in regions because money goes further. We may see these people either staying in regions \u2013 or perhaps people will move from city to regions because they have less money to spend on rent. And when the economy comes back, they move back to the cities.\u201d So is #cottagecore largely an online fantasy? Daley thinks it\u2019s a normal reaction to an old problem. \u201cIn every plague in human history, the impetus was to escape to the country where there\u2019s lots of space,\u201d he says. Ultimately while some people will be tempted by country life, the numbers will be small \u201ccompared to population growth in Melbourne, which has been huge\u201d. Instead, \u201cwe are seeing the resurgence of villages of Melbourne \u2013 suburban hubs have come back pretty quickly\u201d. As people have worked from home over these past few months, they have developed a loyalty to their village, including local cafes and parks, Daley says. \u201cIf anything, links between people and the CBD have become much weaker and the links between people and their local areas are stronger.\u201d Kusher, who lives in an apartment with his partner and small child, predicts there will be a move instead away from inner city apartments and towards townhouses with a bit of space and a backyard. In all this uncertainty, it\u2019s not surprising to see people having a bet both ways.",

Eligible operators also receive the jobkeeper payment, and there is an \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d supplementary payment which can be applied for. The scheme has helped keep three-quarters of operations open according to the government, but has had a negative effect in areas such as family daycare. However, the government has indicated this universal childcare access will be only temporary. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has talked about to a \u201csnap-back\u201d from stimulus spending to pre-coronavirus arrangements. The education minister, Dan Tehan originally said the arrangement could last up to six months, with a review of the scheme planned at the end of June. But more recently he said the scheme had \u201cdone its job\u201d and the old system was effective. The scheme is popular with parents; 36% of people surveyed by Essential Media thought it should continue beyond the its scheduled end date. So given the opportunity to change the way Australia pays for childcare, how much would it cost to make it free to parents permanently, and would that be a good thing? Childcare and early childhood education costs Education department figures provided to the Senate show the temporary free childcare or universal childcare arrangement costs $131m a week.

A less-costly option also modelled by Grattan would be to add $5bn and lift the childcare subsidy to 95% of fees while still maintaining a tapered payment based on means-testing parents. Australian families spend more on childcare than the OECD average, and public funding for childcare and early childhood education is lower than the OECD average: Is universal childcare a good idea? Experts I spoke to said that although making free childcare, or universal childcare, permanent would have beneficial economic and educational outcomes, the implementation would be difficult. Associate Prof Elizabeth Hill is a researcher specialising in the political economy of gender, work and care, and also co-convenor of the Australian work and family policy roundtable, a group of researchers which have argued for increased early childcare and education funding. \u201cThe development of Australia\u2019s early childhood education and care system makes it difficult to suddenly switch to a universal publicly funded system,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t have other options. We can recalibrate the childcare subsidy so that publicly funded early childhood education and care is available to an increasing number of households.\u201d Hill warns that going back to the old system too early could have a negative outcome. \u201cFailure to provide adequate early childhood education and care funding support during the recovery period could lead to a downward spiral in parents\u2019 work participation, as reduced economic security or unemployment could see parents withdraw children from early childhood education and care, which in turn could limit their capacity to find new or more work,\u201d she says. Outside of increasing overall funding, Hill suggests removing the activity test for the childcare subsidy would benefit both during and after the crisis. \u201cIn the Covid recovery, extending universal access and lifting the work activity test will not only support workforce participation, but will also and critically support children from disadvantaged households and will ameliorate inequalities as a result of the crisis,\u201d she says. Kate Griffiths is a researcher at the Grattan Institute and has modelled the cost and economic effect of various changes to childcare funding. \u201cA universal scheme covering 95% of fees would boost GDP by about $27bn [a year] over the medium term through higher workforce participation,\u201d she says. But such a scheme would have a higher upfront cost to the government, and would not be means-tested and so would result in high income earners receiving more than they do under the childcare subsidy. \u201cCheaper options, such as boosting the subsidy to 95% with a simpler, flatter taper would also have significant workforce participation benefits \u2013 $11bn \u2013 and may be more realistic in the current environment,\u201d she says.

      "bodyText": "Making America great again just wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cPresident Trump is making space great again,\u201d the Republican National Committee declared this week. Donald Trump returns to Cape Canaveral in Florida on Saturday to witness the rescheduled launch of a SpaceX rocket carrying Nasa astronauts that was delayed by weather three days earlier. After that anticlimax, the US president will be pinning his hopes on a spectacle loaded with patriotic and political symbolism. Nine years after the space shuttle program fizzled out under Barack Obama, Trump wants to witness astronauts lift off from American soil once again. The mission, billed as \u201cLaunch America\u201d, also offers a welcome diversion from the coronavirus pandemic. Trump may hope that it will boost his optimistic narrative that the country is regaining its swagger \u2013 and show him reaching for the stars even as his earthbound rival Joe Biden stews in his basement. But while the astronauts wear sleek spacesuits and operate touchscreens that point to the future, their adventure is also redolent of the past: nostalgia for an age of perceived American exceptionalism and \u201cwe can do anything\u201d spirit embodied by the Apollo missions to the moon. In Trump\u2019s view, a time when America was \u201cgreat\u201d. \u201cDonald Trump is looking for any symbol of hopefulness and finding a symbol for the 1960s of America\u2019s successes in space is a way for him to connect with a better time in America and make the argument that he is reviving that better time,\u201d said Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota. Human spaceflight, with the potential to plant the Stars and Stripes on new worlds, has a natural appeal to a president who likes big shows of national virility, such as military parades and Fourth of July fireworks, and whose stated cultural touchstones \u2013 Babe Ruth, Alfred E Neuman, Donna Reed \u2013 are from a different era. During his first year in office, Trump signed a directive for Nasa to work with private sector partners for a human return to the moon, followed by a mission to Mars. He re-established the National Space Council, which had been abolished by President Bill Clinton. The president has also created the sixth branch of the armed forces, the Space Force. Receiving its flag earlier this month, he boasted of new military equipment including a \u201csuper-duper missile\u201d. The space force has been widely mocked for its likeness to Star Trek and even inspired a Netflix comedy series, starring Steve Carell, that started on Friday. Trump\u2019s political priorities are evident in other ways. Earlier this month the Reuters news agency reported his administration is drafting a legal blueprint for mining on the moon under a new US-sponsored international agreement called the Artemis Accords. He has eased regulations on private industry space efforts. The launch of a crew by SpaceX \u2013 owned by Elon Musk, also the chief executive of Tesla \u2013 will be the first by a private company rather than a national space agency, which is on-brand for a president who came from the business world. With an eye on the November election, Trump has increasingly sought to downplay the public health toll of the virus and Saturday\u2019s liftoff, which conveniently happens in the swing state of Florida, could reinforce that message in dramatic fashion. Jacobs added: \u201cThe whole operation for Donald Trump is to keep your eyeballs moving away from the reality that we\u2019re in a pandemic and the economy has collapsed. Space travel is America\u2019s little boy\u2019s fascination and, rather than thinking about our current misery, we get to look at the sky and dream of different worlds.\u201d Space is one of the few domains where Democrats and Republicans still regularly cooperate and where public goodwill endures.

      "bodyText": "A rocketship named Dragon breathed new fire into America\u2019s human spaceflight programme on Saturday, carrying two astronauts on a much-anticipated adventure. The launch of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon crew capsule from Florida\u2019s Kennedy Space Center to the International Space Station (ISS) marked the first time since 2011 that humans had blasted off into orbit from US soil. Equally significant, it heralded a new direction for crewed spaceflight, entrepreneur Elon Musk\u2019s company SpaceX becoming the first commercial operator to carry astronauts into space under a public-private partnership set up by Nasa, the American space agency, in 2010. Dragon, atop the powerful nine-engine Falcon rocket, lifted from the launchpad on schedule at 3.22pm ET, creating thick plumes of smoke and fire as it climbed over the Atlantic. \u201cThank you for the first human ride for Falcon 9,\u201d co-commander Doug Hurley said from the flight deck after Dragon reached orbit. \u201cIt was incredible \u2026 appreciate all the hard work and thanks for the great ride to space.\u201d As on Wednesday, when the first attempt at launch was postponed with 17 minutes on the countdown clock, mission managers played cat and mouse with the weather, facing only a 50% chance of a \u201cgo\u201d at daybreak, when thunderstorms, lightning and low clouds stalked Cape Canaveral. This time they caught a break. The Falcon rocket booster, as has become almost routine for SpaceX, returned to Earth after first-stage separation and landed successfully on a recovery ship in the Atlantic for use on a future mission. The capsule reached orbit 12 minutes later, and will spend 19 hours chasing the space station 250 miles above the planet before docking on Sunday. Hurley and Bob Behnken, veterans of space shuttle missions, will join their Nasa colleague Chris Cassidy, already resident with two Russian cosmonauts aboard the ISS. As a test mission paving the way for regular flights of Dragon later this year, every aspect of the spacecraft\u2019s performance will be analyzed by SpaceX engineers. Behnken and Hurley will remain in orbit for up to 120 days. \u201cIt\u2019s been way too long,\u201d Jim Bridenstine, the Nasa administrator, said of the launch. \u201cIt was just an amazing day. I\u2019m breathing a sigh of relief but I won\u2019t be celebrating until Bob and Doug are home safely.\u201d Although the public was urged to watch the launch remotely because of coronavirus restrictions, Donald Trump and his wife Melania, and Vice-President Mike Pence, attended in person. Trump has made space a priority through the foundation of space force as a branch of the US military, independent of Nasa, and the unveiling of his America First National Space Strategy.

It is not just about rule-breaking, it is the glaring contradictions that make nonsense of messages because Cummings is still in there,\u201d said another senior Tory.</p> <p>More than 100 Conservative members of parliament, afraid that they will never be forgiven by their electorates unless they condemn Cummings publicly, have now chosen to criticise him, risking the prime minister\u2019s wrath.</p> <p>The pressure on the prime minister will only mount further. Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of Tory MPs, has already relayed the extent of anger on the Conservative benches to Downing Street. But this week, the 1922 will meet after MPs return to parliament, and the issue is expected to dominate everything.</p> <p>Some Conservatives are doing their best to cool the controversy. Charles Walker, vice-chair of the 1922 Committee, accepts that many are furious, but says there will be more important issues over which the government will have confront the people in months and years to come. \u201cIf people are very angry at the actions of Dominic Cummings, then that anger is probably only a harbinger of the greater rage to come when the forthcoming recession, or heaven forbid depression, starts to bite,\u201d Walker says. \u201cThen the actions of a worried father will be secondary to the reality of lost businesses, jobs and homes.\u201d</p> <p>Other Conservatives vainly try to claim the fuss is being whipped up by bitter and twisted leftwing and liberal Remainers who want revenge on Cummings for delivering Brexit for Johnson.</p> <p>But saying that it is all politically motivated does not fit with the evidence, and most Tories know that. Our Opinium poll today shows that 81% of all voters think Cummings broke the rules, and that 52% of Tory supporters think he should resign. Almost half of 2019 Tory voters say their respect for the government they voted in has been reduced by the Cummings fiasco.</p> <p>Writing in today\u2019s <em>Observer</em> the Tory hardline Brexiter Peter Bone calls again for Cummings to go and dismisses the idea that it is Remainers stirring trouble. \u201cThe saga is now preventing the government from being able to get their message out clearly,\u201d he writes. \u201cEvery announcement on changes to the lockdown rules, track and trace, and government support, is bogged down with questions about Mr Cummings.\u201d</p> <p>Bone adds: \u201cI believe that Mr Cummings did break the rules. Now, if he had accepted that he had done something wrong, and apologised for it, as a fair-minded person, I would have thought that that would be the end of it. It is the insistence that he did not break the rules and the refusal to apologise that has outraged so many.\u201d</p> <p>On Thursday, as Johnson tried desperately to take stories about Dominic Cummings off the front pages and news bulletins, he announced his plans to ease the lockdown by allowing up to six people to meet outside or in each others\u2019 gardens. They could enjoy barbecues together in the hot weather, he said. The announcement surprised many at high levels of government as they had not expected the loosening to be confirmed so soon. Some suspected it had been brought forward to distract from the Cummings row.</p> <p>Now Johnson is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/29/covid-19-spreading-too-fast-to-lift-uk-lockdown-sage-adviser\">facing new criticism for easing the lockdown too soon</a> and risking a second wave of infections. As The <em>Observer</em> reports today, a group of 27 leading public health experts is warning that his refusal to sack Cummings, and his reliance on systems for track and trace that may not be ready, is a dangerous combination that has seriously undermined trust in government.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This incident will make this challenge even harder for the government to clearly communicate and explain lockdown rules</p> <footer> <cite>Shona Hilton, University of Glasgow</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Other scientists add that the Cummings affair has blown a hole in the government\u2019s messaging. Shona Hilton, professor of public health policy at the University of Glasgow, said: \u201cIn the weeks and months ahead, communicating the easing of lockdown restrictions is going to be a&nbsp;significant&nbsp;challenge requiring public trust in&nbsp;our&nbsp;leaders. This incident will make this challenge even harder for the government to clearly communicate and explain these rules.&nbsp;Politicians should not underestimate this challenge or take public support for granted.\u201d</p> <p>Stephen Griffin, a virologist and associate professor at Leeds University, agreed: \u201cThere has only been a very gradual decline in numbers of new cases of Covid-19 being reported each day. We are still getting them in their thousands and it is going to be very hard to test and trace new cases in those sorts of numbers. The margin for error is going to be very slight. And then Cummings does this. It was shocking. The message that we should just move on is not correct. We need to be led by example and not by allowing exceptions like this.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Tories are falling fast in the polls. Their lead stood at 26 points over Labour at the end of March but is now down to four points. On Friday, a petition calling for Cummings to be sacked had gained over one million signatures. Our poll today shows 68% of people think he should resign and if he doesn\u2019t 66% want Johnson to sack him. On Monday, Johnson said he had made clear his position on his adviser and that it was now up to the public to decide its view. It seems the public has now done so but, as yet, there is no sign the prime minister is listening.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Key English election battlegrounds in the north-west and Midlands will be severely exposed to a double economic hit from Brexit and coronavirus should the UK fail to secure an EU trade deal by the end of the year, new analysis has warned. Boris Johnson has continued to rule out any extension to Britain\u2019s EU transition deal, which expires from January. It comes despite a deadlock in talks about a future trade deal, before the final round of talks this week. However, an impact assessment of ending the transition period found that manufacturing, banking, finance and insurance sectors would be \u201cseverely exposed\u201d to a double economic hit from Brexit and coronavirus. The Social Market Foundation analysis divided the country into areas and then placed each in a category between 1 and 5, with 5 representing those most exposed to a double hit. Half of those in the north-west are in category 5 and a further 40% in category 4. It said that the West Midlands, where the Tories made major gains in last year\u2019s election, was also exposed. There have already been warnings that new border arrangements in the Irish Sea will not be ready by Johnson\u2019s end-of-year deadline, but Downing Street is adamant that the transition period, which gives Britain access to the EU\u2019s single market, will not be extended. James Kirkup, the SMF director, said: \u201cIn some cases and some places, that double impact will be severe.
