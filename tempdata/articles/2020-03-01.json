      "bodyText": "Australia has recorded its first death from Covid-19 after authorities confirmed a man in his late 70s died at a Perth hospital on Sunday. The Western Australian chief health officer, Andrew Robertson, said the man was in an intensive care unit when he died in the early hours of Sunday morning. The man\u2019s wife was diagnosed with the coronavirus a few days ago and is now in a stable condition, he added. Asked if the man\u2019s age or prior health had been a factor, Robertson noted people of his age were more \u201clikely to have other chronic conditions\u201d which could make it harder to fight off the disease. The man was diagnosed at Howard Springs, Northern Territory, about 10 days ago. \u201cThere is no risk to general community or to staff,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cHe was in a negative pressure room and then in intensive care.\u201d The couple were among more than 150 Australians who were isolated on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. The man\u2019s family had managed to speak with him on Saturday night through an isolation window before his death on Sunday morning. Robertson said he was concerned about people panicking, saying \u201cwe need to make the point very clear there isn\u2019t community spread in Australia\u201d. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change anything for the status of coronavirus,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cWe always knew it would be a serious virus, especially for the elderly.\u201d \u201cThis very tragic case is related to the Diamond Princess, so the community shouldn\u2019t be panicking at this stage,\u201d he added. Confirmation of the first Australian death came as the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, said it was \u201cnot possible\u201d to extend a travel ban to all countries affected by the rapidly spreading coronavirus, as he defended the government\u2019s decision to restrict travel from Iran, but not South Korea where more cases have been reported. With the government preparing for a global pandemic of the virus and fresh cases of exposure being reported on the Gold Coast and New South Wales over the weekend from people returning from Iran, Dutton said the government believed Iran should be included in the ban because the data coming out of the country was not reliable. \u201cIf you look at the underreporting or the lack of reporting coming out of Iran to start with \u2026 there was a real concern as to whether they had a handle on the numbers,\u201d Dutton told the ABC\u2019s Insiders program on Sunday. \u201cObviously, South Korea has a more advanced health system and they have been reporting numbers for a period of time. So I think they are key differences between those different markets,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the chief medical officer has pointed out, it\u2019s not possible to extend the ban to every country, and we\u2019ll see what phase we move into next.\u201d There have been 388 cases of the virus reported out of Iran, compared to 2,300 in South Korea, but Iran has recorded 43 of the 106 deaths that have occurred outside of China. Worldwide, more than 85,000 are reported to have the virus, with more than 2,900 deaths across 58 countries. On Sunday, a man in his 40s who had recently travelled to Iran became the fifth person in NSW to be diagnosed with the coronavirus, and the second diagnosed after recent travel to Iran. A Gold Coast woman is the other case, with health authorities attempting to track down about 40 people who attended appointments with the 63-year-old beautician at the Hair Plus salon at Australia Fair at Southport before she was diagnosed with the virus and isolated. The new travel restrictions, announced on Sunday, will mean Australian citizens, permanent residents and their immediate family will be required to self-isolate at home for 14 days from the day they left Iran, while foreign nationals will be banned from entering Australia for 14 days since they left the country. The NSW chief health officer, Kerry Chant, said travellers from Iran needed to be \u201cparticularly vigilant\u201d for symptoms, given the rapid increase in the virus activity in recent days. The travel ban also remains in place for China, with the decision preventing the arrival of an estimated 4,000 Chinese foreign nationals each day. The tourism and education sectors are most affected. The health minister, Greg Hunt, has asked the Australian health protection principal committee to consider whether the government has the appropriate level of travel advice in place for Italy, which has seen an outbreak of the virus and so far recorded eight deaths. \u201cI have specifically asked them today to consider whether or not the current arrangements need to be changed in any way, shape or form,\u201d he said.",

However, the virus appears much more infectious than Sars, and consequently has already resulted in a higher number of deaths worldwide.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>In liberal democracies, governments have to rely far more on changes in individual behaviour to slow the virus\u2019s march</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is where the challenge comes: slowing its spread depends on taking disruptive action, particularly in light of the fact that not all carriers will experience easily identifiable symptoms. After the virus took hold in Hubei province, the Chinese government took drastic measures to try to stop its spread across the rest of China, imposing strict quarantine measures, shutting down whole cities and transport networks. More than <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/02/21/806958341/restrictions-and-rewards-how-china-is-locking-down-half-a-billion-citizens?t=1582977223872?t=1582977223872&amp;t=1582992646011\" title=\"\">half a billion people</a> have had severe restrictions imposed on their movement; in Hubei province, residents are forbidden from leaving their apartments without prior permission and many community officials are buying and delivering food and medicines for citizens under quarantine. In some areas of China, local government is offering financial rewards for citizens who tell on those who have failed to report their own travel to infected areas, or who turn in those who have a fever.</p> <p>Few countries would impose restrictions this draconian: in liberal democracies governments have to rely far more on changes in individual behaviour to slow the virus\u2019s march. Hence the emphasis in the UK is on self-isolation for those who have travelled to affected areas, and clear public health advice aimed at improving individual hygiene. It is hoped that this will prevent transmission and protect those who are more vulnerable to severe and potentially fatal symptoms.</p> <p>Employer decisions will also be critical. People are more likely to follow official advice to self-isolate at home if they are entitled to sick pay, even if they are showing no symptoms of disease. Last Wednesday the health secretary, Matt Hancock, told employers that any staff asked to self-isolate are entitled to take sick leave. However, employment experts have said that employers are not necessarily legally bound by this, so some of this will come down to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/26/coronavirus-uk-will-paid-take-sick-leave\" title=\"\">individual business decisions</a>. With suggestions that schools might need to close for up to two months if the virus infects large numbers of people, the government will also need to issue advice for what employers should do about parents whose children need to remain at home. It may need to make emergency support available to prevent small businesses collapsing. It will certainly need a medium-term plan for responding to the economic consequences of a pandemic; amid concerns about a global recession, global stockmarkets lost \u00a33.9tn in value last week.</p> <p>Health officials have warned that there have been serious issues in the response so far. GPs have reported that public health advice has been unclear: patients who have travelled back from at-risk countries have not been given information about what to do if they develop symptoms on arrival at airports; local health authorities have been refusing to suspend online GP booking services, resulting in patients presenting at surgeries with symptoms and potentially putting other patients at risk; and the NHS\u2019s 111 telephone line has been giving the wrong advice to visit a GP. Meanwhile, two senior NHS leaders have told the <em>Observer</em> that the NHS would struggle to cope with a major outbreak of Covid-19 as a result of a lack of high-dependency beds and specialist respiratory wards. While the long-term health risk of contracting the virus appears to be low, it could have profound knock-on impacts on people\u2019s health as a result of cancelled operations and clinics. School closures could significantly reduce medical staff availability. Any pandemic would inevitably place huge pressures on the health service, but a decade of underfunding has left it vulnerable, understaffed and stretched beyond capacity.</p> <p>More broadly, there has been a complete failure of leadership on the part of the government. At a time when public panic could spread, people need reassurance that there are plans in place to deal with a pandemic. But as the alarming headlines and media reports increase, ministers have delayed appearing on key national news programmes that reach a wide public audience, and it took Boris Johnson days after the first British cases emerged to give a statement to the BBC. It echoes his failure to visit flood-hit areas of the country in recent weeks.</p> <p>The reaction of the government, of individuals and employers will determine how quickly the virus spreads, and therefore its long-term impact on the health and economic wellbeing of the nation. We should also not lose sight of the fact that experts have long warned that a pandemic of this sort would eventually happen without tougher worldwide measures to minimise the risk of zoonotic viruses being transmitted to humans. After this outbreak is over, there needs to be stronger global action to reduce the risk of these outbreaks in the first place.</p>",

After the virus took hold in Hubei province, the Chinese government took drastic measures to try to stop its spread across the rest of China, imposing strict quarantine measures, shutting down whole cities and transport networks. More than half a billion people have had severe restrictions imposed on their movement; in Hubei province, residents are forbidden from leaving their apartments without prior permission and many community officials are buying and delivering food and medicines for citizens under quarantine. In some areas of China, local government is offering financial rewards for citizens who tell on those who have failed to report their own travel to infected areas, or who turn in those who have a fever. Few countries would impose restrictions this draconian: in liberal democracies governments have to rely far more on changes in individual behaviour to slow the virus\u2019s march. Hence the emphasis in the UK is on self-isolation for those who have travelled to affected areas, and clear public health advice aimed at improving individual hygiene. It is hoped that this will prevent transmission and protect those who are more vulnerable to severe and potentially fatal symptoms. Employer decisions will also be critical. People are more likely to follow official advice to self-isolate at home if they are entitled to sick pay, even if they are showing no symptoms of disease. Last Wednesday the health secretary, Matt Hancock, told employers that any staff asked to self-isolate are entitled to take sick leave. However, employment experts have said that employers are not necessarily legally bound by this, so some of this will come down to individual business decisions. With suggestions that schools might need to close for up to two months if the virus infects large numbers of people, the government will also need to issue advice for what employers should do about parents whose children need to remain at home. It may need to make emergency support available to prevent small businesses collapsing. It will certainly need a medium-term plan for responding to the economic consequences of a pandemic; amid concerns about a global recession, global stockmarkets lost \u00a33.9tn in value last week. Health officials have warned that there have been serious issues in the response so far. GPs have reported that public health advice has been unclear: patients who have travelled back from at-risk countries have not been given information about what to do if they develop symptoms on arrival at airports; local health authorities have been refusing to suspend online GP booking services, resulting in patients presenting at surgeries with symptoms and potentially putting other patients at risk; and the NHS\u2019s 111 telephone line has been giving the wrong advice to visit a GP. Meanwhile, two senior NHS leaders have told the Observer that the NHS would struggle to cope with a major outbreak of Covid-19 as a result of a lack of high-dependency beds and specialist respiratory wards. While the long-term health risk of contracting the virus appears to be low, it could have profound knock-on impacts on people\u2019s health as a result of cancelled operations and clinics. School closures could significantly reduce medical staff availability. Any pandemic would inevitably place huge pressures on the health service, but a decade of underfunding has left it vulnerable, understaffed and stretched beyond capacity. More broadly, there has been a complete failure of leadership on the part of the government. At a time when public panic could spread, people need reassurance that there are plans in place to deal with a pandemic. But as the alarming headlines and media reports increase, ministers have delayed appearing on key national news programmes that reach a wide public audience, and it took Boris Johnson days after the first British cases emerged to give a statement to the BBC. It echoes his failure to visit flood-hit areas of the country in recent weeks. The reaction of the government, of individuals and employers will determine how quickly the virus spreads, and therefore its long-term impact on the health and economic wellbeing of the nation. We should also not lose sight of the fact that experts have long warned that a pandemic of this sort would eventually happen without tougher worldwide measures to minimise the risk of zoonotic viruses being transmitted to humans. After this outbreak is over, there needs to be stronger global action to reduce the risk of these outbreaks in the first place.",

Wearing a facemask underneath a baseball cap, he quickly records a video while driving. \u201cI\u2019m on the road and someone, I don\u2019t know, state security, has started chasing me,\u201d he says breathlessly. \u201cI\u2019m driving very fast. Help me.\u201d</p> <p>Later, Li posts a live stream of himself in an apartment, waiting for those same agents to knock on his door, probably to detain him. In an impassioned monologue, he explains why he quit a stable job at China\u2019s state broadcaster, CCTV, and how he came to Wuhan on his own.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to remain silent, or shut my eyes and ears. It\u2019s not that I can\u2019t have a nice life, with a wife and kids. I can. I\u2019m doing this because I hope more young people can, like me, stand up,\u201d he says. The live stream, posted on Weibo, where it was later deleted, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJHUpBCNKrZwBhxfcIrP8Aw\" title=\"\">and on YouTube</a>, shows two men in plain clothes entering the apartment and then cuts out.</p> <p>As the number of new coronavirus infections inside China has slowed, authorities say the outbreak will reach its peak by the end of the month and any economic shock caused by an almost two-month nationwide shutdown will be limited. The propaganda machine has gone into overdrive, highlighting the government\u2019s handling and the hard work of health workers and citizens.</p> <p>But for many, especially young people like Li, the damage is done. A growing number have not only become disenchanted with their government, ruled by the powerful Communist party, but are calling for changes such as free speech and government accountability. Some are calling it a political awakening \u2013 a provocative term in a country where any sign of dissent is quickly shut down.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"60dbf4e1dc62fd5ec5596f38c517b16de511ece2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60dbf4e1dc62fd5ec5596f38c517b16de511ece2/752_0_977_1221/800.jpg\" alt=\"Li Zehua\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Li has not been heard from since he livestreamed the arrival of \u201ctwo large guys\u201d outside an apartment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: YouTube</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIn the past, I was afraid of running into trouble so I didn\u2019t speak up much. Now I will speak out much more,\u201d said Krejerk Liu, 30, who runs a bar in Beijing. He posts articles and opinions online and is increasingly critical of the government. \u201cFor me, being awake means I must keep speaking and keep seeing.\u201d</p> <p>More than 2,000 people have died from the virus in China, which has infected almost 80,000. Almost every citizen has been affected whether in Wuhan struggling to save a family member amid overrun hospitals, labyrinthine bureaucracy and supply shortages, or quarantined at home, worried about the virus and when their lives can return to normal. Anger at the authorities has only solidified, helped by a steady stream of accounts of desperate families and health workers in Wuhan, allegations of corruption among state-run charities, and videos and <a href=\"https://qz.com/1807151/chinas-peoples-war-against-coronavirus-revives-memories-of-mao/\" title=\"\">photos of ordinary residents</a> abused by local authorities in the name of epidemic prevention.</p> <p>The financial news outlet Caixin reported last week that authorities had ordered the destruction of samples collected from infected patients in December \u2013 and the loss of valuable information about the virus. Health commission officials also ordered scientists to stop testing, and institutions not to release information. </p> <p>\u201cThe epidemic has exposed this country completely in its corruption, bureaucracy, information control and censorship,\u201d said Phillip Wu, 25, a freelance writer in Beijing. </p> <p>For many, the turning point came on 6 February, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/06/li-wenliang-coronavirus-whistleblower-doctor-profile\" title=\"\">Li Wenliang</a>, a doctor-turned-whistleblower \u2013 and national hero \u2013 died from the virus that he had tried to warn colleagues about. Many see themselves in Li, a regular citizen who was punished by police for trying to speak out. One of his last comments \u2013 that \u201ca healthy society should have more than one voice\u201d \u2013 has become a mantra for continued calls for free speech.</p> <p>\u201cLi Wenliang\u2019s death was an earthquake that actually almost brought people out to the streets. It\u2019s a shame we couldn\u2019t,\u201d said Meredith Yang, 27, who lives in Wuhan and commemorated him alone in a park, throwing a flower into a pond. \u201cI thought: \u2018Why are good, decent people treated this way and those who control this state machine are safe?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Internet users have devised new ways to evade censors, including posting photographs of pieces of text and marking up the images. Some are teaching others about how to use virtual private networks (VPNs) to get over China\u2019s Great Fire Wall and access blocked foreign sites. An army of volunteers has been <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/world/china-journalism-coronavirus/\" title=\"\">preserving and organising</a> videos, testimonies and reports by Chinese media.</p> <p>\u201cWhenever you see a post that is at all critical of the government, your first instinct isn\u2019t to read it but to immediately take a screenshot. I guess you could say this is the \u2018weapon of the weak\u2019 right now,\u201d said Deng, 24, an anthropology student from Guiyang in the south-west.</p> <p>More are turning to encrypted platforms such as Telegram and Signal to voice opinions that would probably get their WeChat accounts shut down. A graphic passed around on WeChat included the QR codes for Telegram and Github, used to archive content censored within China, with the words: \u201cWithout free speech there is no point in speaking.\u201d </p> <p>On Douban, a discussion forum, users frustrated with their posts being deleted called for a boycott under the hashtag: \u201cI don\u2019t understand, I don\u2019t support\u201d \u2013 a reference to the statement police forced Li Wenliang to sign, promising not to \u201cspread rumours\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cNever before have I seen any other issue awaken ordinary people like this. People now know freedom of speech is the basis of protecting society. We can call this a seed \u2013 a formidable and vital seed,\u201d said Hu Jia, a veteran civil rights activist based in Beijing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"50eb25ec76b52dbd900ea53daf729614c60394e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50eb25ec76b52dbd900ea53daf729614c60394e2/0_186_5572_3344/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A delivery man gets food from a supermarket worker from across a barbed wire in Beijing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A delivery man gets food from a supermarket worker from across a barbed wire in Beijing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wu Hong/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Episodes of public outrage are not uncommon in China, but criticism of the political system, which has become even more centralised under Xi Jinping, is normally rare among the public. Over the past month, a 2017 book called <em>The Institutional Logic of Governance in China: An Organizational Approach </em>by Zhou Xueguang, a professor at Stanford, has suddenly become popular.</p> <p>In an interview translated into Chinese but later blocked, Zhou blamed country\u2019s top-down decision-making. \u201cThis is not only an outbreak of a novel virus; it\u2019s also a manifestation of the breakdown of China\u2019s governance structures,\u201d he said. \u201cThe crisis has exposed the cracks in the system.\u201d</p> <p>Aware of these fissures, Zhao Kezhi, the minister of public security, said at a meeting last week that the country must \u201cprioritise the maintenance of political security\u201d during the epidemic and guard against \u201cdisruptive activities carried out by hostile forces at home and abroad\u201d.</p> <p>Officials have launched a \u201cpositive energy\u201d propaganda drive, ranging from pledges from senior leaders, including Xi, to donate personal funds to help fight the virus, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/21/coronavirus-kills-wuhan-doctor-hundreds-infected-china-prisons\" title=\"\">emotive stories about the sacrifices</a> of frontline medics. The effort has fallen flat. Internet users responded with such scorn to two recent mascots created by the Communist Youth League that the campaign was dropped.</p> <p>\u201cThey feel deeply that this time really could lead to a bigger problem for them,\u201d said Hu Jia, referring to China\u2019s top leaders. \u201cA thousand-mile dyke can collapse because of one ant-hole. They are afraid this will be the crack that causes the whole dam to break.\u201d </p> <p>Activists and critics say the prospect of protests on the street is still remote, but China\u2019s leaders, aware of the dangerous potential, are moving quickly to shut down this wave of public discontent. After a brief window of openness for Chinese media, censors have begun to crack down again. Two other citizen journalists in Wuhan, Chen Qiushi and Fang Bin, have gone missing while legal scholar Xu Zhiyong, who called Xi \u201cclueless\u201d<a href=\"https://www.chinafile.com/reporting-opinion/viewpoint/dear-chairman-xi-its-time-you-go\" title=\"\"> in an open letter</a> and asked him to step down, has been detained.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/02/coronavirus-deathsbyage/giv-3902CvN4LGTye0po/\" data-alt=\"Coronavirus\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/02/coronavirus-deathsbyage/giv-3902CvN4LGTye0po/\">Coronavirus</a> </figure>  <p>But more repression may not work. \u201cPublic anger at the government is much bigger than in any earlier crises, and the anger could grow when the economic fallout of the epidemic fully unfolds,\u201d said Ho-Fung Hung, a professor in political economy at Johns Hopkins University.</p> <p>\u201cOne thing for sure is that the social stability contract that has worked for so long \u2013 that the people tolerate the authoritarian rule so far as the government warrants economic prosperity and provides good governance \u2013 is broken in a big way,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Li Zehua, who went to Wuhan in hopes of following in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/10/coronavirus-journalist-missing-in-wuhan-as-anger-towards-chinese-authorities-grows\" title=\"\">footsteps of disappeared journalist Chen Qiushi</a>, has yet to resurface. Li started a \u201cself media\u201d channel called Disobedience TV in 2018 and is sometimes criticised as naive or emotional. </p> <p>Yet he is also realistic.

      "bodyText": "Li Zehua, 25, a citizen journalist in Wuhan, is being chased. Wearing a facemask underneath a baseball cap, he quickly records a video while driving. \u201cI\u2019m on the road and someone, I don\u2019t know, state security, has started chasing me,\u201d he says breathlessly. \u201cI\u2019m driving very fast. Help me.\u201d Later, Li posts a live stream of himself in an apartment, waiting for those same agents to knock on his door, probably to detain him. In an impassioned monologue, he explains why he quit a stable job at China\u2019s state broadcaster, CCTV, and how he came to Wuhan on his own. \u201cI don\u2019t want to remain silent, or shut my eyes and ears. It\u2019s not that I can\u2019t have a nice life, with a wife and kids. I can. I\u2019m doing this because I hope more young people can, like me, stand up,\u201d he says. The live stream, posted on Weibo, where it was later deleted, and on YouTube, shows two men in plain clothes entering the apartment and then cuts out. As the number of new coronavirus infections inside China has slowed, authorities say the outbreak will reach its peak by the end of the month and any economic shock caused by an almost two-month nationwide shutdown will be limited. The propaganda machine has gone into overdrive, highlighting the government\u2019s handling and the hard work of health workers and citizens. But for many, especially young people like Li, the damage is done. A growing number have not only become disenchanted with their government, ruled by the powerful Communist party, but are calling for changes such as free speech and government accountability. Some are calling it a political awakening \u2013 a provocative term in a country where any sign of dissent is quickly shut down. \u201cIn the past, I was afraid of running into trouble so I didn\u2019t speak up much. Now I will speak out much more,\u201d said Krejerk Liu, 30, who runs a bar in Beijing. He posts articles and opinions online and is increasingly critical of the government. \u201cFor me, being awake means I must keep speaking and keep seeing.\u201d More than 2,000 people have died from the virus in China, which has infected almost 80,000. Almost every citizen has been affected whether in Wuhan struggling to save a family member amid overrun hospitals, labyrinthine bureaucracy and supply shortages, or quarantined at home, worried about the virus and when their lives can return to normal. Anger at the authorities has only solidified, helped by a steady stream of accounts of desperate families and health workers in Wuhan, allegations of corruption among state-run charities, and videos and photos of ordinary residents abused by local authorities in the name of epidemic prevention. The financial news outlet Caixin reported last week that authorities had ordered the destruction of samples collected from infected patients in December \u2013 and the loss of valuable information about the virus. Health commission officials also ordered scientists to stop testing, and institutions not to release information. \u201cThe epidemic has exposed this country completely in its corruption, bureaucracy, information control and censorship,\u201d said Phillip Wu, 25, a freelance writer in Beijing. For many, the turning point came on 6 February, when Li Wenliang, a doctor-turned-whistleblower \u2013 and national hero \u2013 died from the virus that he had tried to warn colleagues about. Many see themselves in Li, a regular citizen who was punished by police for trying to speak out. One of his last comments \u2013 that \u201ca healthy society should have more than one voice\u201d \u2013 has become a mantra for continued calls for free speech. \u201cLi Wenliang\u2019s death was an earthquake that actually almost brought people out to the streets. It\u2019s a shame we couldn\u2019t,\u201d said Meredith Yang, 27, who lives in Wuhan and commemorated him alone in a park, throwing a flower into a pond. \u201cI thought: \u2018Why are good, decent people treated this way and those who control this state machine are safe?\u2019\u201d Internet users have devised new ways to evade censors, including posting photographs of pieces of text and marking up the images. Some are teaching others about how to use virtual private networks (VPNs) to get over China\u2019s Great Fire Wall and access blocked foreign sites. An army of volunteers has been preserving and organising videos, testimonies and reports by Chinese media. \u201cWhenever you see a post that is at all critical of the government, your first instinct isn\u2019t to read it but to immediately take a screenshot. I guess you could say this is the \u2018weapon of the weak\u2019 right now,\u201d said Deng, 24, an anthropology student from Guiyang in the south-west. More are turning to encrypted platforms such as Telegram and Signal to voice opinions that would probably get their WeChat accounts shut down. A graphic passed around on WeChat included the QR codes for Telegram and Github, used to archive content censored within China, with the words: \u201cWithout free speech there is no point in speaking.\u201d On Douban, a discussion forum, users frustrated with their posts being deleted called for a boycott under the hashtag: \u201cI don\u2019t understand, I don\u2019t support\u201d \u2013 a reference to the statement police forced Li Wenliang to sign, promising not to \u201cspread rumours\u201d. \u201cNever before have I seen any other issue awaken ordinary people like this. People now know freedom of speech is the basis of protecting society. We can call this a seed \u2013 a formidable and vital seed,\u201d said Hu Jia, a veteran civil rights activist based in Beijing. Episodes of public outrage are not uncommon in China, but criticism of the political system, which has become even more centralised under Xi Jinping, is normally rare among the public. Over the past month, a 2017 book called The Institutional Logic of Governance in China: An Organizational Approach by Zhou Xueguang, a professor at Stanford, has suddenly become popular. In an interview translated into Chinese but later blocked, Zhou blamed country\u2019s top-down decision-making. \u201cThis is not only an outbreak of a novel virus; it\u2019s also a manifestation of the breakdown of China\u2019s governance structures,\u201d he said. \u201cThe crisis has exposed the cracks in the system.\u201d Aware of these fissures, Zhao Kezhi, the minister of public security, said at a meeting last week that the country must \u201cprioritise the maintenance of political security\u201d during the epidemic and guard against \u201cdisruptive activities carried out by hostile forces at home and abroad\u201d. Officials have launched a \u201cpositive energy\u201d propaganda drive, ranging from pledges from senior leaders, including Xi, to donate personal funds to help fight the virus, to emotive stories about the sacrifices of frontline medics. The effort has fallen flat. Internet users responded with such scorn to two recent mascots created by the Communist Youth League that the campaign was dropped. \u201cThey feel deeply that this time really could lead to a bigger problem for them,\u201d said Hu Jia, referring to China\u2019s top leaders. \u201cA thousand-mile dyke can collapse because of one ant-hole. They are afraid this will be the crack that causes the whole dam to break.\u201d Activists and critics say the prospect of protests on the street is still remote, but China\u2019s leaders, aware of the dangerous potential, are moving quickly to shut down this wave of public discontent. After a brief window of openness for Chinese media, censors have begun to crack down again. Two other citizen journalists in Wuhan, Chen Qiushi and Fang Bin, have gone missing while legal scholar Xu Zhiyong, who called Xi \u201cclueless\u201d in an open letter and asked him to step down, has been detained. But more repression may not work. \u201cPublic anger at the government is much bigger than in any earlier crises, and the anger could grow when the economic fallout of the epidemic fully unfolds,\u201d said Ho-Fung Hung, a professor in political economy at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cOne thing for sure is that the social stability contract that has worked for so long \u2013 that the people tolerate the authoritarian rule so far as the government warrants economic prosperity and provides good governance \u2013 is broken in a big way,\u201d he said. Li Zehua, who went to Wuhan in hopes of following in the footsteps of disappeared journalist Chen Qiushi, has yet to resurface. Li started a \u201cself media\u201d channel called Disobedience TV in 2018 and is sometimes criticised as naive or emotional. Yet he is also realistic. He says in his last video posting: \u201cThis isn\u2019t about starting some kind of uprising.. That\u2019s not it. I know idealism died that year, that spring\u201d \u2013 an oblique reference to the wave of protests violently put down across China in 1989.

Claude O\u2019Donovan, 81, remembered listening to the McCarthy hearings on the radio. \u201cCommunism was a muddy thing at the time,\u201d he said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have the charisma to make the argument.\u201d Now he takes the Democrats\u2019 shift to the left seriously. \u201cToday it\u2019s a real threat. Bernie Sanders can say he\u2019s a \u2018democratic socialist\u2019 but that\u2019s just an acronym for communist. It\u2019s communism without a gun. In this day and age, I would never have thought we\u2019d have socialism become so dominant in the country.\u201d O\u2019Donovan, from Aiken, South Carolina, turned up wearing a \u201cTrump\u201d cap and a Santa Claus costume \u2013 a hobby of his. \u201cSanta gave things at Christmas to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ. These people want us to give everything from cradle to grave and it can\u2019t be done. We can\u2019t print money.\u201d What if Sanders is elected? \u201cWe would crash almost immediately. It would be disastrous.\u201d Asked the same question, Ronald Solomon, 60, a retailer of Trump merchandise from Las Vegas, replied: \u201cThe guy\u2019s a certified nut and the world would be hurt. The last place to go for real freedom would be destroyed by a radical socialist. Any place they\u2019ve decided to go down that road has resulted in a stagnating middle class, a collapse of business and people forced to break into zoos to feed themselves.\u201d Sanders\u2019 brand of democratic socialism is more Scandinavian than Soviet, seeking to expand publicly funded education and healthcare and tackle inequality. He has been endorsed by Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 30, and dominates among young Democratic voters. Victoria Spiotto, a 21-year-old student from Ashburn, Virginia, was having none of it. \u201cFor me, socialism is a completely destructive ideology and system,\u201d she said. \u201cI think a lot of young people are ready for it but most Americans don\u2019t trust it. You have people from Venezuela and Cuba who speak out about it and tell the truth of the situation.\u201d Numerous students were sporting T-shirts that said, \u201cKiss me, I\u2019m a capitalist\u201d coupled with images of shamrocks ahead of St Patrick\u2019s Day. Among them was Salicia Bayes, 21, from Lansing in Michigan. \u201cI have a lot of friends from Venezuela and just hearing their stories is terrifying,\u201d she said. \u201cEven a lot of people in the Democratic party are not going to vote for Sanders.\u201d Others questioned how Sanders would pay for his ambitious reforms. Robert Douglas, 86, a neurologist from Pensacola, Florida wearing a \u201cKeep America great\u201d cap, said: \u201cYou can\u2019t justify Medicare for all: it will cost $30tn. What about the green new deal? We\u2019re talking about $60tn for that. JFK was the last moderate Democrat in my lifetime: he was not for big government.\u201d On Friday, British rightwing politician Nigel Farage urged attendees to donate to Sanders\u2019 campaign, predicted that his nomination would guarantee victory for Trump and could enable Republicans to regain the House. Some agreed with that analysis. Shea Justice, 19, a student from Arlington, Massachusetts, said: \u201cWe\u2019re calling it right now: Bernie Sanders is the next Jeremy Corbyn.\u201d Although Sanders made for an obvious and satisfying target, he was seen as symptomatic of a deeper shift in the Democratic party. A former New York police officer who goes by the name of Grizzly Joe said: \u201cThey\u2019re all just different degrees of socialism, saying the same stuff in a different way. At least Bernie is honest about it. \u201cThey want free this, free that. They\u2019re telling their base, whoever that is \u2013 the morons that vote for them \u2013 that we\u2019ll give you free stuff. It\u2019s not physically possible.\u201d In a speech on Thursday, Vice-President Mike Pence summed up: \u201cToday\u2019s Democratic party has been taken over by radical leftists who want higher taxes, open borders and late-term abortion. \u201cThere are no moderates in this Democratic field. Every other one of the Democrats running for president embraces Bernie\u2019s democratic socialism.\u201d",

Judging by recent attacks from his detractors \u2013 Democratic ones, not Trump supporters \u2013 that is the political equivalent of carrying the coronavirus.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what it adds up to,\u201d said Pete Buttigieg, his rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, at this week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/25/democratic-debate-south-carolina-bernie-sanders-mike-bloomberg-joe-biden\">TV debate</a> ahead of Saturday\u2019s primary in South Carolina. Buttigieg referenced Sanders\u2019 \u201cradical\u201d policies of universal tax-funded healthcare, debt-free college tuition and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2019/nov/29/what-is-the-green-new-deal\">Green New Deal</a> to tackle the climate crisis, then said: \u201cIt adds up to four more years of Donald Trump.\u201d</p> <p>On Tuesday Sanders has the chance to take his political insurgency and wipe it across the nation. In the 2020 cycle, Super Tuesday is even more super-charged than usual, providing him with an opportunity to take his already impressive lead over Buttigieg and six other Democratic rivals and virtually blast them out of the water.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://iowastartingline.com/2020/02/27/final-iowa-caucus-results-pete-buttigieg-wins/\">Iowa</a> he finished a splinter-thin second to Buttigieg. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/10/new-hampshire-primary-bernie-sanders-pete-buttigieg\">New Hampshire</a> he won. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/22/bernie-sanders-frontrunner-latino-nevada\">Nevada</a> he sealed his frontrunner status with a slam-dunk victory.</p> <p>Now Super Tuesday promises to project him to all-but invincible heights. Fourteen states go to the polls on 3 March, between them commanding two-thirds of the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/22/us/politics/democratic-primary-dnc-superdelegates.html\">1991 delegates</a> he needs to win outright.</p> <p>In all but two of those states, Sanders is competitively placed or head and shoulders above the pack, including in his home turf of Vermont. But the real prize is California.</p> <p>With its gargantuan crop of 451 delegates \u2013 a quarter of those needed to secure the Democratic nomination, no questions asked \u2013 California\u2019s participation in this year\u2019s Super Tuesday has shaken up the race. Combine the state, where Sanders is currently polling a <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/ca/california_democratic_primary-6879.html\">13-point lead</a> over next-placed Elizabeth Warren, with delegate-rich Texas, which also goes to the polls on Tuesday, and the buzz of expectation in Sanders\u2019 circles is almost as palpable as the fear coursing through everyone else.</p> <p>\u201cIf Sanders cleans up in California and Texas, he is almost guaranteed a plurality of the delegates nationwide,\u201d said political analyst Larry Sabato. \u201cI don\u2019t see anyone who could come close.\u201d</p> <p>Success on Tuesday is certain to take the already shrill debate about democratic socialism and crank it to ear-splitting levels. Buttigieg\u2019s claim that Sanders\u2019 radicalism is a gift to Trump, rendering the US senator from Vermont all but unelectable, will become the rallying cry of the moderate Democrats still clinging to presidential life.</p> <p>Sanders is having none of it. At a rally this week in Virginia \u2013 another of the Super Tuesday states \u2013 he ridiculed the idea that he was extreme. \u201cMy critics say \u2018Bernie is so radical!\u2019 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s radical to say that working people should have the right to live in dignity and security.\u201d</p> <p>As for his electability, Sanders thundered: \u201cWe are going to defeat Trump because American people do not like frauds and pathological liars.\u201d</p> <p>The possibility that \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d might harm Sanders, in turn inflicting terrible damage on America and the world by giving Trump four more years, certainly bears contemplating. The US is, after all, the crucible of capitalism with a long tradition of individualism and suspicion of overweening government.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People think of Bernie as an ideological leader and not an organisational leader, but he\u2019s both</p> <footer> <cite>Larry Sabato</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>To get a sense of America\u2019s enduring political prejudices, a survey Gallup has been conducting since the 1950s makes for <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/285563/socialism-atheism-political-liabilities.aspx\">interesting reading</a>. It shows that on almost all fronts \u2013 race, religion, sexuality \u2013 the country has loosened up immensely over the decades.</p> <p>Americans would vote for a well-qualified presidential candidate who is: Jewish by 93% (great news for Sanders and Bloomberg); over 70 years old by 69% (not bad for Sanders, Bloomberg and Warren); female by 93% (great for Warren and Amy Klobuchar, the last two women in the race); gay or lesbian by 78% (good for Buttigieg, who is gay).</p> <p>But socialist? That rates a miserable 45%.</p> <p>Nor did Sanders\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bernie-sanders-democratic-presidential-front-runner-anderson-cooper-60-minutes/\">recent praise</a> of Fidel Castro\u2019s literacy program in Cuba help, stirring up old Cold War antagonisms. Some of the more piercing attacks from his Democratic adversaries have also intensified the issue, notably the suggestion from Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire late entrant into the race, that <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2020/02/25/bloomberg_to_sanders_russia_is_trying_to_get_you_nominated_so_you_lose_to_trump.html\">Russia</a> was trying to boost Sanders\u2019 nomination hopes because that\u2019s the best way of ensuring re-election for Trump.</p> <p>Against that, Sanders can point to <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/bernie-sanders-trump-poll-election-2020-biden-bloomberg-1483423\">any number</a> <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_sanders-6250.html\">of polls</a> that have him beating Trump more convincingly than any of his Democratic rivals. The idea that socialism remains a bogey word has also been disputed, as has the sharp distinction between \u201cradical\u201d versus \u201cmoderate\u201d Democrats.</p> <p>As the former US secretary of labor Robert Reich <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/02/26/calm-down-establishment-democrats-bernie-sanders-might-be-safest-choice/\">has argued</a>, those concepts are obsolete in an age of soaring inequality when so many Americans feel \u201cpolitically disempowered and economically insecure\u201d.</p> <p>Greg Guma, a Vermont resident who has known Sanders since 1971, believes the whole socialism thing is overblown by the media. \u201cIt\u2019s not like he ran as a socialist or or even mentioned it. I have never heard him utter the word. Right now the Democrats are doing Trump\u2019s work for him by red baiting.\u201d</p> <p>Guma, the author of The People\u2019s Republic: Vermont and the Sanders Revolution, recalls that when he first met Sanders they quarreled over political identity. Sanders was then running for an anti-Vietnam war party, Liberty Union, and wanted only to talk about the \u201cmovement\u201d.</p> <p>Guma wanted the candidate to open up about himself. \u201cYou\u2019re a person, not a movement, you have to prove you\u2019re a basically good person if you want my vote,\u201d he told him.</p> <p>To which the fledgling politician replied: \u201cIt\u2019s the movement that\u2019s important. I don\u2019t want your vote.\u201d</p> <p>If Guma\u2019s account ended there, it would reinforce the image of the crusty old, rigid, dogmatic ideologue that Sanders\u2019 enemies promote. But over the years, Guma says, he saw the emergence of a very different politician, one who builds coalitions and works across the aisle.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"59cdbb744e7ce2dd12000abbcd5caf170aaabb46\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59cdbb744e7ce2dd12000abbcd5caf170aaabb46/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sanders has followed Obama\u2019s example and laid the foundations of a national network of young, energised supporters.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sanders has followed Obama\u2019s example and laid the foundations of a national network of young, energised supporters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Rourke/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAs an intelligent person, he knew that what mattered was not what labels were pinned on him, but how he did as a political manager \u2013 and he did that rather effectively. He is very good at working with people, going beyond his own rhetoric and establishing alliances with unlikely partners including Republicans to get things done.\u201d</p> <p>Sabato agrees that amid the current brouhaha about socialism, what is being lost is Sanders\u2019 considerable skills as an organiser. \u201cPeople think of Bernie as an ideological leader and not an organisational leader, but he\u2019s both. That might be the ultimate source of his strength.\u201d</p> <p>Over the past several years Sanders has followed Barack Obama\u2019s example and laid the foundations of a national network of young, energised supporters that has left his less industrious rivals standing. While his opponents have been screaming about unelectability, Sanders has been quietly doing the unglamorous work it takes to get elected.</p> <p>He has simply outslogged the competition. That includes Bloomberg, with his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/02/26/us/politics/michael-bloomberg-ad-campaign-spending.html\">$410m glut of TV ads</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe live in the age of the permanent campaign,\u201d Sabato says. \u201cThere\u2019s a big advantage to a candidate who runs flat-out all the time, and that\u2019s what Bernie has done and what Joe Biden and the others haven\u2019t. The Sanders crowd hasn\u2019t taken a day off since 2016.\u201d</p> <p>The fruits of hard graft are starting to materialise in what Sanders calls a \u201cmultigenerational, multiracial coalition sweeping this country\u201d. His ability to mobilise young voters who \u201cfeel the Bern\u201d was evident four years ago in his epic battle with Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>This cycle he is also showing resounding support among Latinos.</p> <p>In Nevada he won the support of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/22/bernie-sanders-frontrunner-latino-nevada\">51% of Hispanic Democrats</a>. That\u2019s a critical statistic.

      "bodyText": "Bernie Sanders doesn\u2019t do things by half measures. As he vies to become the 46th president of the United States he is looking to shatter no fewer than three historic records. President Sanders would be the first Jewish incumbent of the most powerful office on Earth. Aged 79 on inauguration day, he would become the oldest president in US history having unseated the current record-holder, Donald Trump, 73. Most striking of all, he would be the first American commander-in-chief describing himself as a \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d. Judging by recent attacks from his detractors \u2013 Democratic ones, not Trump supporters \u2013 that is the political equivalent of carrying the coronavirus. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what it adds up to,\u201d said Pete Buttigieg, his rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, at this week\u2019s TV debate ahead of Saturday\u2019s primary in South Carolina. Buttigieg referenced Sanders\u2019 \u201cradical\u201d policies of universal tax-funded healthcare, debt-free college tuition and a Green New Deal to tackle the climate crisis, then said: \u201cIt adds up to four more years of Donald Trump.\u201d On Tuesday Sanders has the chance to take his political insurgency and wipe it across the nation. In the 2020 cycle, Super Tuesday is even more super-charged than usual, providing him with an opportunity to take his already impressive lead over Buttigieg and six other Democratic rivals and virtually blast them out of the water. In Iowa he finished a splinter-thin second to Buttigieg. In New Hampshire he won. In Nevada he sealed his frontrunner status with a slam-dunk victory. Now Super Tuesday promises to project him to all-but invincible heights. Fourteen states go to the polls on 3 March, between them commanding two-thirds of the 1991 delegates he needs to win outright. In all but two of those states, Sanders is competitively placed or head and shoulders above the pack, including in his home turf of Vermont. But the real prize is California. With its gargantuan crop of 451 delegates \u2013 a quarter of those needed to secure the Democratic nomination, no questions asked \u2013 California\u2019s participation in this year\u2019s Super Tuesday has shaken up the race. Combine the state, where Sanders is currently polling a 13-point lead over next-placed Elizabeth Warren, with delegate-rich Texas, which also goes to the polls on Tuesday, and the buzz of expectation in Sanders\u2019 circles is almost as palpable as the fear coursing through everyone else. \u201cIf Sanders cleans up in California and Texas, he is almost guaranteed a plurality of the delegates nationwide,\u201d said political analyst Larry Sabato. \u201cI don\u2019t see anyone who could come close.\u201d Success on Tuesday is certain to take the already shrill debate about democratic socialism and crank it to ear-splitting levels. Buttigieg\u2019s claim that Sanders\u2019 radicalism is a gift to Trump, rendering the US senator from Vermont all but unelectable, will become the rallying cry of the moderate Democrats still clinging to presidential life. Sanders is having none of it. At a rally this week in Virginia \u2013 another of the Super Tuesday states \u2013 he ridiculed the idea that he was extreme. \u201cMy critics say \u2018Bernie is so radical!\u2019 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s radical to say that working people should have the right to live in dignity and security.\u201d As for his electability, Sanders thundered: \u201cWe are going to defeat Trump because American people do not like frauds and pathological liars.\u201d The possibility that \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d might harm Sanders, in turn inflicting terrible damage on America and the world by giving Trump four more years, certainly bears contemplating. The US is, after all, the crucible of capitalism with a long tradition of individualism and suspicion of overweening government. To get a sense of America\u2019s enduring political prejudices, a survey Gallup has been conducting since the 1950s makes for interesting reading. It shows that on almost all fronts \u2013 race, religion, sexuality \u2013 the country has loosened up immensely over the decades. Americans would vote for a well-qualified presidential candidate who is: Jewish by 93% (great news for Sanders and Bloomberg); over 70 years old by 69% (not bad for Sanders, Bloomberg and Warren); female by 93% (great for Warren and Amy Klobuchar, the last two women in the race); gay or lesbian by 78% (good for Buttigieg, who is gay). But socialist? That rates a miserable 45%. Nor did Sanders\u2019 recent praise of Fidel Castro\u2019s literacy program in Cuba help, stirring up old Cold War antagonisms. Some of the more piercing attacks from his Democratic adversaries have also intensified the issue, notably the suggestion from Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire late entrant into the race, that Russia was trying to boost Sanders\u2019 nomination hopes because that\u2019s the best way of ensuring re-election for Trump. Against that, Sanders can point to any number of polls that have him beating Trump more convincingly than any of his Democratic rivals. The idea that socialism remains a bogey word has also been disputed, as has the sharp distinction between \u201cradical\u201d versus \u201cmoderate\u201d Democrats. As the former US secretary of labor Robert Reich has argued, those concepts are obsolete in an age of soaring inequality when so many Americans feel \u201cpolitically disempowered and economically insecure\u201d. Greg Guma, a Vermont resident who has known Sanders since 1971, believes the whole socialism thing is overblown by the media. \u201cIt\u2019s not like he ran as a socialist or or even mentioned it. I have never heard him utter the word. Right now the Democrats are doing Trump\u2019s work for him by red baiting.\u201d Guma, the author of The People\u2019s Republic: Vermont and the Sanders Revolution, recalls that when he first met Sanders they quarreled over political identity. Sanders was then running for an anti-Vietnam war party, Liberty Union, and wanted only to talk about the \u201cmovement\u201d. Guma wanted the candidate to open up about himself. \u201cYou\u2019re a person, not a movement, you have to prove you\u2019re a basically good person if you want my vote,\u201d he told him. To which the fledgling politician replied: \u201cIt\u2019s the movement that\u2019s important. I don\u2019t want your vote.\u201d If Guma\u2019s account ended there, it would reinforce the image of the crusty old, rigid, dogmatic ideologue that Sanders\u2019 enemies promote. But over the years, Guma says, he saw the emergence of a very different politician, one who builds coalitions and works across the aisle. \u201cAs an intelligent person, he knew that what mattered was not what labels were pinned on him, but how he did as a political manager \u2013 and he did that rather effectively. He is very good at working with people, going beyond his own rhetoric and establishing alliances with unlikely partners including Republicans to get things done.\u201d Sabato agrees that amid the current brouhaha about socialism, what is being lost is Sanders\u2019 considerable skills as an organiser. \u201cPeople think of Bernie as an ideological leader and not an organisational leader, but he\u2019s both. That might be the ultimate source of his strength.\u201d Over the past several years Sanders has followed Barack Obama\u2019s example and laid the foundations of a national network of young, energised supporters that has left his less industrious rivals standing. While his opponents have been screaming about unelectability, Sanders has been quietly doing the unglamorous work it takes to get elected. He has simply outslogged the competition. That includes Bloomberg, with his $410m glut of TV ads. \u201cWe live in the age of the permanent campaign,\u201d Sabato says. \u201cThere\u2019s a big advantage to a candidate who runs flat-out all the time, and that\u2019s what Bernie has done and what Joe Biden and the others haven\u2019t. The Sanders crowd hasn\u2019t taken a day off since 2016.\u201d The fruits of hard graft are starting to materialise in what Sanders calls a \u201cmultigenerational, multiracial coalition sweeping this country\u201d. His ability to mobilise young voters who \u201cfeel the Bern\u201d was evident four years ago in his epic battle with Hillary Clinton. This cycle he is also showing resounding support among Latinos. In Nevada he won the support of 51% of Hispanic Democrats. That\u2019s a critical statistic. It suggests that his tireless outreach to Latino communities, combined with policies that talk to them such as a $15 federal minimum wage, a moratorium on immigration deportations, and commitment to an NHS-style system of Medicare for All which appeals to the high numbers of Latinos who have no or little health insurance \u2013 will pay dividends on Tuesday in heavily Hispanic California and Texas. The key question now is whether this coalition of young voters, Latinos, African Americans, blue-collar workers and urban progressives is big enough to prevail against Trump. He doesn\u2019t only have to match the ecstatic enthusiasm that Trump can muster among his \u201cKeep America Great\u201d base \u2013 the president\u2019s approval rating among Republicans is at an astronomical 90%. Sanders also has to compensate for those voters balking at the idea of a tax-and-spend socialist in the White House. That is particularly true in affluent suburbs where independent and moderate Republicans who are disaffected with Trump \u2013 especially women \u2013 were key to Democrats taking back the House of Representatives in 2018. Without such a surge in turnout Sanders could suffer the same fate as Clinton, winning the popular vote but still being outgunned in the electoral college. It only took 77,744 votes in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, out of a total of 137m nationally, to hand Trump the presidency in 2016. There are warning signs for Sanders \u2013 and indeed the entire Democratic field \u2013 here. Turnout in the early caucuses and primaries has so far fallen short of stellar. \u201cThe early promise from the Sanders camp that only he could generate a large turnout of minorities and young people who failed to turn out for Hillary Clinton is not necessarily true,\u201d Sabato says. \u201cTurnout has been underwhelming so far, and it\u2019s all about getting voters to show up.\u201d So the still-crowded Democratic field remains far from settled. Super Tuesday may clarify matters, but if it fails to deliver a clear winner a primary season that is already fractured and ill-tempered will grow uglier by the day. To add to the jitters, there is even talk of the nightmare scenario. Should Sanders fail to gain an overall majority in the delegate count by the end of the primaries in June he faces the prospect at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin a month later of a brokered convention. At that point \u201csuper delegates\u201d \u2013 some 771 officials and potentates of the Democratic party \u2013 could use their establishment power to block him from the nomination. It would provide a spectacular ending to what is turning into an impressively unedifying process. But it would benefit only one person: the man gleefully watching the fireworks from his vantage point in the Oval Office.",

Almost exactly 10 years ago, in March 2010, a high court judge upheld the claims of anti-third-runway protesters, ruling that the government had failed to scrupulously account for climate change in approving the London airport\u2019s expansion. The verdict required the government to redraw its policy statement; but the Conservative leader, David Cameron, had pinned his colours to the anti-expansion mast. In the wake of the election two months later, he was in Downing Street and it was clear that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/may/24/third-runway-heathrow-scrapped-baa\" title=\"\">the scheme was dead</a>.</p> <p>A strikingly similar scenario appears to have killed off Heathrow\u2019s ambitions again last week. While the airport believes the judgment only presents a small hurdle to clear, it cannot do so if the government declines to jump. For Boris Johnson, in whom those Churchillian qualities of decisive, bold leadership are daily more absent, the ruling is perfect cover. Instead of either embracing or challenging the ruling, the PM left it to his transport secretary to say that the government did not have a dog in this fight, and that Heathrow could appeal if it wanted to.</p> <p>It is, therefore, difficult to prove the claim that this ruling marks a historic watershed whereby governments must rein in policy to the greater demands of the Paris climate accords. The true test case will surely be when a scheme upon which a government is hell-bent is forced through the environmental wringer. Campaigners will hope the Department for Transport proves equally unattached to its prospective multibillion-pound road-building projects, such as the Oxford-to-Cambridge expressway or the Lower Thames Crossing.</p> <p>Much has, of course, changed since 2010: ever more people are aware of the climate emergency, and \u2013 at least outside Trump\u2019s America \u2013 the imperative to act is perceived to be far more urgent. The aviation industry itself has, belatedly, addressed the need to clean up.

It remains to be seen whether coronavirus will indeed surpass the banking crisis for wrecking the global economy, or just how much Brexit will affect Britain\u2019s own economic health. Both, certainly, could cause enough woe to make foreign travel less desirable or affordable \u2013 potentially solving the problem of airport capacity.</p> <p>But should Britain trundle on, post-Brexit, into the bog-standard doldrums, it would be little surprise to see Heathrow\u2019s runway back on the agenda.

But the slump in share prices had opened up \u201ca new channel through which the coronavirus outbreak could weigh on the UK economy\u201d. It said: \u201cStock market losses have already exceeded those that we modelled in our \u2018global pandemic\u2019 scenario, in which high infection rates spread globally and the combination of disruption to activity and tighter financial conditions cause world GDP growth to slow to near-zero in the first quarter of 2020.\u201d There could be a quick bounce back if the virus is seen to be contained, but with dire manufacturing data already out this weekend from China, markets probably have further to fall before they finally turn.",

      "body": "<p>In late 1918 the world\u2019s greatest killer \u2013 Spanish flu \u2013 roared towards Gunnison, a mountain town in Colorado.</p> <p>The pandemic was infecting hundreds of millions of people in Europe, Africa, Asia and across the United States, overwhelming hospitals and morgues in Boston and Philadelphia before sweeping west, devastating cities, villages and hamlets from Alaska to Texas.</p> <p>Gunnison, a farming and mining town of about 1,300 people, had special reason to fear. Two railroads connected it to Denver and other population centers, many badly hit. \u201cThe flu is after us\u201d the Gunnison News-Champion <a href=\"http://chm.med.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2015/02/gnc03.pdf\">warned on 10 October</a>. \u201cIt is circulating in almost every village and community around us.\u201d</p> <p>What happened next is instructive amid a<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\"> new global health emergency</a> a century later as the world struggles react to the emergence of a new coronavirus. Gunnison declared a \u201cquarantine against all the world\u201d. It erected barricades, sequestered visitors, arrested violators, closed schools and churches and banned parties and street gatherings, a de facto lockdown that lasted four months.</p> <p>It worked. Gunnison emerged from the pandemic\u2019s first two waves \u2013 by far the deadliest - without a single case. It was one of a handful of so-called \u201cescape communities\u201d that researchers have analysed for insights into containing the apparently uncontainable.</p> <p>\u201cGunnison\u2019s management of the influenza situation, one hallmarked by the application of protective sequestration, is particularly impressive when one considers that nearly every nearby town and county was severely affected by the pandemic,\u201d the University of Michigan Medical School said in a <a href=\"http://chm.med.umich.edu/research/1918-influenza-escape-communities/gunnison/\">2006 report</a> for the Pentagon\u2019s Defense Threat Reduction Agency. \u201cThe town of Gunnison was exceptional.\u201d</p> <p>Now it is the turn of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/what-is-coronavirus-symptoms-wuhan-china-pandemic-spread-covid-19\">coronavirus</a> to race around the world, rattling governments and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/26/will-coronavirus-trigger-global-recession-donald-trump-trade-policy\">stock markets</a> and prompting a desperate scramble to contain and control. Tourists stuck in Spanish hotels, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/25/its-extremely-empty-coronavirus-brings-milan-to-a-standstill\">Italian streets eerily empty</a>, schools shuttered in Japan, pilgrimages to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/saudia-arabia-bans-foreign-pilgrims-as-coronavirus-hits-region\"> Islam\u2019s holiest sites banned,</a> international sporting fixtures suspended \u2013 a multiplying list of measures amid confusion over how to respond.</p> <p>The experience of a small town in the Rockies at the end of the first world war does not provide a failsafe blueprint for a different disease in a far more populous, and far more interconnected era. It does however offer tantalising nuggets about about eluding a cataclysm that infected about a third of the global population and killed between 50 million and 100 million people.</p> <p>Instead of face masks and anti-bacterial hand gels, Gunnsion relied on the guidance and authority of local newspapers, doctors and police \u2013 a trust in institutions that may now seem quaint \u2013 and on people\u2019s capacity for patience.

      "bodyText": "In late 1918 the world\u2019s greatest killer \u2013 Spanish flu \u2013 roared towards Gunnison, a mountain town in Colorado. The pandemic was infecting hundreds of millions of people in Europe, Africa, Asia and across the United States, overwhelming hospitals and morgues in Boston and Philadelphia before sweeping west, devastating cities, villages and hamlets from Alaska to Texas. Gunnison, a farming and mining town of about 1,300 people, had special reason to fear. Two railroads connected it to Denver and other population centers, many badly hit. \u201cThe flu is after us\u201d the Gunnison News-Champion warned on 10 October. \u201cIt is circulating in almost every village and community around us.\u201d What happened next is instructive amid a new global health emergency a century later as the world struggles react to the emergence of a new coronavirus. Gunnison declared a \u201cquarantine against all the world\u201d. It erected barricades, sequestered visitors, arrested violators, closed schools and churches and banned parties and street gatherings, a de facto lockdown that lasted four months. It worked. Gunnison emerged from the pandemic\u2019s first two waves \u2013 by far the deadliest - without a single case. It was one of a handful of so-called \u201cescape communities\u201d that researchers have analysed for insights into containing the apparently uncontainable. \u201cGunnison\u2019s management of the influenza situation, one hallmarked by the application of protective sequestration, is particularly impressive when one considers that nearly every nearby town and county was severely affected by the pandemic,\u201d the University of Michigan Medical School said in a 2006 report for the Pentagon\u2019s Defense Threat Reduction Agency. \u201cThe town of Gunnison was exceptional.\u201d Now it is the turn of coronavirus to race around the world, rattling governments and stock markets and prompting a desperate scramble to contain and control. Tourists stuck in Spanish hotels, Italian streets eerily empty, schools shuttered in Japan, pilgrimages to Islam\u2019s holiest sites banned, international sporting fixtures suspended \u2013 a multiplying list of measures amid confusion over how to respond. The experience of a small town in the Rockies at the end of the first world war does not provide a failsafe blueprint for a different disease in a far more populous, and far more interconnected era. It does however offer tantalising nuggets about about eluding a cataclysm that infected about a third of the global population and killed between 50 million and 100 million people. Instead of face masks and anti-bacterial hand gels, Gunnsion relied on the guidance and authority of local newspapers, doctors and police \u2013 a trust in institutions that may now seem quaint \u2013 and on people\u2019s capacity for patience. And on luck. According to the state health board, influenza arrived in Colorado on or about 20 September 1918 when 250 soldiers from Montana \u2013 13 of them seriously ill - arrived in the city of Boulder. The deadly flu \u2013 mistakenly sourced to Spain - swiftly spread. On 5 October health officials issued a warning and on 16 October the governor, Julius Gunter, issued an executive order banning public and private gatherings across the state. By then towns near Gunnison were already reeling. Gunnison moved swiftly thanks partly to the News-Champion, which from late September carried at least one front page article on influenza, including practical advice on avoidance and treatment, in each weekly edition. Dr FP Hanson, the county physician, took a leading role. \u201cAn epidemic, terrible in proportions and resultant deaths, is sweeping over the country,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI have caused a strict quarantine to be placed on Gunnison county against the world. Barricades and fences have been erected on all main highways near the county lines.\u201d Lanterns and signs warned motorists to drive straight through or submit to quarantine. Train passengers who disembarked were quarantined. \u201cAny person may leave the county at his will; none may return except those who will go into voluntary quarantine,\u201d said Hanson. Any violators would be be \u201cdealt with to the fullest extent of the law, and to this we promise our personal attention\u201d, he added. Officials fortified defences by giving another physician, Dr JW Rockerfeller, \u201centire charge of both town and county to enforce a quarantine against all the world\u201d. He meant business. When residents reported two motorists and a rail passenger who tried to evade quarantine the sheriff jailed them. \u201cThis little instance should show outsiders what Gunnison county\u2019s stand is. We have no flu, and we do not intend to have any,\u201d said Rockerfeller. The screws tightened. Quarantine was extended from two to five days. Several train stations around the county were shut, facilitating monitoring. By early February, with state-wide flu cases ebbing, Gunnison lifted restrictions. It was premature: a third wave in March infected about a hundred people in the town. The cases were mild and all survived. Other \u201cescape communities\u201d in the US included Princeton university, a New York tuberculosis sanatorium, Yerba Buena island in San Francisco bay and the Vermont town of Fletcher. The Michigan Medical School study attributed Gunnison\u2019s feat to strict measures, low population density and luck \u2013 no infected person arrived before quarantine.

Authorities said they did not know how he had contracted the virus because he did not have any history of travel to affected areas or contact with known Covid-19 cases. On Sunday, China reported its sharpest increase in new infections in a week with 573 new cases, the highest daily rise in a week. Chinese health authorities reported 35 new deaths on Sunday, a drop from the previous day\u2019s toll of 47. A 32-year-old doctor named Zhong Jinxing in the southern province of Guangxi reportedly died from \u201coverwork\u201d on Friday after working for 33 consecutive days. Another doctor, Jiang Xueqing, 55, died on Sunday after having been infected with Covid-19, according to Chinese state media. An estimated 87,000 people globally have contracted the virus, with cases in at least 59 countries. On Sunday, Armenia reported its first case, while Qatar, Ecuador, Luxembourg and Ireland were among those reporting initial infections over the weekend. South Korea, the worst-hit country after China, confirmed 376 new cases on Sunday, bringing the number of infections to more than 3,500. Churches were closed, with many holding online services as authorities warned residents to stay indoors during this \u201ccritical moment\u201d. Japan reported its second death. A man in his 70s in the northernmost island of Hokkaido died on Saturday night after testing positive for Covid-19. Japan has said it plans to go ahead with the Tokyi Olympics scheduled for July and August. \u201cI have decided we must make all efforts in the next one or two weeks to prevent the spread,\u201d the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said in a press conference on Saturday. As the World Health Organization raised the global risk level from the coronavirus to \u201cvery high\u201d, countries have expanded travel restrictions and preventive measures. France, which has recorded at least 100 coronavirus cases, has temporarily banned public gatherings of more than 5,000 people while Switzerland said it will bar events of more than 1,000. American Airlines said it would suspend all flights to Milan, Italy, after the US raised travel warnings for parts of the country. Italy, home to at least 1,100 cases, has been the hardest hit European country, reporting 29 deaths caused by the virus. The White House also said that travellers coming from South Korea would face additional screening and that those who have travelled to Iran in the last 14 days would be banned from entering the US. Starting on Sunday, Australia will also ban travellers from Iran. In China, where officials and WHO experts say they have seen \u201csteep declines\u201d, authorities are still trying to grapple with public discontent over its handling of the crisis, and weeks of economic paralysis. On Saturday, China published the country\u2019s first official economic data since the outbreak began. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the manufacturing purchasing manager\u2019s index, a measure of manufacturing activity, declined to 35.7 \u2013 an all-time low, and well below the 50-point mark which indicates a contraction. In excerpts of speeches published by Qiushi, a journal run by the Chinese Communist party, the Chinese leader called on the country to plug \u201cloopholes\u201d in its emergency response system. Xi Jinping, appearing to acknowledge some of the government\u2019s mistakes, said some areas were \u201cat a loss in how to react\u201d to the epidemic. \u201cIn some areas there was lawless and criminal conduct that seriously impeded containment of the epidemic, causing public dissatisfaction,\u201d he said.",

      "body": "<p>The coronavirus crisis has sparked a worldwide race against time to try to understand its nature, contain its spread and develop a vaccine. Only in a few remote corners of the planet do people appear to be nonchalantly confident that it can\u2019t get to them. One of those cut-off places is Downing Street. On Friday, Number 10 announced that the prime minister would finally chair a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/28/boris-johnson-not-to-hold-coronavirus-crisis-meeting-cobra-until-monday\" title=\"\">not until Monday</a>. Nothing must get in the way of Boris Johnson\u2019s weekend. This is of a piece with his behaviour as the spread of the virus has escalated. He has elected to self-isolate indoors rather than take visible charge of the government\u2019s planning and public messaging.</p> <p>Those rebuking his vanishing act include the prime minister\u2019s old frenemy George Osborne, who complained: \u201cThe British government now needs to go on to a \u2018war footing\u2019 with the coronavirus: daily NHS press briefings, regular Cobra meetings chaired by the PM, ministers on all major media shows. The public is fearful, wants information and needs to know their leaders have got a grip.\u201d You know you are in trouble when the former chancellor is giving advice on crisis management.</p> <p>I think he\u2019s wrong to suggest that most of the public are \u201cfearful\u201d, but he\u2019s right to say that they want reassurance that their government has \u201cgot a grip\u201d. In times like these, people have two main demands of their rulers. They crave reliable information that they can act on with confidence. And they want evidence that the government has a plan, or is at least diligently and urgently working on a plan, to deal with the crisis. What they don\u2019t expect is for the occupant of Number 10 to turn himself into the invisible man.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is no vaccine to protect us from economic influenza. If the world catches that cold, Britain will be sneezing with it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The criticism that he has gone absent without leave appears to have stung Mr Johnson at least a little bit. Because he then did pop up to make a brief appearance before TV cameras on Friday evening, after the first fatality of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/28/first-briton-dies-from-coronavirus-japanese-media-report-diamond-princess\" title=\"\">British citizen</a> had been announced, to declare that responding to Covid-19 was now the government\u2019s \u201ctop priority\u201d. Its plan for containment and mitigation will be published early this week.</p> <p>This crisis is testing the resilience of peoples, the competence of their governments and the mettle of leaders around the world. The best find the right balance between giving the public trustworthy guidance and not stoking panic. The challenges to leadership are the greater because the coronavirus presents an unusual cocktail of threats. It is a health hazard accompanied by a menace to the world economy. Financial markets were initially complacent that the contagion would be mostly contained to China, and world growth would quickly rebound in a V-shaped recovery from any setback. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/29/markets-fall-coronavirus-china-economy\" title=\"\">Markets</a> are now shaking with fright that the virus will trigger a chain reaction with severe consequences for global growth. Belatedly pricing in the potential hit to trade and company earnings, American and European stock markets have just lurched through their steepest falls since the collapse of Lehman Brothers triggered the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/dec/28/markets-credit-crunch-banking-2008\" title=\"\">great crash of 2008</a>. There is a rising chance that the disruption to international supply chains and the suppression of economic activity will tip us into a global recession. Central banks can try to stimulate demand, but they can\u2019t do much to soften a supply shock. This is a threat to this country even if the UK itself manages to avoid an epidemic. For an open economy that is especially dependent on trade flows and finance, there is no vaccine to protect us from economic influenza. If the world catches that cold, Britain will be sneezing with it.</p> <p>Few members of this government know much about viruses. Nearly all do understand the link between the economic climate and how the public feel about their leaders. I detect rising anxiety within ministerial ranks about a global contraction and the havoc that would wreak on their plans and their popularity. Talking to one cabinet minister recently about what might derail this government, he confided: \u201cA recession. That\u2019s what I fear most.\u201d A downturn will make it much harder for the government to deliver on its end-to-austerity spending promises and its pledges not to raise any of the main forms of personal taxation. Damage would be inflicted on living standards, not least among those voters in what we used to call the Labour heartlands who turned to the Tories for the first time at the election.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/29/officials-try-to-trace-contacts-of-first-patient-to-catch-coronavirus-in-uk\">Three more people test positive for coronavirus in England</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The menace of a virus-induced recession infecting the British economy has large implications for the budget that is due in just 10 days. This had been planned as a boldly defining event in the early life of the Johnson government. Now it will be a budget built on very wobbly foundations. Ministers simply don\u2019t know \u2013 and will admit as much in private \u2013 what sort of hit there will be on the British economy. Estimates range from the light to the seriously nasty. The neophyte chancellor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rishi-sunak\" title=\"\">Rishi Sunak</a>, and his officials face what one calls \u201cthe nightmare\u201d of presenting a budget when all the underpinning assumptions about growth, borrowing, spending and tax revenues have been rendered even more flaky than usual.</p> <p>The spread of the coronavirus also has significant implications for Mr Johnson\u2019s attempt to secure a decent trade deal with the EU. Since London and Brussels published their negotiating strategies, there has been a lot of sabre-rattling from both sides. That was to be expected, but the crisis places a much darker complexion on this Brexit brinkmanship. The spectre of a virus-induced global recession greatly elevates the hazards if the talks fail and will make the price of a no-deal outcome that much more punishing for the British economy.</p> <p>This points us to another thing required of political leadership: a capacity to make tough choices, some of which will be very hard indeed should the UK face a coronavirus epidemic. The constant ministerial mantra is that they are relying on clinical advice to formulate a response that is designed to be both effective and proportionate. Expect to hear a lot more of that when the government publishes its plan. But some decisions are ultimately for the politicians to make and the most testing of them will land on the prime minister\u2019s desk.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Should we take every measure available to try to counter the virus and at whatever economic and social cost?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, has delicately hinted at the difficulty of the choices in the worst scenarios. The prime minister and his cabinet will have to make some large decisions about the extent to which normal life is curtailed. Following Japan\u2019s example and closing all schools will take many adults out of the workforce to look after their children. Emulating the Chinese model of shutting down factories, offices, shops, restaurants and transport networks in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus will mean hurting many businesses and the livelihoods of those who work for them. Some firms will go bust. The Swiss have prohibited all gatherings of more than 1,000 people, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/28/swiss-government-bans-large-events-on-back-of-coronavirus-crisis\" title=\"\">cancelling</a> the Geneva motor show. The Saudis are banning foreign travellers from visiting the two holiest sites in Islam. Italy has placed several towns in the north under police-controlled quarantine. Other measures can include closing all museums, theatres and cinemas, and cancelling music festivals and sporting fixtures. All of which have knock-on economic effects.</p> <p>As Professor Whitty observes, the prohibition of so many human activities that we normally take for granted would have \u201cnon-trivial implications\u201d. The experience of previous viral outbreaks suggests that the biggest impact on economies and incomes will come not from the disease itself but from the responses. There are trade-offs between doing everything a government can to stop the spread of contagion, and the disruption that containment strategies will inflict on economic and social life. The chief medical officer is right to suggest that \u201cwe are going to have to have, as a society, a serious discussion about how we manage the trade-offs\u201d.</p> <p>I am going to put the choice more bluntly than he does \u2013 or any politician is ever likely to be brave enough to spell out. Should we take every measure available to try to counter the virus and at whatever economic and social cost? Or are we better advised to take less stringent steps to minimise the impact on society, at the price of increasing the risk of infection and, for those most vulnerable to the virus, elevating the risk of death?</p> <p>This is the critical dilemma that is lurking behind many of the calculations and pronouncements by politicians and their advisers. The debate needs to be had honestly and openly. It is a conversation that will need to be led. To govern is to choose. One choice no leader can make at a time of crisis is to hide.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</p>",

And they want evidence that the government has a plan, or is at least diligently and urgently working on a plan, to deal with the crisis. What they don\u2019t expect is for the occupant of Number 10 to turn himself into the invisible man. The criticism that he has gone absent without leave appears to have stung Mr Johnson at least a little bit. Because he then did pop up to make a brief appearance before TV cameras on Friday evening, after the first fatality of a British citizen had been announced, to declare that responding to Covid-19 was now the government\u2019s \u201ctop priority\u201d. Its plan for containment and mitigation will be published early this week. This crisis is testing the resilience of peoples, the competence of their governments and the mettle of leaders around the world. The best find the right balance between giving the public trustworthy guidance and not stoking panic. The challenges to leadership are the greater because the coronavirus presents an unusual cocktail of threats. It is a health hazard accompanied by a menace to the world economy. Financial markets were initially complacent that the contagion would be mostly contained to China, and world growth would quickly rebound in a V-shaped recovery from any setback. Markets are now shaking with fright that the virus will trigger a chain reaction with severe consequences for global growth. Belatedly pricing in the potential hit to trade and company earnings, American and European stock markets have just lurched through their steepest falls since the collapse of Lehman Brothers triggered the great crash of 2008. There is a rising chance that the disruption to international supply chains and the suppression of economic activity will tip us into a global recession. Central banks can try to stimulate demand, but they can\u2019t do much to soften a supply shock. This is a threat to this country even if the UK itself manages to avoid an epidemic. For an open economy that is especially dependent on trade flows and finance, there is no vaccine to protect us from economic influenza. If the world catches that cold, Britain will be sneezing with it. Few members of this government know much about viruses. Nearly all do understand the link between the economic climate and how the public feel about their leaders. I detect rising anxiety within ministerial ranks about a global contraction and the havoc that would wreak on their plans and their popularity. Talking to one cabinet minister recently about what might derail this government, he confided: \u201cA recession. That\u2019s what I fear most.\u201d A downturn will make it much harder for the government to deliver on its end-to-austerity spending promises and its pledges not to raise any of the main forms of personal taxation. Damage would be inflicted on living standards, not least among those voters in what we used to call the Labour heartlands who turned to the Tories for the first time at the election. The menace of a virus-induced recession infecting the British economy has large implications for the budget that is due in just 10 days. This had been planned as a boldly defining event in the early life of the Johnson government. Now it will be a budget built on very wobbly foundations. Ministers simply don\u2019t know \u2013 and will admit as much in private \u2013 what sort of hit there will be on the British economy. Estimates range from the light to the seriously nasty. The neophyte chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and his officials face what one calls \u201cthe nightmare\u201d of presenting a budget when all the underpinning assumptions about growth, borrowing, spending and tax revenues have been rendered even more flaky than usual. The spread of the coronavirus also has significant implications for Mr Johnson\u2019s attempt to secure a decent trade deal with the EU. Since London and Brussels published their negotiating strategies, there has been a lot of sabre-rattling from both sides. That was to be expected, but the crisis places a much darker complexion on this Brexit brinkmanship. The spectre of a virus-induced global recession greatly elevates the hazards if the talks fail and will make the price of a no-deal outcome that much more punishing for the British economy. This points us to another thing required of political leadership: a capacity to make tough choices, some of which will be very hard indeed should the UK face a coronavirus epidemic. The constant ministerial mantra is that they are relying on clinical advice to formulate a response that is designed to be both effective and proportionate. Expect to hear a lot more of that when the government publishes its plan. But some decisions are ultimately for the politicians to make and the most testing of them will land on the prime minister\u2019s desk. Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, has delicately hinted at the difficulty of the choices in the worst scenarios. The prime minister and his cabinet will have to make some large decisions about the extent to which normal life is curtailed. Following Japan\u2019s example and closing all schools will take many adults out of the workforce to look after their children. Emulating the Chinese model of shutting down factories, offices, shops, restaurants and transport networks in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus will mean hurting many businesses and the livelihoods of those who work for them. Some firms will go bust. The Swiss have prohibited all gatherings of more than 1,000 people, cancelling the Geneva motor show. The Saudis are banning foreign travellers from visiting the two holiest sites in Islam. Italy has placed several towns in the north under police-controlled quarantine. Other measures can include closing all museums, theatres and cinemas, and cancelling music festivals and sporting fixtures. All of which have knock-on economic effects. As Professor Whitty observes, the prohibition of so many human activities that we normally take for granted would have \u201cnon-trivial implications\u201d. The experience of previous viral outbreaks suggests that the biggest impact on economies and incomes will come not from the disease itself but from the responses. There are trade-offs between doing everything a government can to stop the spread of contagion, and the disruption that containment strategies will inflict on economic and social life. The chief medical officer is right to suggest that \u201cwe are going to have to have, as a society, a serious discussion about how we manage the trade-offs\u201d. I am going to put the choice more bluntly than he does \u2013 or any politician is ever likely to be brave enough to spell out. Should we take every measure available to try to counter the virus and at whatever economic and social cost? Or are we better advised to take less stringent steps to minimise the impact on society, at the price of increasing the risk of infection and, for those most vulnerable to the virus, elevating the risk of death? This is the critical dilemma that is lurking behind many of the calculations and pronouncements by politicians and their advisers. The debate needs to be had honestly and openly. It is a conversation that will need to be led. To govern is to choose. One choice no leader can make at a time of crisis is to hide. \u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer",

It leaves one of the closest title races for years in danger of a late finish, as happened in 2001 when restrictions on travel because of a foot-and-mouth outbreak meant Ireland did not play their three fellow home unions until September and October of the following season and England missed out on the grand slam after a six-month wait. While five teams have a mathematical chance of winning the title, Wales and Scotland are all but out of it after losing two of their opening three matches. Yet Wales have the best points difference, +28, of the six teams while Scotland have conceded the fewest points, 32, and the lowest number of tries, two. Murrayfield is the fourth leg of what France hope will be their first grand slam since 2010. One omen is that their 2002 and 2004 grand slams came after fourth-round victories in Scotland but they have lost on their past two appearances in Edinburgh, campaigns when they finished at the bottom of the try-scoring table in the championship. This year, no one has scored more than their 11 tries and if only Italy have conceded more, there is a balance to France that has been missing for 10 years, helped by the recruitment of Shaun Edwards as defence coach. A team that flickered on and off like a dodgy light bulb has a glow to it, no longer fumbling around in the dark. \u201cThe players are really buying into how I want them to defend,\u201d said Edwards, \u201cand what has been as important this year is the style of play. French teams in the past have maybe overplayed in their own half, but by mixing French flair with some structured rugby, we were able to beat a high-quality opponent like Wales on their own ground. We have to keep it up next week because when Wales won the grand slam last year, Scotland were the toughest opponents.\u201d A Scotland victory would mean everyone would have lost at least one match going into the final round. England welcome Wales to Twickenham the day before, having lost at home in the tournament once since 2012, although they drew with Scotland last year. Eddie Jones was in waspish form after the victory over Ireland in the last round, claiming they could have declared at half-time such had been their dominance. England then led 17-0, which was the same score at the interval in Paris on the opening weekend, although it was France who held the advantage on that occasion. It is probably as well that cricket is not very big there. England were restored to full power against Ireland, physically dominating opponents who in the previous round had overwhelmed Wales and neutering their experienced half-backs, Johnny Sexton and Conor Murray. The one blemish was missing out on a bonus point that would have closed the gap with France to three points and put them one ahead of Ireland. If the title comes down to points difference, England and Ireland have an advantage over France because they still have to play Italy, whenever that may be. Les Bleus have a difference of plus 24, England plus 12 and Ireland plus five. Ireland\u2019s average winning margin at home to Italy in the Six Nations is 26 points, but in the past four matches it is nearly 38 points. England have won by an average of 34 points on their past three visits to Rome, so if France lose one of their final two matches, the Six Nations will need to find an alternative date for Ireland\u2019s match against Italy and England\u2019s if their trip to Rome is called off. Otherwise, as happened in the World Cup when Typhoon Hagibis claimed three matches, they would go down as 0-0 draws and lead to a pointless finish.",

What are the best-case and worst-case scenarios?</strong><br>The best case is that the Chinese conflagration is brought under control, the smaller \u201cflames\u201d we\u2019ve seen flare up in other countries are extinguished, there\u2019s little or no spread to new countries or continents, and the epidemic dies out. The worst case is that the outbreak goes global and the disease eventually becomes endemic, meaning it circulates permanently in the human population.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b9327e7b664951164755cc914b132b29b45e84e3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9327e7b664951164755cc914b132b29b45e84e3/110_69_3794_5877/646.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Jonathan Quick\" width=\"646\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Jonathan Quick: \u2018It\u2019s critical not to try to mislead the population.\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steven May/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Your feeling as to which is more likely, as of today, 27 February?</strong><br>The worst-case scenario is looking increasingly likely. We\u2019ve now seen cases on six continents, apparently \u201csilent\u201d \u2013 that is, at least partly asymptomatic \u2013 chains of human-to-human transmission both inside and outside China, with additional countries reporting cases within the last week \u2013 bringing the total to 47 \u2013 and new, accelerating outbreaks in Iran, Italy and South Korea. If it becomes a pandemic, the questions are, how bad will it get and how long will it last? The case fatality rate \u2013 the proportion of cases that are fatal \u2013 has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/01/coronavirus-victims-profile-outlier-impact-cases\" title=\"\">just over 2%</a>, much less than it was for Sars, but 20 times that of seasonal flu. There are still many unknowns \u2013 we may have underestimated the period during which a person is contagious, for instance, and the variety of ways in which the virus spreads.</p> \n<p><strong>If the worst-case scenario comes true, are there still things we can do to minimise the pandemic\u2019s impact?</strong><br>Absolutely. We can mobilise more health officials and keep engaging the public, implementing sensible travel controls and ensuring that frontline health workers have ready access to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/21/nhs-to-test-londoners-for-coronavirus-at-home\" title=\"\">diagnostic tests</a> and are vigilant \u2013 that they don\u2019t send anyone who may have been exposed home without testing them, for example. Judging by past experience, however, it\u2019s likely that health officials and the public in much of the world remain unaware or unconvinced of the danger this virus poses.</p> \n<p><strong>You have said that time and trust are critical to good epidemic management. What do you mean?</strong><br>The delay between the frontline health workers noticing something unusual, in the form of an emerging disease, and that information travelling up the line to central decision-makers is critical. To illustrate that, a 2018 simulation that the <a href=\"https://www.gatesfoundation.org/\" title=\"\">Gates Foundation</a> conducted of a flu pandemic estimated that there would be 28,000 deaths after one month, 10 million after three months, and 33 million after six months. The virus used in that simulation was more contagious and deadly than Covid-19 \u2013 though they are both respiratory viruses \u2013 but the example shows how all epidemics grow exponentially. So if you can catch an epidemic in the first few weeks, it makes all the difference. As for trust, it\u2019s critical to disseminate dispassionate, evidence-based information, and not to try to mislead the population. If you do, they will stop cooperating. Let\u2019s hope that doesn\u2019t happen in China.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/02/corona-carousel\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Judging by reports, we\u2019re at least a year out from having an approved Covid-19 vaccine. Once one is available, do you think there will be a problem of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/13/vaccines-hesitant-parents-threat-to-global-health\" title=\"\">vaccine hesitancy</a>, as there has been with some of the resurgent childhood diseases?</strong><br>Evidence suggests that vaccine hesitancy diminishes when lots of people are dying. Once an outbreak is over, however, levels of vaccine uptake may depend on how fresh that outbreak is in people\u2019s minds \u2013 even though the risk of another one is real. I\u2019ve written about a hypothetical situation in which a new and dangerous pathogen emerges, a vaccine is developed, and you still get a pandemic, because large numbers of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/feb/10/yes-millennials-are-dumbasses-for-being-scared-of-vaccinations\" title=\"\">millennials refuse the vaccine</a>. In the US, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/1/31/7954725/vaccines-autism-young-adults\">20</a><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/1/31/7954725/vaccines-autism-young-adults\">% of millennials</a> believe that vaccines cause autism. The problem is bad information. As my students often remind me, news tends to be behind paywalls, while fake news is free.</p> \n<p><strong>Is it plausible that the Chinese have already created a Covid-19 vaccine?</strong><br>The US drug company <a href=\"https://time.com/5790545/first-covid-19-vaccine/\" title=\"\">Moderna</a> is the only one I\u2019m aware of that has a Covid-19 vaccine ready for human trials. Those are due to start in April. Chinese firms are new to the global vaccine market, but at least one, <a href=\"https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/gsk-gives-clover-adjuvant-for-vaccine-against-indispensable-covid-19-protein\" title=\"\">Clover Biopharmaceuticals</a>, is working to develop a Covid-19 vaccine.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/26/what-is-coronavirus-symptoms-wuhan-china-covid-19\">What is coronavirus and what should I do if I have symptoms?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>It appears that the Covid-19 virus originated in a \u201cwet\u201d or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/25/coronavirus-closures-reveal-vast-scale-of-chinas-secretive-wildlife-farm-industry\" title=\"\">live animal market</a>. Should such markets be banned?</strong><br>No. The Chinese government tried that after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/sars\" title=\"\">Sars</a>. The markets just went underground. They need to be better regulated, and there needs to be active surveillance. Active monitoring and culling of poultry populations in Asia has stamped out outbreaks of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/15/china-first-human-case-h7n4-bird-flu\" title=\"\">avian flu</a> in those populations.</p> \n<p><strong>Was an epidemic like that of Covid-19 inevitable?</strong><br>From a biological standpoint an outbreak of a novel pathogen was inevitable, but this one happened in the worst place at the worst time. Wuhan is a big city and a crossroads, and the first cases were recorded there just before the lunar new year, when large numbers of people were about to travel to visit their families.</p> \n<p><strong>In terms of containing it, was it a good or a bad thing that it happened in China?</strong><br>As of five months ago, we have a measure of epidemic preparedness \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.ghsindex.org/\" title=\"\">Global Health Security (GHS) Index</a> \u2013 that scores countries on six dimensions: prevention, detection, response, health system, risk environment and compliance with international standards. No country scores perfectly on all six. China has detected and responded to this epidemic pretty well, though its health system is now stretched beyond capacity, but it is weak on prevention \u2013 particularly when it comes to food safety.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c07b495185e533b851647e74ac37e17f84811d3b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c07b495185e533b851647e74ac37e17f84811d3b/0_0_2054_1358/1000.jpg\" alt=\"iraj harirchi the iranian deputy health minister mops his brow during a press conference in tehran last monday\" width=\"1000\" height=\"661\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iraj Harirchi (left), the Iranian deputy health minister, who has tested positive for coronavirus, mops his brow during a press conference in Tehran last Monday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>How well is the US prepared?</strong><br>The US ranks high on the GHS index, but is still unprepared for a severe pandemic, should one happen.

      "bodyText": "In 2018 global health expert Jonathan D Quick, of Duke University in North Carolina, published a book titled The End of Epidemics: The Looming Threat to Humanity and How to Stop It. In it he prescribed measures by which the world could protect itself against devastating disease outbreaks of the likes of the 1918 flu, which killed millions and set humanity back decades. He is the former chair of the Global Health Council and a long-term collaborator of the World Health Organization (WHO). The Covid-19 epidemic looks like it\u2019s edging towards becoming a pandemic \u2013 that is, as the WHO defines it, \u201cthe worldwide spread of a new disease\u201d \u2013 but the WHO hasn\u2019t declared a pandemic yet. What are the best-case and worst-case scenarios? The best case is that the Chinese conflagration is brought under control, the smaller \u201cflames\u201d we\u2019ve seen flare up in other countries are extinguished, there\u2019s little or no spread to new countries or continents, and the epidemic dies out. The worst case is that the outbreak goes global and the disease eventually becomes endemic, meaning it circulates permanently in the human population. Your feeling as to which is more likely, as of today, 27 February? The worst-case scenario is looking increasingly likely. We\u2019ve now seen cases on six continents, apparently \u201csilent\u201d \u2013 that is, at least partly asymptomatic \u2013 chains of human-to-human transmission both inside and outside China, with additional countries reporting cases within the last week \u2013 bringing the total to 47 \u2013 and new, accelerating outbreaks in Iran, Italy and South Korea. If it becomes a pandemic, the questions are, how bad will it get and how long will it last? The case fatality rate \u2013 the proportion of cases that are fatal \u2013 has been just over 2%, much less than it was for Sars, but 20 times that of seasonal flu. There are still many unknowns \u2013 we may have underestimated the period during which a person is contagious, for instance, and the variety of ways in which the virus spreads. If the worst-case scenario comes true, are there still things we can do to minimise the pandemic\u2019s impact? Absolutely. We can mobilise more health officials and keep engaging the public, implementing sensible travel controls and ensuring that frontline health workers have ready access to diagnostic tests and are vigilant \u2013 that they don\u2019t send anyone who may have been exposed home without testing them, for example. Judging by past experience, however, it\u2019s likely that health officials and the public in much of the world remain unaware or unconvinced of the danger this virus poses. You have said that time and trust are critical to good epidemic management. What do you mean? The delay between the frontline health workers noticing something unusual, in the form of an emerging disease, and that information travelling up the line to central decision-makers is critical. To illustrate that, a 2018 simulation that the Gates Foundation conducted of a flu pandemic estimated that there would be 28,000 deaths after one month, 10 million after three months, and 33 million after six months. The virus used in that simulation was more contagious and deadly than Covid-19 \u2013 though they are both respiratory viruses \u2013 but the example shows how all epidemics grow exponentially. So if you can catch an epidemic in the first few weeks, it makes all the difference. As for trust, it\u2019s critical to disseminate dispassionate, evidence-based information, and not to try to mislead the population. If you do, they will stop cooperating. Let\u2019s hope that doesn\u2019t happen in China. Judging by reports, we\u2019re at least a year out from having an approved Covid-19 vaccine. Once one is available, do you think there will be a problem of vaccine hesitancy, as there has been with some of the resurgent childhood diseases? Evidence suggests that vaccine hesitancy diminishes when lots of people are dying. Once an outbreak is over, however, levels of vaccine uptake may depend on how fresh that outbreak is in people\u2019s minds \u2013 even though the risk of another one is real. I\u2019ve written about a hypothetical situation in which a new and dangerous pathogen emerges, a vaccine is developed, and you still get a pandemic, because large numbers of millennials refuse the vaccine. In the US, 20% of millennials believe that vaccines cause autism. The problem is bad information. As my students often remind me, news tends to be behind paywalls, while fake news is free. Is it plausible that the Chinese have already created a Covid-19 vaccine? The US drug company Moderna is the only one I\u2019m aware of that has a Covid-19 vaccine ready for human trials. Those are due to start in April. Chinese firms are new to the global vaccine market, but at least one, Clover Biopharmaceuticals, is working to develop a Covid-19 vaccine. It appears that the Covid-19 virus originated in a \u201cwet\u201d or live animal market. Should such markets be banned? No. The Chinese government tried that after Sars. The markets just went underground. They need to be better regulated, and there needs to be active surveillance. Active monitoring and culling of poultry populations in Asia has stamped out outbreaks of avian flu in those populations. Was an epidemic like that of Covid-19 inevitable? From a biological standpoint an outbreak of a novel pathogen was inevitable, but this one happened in the worst place at the worst time. Wuhan is a big city and a crossroads, and the first cases were recorded there just before the lunar new year, when large numbers of people were about to travel to visit their families. In terms of containing it, was it a good or a bad thing that it happened in China? As of five months ago, we have a measure of epidemic preparedness \u2013 the Global Health Security (GHS) Index \u2013 that scores countries on six dimensions: prevention, detection, response, health system, risk environment and compliance with international standards. No country scores perfectly on all six. China has detected and responded to this epidemic pretty well, though its health system is now stretched beyond capacity, but it is weak on prevention \u2013 particularly when it comes to food safety. How well is the US prepared? The US ranks high on the GHS index, but is still unprepared for a severe pandemic, should one happen. Malfunctioning coronavirus tests have frustrated public health labs and delayed outbreak monitoring. Supplies of masks, suits and other protective material for health workers are running low in the midst of a moderately severe flu season. Since the creation of a much-needed public health emergency preparedness fund in the aftermath of 9/11, its budget and the public health functions it supports have been steadily reduced. This is the mentality that left the world vulnerable to the devastating 2014 outbreak of Ebola in west Africa \u2013 that is, close the fire department and cancel the fire insurance as nobody\u2019s house or factory has burned down lately. It\u2019s time we learned that the bugs never stop mutating and crossing over to humans. Has the world been an ostrich over pandemic risk? Generally speaking, no. After each major recent outbreak \u2013 Sars, swine flu, Ebola \u2013 we\u2019ve moved ahead. The GHS Index is itself a big advance, because we can now see where individual countries are weak in terms of preparedness. We should be moving faster, though. What exactly should we be doing faster? Fewer than one in three countries are close to being prepared to confront an epidemic, which leaves the vast majority of the world\u2019s population vulnerable. That in turn leaves us all vulnerable because we\u2019re only as safe as the least safe place. We need to invest more in preparedness, and we need our leaders to take a greater interest in it \u2013 that\u2019s all leaders, in both the public and private sectors \u2013 from the grass roots to the grass tops. Is a global health agency essential to managing a pandemic, and is the WHO up to the task? A global health agency is essential, yes. None of the advances I\u2019ve mentioned could have happened without the WHO\u2019s involvement, but the WHO can only perform as well as its members allow it to \u2013 and they have pulled back on funding since the 2008 financial crisis. Your book is optimistically entitled The End of Epidemics. Could we ever really wave goodbye to epidemics? The world will continue to have disease outbreaks, but there is plenty we can do to protect ourselves against global catastrophes like the 1918 flu.",

      "body": "<p>After a brief interlude during a trip back to Ireland, the boy\u2019s sickness has returned with a vengeance. We were called by the childminder to come and pick him up, because he\u2019d been sick again. It was worse this time, and our sense of distress was enhanced by the indignity of false hope, since our trip home had proved mostly painless. He now had a high temperature and a cough that could strip paint. The minor hardship we\u2019d experienced the week before appeared to have been little more than an hors d\u2019oeuvre.</p> <p>My natural refuge in any time of stress is the internet \u2013 eg five minutes ago when I couldn\u2019t spell \u2018hors d\u2019oeuvre\u2019 and Googled \u2018hrouresdearveses\u2019 \u2013 but this seemed like a better candidate for good old-fashioned, face-to-face doctoring. Besides, my wife and I are incapable of searching my son\u2019s symptoms without concluding he has coronavirus, so we thought it best that a professional decide.</p> <p>I raced him to the doctor, not so much out of urgency but because our appointment coincided with a torrential downpour. All of which he found so exciting he\u2019d forgotten he was ill by the time we arrived. This was not the ideal moment for me to be flustered and damp, and for him to be alert, smiling, and conspicuously lacking the cough he\u2019d had for the previous 12 hours.</p> <p>I was confronted with a weird sense of annoyance that my child seemed better. Some part of you fears the doctor will think you\u2019re lying or, worse, are one of those overbearing TV parents, cradling a perfectly healthy child and demanding someone donate an entire hospital ward to his care. \u2018Come on,\u2019 I thought to myself, my brave little soldier acting altogether too brave for my liking. \u2018Give us a few coughs, that\u2019s a good boy.\u2019</p> <p>Luckily, this is not how medicine actually works, and my doctor discerned the problem with that unshowy confidence they always have. I revert to childhood around doctors, happy for them to take control, to relinquish my adulthood entirely. I envy this of doctors most of all \u2013 to be an adult, a real adult, one who never Googles their ailments (or \u2018ourrsdeoeurvs\u2019), who spends their days helping people, putting them at ease, and in their downtime, doing that thing where they push themselves backwards on a wheeled chair so they can get something out of a sliding drawer behind them. There are, I\u2019m sure, aspects of medical life that are less fun. It\u2019s just I lack the imagination to consider them when I\u2019m face to face with someone who gets to have a life-sized plastic skeleton in their office.</p> <p>In the end, he diagnosed my son with mild croup and not the coronavirus I had promised myself I wouldn\u2019t talk about, but ended up mentioning several times. My son got a sticker, tried to eat it, and began crying as I fastened it to my own shirt instead. \u2018Come now, you\u2019ve been a very brave boy,\u2019 the doctor said. \u2018Thank you,\u2019 I replied, \u2018I have, haven\u2019t I?\u2019</p> <p><em>Follow S\u00e9amas on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shockproofbeats?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@shockproofbeats</a></em></p>",

He now had a high temperature and a cough that could strip paint. The minor hardship we\u2019d experienced the week before appeared to have been little more than an hors d\u2019oeuvre. My natural refuge in any time of stress is the internet \u2013 eg five minutes ago when I couldn\u2019t spell \u2018hors d\u2019oeuvre\u2019 and Googled \u2018hrouresdearveses\u2019 \u2013 but this seemed like a better candidate for good old-fashioned, face-to-face doctoring. Besides, my wife and I are incapable of searching my son\u2019s symptoms without concluding he has coronavirus, so we thought it best that a professional decide. I raced him to the doctor, not so much out of urgency but because our appointment coincided with a torrential downpour. All of which he found so exciting he\u2019d forgotten he was ill by the time we arrived. This was not the ideal moment for me to be flustered and damp, and for him to be alert, smiling, and conspicuously lacking the cough he\u2019d had for the previous 12 hours. I was confronted with a weird sense of annoyance that my child seemed better. Some part of you fears the doctor will think you\u2019re lying or, worse, are one of those overbearing TV parents, cradling a perfectly healthy child and demanding someone donate an entire hospital ward to his care. \u2018Come on,\u2019 I thought to myself, my brave little soldier acting altogether too brave for my liking. \u2018Give us a few coughs, that\u2019s a good boy.\u2019 Luckily, this is not how medicine actually works, and my doctor discerned the problem with that unshowy confidence they always have. I revert to childhood around doctors, happy for them to take control, to relinquish my adulthood entirely. I envy this of doctors most of all \u2013 to be an adult, a real adult, one who never Googles their ailments (or \u2018ourrsdeoeurvs\u2019), who spends their days helping people, putting them at ease, and in their downtime, doing that thing where they push themselves backwards on a wheeled chair so they can get something out of a sliding drawer behind them. There are, I\u2019m sure, aspects of medical life that are less fun. It\u2019s just I lack the imagination to consider them when I\u2019m face to face with someone who gets to have a life-sized plastic skeleton in their office. In the end, he diagnosed my son with mild croup and not the coronavirus I had promised myself I wouldn\u2019t talk about, but ended up mentioning several times. My son got a sticker, tried to eat it, and began crying as I fastened it to my own shirt instead. \u2018Come now, you\u2019ve been a very brave boy,\u2019 the doctor said. \u2018Thank you,\u2019 I replied, \u2018I have, haven\u2019t I?\u2019 Follow S\u00e9amas on Twitter @shockproofbeats",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person.

      "bodyText": "Government lawyers are assessing the possibility of delaying the local authority, mayoral and police and crime commissioner elections in May if the coronavirus outbreak continues to escalate, the Guardian can disclose. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said on Sunday the government was considering all options, from closing schools to isolating entire cities if Covid-19 became a pandemic. He said ministers would publish a plan this week to explain how they may tackle such an event. An email sent to board members of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners on Saturday by its chief executive, Susannah Hancock, reveals that these measures would also include potentially delaying the forthcoming elections. She said that the Home Office, in discussions with the Cabinet Office, had sought legal advice on postponing the elections. \u201cWe have had a number of inquiries today regarding the PCC elections, coronavirus and whether the May PCC and local elections will take place,\u201d the email reads. \u201cI have spoken with the Home Office and they are currently liaising with Cabinet Office to understand their latest thinking and planning on this.\u201d The Home Office \u201care also engaging lawyers at their end to understand how things could proceed and what if any primary legislation might be needed etc\u201d. She added that the Home Office would keep the APCC updated and that police and crime commissioners would be briefed soon. \u201cWe can get further information out to PCCs once we have more info next week, but I wanted to let you know the latest and that work is in hand.\u201d The local elections are due to be held on Thursday 7 May. About 118 English councils will be contested, along with eight directly elected mayors in England and 40 police and crime commissioners in England and Wales. In 2001, the local elections were delayed because of the foot and mouth epidemic, the first delay to local elections since the second world war, as more than 6 million sheep, cattle and pigs were slaughtered to contain the outbreak. A government spokesperson said the UK was \u201cextremely well prepared for these types of outbreaks\u201d but would not comment directly on the plans to assess the possibility of delaying the elections. \u201cWe are continuing to work closely across government, with the World Health Organization and the international community as the outbreak develops to ensure we are ready for all eventualities,\u201d they said. An Electoral Commission spokesperson said: \u201cThe commission and the electoral community are working hard to ensure that the scheduled May elections can go ahead as planned, as well as monitoring the developing issue of the coronavirus and its potential impact. \u201cAny changes to the date of May\u2019s polls would be a matter for the UK government and parliament. In the event of any changes to the date, we would work with the electoral community to minimise any potential disruption.\u201d",

Twenty-two Americans have coronavirus that is either travel-related or was spread from another person, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Of the Americans repatriated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship and Wuhan, China, 47 have tested positive for coronavirus. According to the latest World Health Organization (WHO) situation report, there have been reports of 83,652 cases of coronavirus and nearly 2,800 deaths worldwide. The majority of cases are in China but severe outbreaks have been reported in Iran, South Korea and Italy. On Saturday, Pence announced measures including new travel restrictions on Iran and screening of passengers coming to the US from other countries.",

It is a situation where fear can spread faster than the pathogen, according to David Owen, chief European economist at the US Bank Jefferies, who said most economic losses from infectious disease outbreaks result from the actions of unaffected individuals. There are many lessons. Globalisation, technology and climate change make the spread of viral disease easier and incubate many other social and economic ills. Lurching headlong into a protectionist and luddite world will not provide adequate and lasting solutions. The scale of our collective problems demand international coordination.",

Political prisoner Chau Van Kham, 70, was arrested in Vietnam in January 2019, accused of meeting with fellow members of Viet Tan, a pro-democracy advocacy group proscribed by Vietnam\u2019s communist government, and of helping finance the organisation. Chau\u2019s single-day judge-only trial, held simultaneously with four other people, saw him tried and convicted on charges of \u201cfinancing terrorism\u201d, and sentenced to 12 years in jail, all within four hours. The court was effectively closed \u2013 open only for approved people, his family was excluded \u2013 for the entirety of the trial. Speaking at the United Nations\u2019 Geneva summit for human rights and democracy in February, Chau\u2019s son, Dennis, described his father\u2019s 12-year sentence as \u201ceffectively a death sentence\u201d. \u201cThe entire charade was rushed and improper.

Dennis Chau said he feared his father could not survive his prison sentence. \u201cHe\u2019s held in a cell for 23 hours of the day with one hour of exercise permitted.

Factoring in prison conditions and poor access to medical treatments, I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ll ever see him alive, a free man. It\u2019s effectively a death sentence.\u201d Chau\u2019s appeal against his conviction and sentence will be heard early Monday morning in Ho Chi Minh City. In response to his appeal, the prosecution have added to their indictment a request he be deported from Vietnam after he serves his sentence. Sources close to Chau say they have little faith in the appeals process, and little hope for a quashing or reduction in his sentence. A US citizen, Michael Nguyen, convicted on identical charges, and also sentenced to 12 years in jail, had his sentence confirmed in a recent appeal. Chau\u2019s family and supporters say the Australian government needs to more aggressively pressure the Vietnamese government over what they argue is clearly a political prosecution. He has been allowed one meeting with his lawyer ahead of his appeal. Previously, Chau had been granted one consular visit a month \u2013 always observed by Vietnamese security officials \u2013 but Australian consular officials were denied a meeting in February, with authorities citing concerns over coronavirus for cancelling all consular visits for prisoners. Chau, an Australian citizen, was born in Vietnam and served in the army of the Republic of Vietnam before 1975. After the war, he was sent to a re-education camp for three years, before he fled Vietnam by boat, arriving in Australia in 1983. In Sydney, he worked as a baker for decades, rising before dawn to work at a modest suburban bakery. In 2010, he became a member of the Viet Tan pro-democracy organisation, and became a key Australian organiser of pro-reform rallies and an outspoken advocate for democratisation in Vietnam. In the 1980s, Viet Tan had advocated for the toppling of the communist government through popular uprising, but in recent years it has explicitly \u201crejected the use of violence\u201d, stating the organisation is \u201cconvinced that nonviolent means are most effective for generating maximum civic participation \u2026 to contribute to Vietnam\u2019s modernisation and reform\u201d. The United Nations describes Viet Tan as \u201ca peaceful organisation advocating for democratic reform\u201d, but it was formally proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the Vietnamese government in 2016, which said it was \u201ca reactionary and terrorist organisation, always silently carrying out activities against Vietnam\u201d. Chau sought to return to Vietnam in 2019 to meet fellow pro-democracy advocates but was refused a visa by the Vietnamese government. He chose to cross into Vietnam via a land border with Cambodia in January, carrying false identity documents. He was later arrested after meeting with a democracy activist who, it is believed, was under surveillance, along with Vietnamese nationals Nguyen Van Vien and Tran Van Quyen, who were sentenced to 11 and 10 years in prison respectively. Chau was initially charged with participating in activities aimed at overthrowing the government, but in July this was downgraded to \u201cterrorism to oppose the people\u2019s government\u201d. Vietnam\u2019s Ministry of Public Security said in a statement Chau was convicted of holding a senior position in the New South Wales chapter of Viet Tan, for \u201cfinancing terrorism\u201d and for recruiting new members to the movement. Dennis Chau said his father was a peaceful man, committed to campaigning for a more democratic Vietnam. \u201cMy father came to Australia with nothing but the clothes on his back as a refugee after the Vietnam war. He worked hard all his life to make something for him and his family in his new adopted home.

      "bodyText": "When he arrived in August last year, new Seven West Media boss James Warburton promised to enlarge the ailing media company by hunting down and buying businesses. But now, just six months later, the veteran media executive is dealing with the fallout from the failure of his first takeover bid, an effort to take control of regional affiliate Prime that would have transformed Seven\u2019s dismal finances. After being stymied in their bid for Prime, Warburton and Seven\u2019s biggest shareholder, West Australian billionaire Kerry Stokes, would be painfully aware that time is ticking to repay or refinance the $683m it owes to a syndicate of banks. The first instalment is due in November next year, and if it cannot satisfy its lenders, Seven could go the way of fellow broadcaster Ten and fall into administration. Warburton\u2019s freedom to move is also constricted by his pledge to rip $100m in costs out of Seven, a move taken with at least one eye on the need for the company to stay within strict financial constraints set by its banks as a condition of their loans. This, along with the ratings failure of this year\u2019s season of My Kitchen Rules and the possibility that this year\u2019s Olympics could be cancelled due to the coronavirus crisis, will make it harder for him to achieve his other ambition, restoring Seven to its place as the TV network with the most viewers. All this is taking place in a commercial TV industry that is in a grim situation, as demonstrated by financial results released by Seven and its long-time rival Nine over the past fortnight, and a broader media landscape that isn\u2019t much better. Seven declared a loss for the half-year to the end of December of $67.4m, a dramatic fall from the $117m booked for the same period in the previous year, after writing down the value of its broadcasting licence. Warburton has been through the commercial TV mill before. He was sacked as chief executive of Ten by the board \u2013 then chaired by Lachlan Murdoch \u2013 in 2013. That means he can\u2019t be blamed for Ten\u2019s subsequent collapse, in 2017, after two key shareholders, Murdoch and Bermuda-based billionaire Bruce Gordon, refused to continue their guarantee of a $200m loan. The Prime deal \u2013 and Antony Catalano The Prime deal was an obvious play for Warburton because just before becoming CEO of Seven, he was reportedly leading a private equity-backed consortium that mulled taking over Prime. Sources say the Seven board was initially attracted to Warburton as a contrast to the previous CEO, Tim Worner, who had been wounded by a scandal over his affair with a staffer. \u201cAll of a sudden you\u2019ve got what a board wants to hear \u2013 someone who unlike Tim has creative ways to build momentum,\u201d an industry source said. However, there is no doubt that under Warburton Seven invested heavily in the Prime deal \u2013 the company estimated it would spend $2.8m just to pull it off, in an industry where every penny counts. The rewards would also have been great, with $11m in cost savings a year to be made by combining the company\u2019s operations. Seven would also have been bolstered by Prime\u2019s financial strength \u2013 unlike its big city cousin, the regional broadcaster\u2019s balance sheet is all but free from debt. The deal was endorsed by Prime\u2019s board, headed at the time by former News Corp executive John Hartigan. But in December it fell apart after opposition from two key shareholders \u2013 Gordon, who controlled 11% of the stock, and a company called WA Chess, controlled by mini-mogul Antony Catalano and billionaire Alex Waislitz. Catalano, a former journalist from Melbourne, made his name \u2013 and fortune \u2013 by building a rival group of glossy local newspapers after leaving Fairfax. He sold the group to Fairfax, which spun it into the Domain group, where he was CEO until leaving in 2018. Waislitz, the former son-in-law of box king Richard Pratt, is Catalano\u2019s financial backer. He bankrolled Catalano\u2019s purchase of Australian Community Media, a string of former regional papers Nine sold after taking over Fairfax Media in 2018. These include mastheads in WA, sparking a stoush over printing with Seven\u2019s West Australian News, which has newspapers in the state including the West Australian and a string of regionals. As part of the ACM deal, Catalano acquired a printing press in Mandurah that was geared up for the big page counts \u2013 200 or more for the Mandurah Mail \u2013 and large circulations of print\u2019s golden era. \u201cIt was tremendously profitable and booming in those halcyon days of 2012-13,\u201d a source with knowledge of Fairfax Media\u2019s operations in WA said. \u201cThey\u2019d be struggling now, like all printing operations.\u201d Industry sources say Catalano would like to save money by closing Mandurah and printing on Seven\u2019s presses. \u201cIt was not considered a poor performer but clearly any consolidation with WAN would save costs for both sides,\u201d another source with deep knowledge of Fairfax\u2019s former regional network said. Unfortunately, Catalano\u2019s role in the Prime caper appears to have soured Stokes on the idea. \u201cI don\u2019t think Kerry\u2019s inclined to do anything for him,\u201d one senior industry source said. \u201cThe way that was left after the failed takeover \u2026 I just can\u2019t see them doing any favours for Antony.\u201d Asked whether there had been any discussions about a print deal with ACM, Seven\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cAny commercial discussions SWM is having with any party are confidential.\u201d Catalano didn\u2019t respond to Guardian Australia\u2019s request for comment. But a source close to Catalano played down his responsibility for the collapse of the Prime deal. \u201cI reckon ego got in the way of closing it,\u201d the source said. \u201cBruce and Ant were probably sellers at the right price.\u201d Warburton is not without options. He has already sold the WA radio business, Redwave, for $28m in much-needed cash. Also in the works is the sale of Pacific Magazines, home of titles including New Idea, to rival Bauer, which will reap $40m but is opposed by the competition regulator. Seven is also looking at selling its production studio, which makes programs including soap opera Home &amp; Away. UBS analyst Eric Choi thinks it could fetch as much as $400m. In a note to clients, Choi also said Seven could reap $75m by flogging off land belonging to WAN and leasing it back. These sales would \u201coffset a large portion\u201d of the company\u2019s debt pile, he said. Critics say the sales program will shrink the company\u2019s earnings because much of what is on the block makes money. And it is not clear how much debt Seven needs to get rid of to satisfy its bankers. Seven\u2019s spokesman refused to say how much of the pile falls due in November next year, or clarify the debt covenants to which it has agreed with the banks. \u201cThey\u2019ve got all sorts of banking restrictions they\u2019re going to hit soon,\u201d a well-placed source said. Seven\u2019s spokesman said the media market was \u201cuncertain\u201d. \u201cTo counter uncertainties the directors approved actions to ensure adequate covenant headroom,\u201d he said. \u201cSWM remains well within covenant levels.\u201d At the same time, industry sources insist the psychological blow of losing the spot as number one network to Nine has real consequences. \u201cThe most significant thing is that they\u2019ve been usurped as the number one network,\u201d one source said. \u201cThat can change the whole sense of their performance. \u201cNine has all the momentum, even though it\u2019s a pretty narrow lead.\u201d",

Here are some of the key subjects the committee is likely to quiz him on.</p> <p><strong>His record<br></strong>When Bailey was appointed he was widely hailed as a \u201csafe pair of hands\u201d.

      "bodyText": "When the cross-party Treasury committee is officially appointed on Monday, one of its first tasks will be to question Andrew Bailey over his role as the next governor of the Bank of England, which he is due to start on 16 March. This is standard procedure for the influential group of MPs, but comes at a time of great challenge for an incoming governor, not least amid the unfolding economic collapse caused by the coronavirus outbreak. Bailey, who replaces Mark Carney and was chosen as his successor in December by the former chancellor Sajid Javid, will face several urgent tasks in his opening weeks and months as governor to address \u2013 as well as some potentially awkward questions. Here are some of the key subjects the committee is likely to quiz him on. His record When Bailey was appointed he was widely hailed as a \u201csafe pair of hands\u201d. However, critics of his time at the Financial Conduct Authority beg to differ. Gina Miller, the businesswoman best known for her legal challenge to the government\u2019s attempt to push through Brexit without parliamentary approval, is leading a group calling for a review of Bailey\u2019s appointment and has welcomed the Treasury committee\u2019s opportunity to examine his record. Miller has highlighted his reaction to the collapse of investments run by London Capital &amp; Finance, and the liquidation of Neil Woodford\u2019s once-popular flagship investment fund, among other things. \u201cThe hundreds of thousands of Britain\u2019s depositors, savers, investors and pensioners whose lives have been ruined and savings squandered, on Mr Bailey\u2019s watch as CEO of the Financial Conduct Authority, deserve no less,\u201d Miller said. Bailey has argued on many of the issues that the FCA\u2019s statutory powers were limited. However, the scandals have overshadowed his time at the regulator. Coronavirus There are questions about how much the Bank can do to support the economy given the global nature of the coronavirus outbreak and the limited firepower central banks have at their disposal to combat an economic downturn. Bailey arrives with interest rates still close to the lowest levels in the Bank\u2019s 325-year history, at 0.75%, only 0.25 percentage points higher than when Carney started at the Bank almost seven years ago and limiting the scope for further cuts if deemed necessary. Whether Bailey will be able to make much of an inroad into returning rates to more normal levels will be closely watched. Brexit The British economy could be put under renewed strain later this year as the Brexit negotiations gather pace ahead of the deadline for the UK\u2019s exit from the transition period at the end of December, which Boris Johnson has warned he will not extend. Once the dust from the coronavirus outbreak has settled, the path for interest rates and the continued stability of the financial system will partly depend on the nation\u2019s new trading relationship with the EU, and the extent to which there are tougher barriers, friction at Britain\u2019s borders and whether there is a smooth or abrupt transition. Carney had been accused of bringing the central bank\u2019s independence into question, given his repeated warnings about the threat posed by Brexit to the UK economy and banking system. Serving under the government of Boris Johnson, the new governor could face more questions about Britain\u2019s future relationship with the EU. Climate As governor, Mark Carney brought to the top of the agenda the importance of global heating as a problem for central bankers to address, warning about the existential crisis facing the world financial system. Threadneedle Street is preparing to run a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d climate-related stress test next year, a landmark moment. Bailey will need to show early on that he will take the issue as seriously as his predecessor. Hedge fund scandal Bailey is likely to face questions about the embarrassing revelation about a backup audio feed that without the Bank\u2019s knowledge potentially allowed traders early access to an audio feed of market-moving Bank press conferences. The answers to those questions could have broader implications for how the Bank protects key national infrastructure, amid criticisms of where accountability lies for failures at the institution. Diversity Bailey is set to become the 121st governor \u2013 and the 121st man to take the role. That imbalance is mirrored throughout the top levels of the Bank, with a lack of gender or ethnic diversity in top jobs. There is only one woman, Silvana Tenreyro, on the Bank\u2019s nine-member rate-setting monetary policy committee. Across the Bank Bailey will be pressured to close ethnicity and gender pay gaps, as well as increase representation, which sometimes went backwards during Carney\u2019s tenure. Independence The Bank of England is run at arm\u2019s length from the government to preserve its independence at setting interest rates and producing economic forecasts. As the government expands its spending \u2013 boosting the economy \u2013 the Bank of England may feel the need to raise interest rates to stop inflationary pressures building. That could bring the Bank into conflict with the government and Johnson\u2019s choice as chancellor, Rishi Sunak. How Threadneedle Street and Downing Street work together will be a key question of Bailey\u2019s regime \u2013 and potentially his legacy as governor.",

      "bodyText": "The Bundesliga saw further protests against Hoffenheim investor Dietmar Hopp on Sunday, twice prompting the referee to stop play during Wolfsburg and Union Berlin\u2019s 2-2 draw. Offensive banners insulting Hopp were unveiled by Union Berlin fans just before half-time prompting the referee to stop the game and order the players back into the dressing rooms. Union\u2019s players went over to the home tribune to plead with fans to take down the banners, with captain Christopher Trimmel seen in direct conversation to one of the ultras in a bid to get the game re-started. A later protest against the Deutscher Fu\u00dfball-Bund\u2019s (DFB) position on collective punishments and a perceived \u2018currying of favour\u2019 with Hopp saw the game stopped again as fans were warned that another indiscretion would lead to match being called off. The incidents occurred after similar scenes at Hoffenheim\u2019s Rhein-Neckar-Arena during Bayern Munich\u2019s 6-0 win on Saturday. There Bayern players and executives also tried to intervene to get banners insulting Hoop taken down as the game was held up for 20 minutes. Hopp has been a lightning rod for some German fans, who oppose the way he used his wealth to help Hoffenheim climb through the lower leagues to the Bundesliga with consecutive promotions more than a decade ago.

John Purcell Coventry \u2022 I became a great-grandparent last week, and the joy and delight was mixed with such strong feelings of anxiety, depression and anger at the shitty world into which the little fellow has been born. Then I saw the protests by schoolchildren waiting to hear Greta Thunberg speak (Report, 29 February). My heart was lifted. Maybe there is some hope for him... Maggie Warwick Leeds \u2022 So Newcastle United FC players and staff are no longer shaking hands because of the coronavirus outbreak (Sport, 29 February). What\u2019s the wider guidance from the government on this commonly practised ritual? The classic chant \u201cyou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing\u201d springs to mind. Liz O\u2019Connell St Albans, Hertfordshire \u2022 In all this correspondence (Letters, 29 February), no one has mentioned one of the best marmalade treats: marmalade tea, made with one dessertspoonful and boiling water. Wonderful. At 85, I have it most days. Maryrose Romer Mayfield, East Sussex \u2022 Mention of the \u201clord of the dark settee\u201d (Letters, 29 February) reminds me of an assembly at a Salford high school when I heard students singing about the \u201clord of the damp settee\u201d. Up \u2019ere, of course, vowels are flatter. Ann Hudson Prestwich, Manchester \u2022 At my east Midlands Sunday school, aged five, I was taught the same song, but heard \u201cdamn settee\u201d. My Catholic granny wasn\u2019t pleased!

      "body": "<p>One of the most striking aspects of turbulent times in British politics is the determination with which Boris Johnson\u2019s administration appears to actively court conflict at the heart of government and beyond. In the wake of Sir Philip Rutnam\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/29/philip-rutnam-resignation-his-full-statement\" title=\"\">unprecedented resignation statement</a> on Saturday morning, in which the former permanent secretary to the Home Office condemned a pattern of bullying and intimidation in Whitehall, one senior ex-civil servant described the Tory leadership as modern-day Jacobins. \u201cThey used to want to preserve our great institutions,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nickmacpherson2?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">tweeted Nick Macpherson</a>. \u201cThey are now hell-bent on destroying them.\u201d</p> <p>The civil service has been a prime target. Sir Philip\u2019s decision to resign after 33 years\u2019 service came after what he described as a \u201cvicious and orchestrated briefing campaign\u201d against him. This was sanctioned, he believes, by his boss, the home secretary, Priti Patel, with whom he had arguments about personnel and Ms Patel\u2019s management style. Sir Philip is now taking legal action against the government on the grounds of constructive dismissal. His statement accused Ms Patel of bullying other Home Office officials by \u201cshouting and swearing, belittling people, making unreasonable and repeated demands\u201d.</p> <p>Ms Patel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/29/who-is-the-real-priti-patel\" title=\"\">has a reputation</a> for being a difficult minister to work with and now faces pressure to answer these serious allegations in parliament. But the notion that this episode was purely the result of a personality clash which got out of hand is implausible. In the most senior echelons of the government, there is a palpable desire to target and remove perceived backsliders from key positions, as the country heads towards a form of departure from the EU that could bring severe economic disruption. Last month it was <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/02/22/top-civil-servants-tories-hit-list/\" title=\"\">anonymously briefed</a> that Downing Street was keen to replace \u201ca few permanent secretaries\u201d, including , whose names could be found on a secret \u201cshitlist\u201d. When pressure was exerted on the former chancellor, Sajid Javid, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/13/javid-resigned-after-johnson-pushed-him-to-sack-advisers\" title=\"\">he chose to resign</a> rather than replace his team of Treasury aides with Downing Street appointees.</p> <p>For this government, acquired experience and expertise counts for far less than ideology. The Treasury and the Home Office are seen by the prime minister and his chief aides as critical to the remaking of post-Brexit Britain: Rishi Sunak, Mr Javid\u2019s successor, will be expected to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/14/points-based-immigration-system-uk-2021-cabinet\" title=\"\">find a way to boost public spending</a> in the \u201cred wall\u201d seats of the north and Midlands, as post-Brexit headwinds almost certainly lead to a fall in GDP growth. This was a task for which Mr Javid\u2019s team, wedded to the fiscal rules he wrote into the Conservatives\u2019 election manifesto, was deemed insufficiently enthusiastic.

      "bodyText": "One of the most striking aspects of turbulent times in British politics is the determination with which Boris Johnson\u2019s administration appears to actively court conflict at the heart of government and beyond. In the wake of Sir Philip Rutnam\u2019s unprecedented resignation statement on Saturday morning, in which the former permanent secretary to the Home Office condemned a pattern of bullying and intimidation in Whitehall, one senior ex-civil servant described the Tory leadership as modern-day Jacobins. \u201cThey used to want to preserve our great institutions,\u201d tweeted Nick Macpherson. \u201cThey are now hell-bent on destroying them.\u201d The civil service has been a prime target. Sir Philip\u2019s decision to resign after 33 years\u2019 service came after what he described as a \u201cvicious and orchestrated briefing campaign\u201d against him. This was sanctioned, he believes, by his boss, the home secretary, Priti Patel, with whom he had arguments about personnel and Ms Patel\u2019s management style. Sir Philip is now taking legal action against the government on the grounds of constructive dismissal. His statement accused Ms Patel of bullying other Home Office officials by \u201cshouting and swearing, belittling people, making unreasonable and repeated demands\u201d. Ms Patel has a reputation for being a difficult minister to work with and now faces pressure to answer these serious allegations in parliament. But the notion that this episode was purely the result of a personality clash which got out of hand is implausible. In the most senior echelons of the government, there is a palpable desire to target and remove perceived backsliders from key positions, as the country heads towards a form of departure from the EU that could bring severe economic disruption. Last month it was anonymously briefed that Downing Street was keen to replace \u201ca few permanent secretaries\u201d, including , whose names could be found on a secret \u201cshitlist\u201d. When pressure was exerted on the former chancellor, Sajid Javid, he chose to resign rather than replace his team of Treasury aides with Downing Street appointees. For this government, acquired experience and expertise counts for far less than ideology. The Treasury and the Home Office are seen by the prime minister and his chief aides as critical to the remaking of post-Brexit Britain: Rishi Sunak, Mr Javid\u2019s successor, will be expected to find a way to boost public spending in the \u201cred wall\u201d seats of the north and Midlands, as post-Brexit headwinds almost certainly lead to a fall in GDP growth. This was a task for which Mr Javid\u2019s team, wedded to the fiscal rules he wrote into the Conservatives\u2019 election manifesto, was deemed insufficiently enthusiastic. The Home Office will be responsible for ending freedom of movement and implementing the government\u2019s new immigration policy from next January. The new regime will supposedly end unskilled migration and could potentially lead to acute labour shortages. The whole Brexit process has been described by one Tory MP as \u201cwalking through a minefield with a blindfold on\u201d. Clearly, only true believers are required for the journey. Sir Philip\u2019s departure is another indication that Britain is currently governed not so much by a political party as by an insurgent movement within a party \u2013 one which intends to take enormous risks. Its leading figures are determined, through studied recklessness, to disrupt, demoralise and goad representatives of the ancien regime. But as Mr Johnson licenses the revolutionary zeal embodied by Dominic Cummings, his chief aide, he would do well to pay more attention to basic issues of good governance. The prime minister has already come in for justified criticism over his failure to visit flood-affected areas, as the February rains inflicted devastation across the land. Impending fatherhood was not a good enough excuse for that dereliction of duty. This weekend it emerged that, scandalously, a scheduled meeting on the coronavirus crisis between Ms Patel and Sir Philip did not take place, as their standoff escalated. The evidence accumulates that this government\u2019s penchant for a sectarian, bullying form of conviction politics is creating a dysfunctional administration. Mr Johnson will recall that, eventually, the architects of the Jacobin Terror lost their heads too.",

The city government of the capital, Seoul, has asked prosecutors to charge Lee Man-hee, the founder of the Shincheonji church, and 11 others who are accused of hiding the names of some members as officials tried to track patients before the virus spread.</p> \n<p>That coincided with the decision by South Korea\u2019s Catholic church to halt masses at more than 1,700 locations nationwide for the first time in its 236-year history. Buddhist temples also called off events, while major Christian churches held online services.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"55ab9c84754be2c9160cc78924cf4b7f29dc6cf0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55ab9c84754be2c9160cc78924cf4b7f29dc6cf0/373_0_3573_2144/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ambulances parked to transport potential coronavirus patients in Daegu, South Korea\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ambulances parked to transport potential coronavirus patients in Daegu, South Korea.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ryu Young-seok/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In France, meanwhile, travellers were advised to avoid journeys abroad outside the EU unless strictly necessary. The country has banned gatherings of more than 5,000 people in confined spaces and outside demonstrations in areas where the virus has been reported. Sunday\u2019s Paris half-marathon has been cancelled, while priests in some dioceses, including Paris, have been instructed not to put the host into communicants\u2019 mouths but into their hands instead.</p> \n<p>Among the new contaminations were three health workers at a Paris hospital and a firefighter in Rennes. In the Haute-Savoie region, where there has been a cluster of cases thought to have originated from a person who had returned from northern Italy, the mayor of La Balme-de-Sillingy, Fran\u00e7ois Daviet, announced he had tested positive. </p> \n<p>New cases also included two children aged one year and five years who have been hospitalised in Strasbourg along with their 27-year-old mother who also tested positive. Their condition has been described as not worrying.</p> \n<p>Elsewhere, the US, Australia and Thailand have reported their first deaths, while two frontline doctors in China died and more countries banned large gatherings and imposed travel restrictions.</p> \n<p>A 35-year-old male retail worker in Thailand died from Covid-19, according to the country\u2019s department of disease control on Sunday. The man had also tested positive for dengue fever. In Australia, a 78-year-old man who was on the Diamond Princess cruise ship died in a hospital in Western Australia. His wife has also contracted the virus.</p> \n<p>Fears were mounting in the US, where the governor of Washington declared a state of emergency after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/29/us-coronavirus-states-new-cases-california-oregon-washington\">a man died there</a>, the country\u2019s first reported death. More than 50 people in a nursing facility in the state are ill and being tested for the virus. Governor Jay Inslee directed state agencies to use all resources necessary to prepare for and respond to the outbreak. The declaration also allows the use of the Washington national guard if necessary.</p> \n<p>The Israeli national airline, El Al, is reportedly considering firing 1,000 out of its total workforce of about 6,000 because of losses linked to the coronavirus outbreak. A company spokesman confirmed the plan to AFP but would not give further details.</p>",

Try to avoid crowded areas, or places where you might interact with people who are sick.\u201d And among a growing number of sites and events to fall victim to coronavirus fears was the Louvre museum in Paris, which shut on Sunday afternoon, reportedly after about 300 staff met in the morning and voted \u201calmost unanimously\u201d not to open. Louvre management later confirmed the museum was closed for the entire day, and said it would refund ticketholders. Both France and Switzerland, which banned mass gatherings \u2013 have cautioned citizens not use \u201cla bise\u201d \u2013 known to Britons as the \u201ckissy kissy\u201d greeting \u2013 for fear of spreading the virus. The Iranian figures represent 11 more deaths than reported on Saturday and 385 new cases of infections. While the new numbers have brought down the percentage of deaths to infections to about 5.5%, that is still much higher than other countries, suggesting the number of infections in Iran may be far higher. Amid plans announced by the Revolutionary Guards to install mobile hospitals in the cities of Qom and Rasht, Iran\u2019s state broadcaster said all flights to and from Rasht, the capital of northern Gilan province, had been suspended. \u201cWe have set up centres across the country to help people to tackle the virus,\u201d an unnamed Revolutionary Guards commander told a televised news conference on Sunday. \u201cWe need national cooperation to tackle this crisis. People should follow our health officials\u2019 advice.\u201d After days of assurances that the virus was largely under control, officials recently acknowledged Iran was preparing for the possibility of tens of thousands of people getting tested for the disease. The figures from Iran, which along with China, South Korea and Italy has suffered the most serious outbreaks, came at the same time as an avalanche of worsening indicators outside China, where reported cases had appeared to be declining. However, despite recent indications that China, the worst affected country so far, might be turning a corner, on Sunday it reported the sharpest increase in new infections in a week with 573 additional cases and 35 deaths. The deaths represented a drop from the previous day\u2019s toll of 47. China has recorded a total of 2,870 deaths from 79,824 cases, mostly in the central province of Hubei. In Italy, a top health official has warned of a \u201ctsunami\u201d effect on its hospital system after confirmed cases there rose to almost 1,700 including 34 deaths, a warning that has been increasingly echoed in other European capitals. \u201cThe situation is, frankly, an emergency from the point of view of health system organisation,\u201d Massimo Galli, a professor and director of infectious diseases at Milan\u2019s Sacco hospital, told Corriere della Sera on Sunday. His warning came as the US on Sunday urged Americans not to travel to the two Italian regions hardest hit by the new virus, raising the level of warning for the Lombardy and Veneto regions to the highest level. \u201cIt is the equivalent of a tsunami for the number of patients with major diseases being hospitalised all together,\u201d said Galli. \u201cFor example, on Friday, before the new wave of cases arrived in Lombardy, there were 85 beds occupied by patients intubated for Covid-19 \u2013 that\u2019s a significant share of those available.\u201d The pattern of rapid spread was also visible in South Korea, which reported a further 586 infections, taking the country\u2019s tally to 3,736 cases, with a death toll of 18. In a sign of the wider social impact of the outbreak, it was disclosed that the leader of a religious sect in South Korea could face a homicide investigation over some of the coronavirus deaths. The city government of the capital, Seoul, has asked prosecutors to charge Lee Man-hee, the founder of the Shincheonji church, and 11 others who are accused of hiding the names of some members as officials tried to track patients before the virus spread. That coincided with the decision by South Korea\u2019s Catholic church to halt masses at more than 1,700 locations nationwide for the first time in its 236-year history. Buddhist temples also called off events, while major Christian churches held online services. In France, meanwhile, travellers were advised to avoid journeys abroad outside the EU unless strictly necessary. The country has banned gatherings of more than 5,000 people in confined spaces and outside demonstrations in areas where the virus has been reported. Sunday\u2019s Paris half-marathon has been cancelled, while priests in some dioceses, including Paris, have been instructed not to put the host into communicants\u2019 mouths but into their hands instead. Among the new contaminations were three health workers at a Paris hospital and a firefighter in Rennes. In the Haute-Savoie region, where there has been a cluster of cases thought to have originated from a person who had returned from northern Italy, the mayor of La Balme-de-Sillingy, Fran\u00e7ois Daviet, announced he had tested positive. New cases also included two children aged one year and five years who have been hospitalised in Strasbourg along with their 27-year-old mother who also tested positive. Their condition has been described as not worrying. Elsewhere, the US, Australia and Thailand have reported their first deaths, while two frontline doctors in China died and more countries banned large gatherings and imposed travel restrictions. A 35-year-old male retail worker in Thailand died from Covid-19, according to the country\u2019s department of disease control on Sunday. The man had also tested positive for dengue fever. In Australia, a 78-year-old man who was on the Diamond Princess cruise ship died in a hospital in Western Australia. His wife has also contracted the virus. Fears were mounting in the US, where the governor of Washington declared a state of emergency after a man died there, the country\u2019s first reported death. More than 50 people in a nursing facility in the state are ill and being tested for the virus. Governor Jay Inslee directed state agencies to use all resources necessary to prepare for and respond to the outbreak. The declaration also allows the use of the Washington national guard if necessary. The Israeli national airline, El Al, is reportedly considering firing 1,000 out of its total workforce of about 6,000 because of losses linked to the coronavirus outbreak. A company spokesman confirmed the plan to AFP but would not give further details.",

      "bodyText": "Moses Kamaras stands at the foot of Lesbos\u2019 Statue of Liberty, holding a pair of sodden shoes in his left hand, a rucksack hoisted over his right shoulder. The sun is in early ascent but the boat that has brought him \u2013 and 59 others \u2013 to this first bit of soil they will know as Europe is already the fourth to have landed on the island\u2019s southern shores. By midday on Sunday two more vessels will have crossed from Turkey, carrying 127 Afghans to the north of the Aegean isle. \u201cI was really scared,\u201d Kamaras, 34, from Sierra Leone, says, dazed and disoriented from the journey, his face covered by a surgical mask handed to him by the Greek police. \u201cOur engine was really weak, we were in the boat for four hours and all the time I thought, what if I die,\u201d he murmurs, raising a right hand with all five fingers missing, the price he says he has paid in torture for political opposition. \u201cBut I had spent six months in Istanbul. I had waited a long time for this day.\u201d Kamaras\u2019 chance to traverse the sea came last week when, in a move of unexpected brinkmanship, Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, vowed to \u201copen the doors\u201d for migrants to enter Europe in retaliation for the EU failing to support Ankara in Syria. While thousands headed towards Greece\u2019s land frontier others, like Kamaras, made for the Turkish coast. In echoes of the 2015 refugee crisis, when close to a million displaced Syrians entered Europe via Lesbos and adjacent Aegean isles, as many as 150,000 are now thought to have gathered on the country\u2019s western shores in the hope of crossing. By nightfall, ever growing numbers of women and children had reportedly joined those grouped on beaches opposite the outposts, despite the Greek government rushing to make a defensive ring of naval vessels and coastguard ships around the isles. An all-out drive to create crudely made inflatables has also been launched as traffickers amass in the area. Sgt Panaghiotis Fykias, a veteran of that crisis, fears the worst. Seconded to the local police department\u2019s immigration sector, Fykias makes countless trips patrolling Lesbos\u2019 sealine every day in his battered Citro\u00ebn. On Sunday, what greeted him barely an hour after his 6.30am shift began was a surprise even for him. \u201cOne after the other the boats were coming in,\u201d he says stopping at a beach strewn with the remains of rubber dinghies, life jackets, the inner tubes of tyres, blankets, food and clothes. \u201cTo be honest I am not hopeful. Today, for the first time, I was taken back to 2015. The winds had dropped, the weather was perfect [for the crossing] but if these flows continue, the omens aren\u2019t good. It\u2019s explosive. There are 27,000 migrants here and residents have lost patience. The situation could easily get out of control.\u201d The first officer to arrive at the scene when reports emerged of a boat landing close to the Statue of Liberty \u2013 the showpiece sculpture within metres of the harbour of Mytilene, the island\u2019s capital \u2013 Fykias encountered people as much elated as exhausted. \u201cThere were pregnant women among them, lots of children, faces that looked so very tired,\u201d he says. \u201cBut with coronavirus we have a procedure now, to hand out face masks, head count and put them on buses for Moria camp.\u201d In a sign of the brewing tensions on the island, that now appears to be anything but easy. Enraged at the sight of more migrants arriving locals moved to set up road blocks to prevent them even getting to the vastly overcrowded holding facility. In other unprecedented scenes, assailants rounded on volunteers with an aid organisation, beating them up in broad daylight. \u201cIf we let one bus through, it will be the beginning of the end,\u201d Yannis Mastroyiannis, the community head of Moria\u2019s hilltop village insisted. Fourteen hours after landing in Lesbos, Kamaras had not moved further than a few meters away from the statue. His bus, like others carrying the newly arrived, had been held up by roadblocks and returned to a guarded area in the harbour. It was his first taste of Europe\u2019s promised land.",

      "body": "<p>A patient in Essex has become the second person in the UK to test positive for coronavirus without having recently travelled abroad, fuelling concerns that the virus is circulating in Britain undetected.</p> \n<p>Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, said the patient \u201chad no relevant travel\u201d and an investigation was under way to determine whether the patient contracted the virus directly or indirectly from someone who had recently returned from overseas.</p> \n<p>The case suggests the country is edging closer to the point where containment becomes impossible because the virus is being spread by people who are either unaware they are infected, or are diagnosed too late to prevent onward transmission.</p> \n<p>The Essex patient was among 13 new cases reported on Sunday, bringing the total UK infections to 36. It is the largest single-day increase of new cases in the UK so far. One of the new cases is the first to be reported in Scotland, while two cases in total had previously been reported in Northern Ireland and Wales.</p> \n<p>The patient in Scotland, who is a resident of the Tayside area and had recently travelled from Italy, has been admitted to hospital and is receiving treatment in isolation.</p> \n<p>Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, chaired a meeting of the Scottish government resilience committee on Sunday evening and will be taking part in a similar meeting chaired by Boris Johnson on Monday morning.</p> \n<p> Peter Openshaw, a professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, said: \u201cThis really adds to the supposition that many are now making that this one is going to be very hard to put back in the box. It makes it particularly difficult to control any outbreak if there are people who don\u2019t know they\u2019re spreading it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Johnson will chair a Cobra meeting on Monday to review the next steps aimed at containing the virus, and he will tell those signing off the strategy that the government will \u201cstop at nothing\u201d to fight the disease.</p> \n<p>The meeting will be attended by senior ministers as well as Whitty and chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance in order to ratify the government\u2019s proposed countermeasures.</p> \n<p>The prime minister is set to tell those at the meeting: \u201cThe number of coronavirus cases around the world is rising every day \u2013 and the UK is no exception. There now seems little doubt that it will present a significant challenge for our country.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut we are well prepared, and the government and the NHS will stop at nothing to fight this virus. This battle plan lays out in detail the measures we could use \u2013 if and when they are needed.\u201d</p> \n<p>Johnson had been dubbed a \u201cpart-time\u201d prime minister by critics for failing to take charge of a Cobra meeting before this week. </p> \n<p>The health secretary, Matt Hancock, confirmed on Sunday that the government would publish its approach to coronavirus this week but conceded it was inevitable that the virus would continue to spread across the UK. The NHS is planning to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/29/nhs-dads-army-plan-for-coronavirus-spread-pandemic-strategy\">bring doctors out of retirement</a> to cope if the outbreak escalates and Hancock did not rule out following China\u2019s lead <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/matt-hancock-ministers-to-publish-coronavirus-battle-plan-for-uk\">and isolating cities</a> to contain the virus.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere is clearly a huge economic and social downside to that,\u201d Hancock told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show. \u201cBut we don\u2019t take anything off the table at this stage because you have to make sure you have all the tools available if that is what is necessary.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"649a5d7e9e23d88eb85fb4188647f220618cec49\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/649a5d7e9e23d88eb85fb4188647f220618cec49/0_138_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson visited a Public Health England laboratory in Colindale, north London, on Sunday\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson: \u2018I don\u2019t want to go now into the kinds of things that might be necessary.\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Nicholls/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Emergency powers to slow the spread of the virus, if it becomes endemic, would only be temporary, Hancock added. He said \u201cpopulation distancing measures\u201d such as banning public gatherings and cancelling football matches might be considered and closing schools could become necessary.</p> \n<p>On Friday, a man from Haslemere in Surrey became the first person known to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/28/fears-that-surrey-gp-is-uks-latest-coronavirus-victim\">caught the infection in the UK</a>. Three of the men\u2019s relatives, one also from Surrey and two from West Sussex, are among the new cases, forming an \u201cadult family cluster\u201d, said James Mapstone at Public Health England. At the weekend, the Prince of Wales pub in the town closed for deep cleaning after landlords said one of its customers had tested positive.</p> \n<p> Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said: \u201cAlthough it may still be possible to prevent a community-wide epidemic, this is looking increasingly unlikely and we should be prepared to cope with a more widespread epidemic on our shores.\u201d </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7a6078f6-5a66-4d3e-9339-5610fe320767\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.</p>\n    <p>The UN agency&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public\">advises</a>&nbsp;people to:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Frequently wash their hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or warm water and soap</li>\n     <li>Cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when sneezing or coughing</li>\n     <li>Avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever or cough</li>\n     <li>Seek early medical help if they have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, and share their travel history with healthcare providers</li>\n     <li>Advice about face masks varies.

All of the new patients, from London, West Yorkshire, Greater Manchester, Hertfordshire and Gloucestershire, are being investigated and their close contacts traced.</p> \n<p>The sudden rise in cases came as health authorities scrambled to track down people who had come into contact with a 35-year man from Shenzhen in China, who had been working in Bristol and tested positive for coronavirus after taking a Cathay Pacific flight from Heathrow to Hong Kong on Thursday.</p> \n<p>A <a href=\"http://wsjkw.gd.gov.cn/zwyw_gzdt/content/post_2911984.html\">statement</a> from the Guangdong health commission late on Sunday said authorities in Shenzhen had declared an \u201cimported case\u201d of the coronavirus after the man tested positive. It is unclear whether or not he became infected in the UK, but Chinese authorities said two of the patient\u2019s colleagues in the UK had reported coughs and fever.</p> \n<p>The man travelled from London to Hong Kong on 27 February on Cathay Pacific flight CX250. After landing in Hong Kong he took a ferry to Shekou port and from there entered mainland China.</p> \n<p>While the man\u2019s temperature was normal on arrival, he developed a cough and fever on 29 February and was driven to a hospital where he tested positive for coronavirus. He is now having treatment in Shenzhen, where his condition was described as stable.</p> \n<p>Chuang Shuk-kwan, the director of the infectious disease division of the Centre for Health Protection in Hong Kong, advised all passengers on Thursday\u2019s Cathay CX250 flight from Heathrow to Hong Kong, or on ferry number 3A109, to call the centre\u2019s hotline and to be \u201caware of the health situation\u201d, and seek medical help or quarantine if necessary. A spokesperson for Cathay Pacific said the plane was being disinfected and the airline was helping authorities trace passengers who came into close contact with the man.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Among measures announced by the Department of Health and Social Care on Sunday were a ministerial lead on the virus in every department and a cross-Whitehall \u201cwar room\u201d to coordinate a beefed-up public information campaign.</p> \n<p>One of the newly confirmed cases is a patient from Bury in Greater Manchester, who is being treated at a specialist NHS infection centre, according to Bury council.

      "bodyText": "A patient in Essex has become the second person in the UK to test positive for coronavirus without having recently travelled abroad, fuelling concerns that the virus is circulating in Britain undetected. Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, said the patient \u201chad no relevant travel\u201d and an investigation was under way to determine whether the patient contracted the virus directly or indirectly from someone who had recently returned from overseas. The case suggests the country is edging closer to the point where containment becomes impossible because the virus is being spread by people who are either unaware they are infected, or are diagnosed too late to prevent onward transmission. The Essex patient was among 13 new cases reported on Sunday, bringing the total UK infections to 36. It is the largest single-day increase of new cases in the UK so far. One of the new cases is the first to be reported in Scotland, while two cases in total had previously been reported in Northern Ireland and Wales. The patient in Scotland, who is a resident of the Tayside area and had recently travelled from Italy, has been admitted to hospital and is receiving treatment in isolation. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, chaired a meeting of the Scottish government resilience committee on Sunday evening and will be taking part in a similar meeting chaired by Boris Johnson on Monday morning. Peter Openshaw, a professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, said: \u201cThis really adds to the supposition that many are now making that this one is going to be very hard to put back in the box. It makes it particularly difficult to control any outbreak if there are people who don\u2019t know they\u2019re spreading it.\u201d Johnson will chair a Cobra meeting on Monday to review the next steps aimed at containing the virus, and he will tell those signing off the strategy that the government will \u201cstop at nothing\u201d to fight the disease. The meeting will be attended by senior ministers as well as Whitty and chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance in order to ratify the government\u2019s proposed countermeasures. The prime minister is set to tell those at the meeting: \u201cThe number of coronavirus cases around the world is rising every day \u2013 and the UK is no exception. There now seems little doubt that it will present a significant challenge for our country. \u201cBut we are well prepared, and the government and the NHS will stop at nothing to fight this virus. This battle plan lays out in detail the measures we could use \u2013 if and when they are needed.\u201d Johnson had been dubbed a \u201cpart-time\u201d prime minister by critics for failing to take charge of a Cobra meeting before this week. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, confirmed on Sunday that the government would publish its approach to coronavirus this week but conceded it was inevitable that the virus would continue to spread across the UK. The NHS is planning to bring doctors out of retirement to cope if the outbreak escalates and Hancock did not rule out following China\u2019s lead and isolating cities to contain the virus. \u201cThere is clearly a huge economic and social downside to that,\u201d Hancock told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show. \u201cBut we don\u2019t take anything off the table at this stage because you have to make sure you have all the tools available if that is what is necessary.\u201d Emergency powers to slow the spread of the virus, if it becomes endemic, would only be temporary, Hancock added. He said \u201cpopulation distancing measures\u201d such as banning public gatherings and cancelling football matches might be considered and closing schools could become necessary. On Friday, a man from Haslemere in Surrey became the first person known to have caught the infection in the UK. Three of the men\u2019s relatives, one also from Surrey and two from West Sussex, are among the new cases, forming an \u201cadult family cluster\u201d, said James Mapstone at Public Health England. At the weekend, the Prince of Wales pub in the town closed for deep cleaning after landlords said one of its customers had tested positive. Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said: \u201cAlthough it may still be possible to prevent a community-wide epidemic, this is looking increasingly unlikely and we should be prepared to cope with a more widespread epidemic on our shores.\u201d Of the remaining eight new cases, six had recently returned from Italy and two from Iran. All of the new patients, from London, West Yorkshire, Greater Manchester, Hertfordshire and Gloucestershire, are being investigated and their close contacts traced. The sudden rise in cases came as health authorities scrambled to track down people who had come into contact with a 35-year man from Shenzhen in China, who had been working in Bristol and tested positive for coronavirus after taking a Cathay Pacific flight from Heathrow to Hong Kong on Thursday. A statement from the Guangdong health commission late on Sunday said authorities in Shenzhen had declared an \u201cimported case\u201d of the coronavirus after the man tested positive. It is unclear whether or not he became infected in the UK, but Chinese authorities said two of the patient\u2019s colleagues in the UK had reported coughs and fever. The man travelled from London to Hong Kong on 27 February on Cathay Pacific flight CX250. After landing in Hong Kong he took a ferry to Shekou port and from there entered mainland China. While the man\u2019s temperature was normal on arrival, he developed a cough and fever on 29 February and was driven to a hospital where he tested positive for coronavirus. He is now having treatment in Shenzhen, where his condition was described as stable. Chuang Shuk-kwan, the director of the infectious disease division of the Centre for Health Protection in Hong Kong, advised all passengers on Thursday\u2019s Cathay CX250 flight from Heathrow to Hong Kong, or on ferry number 3A109, to call the centre\u2019s hotline and to be \u201caware of the health situation\u201d, and seek medical help or quarantine if necessary. A spokesperson for Cathay Pacific said the plane was being disinfected and the airline was helping authorities trace passengers who came into close contact with the man. Among measures announced by the Department of Health and Social Care on Sunday were a ministerial lead on the virus in every department and a cross-Whitehall \u201cwar room\u201d to coordinate a beefed-up public information campaign. One of the newly confirmed cases is a patient from Bury in Greater Manchester, who is being treated at a specialist NHS infection centre, according to Bury council. Will Welfare, the interim deputy director of health protection for Public Health England North West, said the agency was tracing people who had close contact with the patient, who became infected while in Italy. Another case, identified on Saturday, is a member of staff at St Mary\u2019s school in Tetbury, Gloucestershire. The school has been closed until at least Wednesday because of \u201coperational difficulties\u201d with staff rather than any ongoing health risk, according to a letter sent to parents from Jo Woolley, the headteacher. She said a deep clean was carried out on Saturday and that all people who had contact with the infected staff member had been spoken to. \u201cThe thing I would urge every organisation and every business to do is to really start planning, as of now, for how people are going to manage to work remotely and cover each other\u2019s jobs in the event that people have to take time off from work,\u201d said Openshaw. \u201cIt\u2019s planning for resilience in the eventuality that the spread is going to continue.\u201d",

Top stories Australia, the US and Thailand have confirmed their first fatalities from the coronavirus after a 78-year-old Australian man who had been aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship died in a Perth hospital on Sunday. The former chair of the Global Health Council has confirmed \u201c[t]he worst-case scenario for coronavirus is likely\u201d, meaning that the disease becomes endemic, circulating permanently around the globe. Confirmed cases in Italy have risen to 1,700 with 34 dead, and Iran\u2019s health ministry has confirmed a toll of 54 and 978 cases. Concerns have also grown in the UK as a patient in Essex became the second Briton to test positive without having travelled overseas. Australian pensioners have been caught up in a $100m global cryptocurrency scam run out of a call centre in Kiev that\u2019s been exposed in an investigation conducted by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project. More than 200 fake \u201ctraders\u201d based in the Ukraine conned prospective investors with false ads including celebrities such as Gordon Ramsay and Hugh Jackman. Thousands have already been caught up in the scam, with some losing their life savings. The inner workings of the fraudulent Milton Group have been revealed by a whistleblower from within the organisation. The family of an Australian man fear he could die in jail after a Vietnamese court sentenced the 70-year-old to 12 years in prison on terrorism charges they\u2019ve labelled a \u201ccharade\u201d. Chau Van Kham, a retired baker, was accused of meeting with a pro-democracy group that is proscribed by the Vietnamese government and convicted of \u201cfinancing terrorism\u201d in a trial that lasted just four hours. \u201cMy father was given one hour to consult with his lawyer after being subject to investigation for 11 months,\u201d Chau\u2019s son Dennis told a UN summit for human rights. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019ll ever see him alive, a free man. It\u2019s effectively a death sentence.\u201d Australia Channel Seven\u2019s boss, James Warburton, faces a ticking clock as the ailing media company rushes to refinance $683m of debt. Rebuffed in attempts to take control of the debt-free regional affiliate Prime, Seven could follow fellow broadcaster Ten, which went into administration in 2017. Scott Morrison will announce a new recycling policy for commonwealth agencies, aiming to increase demand for recycled products. Australia produces 400m tonnes of plastics a year, and the prime minister hopes government departments can lead the way in reducing consumption. Josh Frydenberg has been accused of \u201cderisive\u201d and \u201cheartbreaking\u201d comments by prominent Hindu organisations after he mocked the opposition treasury spokesman Jim Chalmers\u2019 potential pursuit of a \u201cwellness budget\u201d.

Their centrist rival Pete Buttigieg has announced he won\u2019t drop out before Super Tuesday, despite finishing a disappointing fourth. Turkey says it has destroyed Syrian air defence systems, more than 100 tanks and two planes in retaliation to an airstrike that killed at least 33 troops last week. Fighting between Turkey-backed rebels and Russian-backed Syrian government forces has escalated. Meanwhile, on Turkey\u2019s western border, 13,000 refugees have massed after President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan reneged on a deal with Brussels to prevent migrants entering the EU. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has denied that a major stumbling block has emerged in his newly proclaimed US-Taliban deal, after the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, rejected a key clause that included the release of 5,000 Taliban prisoners.

The new cases came after Washington state confirmed a man in his 50s died from the respiratory illness \u2013 the first known death caused by coronavirus in the US. Azar told Fox News Sunday the Chicago case was one of 23 to be diagnosed in a person who had not been repatriated from Japan or China. \u201cOf those individuals, we\u2019ve got cases in Chicago as well as Washington and Oregon and two in California where we do not yet know why they contracted the novel coronavirus,\u201d Azar said.

Washington governor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency on Saturday. The man who died was in his 50s and had underlying health conditions and no history of travel or contact with a known coronavirus case. Eight people have tested positive in Washington, according to the state\u2019s health department. Two of those cases were reported on Sunday as men in their 60s with underlying health conditions. Another 50 people with symptoms of respiratory illness were being tested at a nursing home in Washington state, where a worker in her 40s and a resident in her 70s tested positive. Health officials in California, Oregon and Washington are worried because a growing number of people are being infected despite not having visited an area where there was an outbreak, or apparently being in contact with anyone who had. Azar told ABC\u2019s This Week the increase in cases around the US was what the government had been predicting. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important that we treat the American people like adults and explain to them that we don\u2019t know where this will go, that we will see more cases, that we will see continued community spreading in the United States, as we\u2019re seeing around the world,\u201d Azar said.

      "body": "<p>England have been warned not to underestimate the cross-border passion driving Wales in the build-up to their Six Nations match at Twickenham on Saturday. Sam Underhill, the flanker who spent a formative period of his career playing for Ospreys, also believes the home side need to keep close tabs on his Welsh counterpart Justin Tipuric, whom he rates as the best back-row in the world.</p> <p>Underhill spent two seasons with the Ospreys while at university in Cardiff and saw precisely how much the England game means to Welsh supporters. During his time in Wales he also developed huge respect for Tipuric, whom he played alongside before transferring back across the Severn bridge to Bath.</p> <p>Wales will also be keenly aware of Underhill\u2019s abilities, not least the superb corner-flagging tackle on Scott Williams which prevented a crucial try at Twickenham <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/10/england-wales-six-nations-match-report\" title=\"\">two seasons ago</a>, and the 23-year-old is eagerly awaiting a fixture with a genuine crackle to it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/23/wales-england-six-nations-match-report\">Wales on course for grand slam as late tries shatter England</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a special sense of occasion,\u201d said Underhill, who is poised to win his 19th cap this week. \u201cI\u2019ll never be able to know what it really means for them because I\u2019m English but you definitely sense there\u2019s an extra edge and added emotion.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s obviously more to England v Wales than just rugby. Obviously none of us work at Westminster but it\u2019s important to recognise what the game means to both parties. From living over there I\u2019ve seen how much it means to them as a nation. As a player it\u2019s always one to look forward to; it\u2019s the game you want to play in. In the era of professional sport you can\u2019t let things like that distract you too much but for the fans there\u2019s definitely something else.\u201d</p> <p>As recently as four years ago Underhill was a fan himself and could be found watching the equivalent fixture in the student union bar. \u201cI remember watching in the Taf, which was the student union pub. To be fair it was full of Cardiff students from Surrey so it wasn\u2019t really the same atmosphere as I\u2019m sure it was in Neath or Swansea.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/10/england-wales-six-nations-match-report\">Jonny May\u2019s early tries take England over the line against battling Wales</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He still keeps in touch with some of his former Ospreys teammates and remains particularly grateful for everything Tipuric taught him about back\u2011row play. \u201cI learned a lot from him. He\u2019s a phenomenal player and definitely the most skilful back-row I\u2019ve played with or against. He\u2019s very gifted and those are the guys you want to play against. You want to play against the best, as a team and an individual.\u201d</p> <p>England, however, will be equally keen to build on their forceful display against Ireland, having surrendered a 10-3 half-time lead to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/23/wales-england-six-nations-match-report\" title=\"\">lose 21-13</a> against Wales in Cardiff just over a year ago. Underhill was not involved on that occasion but believes Eddie Jones\u2019s team are regathering their momentum following their opening defeat in Paris. \u201cAgainst Ireland we showed with our performance that we are capable of more. We can still get better as a group in terms of performance. We never think we\u2019re there.\u201d</p> <p>Any chance of England nicking the title this season is now largely dependent on France losing and an improvement in the coronavirus outlook but, having spent part of last week coaching grassroots players at a Canterbury\u2011sponsored session near Didcot, Underhill and his teammates are keen to block out all distractions and concentrate simply on Wales.</p> <p>\u201cThe only thing we can do is focus on the next game and put ourselves in as good a position as possible in the tournament. We can\u2019t predict or influence what is going to happen with anyone other than ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>Wales have won just once at Twickenham in the Six Nations over the past decade but won the 2015 World Cup pool game between the sides and were slightly unfortunate to lose 12-6 against England in a tense encounter two years ago.</p>",

      "bodyText": "England have been warned not to underestimate the cross-border passion driving Wales in the build-up to their Six Nations match at Twickenham on Saturday. Sam Underhill, the flanker who spent a formative period of his career playing for Ospreys, also believes the home side need to keep close tabs on his Welsh counterpart Justin Tipuric, whom he rates as the best back-row in the world. Underhill spent two seasons with the Ospreys while at university in Cardiff and saw precisely how much the England game means to Welsh supporters. During his time in Wales he also developed huge respect for Tipuric, whom he played alongside before transferring back across the Severn bridge to Bath. Wales will also be keenly aware of Underhill\u2019s abilities, not least the superb corner-flagging tackle on Scott Williams which prevented a crucial try at Twickenham two seasons ago, and the 23-year-old is eagerly awaiting a fixture with a genuine crackle to it. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a special sense of occasion,\u201d said Underhill, who is poised to win his 19th cap this week. \u201cI\u2019ll never be able to know what it really means for them because I\u2019m English but you definitely sense there\u2019s an extra edge and added emotion. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously more to England v Wales than just rugby. Obviously none of us work at Westminster but it\u2019s important to recognise what the game means to both parties. From living over there I\u2019ve seen how much it means to them as a nation. As a player it\u2019s always one to look forward to; it\u2019s the game you want to play in. In the era of professional sport you can\u2019t let things like that distract you too much but for the fans there\u2019s definitely something else.\u201d As recently as four years ago Underhill was a fan himself and could be found watching the equivalent fixture in the student union bar. \u201cI remember watching in the Taf, which was the student union pub. To be fair it was full of Cardiff students from Surrey so it wasn\u2019t really the same atmosphere as I\u2019m sure it was in Neath or Swansea.\u201d He still keeps in touch with some of his former Ospreys teammates and remains particularly grateful for everything Tipuric taught him about back\u2011row play. \u201cI learned a lot from him. He\u2019s a phenomenal player and definitely the most skilful back-row I\u2019ve played with or against. He\u2019s very gifted and those are the guys you want to play against. You want to play against the best, as a team and an individual.\u201d England, however, will be equally keen to build on their forceful display against Ireland, having surrendered a 10-3 half-time lead to lose 21-13 against Wales in Cardiff just over a year ago. Underhill was not involved on that occasion but believes Eddie Jones\u2019s team are regathering their momentum following their opening defeat in Paris. \u201cAgainst Ireland we showed with our performance that we are capable of more. We can still get better as a group in terms of performance. We never think we\u2019re there.\u201d Any chance of England nicking the title this season is now largely dependent on France losing and an improvement in the coronavirus outlook but, having spent part of last week coaching grassroots players at a Canterbury\u2011sponsored session near Didcot, Underhill and his teammates are keen to block out all distractions and concentrate simply on Wales. \u201cThe only thing we can do is focus on the next game and put ourselves in as good a position as possible in the tournament. We can\u2019t predict or influence what is going to happen with anyone other than ourselves.\u201d Wales have won just once at Twickenham in the Six Nations over the past decade but won the 2015 World Cup pool game between the sides and were slightly unfortunate to lose 12-6 against England in a tense encounter two years ago.",

To mitigate the risk of outbreaks, WHO warned that countries need to have proactive surveillance, rapid diagnosis and immediate quarantine, plus an education campaign so the public knows proper hygiene and what to do if they become sick.</p> <p>Australia reported its first Covid-19-related death on Sunday \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/dutton-says-extending-travel-ban-not-possible-and-defends-coronavirus-response\">78-year-old James Kwan</a> from Perth, a passenger on the Diamond Princess cruise ship.

However, in a second case, a healthcare worker is believed to have contracted it without having travelled to an infection zone or been in direct contact with one of the few known infected people. Some health experts and researchers have said community spread is inevitable in Australia, and questions are being asked about how many people might need treatment in hospital and how many might become critically ill \u2013 and whether resources will cope.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/21/explainer-how-worried-should-i-be-about-coronavirus-in-australia\">Explainer: how worried should I be about coronavirus in Australia?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, such predictions can be irresponsible or misleading because the fatality rate is so dynamic. When asked about Iran, which recently reported an 11% mortality rate, Dr Michael Ryan from WHO said: \u201cWe need to be very careful in the first wave of infections and any newly affected country because we may only be detecting severe cases and the deaths will be over-represented in that.\u201d</p> <p>The risk and death rate differs between countries because of a range of factors such as how quickly the source of transmission is identified, the available health system resources, the health of the population and the way testing is conducted.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s deputy chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, told the ABC: \u201cWe\u2019ve had the very best modellers in Australia trying to predict what might happen, and it ranges from [Covid-19] not coming to Australia, all the way to everyone getting it, and we\u2019re looking to prepare for all of those possibilities.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Mary-Louise McLaws, an infection control expert who has advised WHO, said: \u201cThe correct thing to do with a new virus is to wait until the end before giving solid death rate figures.</p> <p>\u201cTrying to maintain a running death rate commentary is difficult because you never know the amount of people who are undiagnosed or who is diagnosed but yet to die.\u201d</p> <h2>What should Australians do to prepare?</h2> <p>Australian health authorities have urged people not to waste face masks. They are only useful for people with the virus and for healthcare workers treating those infected. According to WHO, airborne spread has not been reported for Covid-19 and it is not believed to be a major driver of transmission based on available evidence.</p> <p>It seems to spread most readily by human-to-human transmission. Preventing its spread is similar to many other respiratory infections: by avoiding close contact with ill people and through frequent hand washing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/australia-declares-coronavirus-will-become-a-pandemic-as-it-extends-china-travel-ban\">Australia declares coronavirus will become a pandemic as it extends China travel ban</a> </p> </aside>  <p>An associate professor in disaster and emergency response at Edith Cowan University, Erin Smith, said it was concerning to see widespread shortages of face masks. \u201cIt\u2019s a fear-driven response,\u201d she said. \u201cThose surgical-based face masks don\u2019t do a huge amount to prevent community transmission, so if that\u2019s what people are hoping there are other ways to prevent spread that are more effective, like washing your hands with soap and water.</p> <p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t get soap and water, that\u2019s when hand sanitiser is useful,\u201d she said. \u201cBut hand sanitisers do not replace washing hands with soap and water and a good old scrub, which is more effective.\u201d Learning not to touch your face \u2013 which people do up to 3,000 times per day \u2013 could also prevent disease spread.</p> <p>\u201cI see so many people in the Australian community wearing a face mask at the moment and I just want to ask them whether they\u2019ve had their flu vaccine, because they are more likely to get influenza at the moment,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Finally, Smith said, it would not hurt for people with children, especially, to have a couple of weeks\u2019 worth of medication and food on hand in case someone in the family became sick and everyone needed to stay home from work and school. But she said this was no different to preparing for other infectious diseases, such as influenza. Stockpiling beyond that is unnecessary, Australia\u2019s chief medical officer Prof Brendan Murphy said.</p> <p>McLaws agreed. \u201cI\u2019m not a doomsdayer,\u201d she said. \u201cTelling people to stock up on months\u2019 worth of food and to expect the worst is not helpful, and I\u2019m actually very impressed with our health department and government commitment to this potential pandemic.\u201d</p> <h2>What are the government and health departments doing?</h2> <p>Australia has a national medical stockpile, a reserve of drugs and protective equipment for use in a public health emergency. Hospitals also have procedures for responding to infectious diseases, including pandemics.</p> <p>On Thursday the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said Australia was acting as though <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/australia-declares-coronavirus-will-become-a-pandemic-as-it-extends-china-travel-ban\">a pandemic had already been declared</a> in order to be well prepared. The health minister, Greg Hunt, said state and territory health departments were particularly focused on making sure there would be enough medical personnel if there was a surge of hospital patients. Hospitals are used to this type of planning already from previous outbreaks, such as influenza spikes.</p> <p>Every week, the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee will update its travel advice. Its latest statement, issued on Friday, said travel restrictions and self-quarantine procedures for people coming from mainland China had been successful. There have been no cases detected in the more than 30,000 Australians returning from mainland China since 1 February. The committee said as the disease spreads, \u201cextending travel bans to restrict travel from multiple countries is not likely to be feasible or effective in the medium term\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, it may be appropriate to consider self-isolation or practise social distancing upon return from higher risk regions.\u201d</p> <h2>If Covid-19 hits Australia, who is most at risk?</h2> <p>Coronavirus is a very mild illness for the majority of people infected, Smith said. \u201cThe majority of those people with serious infections or who have died are elderly and with comorbidities such as asthma, diabetes, cancer or cardiac or renal disease. This is largely a pneumonia-type of illness so people with respiratory illnesses need to be aware.\u201d</p> <p>A report from the WHO-China joint mission on coronavirus said the disease was relatively rare and mild in children, with 2.4% of the total reported cases in people age under 19. These figures will change as more data is gathered. Mortality increases with age, with the highest mortality among people over 80 years of age. Men seem to have a higher fatality rate than women in China, where it\u2019s important to note there are high smoking rates among men. Pregnant women seem to be no more at risk than the average person.</p> <p>Smith said it was prudent to be aware, \u201cbut we don\u2019t want people to be alarmed\u201d. \u201cOnce that happens you <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/29/it-just-seems-sensible-the-australians-stockpiling-for-the-coronavirus\">have panic-buying</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/doctors-and-nurses-at-melbourne-hospital-racially-abused-over-coronavirus-panic\">antisocial behaviour</a>,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have excellent healthcare in Australia and we have been planning for this for years \u2013 every public health system has a pandemic plan. The managers would have drilled for it.\u201d</p> <p>McLaws said Australia\u2019s health system would likely be stretched, \u201cbut it will manage\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe quarantine has given us time to prepare well,\u201d she said. \u201cIf coronavirus does hit and people become unwell, they should stay at home, put a mask on and ring in to their doctor to be triaged on the phone. For vulnerable people with a comorbidity, they should get themselves to a fever clinic or hospital and again, they should be triaged on the phone first.\u201d</p> <p>If it spreads throughout Australia it will be important to heed government advice if community events are cancelled, such as sporting and cultural events, and to stay home if unwell. Currently, however, the prime minister said \u201cthere is no need for us to be moving towards not having mass gatherings of people\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/29/it-just-seems-sensible-the-australians-stockpiling-for-the-coronavirus\">\u2018It just seems sensible\u2019: the Australians stockpiling for the coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cYou can still go to the football, you can still go to the cricket, you can still go and play with your friends down the street, you can go off to the concert, and you can go out for a Chinese meal,\u201d he said.</p> <h2>Is comparing Covid-19 to other illnesses, such as Sars and influenza, useful?</h2> <p>It can be useful to learn from previous disease outbreaks when preparing emergency response plans, and consistent community messaging around hygiene and prevention of infectious diseases is also helpful.</p> <p>However, looking at infection and death rates from influenza and Sars is not useful, WHO has said.</p> <p>\u201cCovid-19 is not Sars and it is not influenza,\u201d the WHO-China joint mission on coronavirus report said. \u201cIt is a new virus with its own characteristics.

Australia\u2019s deputy chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, told the ABC: \u201cWe\u2019ve had the very best modellers in Australia trying to predict what might happen, and it ranges from [Covid-19] not coming to Australia, all the way to everyone getting it, and we\u2019re looking to prepare for all of those possibilities.\u201d Prof Mary-Louise McLaws, an infection control expert who has advised WHO, said: \u201cThe correct thing to do with a new virus is to wait until the end before giving solid death rate figures. \u201cTrying to maintain a running death rate commentary is difficult because you never know the amount of people who are undiagnosed or who is diagnosed but yet to die.\u201d What should Australians do to prepare? Australian health authorities have urged people not to waste face masks. They are only useful for people with the virus and for healthcare workers treating those infected. According to WHO, airborne spread has not been reported for Covid-19 and it is not believed to be a major driver of transmission based on available evidence. It seems to spread most readily by human-to-human transmission. Preventing its spread is similar to many other respiratory infections: by avoiding close contact with ill people and through frequent hand washing. An associate professor in disaster and emergency response at Edith Cowan University, Erin Smith, said it was concerning to see widespread shortages of face masks. \u201cIt\u2019s a fear-driven response,\u201d she said. \u201cThose surgical-based face masks don\u2019t do a huge amount to prevent community transmission, so if that\u2019s what people are hoping there are other ways to prevent spread that are more effective, like washing your hands with soap and water. \u201cIf you can\u2019t get soap and water, that\u2019s when hand sanitiser is useful,\u201d she said. \u201cBut hand sanitisers do not replace washing hands with soap and water and a good old scrub, which is more effective.\u201d Learning not to touch your face \u2013 which people do up to 3,000 times per day \u2013 could also prevent disease spread. \u201cI see so many people in the Australian community wearing a face mask at the moment and I just want to ask them whether they\u2019ve had their flu vaccine, because they are more likely to get influenza at the moment,\u201d she said. Finally, Smith said, it would not hurt for people with children, especially, to have a couple of weeks\u2019 worth of medication and food on hand in case someone in the family became sick and everyone needed to stay home from work and school. But she said this was no different to preparing for other infectious diseases, such as influenza. Stockpiling beyond that is unnecessary, Australia\u2019s chief medical officer Prof Brendan Murphy said. McLaws agreed. \u201cI\u2019m not a doomsdayer,\u201d she said. \u201cTelling people to stock up on months\u2019 worth of food and to expect the worst is not helpful, and I\u2019m actually very impressed with our health department and government commitment to this potential pandemic.\u201d What are the government and health departments doing? Australia has a national medical stockpile, a reserve of drugs and protective equipment for use in a public health emergency. Hospitals also have procedures for responding to infectious diseases, including pandemics. On Thursday the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said Australia was acting as though a pandemic had already been declared in order to be well prepared. The health minister, Greg Hunt, said state and territory health departments were particularly focused on making sure there would be enough medical personnel if there was a surge of hospital patients. Hospitals are used to this type of planning already from previous outbreaks, such as influenza spikes. Every week, the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee will update its travel advice. Its latest statement, issued on Friday, said travel restrictions and self-quarantine procedures for people coming from mainland China had been successful. There have been no cases detected in the more than 30,000 Australians returning from mainland China since 1 February. The committee said as the disease spreads, \u201cextending travel bans to restrict travel from multiple countries is not likely to be feasible or effective in the medium term\u201d. \u201cHowever, it may be appropriate to consider self-isolation or practise social distancing upon return from higher risk regions.\u201d If Covid-19 hits Australia, who is most at risk? Coronavirus is a very mild illness for the majority of people infected, Smith said. \u201cThe majority of those people with serious infections or who have died are elderly and with comorbidities such as asthma, diabetes, cancer or cardiac or renal disease. This is largely a pneumonia-type of illness so people with respiratory illnesses need to be aware.\u201d A report from the WHO-China joint mission on coronavirus said the disease was relatively rare and mild in children, with 2.4% of the total reported cases in people age under 19. These figures will change as more data is gathered. Mortality increases with age, with the highest mortality among people over 80 years of age. Men seem to have a higher fatality rate than women in China, where it\u2019s important to note there are high smoking rates among men. Pregnant women seem to be no more at risk than the average person. Smith said it was prudent to be aware, \u201cbut we don\u2019t want people to be alarmed\u201d. \u201cOnce that happens you have panic-buying and antisocial behaviour,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have excellent healthcare in Australia and we have been planning for this for years \u2013 every public health system has a pandemic plan. The managers would have drilled for it.\u201d McLaws said Australia\u2019s health system would likely be stretched, \u201cbut it will manage\u201d. \u201cThe quarantine has given us time to prepare well,\u201d she said. \u201cIf coronavirus does hit and people become unwell, they should stay at home, put a mask on and ring in to their doctor to be triaged on the phone. For vulnerable people with a comorbidity, they should get themselves to a fever clinic or hospital and again, they should be triaged on the phone first.\u201d If it spreads throughout Australia it will be important to heed government advice if community events are cancelled, such as sporting and cultural events, and to stay home if unwell. Currently, however, the prime minister said \u201cthere is no need for us to be moving towards not having mass gatherings of people\u201d. \u201cYou can still go to the football, you can still go to the cricket, you can still go and play with your friends down the street, you can go off to the concert, and you can go out for a Chinese meal,\u201d he said. Is comparing Covid-19 to other illnesses, such as Sars and influenza, useful? It can be useful to learn from previous disease outbreaks when preparing emergency response plans, and consistent community messaging around hygiene and prevention of infectious diseases is also helpful. However, looking at infection and death rates from influenza and Sars is not useful, WHO has said. \u201cCovid-19 is not Sars and it is not influenza,\u201d the WHO-China joint mission on coronavirus report said. \u201cIt is a new virus with its own characteristics. Building scenarios and strategies only on the basis of well-known pathogens risks failing to exploit all possible measures to slow transmission of the Covid-19 virus, reduce disease and save lives.\u201d As WHO states, if you are not in an area where Covid-19 is spreading, or have not travelled from an area where Covid-19 is spreading, or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. The federal government and WHO websites are the best sources for up-to-date information. There is also a coronavirus information line: 1800 020 080.",

They had recently travelled to the UK from China. They were staying at a hotel in York when they fell ill and were taken to Newcastle Royal Victoria Infirmary for treatment.</p> \n  <p><strong>6 February </strong>A third person in the UK is diagnosed in Brighton and transferred to Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 in London. It later emerges that the patient, businessman Steve Walsh, contracted the virus at a conference in Singapore. On his way back to the UK, he stopped off for several days at a French ski chalet, where five Britons were subsequently infected with the virus.</p> \n  <p><strong>9 February </strong>Prof Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, says a fourth person has been diagnosed in the UK, believed to be a contact of Walsh. It is later confirmed that the virus was passed on in France.</p> \n  <p><strong>10 February </strong>Four more patients in England test positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases in the UK to eight. Those infected are all contacts of Walsh and Public Health England (PHE) confirms two are healthcare workers. The four newly diagnosed people had contracted the virus in France.</p> \n  <p><strong>13 February </strong>A woman in London becomes the ninth person to test positive for the illness in the UK - the first confirmed case in the capital. The patient, also moved to Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019, contracted the virus in China, Whitty says. As with previously confirmed cases, officials work to identify people who had been in recent contact with the woman.</p> \n  <p><strong>23 February </strong>Four Britons rescued from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan test positive for the illness in the UK, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 13. They were among a group of 30 Britons and two Irish citizens who arrived at a quarantine block at Arrowe Park hospital in Merseyside a day earlier. Whitty said the virus was passed on when all four were on board the vessel.</p> \n  <p><strong>27 February </strong>The first case of Covid-19 is diagnosed in Northern Ireland, while two more people tested positive across the rest of the UK. The patient in Belfast had recently returned from northern Italy and had previously been in Dublin. Another of the new cases, a parent at a Buxton primary school in Derbyshire, contracted the virus in Tenerife. The third patient also contracted the virus in Italy.</p> \n  <p><strong>28 February </strong>The number of confirmed UK cases jumps to 20 after Wales reports its first patient and three more are identified in England. Dr Frank Atherton, the chief medical officer for Wales confirmed a man had been diagnosed with the virus after travelling back to Wales from Italy.</p> \n  <p>Two of the new cases identified in England had recently travelled back from Iran. Meanwhile, a patient identified in Surrey becomes the first to catch the illness within the UK. Prof Whitty says it is not clear if the patient had contracted the virus \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d from somebody who had recently travelled abroad.</p> \n  <p><strong>29 February </strong>Three more patients are identified in England. Two of the patients had recently travelled back from Italy while the other had returned from Asia.</p> \n  <p><strong>1 March </strong>The UK total climbs to 36 after 13 new patients are identified, with Scotland reporting its first case. Three of the latest cases in England are family members of a man from Surrey who was the first to catch the illness within the UK. All four are adults, including one more from Surrey and two from West Sussex, and are not GPs or health workers, acting regional director for the south of England for PHE says.</p> \n  <p>Another new patient, from Essex, had no relevant travel to an affected area, according to Whitty, and it was unclear whether the patient had contracted it \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d from somebody who had recently travelled abroad.</p> \n  <p>The eight remaining cases include one from Bury, Greater Manchester, who was infected in Italy, two new patients from Hertfordshire and one in London. Three cases were confirmed in West Yorkshire, including two Leeds residents \u2013 who became infected in Iran \u2013 while one is from Bradford who had been in Italy.</p> \n  <p>Another is from Gloucestershire and is linked to a member of staff at a school in the Cotswolds, identified the day before. Meanwhile, the first person in Scotland to be diagnosed is a Tayside resident who recently travelled from Italy.<br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e5c20158f0811db2fb01a78\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-01T21:08:28.434Z\">9.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: \u2018Scottish coronavirus case not unexpected\u2019</strong></p> \n  <p>Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon said the first confirmed case in Scotland was \u201cnot unexpected\u201d. </p> \n  <p>In an interview with Sky News a few minutes ago, said they had been preparing for this occasion \u201cfor some time\u201d and that she was expecting more cases in the coming days and weeks.</p> \n  <p>Sturgeon reiterated much of her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/01/coronavirus-latest-updates-coronavirus-live-updates-latest-news-china-wuhan-stock-markets-update-china-iran-us-australia-south-korea-japan?page=with:block-5e5c13dd8f086a28115b5a36#block-5e5c13dd8f086a28115b5a36\">earlier statement</a>, and said the Scottish coronavirus patient is clinically well. </p> \n  <p><strong>Confident in the NHS response</strong></p> \n  <p>The first minister also assured the public that the UK was well-equipped to deal with a rise in cases. \u201cAll the things that should be done are being done\u201d, she said. \u201cWe have to be prepared for a significant outbreak fo coronavirus.\u201d</p> \n  <p>She said that Scotland remained in the containment phase, and was focusing on trying to limit and contain spread of infection -

As yet the number of cases in the UK who have no relevant travel history remains small but even a couple of such cases indicates community spread here. The current containment strategy is still appropriate for now but we can expect to see further increases in the next few days and consequently the UK\u2019s response will move more towards the next phase of delaying rather than containing infections.

It means that every single case that is found here gets immediate treatment, but also we contact all of the people that that person has been in close contact with. Largely most of the cases so far, are from people who\u2019ve caught the virus elsewhere and brought it here, and we\u2019re then able to contain it.</p> \n   <p>We\u2019ve put \u00a340m into trying to find a vaccine and also trying to improve the treatments for people who do have the disease. The experts say that a vaccine, even accelerated as fast as possible, is still many months off. But the potential for treatments that make the virus less of a problem if you\u2019ve got it, they are more optimistic. The final plan is to prepare for mitigation should this become endemic in this country and making sure that not only the NHS is prepared, but also all parts of society.

Here\u2019s the latest summary of the key events: Scotland has confirmed its first case of coronavirus, bringing the UK total up to 36. Thirteen of those have been confirmed today alone. A man in Essex became the second person in the UK to be infected with the virus without traveling abroad. A group of Britons who have been on lockdown in a hotel in Tenerife since Tuesday have arrived at the airport to fly home. Dozens of Brits remain inside. The number of cases in Germany has doubled in the last day, and a further 30 cases were announced in France since Saturday, bringing its total up to 130. In Italy, the head of the country\u2019s civil protection agency has confirmed the death toll now stands at 34, five more than a yesterday, while the number of infections has risen 50% to 1,694. New cases have appeared in Chicago and Rhode Island in the US. Non-essential British embassy staff have been withdrawn from Tehran with immediate effect. The death toll in Iran is currently at 54, with 978 confirmed cases. The husband of British-Iranian woman Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is being held on spying charges in Iran, believes she has contracted coronavirus in prison but says officials are refusing to test her. Australia\u2019s number of confirmed cases has been increased to 29, after a ninth case appeared in Victoria. Israel has confirmed another three cases, two of which were patients who recently returned from Italy but the other was caught locally. This bring\u2019s the country\u2019s total number to 10. The first case of coronavirus has been confirmed in the Dominican Republic, a tourist visiting from Italy. A fifth case has appeared in Mexico \u2013 a young woman who was studying in Milan, Italy, but reportedly returned home to Mexico when her school was shut down because of the virus. You can follow our latest liveblog here: Christopher Betts, 73, is a British holidaymaker who is still in lockdown in the hotel in Tenerife. He arrived at the hotel with his wife on the 18th, and was due to be leaving on the morning the hotel went into quarantine. Christopher told the Guardian he has been tested for coronavirus but hasn\u2019t received his results, and has no idea when he\u2019ll be able to fly home. One of his friends in the hotel is in regular contact with the Foreign Office, and says he\u2019s being told different things depending on which member of staff he speaks to there. \u201cOne branch of Foreign Office says that when you\u2019re negative you can go, another branch says you have to stay for the full isolation period, until March 10,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re operating on a Chinese whispers system. If we have to stop til next Tuesday, fine, we\u2019ll accept it. all we need is clarification.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re getting conflicting stories from our government. Finish and Dutch people in the hotel have said their government have been clear about them staying until the 10th, but we don\u2019t know,\u201d he added. Those who test negative will have to retest when the time comes to fly home, and must leave 24 hours after their negative result. Christopher is concerned that if the remaining Brits are allowed to leave the hotel, they won\u2019t be able to get transport to the airport. He praised the staff at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace for their hospitality during the quarantine period. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t wish for a better hotel,\u201d he said. \u201cStaff and guests were dancing in the restaurant last night, they brought us entertainment. I know people whinge, but you couldn\u2019t wish for anything more under the circumstances. They\u2019re even giving us free drinks.\u201d Israel has confirmed three more cases of coronavirus, bringing its total number to 10. Two of the new cases had recently returned from a trip to Italy, and the third is thought to have been infected within Israel. The three patients have \u201clight\u201d symptoms, Israel\u2019s health ministry said. PA have produced a helpful overview of the UK coronavirus cases, which might help to map out what\u2019s happened so far: 31 January The first cases are reported in the UK when two members of the same family test positive for the virus. They had recently travelled to the UK from China. They were staying at a hotel in York when they fell ill and were taken to Newcastle Royal Victoria Infirmary for treatment. 6 February A third person in the UK is diagnosed in Brighton and transferred to Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 in London. It later emerges that the patient, businessman Steve Walsh, contracted the virus at a conference in Singapore. On his way back to the UK, he stopped off for several days at a French ski chalet, where five Britons were subsequently infected with the virus. 9 February Prof Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, says a fourth person has been diagnosed in the UK, believed to be a contact of Walsh. It is later confirmed that the virus was passed on in France. 10 February Four more patients in England test positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases in the UK to eight. Those infected are all contacts of Walsh and Public Health England (PHE) confirms two are healthcare workers. The four newly diagnosed people had contracted the virus in France. 13 February A woman in London becomes the ninth person to test positive for the illness in the UK - the first confirmed case in the capital. The patient, also moved to Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019, contracted the virus in China, Whitty says. As with previously confirmed cases, officials work to identify people who had been in recent contact with the woman. 23 February Four Britons rescued from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan test positive for the illness in the UK, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 13. They were among a group of 30 Britons and two Irish citizens who arrived at a quarantine block at Arrowe Park hospital in Merseyside a day earlier. Whitty said the virus was passed on when all four were on board the vessel. 27 February The first case of Covid-19 is diagnosed in Northern Ireland, while two more people tested positive across the rest of the UK. The patient in Belfast had recently returned from northern Italy and had previously been in Dublin. Another of the new cases, a parent at a Buxton primary school in Derbyshire, contracted the virus in Tenerife. The third patient also contracted the virus in Italy. 28 February The number of confirmed UK cases jumps to 20 after Wales reports its first patient and three more are identified in England. Dr Frank Atherton, the chief medical officer for Wales confirmed a man had been diagnosed with the virus after travelling back to Wales from Italy. Two of the new cases identified in England had recently travelled back from Iran. Meanwhile, a patient identified in Surrey becomes the first to catch the illness within the UK. Prof Whitty says it is not clear if the patient had contracted the virus \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d from somebody who had recently travelled abroad. 29 February Three more patients are identified in England. Two of the patients had recently travelled back from Italy while the other had returned from Asia. 1 March The UK total climbs to 36 after 13 new patients are identified, with Scotland reporting its first case. Three of the latest cases in England are family members of a man from Surrey who was the first to catch the illness within the UK. All four are adults, including one more from Surrey and two from West Sussex, and are not GPs or health workers, acting regional director for the south of England for PHE says. Another new patient, from Essex, had no relevant travel to an affected area, according to Whitty, and it was unclear whether the patient had contracted it \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d from somebody who had recently travelled abroad. The eight remaining cases include one from Bury, Greater Manchester, who was infected in Italy, two new patients from Hertfordshire and one in London. Three cases were confirmed in West Yorkshire, including two Leeds residents \u2013 who became infected in Iran \u2013 while one is from Bradford who had been in Italy. Another is from Gloucestershire and is linked to a member of staff at a school in the Cotswolds, identified the day before. Meanwhile, the first person in Scotland to be diagnosed is a Tayside resident who recently travelled from Italy. Nicola Sturgeon: \u2018Scottish coronavirus case not unexpected\u2019 Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon said the first confirmed case in Scotland was \u201cnot unexpected\u201d. In an interview with Sky News a few minutes ago, said they had been preparing for this occasion \u201cfor some time\u201d and that she was expecting more cases in the coming days and weeks. Sturgeon reiterated much of her earlier statement, and said the Scottish coronavirus patient is clinically well. Confident in the NHS response The first minister also assured the public that the UK was well-equipped to deal with a rise in cases. \u201cAll the things that should be done are being done\u201d, she said. \u201cWe have to be prepared for a significant outbreak fo coronavirus.\u201d She said that Scotland remained in the containment phase, and was focusing on trying to limit and contain spread of infection - which was \u201cparticularly important given the lack of coronavirus vaccine\u201d. The first minister said that wider planning for a significant outbreak in coming weeks was underway, including escalation plans for the NHS. \u201cI have a lot of confidence in the plans and procedures that are in place,\u201d she said. She said that steps that will be taken will be informed and guided by best possible advice, and that she wouldn\u2019t rule anything out at this stage. However, she also said that the public \u201chave a big part to play\u201d in stopping the spread of the virus by following public health guidelines. Sturgeon said that Scotland was working with other UK nations, and described it as \u201cvital\u201d to have a co-ordinated, UK wide response. \u201cThis is a virus that will not respect boundaries,\u201d she said. You can read more about the new cases in the US from my colleague Amanda Holpuch in New York. Brazil has so far confirmed only two cases of coronavirus - both Brazillian citizens who had been in Italy. But a report in one of the country\u2019s leading newspapers this Sunday says there are now 252 suspected cases - 136 of them in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo and 19 in Rio de Janeiro. According to the Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper, the suspected cases are people who have not just symptoms but have also had contact with a suspected case or a travel history connected to coronavirus. Angola has announced that it will ban citizens from China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, Nigeria, Egypt and Algeria from entering the country. The ban will only apply to those who have travelled directly from those countries, and has been implemented to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Mexico have confirmed a fifth case of the virus - an 18-year-old woman who had been studying in Milan and had recently returned to Chiapas state. The woman tested positive for the virus on Saturday but is asymptomatic, state health authorities said. Authorities said she had returned to Mexico after her school in Italy closed because of the crisis. Two of Mexico\u2019s confirmed cases are in the capital, Mexico City, where schools and nurseries are already starting to adopt special measures to guard against a potential outbreak. Speaking at a press conference on Sunday, Mexico City mayor Claudia Sheinbaum said there were currently no plans to cancel major public events or gatherings because of coronavirus. A nursing home near Seattle is on lockdown after a 70 year old resident and a worker in her 40s tested positive for coronavirus, officials at the home have said. State officials said that an additional 27 residents of the nursing home and 25 staff members are reporting symptoms of the virus, which can be similar to that of the common flu. The Life Care Center of Kirkland is not accepting new patients or allowing visitors, family or vendors into the facility. \u201cConcerned family members or responsible parties may call our facility,\u201d the release posted on its website said. \u201cThe facility is currently placing a hold on admissions as well to fully focus on our current residents and associates.\u201d The two cases were confirmed on Saturday by Washington state officials. The resident is in a serious condition, whilst the worker is in a \u2018satisfactory\u2019 condition. There are around 70 cases in the US. A woman who recently returned from Iran has today been confirmed as the ninth case of coronavirus in the Australian state of Victoria. Australia recorded its first death from Covid-19 on Sunday when a man in his late 70s, who had been evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan, died in hospital in Perth. Seven cases from Victoria have recovered and are no longer in isolation. The eighth confirmed case is in a stable condition and is isolated and recovering in hospital. The ninth case, a woman in her 30s from Victoria who returned from Tehran, is recovering in isolation at home. The woman became unwell on February 27 while travelling to Melbourne from Tehran, via Kuala Lumpur and Bali. She travelled on Malindo Air on flight number OD177 and landed in Melbourne on 28 February at 6.04am. The Victorian department of health is following up close contacts on the plane. Across Australia, there have now been 29 confirmed cases: 9 in Queensland 6 in New South Wales 9 in Victoria 3 in South Australia 2 in Western Australia Out of these, 15 have recovered, one has died and the rest are in a stable condition. A coach of Britons who have been in lockdown in a hotel in Tenerife since Tuesday have arrived at an airport terminal to fly home. It is understood that the Brits have been booked on two different flights back to the UK, and they will have to self-isolate on their return. There are still dozens of Brits still inside the hotel, and it is unclear who has been allowed to leave and why. One told Sky News that it was based on \u201cpotluck\u201d according to travel providers. Tests for coronavirus on Brits in the hotel began yesterday and continued in to today. According to Sky New, the Brits were told that if they tested negative, they had 24 hours to get on a flight. One of those leaving said at the airport that he was feeling \u201crelieved\u201d and another praised the hotel staff as \u201cfantastic.\u201d The first person in Scotland has tested positive for coronavirus. The announcement brings the total number of UK cases to 36, 13 of which have been confirmed today. The patient, who is a resident of the Tayside area and had recently travelled from Italy, has now been admitted to hospital and is receiving treatment in isolation. Clinicians have also started to gather details of the places they have visited and the people they have been in contact with since they returned to the UK. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has chaired a meeting of the Scottish government resilience committee this evening, and will be taking part in a similar one chaired by Boris Johnson tomorrow morning. Sturgeon said: \u201cOur first thoughts must be with the patient diagnosed with coronavirus, I wish them a speedy recovery. \u201cScotland is well-prepared for a significant outbreak of coronavirus but there is currently no treatment or vaccine. Early detection measures will continue to be vital in helping to prevent the spread of the virus. \u201cPeople have a vital role to play in helping us contain any outbreak by following the latest health and travel advice, and following basic hygiene precautions, such as washing hands frequently, not touching their face and covering their nose and mouth with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.\u201d There have been a total of 698 negative test results in Scotland since the outbreak began. According to Reuters, organisers have said that a conference on the world economy due to take in Italy later this month with Pope Francis taking part has been postponed until November because of the outbreak. Some Britons in the hotel in Tenerife have been allowed to leave, Sky News have said. The number of people in Germany infected rose to 129 on Sunday, up from 66 on Saturday, DW has reported. Nine of Germany\u2019s 16 states now have cases of COVID-19, with Frankfurt, Hamburg and Bremen among the cities reporting their first infections, Germany\u2019s centre for disease control and prevention, the Robert Koch Institute, said. Almost half of the cases, 74 in total, have been confirmed in North Rhine-Westphalia, which is Germany\u2019s most populous state. Bavaria has the next highest number of confirmed cases, with 23, followed by Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg with 15. The Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said people should \u201cstill go about their business\u201d, but that the government was \u201cconsidering all options\u201d. In an interview with Sky News a few minutes ago, he insisted the government\u2019s plan was \u201cvery clear\u201d. What are the government\u2019s steps? Firstly, the government are trying to contain the virus, he said. This meant that \u201cevery single case found here gets immediate treatment\u201d, with their contacts tracked down and given medical advice or checks. Hancock said that the government were trying to delay the onset of the virus, having determined that the UK would be better able to cope with a mass spread of coronavirus in the summer. He also said that the government had invested \u00a340 million into finding a vaccine and treatments for disease. He warned that a vaccine was \u201cstill many months off\u201d even with an accelerated process, but treatments for those who have virus already were \u201cmore optimistic\u201d. What should the public do? When asked if people should follow World Health Organisation advice to other parts of the world that over 60s should avoid shared spaces, he said no, as the cases were still \u201crelatively low\u201d. \u201cIf we get to a position where this is endemic around the world and large scale here, we will change advice,\u201d he added. He also said that stopping flights from China was not the answer, comparing it to Italy, who did stop flights and have much higher numbers of cases than the UK. He echoed Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s earlier statement that the best thing the public can do is wash their hands for 20 seconds. As Johnson referenced earlier, albeit slightly less clearly, the government are telling children to sing \u2018happy birthday\u2019 whilst washing their hands to ensure they wash for long enough. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said there needed to be \u201cmore direction from the Prime Minister\u201d and accused him of being slow to organise COBRA meetings - the government\u2019s emergency response committee. He said that the NHS were \u201creally doing their best\u201d and that clinicians would \u201calways rise to the challenge\u201d. However, he alleged that 80% of the beds needed for coronavirus were already taken up, saying that years of austerity meant resources to tackle the spread of the virus are stretched. Non-essential British embassy staff in Tehran are being withdrawn with immediate effect due to the virus, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has confirmed. The FCO also warned that the embassy\u2019s help to British nationals in Iran would be limited. A statement said: \u201cAs of 1 March, dependants and some staff from the British Embassy are being withdrawn from Iran due to the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. Essential staff needed to continue critical work will remain. \u201cIn the event that the situation deteriorates further, the ability of the British Embassy to provide assistance to British nationals from within Iran may be limited.\u201d The director general of France\u2019s health service, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Salomon, has given the latest figures and there\u2019s another leap on Sunday. The number of confirmed cases has risen to 130, from 100. Of that, 116 people are in hospital \u2013 nine of them in a serious condition \u2013 and 12 people recovered. There have been two deaths New cases include two children, a one-year-old and a five-year-old, who have been hospitalised in Strasbourg in eastern France along with their 27-year-old mother who also tested positive. Their condition has been described as not worrying. Salomon says French travellers should avoid journeys abroad outside the European Union \u201cunless strictly necessary\u201d. Nevertheless, he pointed out the death rate worldwide is 3.4% of confirmed cases. The Manga and Sci-Fi Show salon planned for next week in Paris, which was to have featured giant karaoke and K Pop concerts, has been cancelled. The Trump administration has accused the public of overreacting to the impact of the coronavirus on the economy, and insisted that stocks would bounce back. The S&amp;P 500 index dropped 11.5% last week as coronavirus spread - the worst weekly drop since the 2008 global financial crisis. \u201cThe stock market that saw some downturns this week, it will come back,\u201d Vice President Mike Pence, who is leading the government\u2019s response to the virus, told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cThe fundamentals of this economy are strong.\u201d he added. Pence also said the government was doing \u201ceverything possible\u201d to prevent the virus from spreading and that he was \u201cconfident\u201d the United States was prepared. U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar told Fox News Sunday that the public was over-reacting to the current threat. The situation in the US A Washington man in his 50s with underlying health conditions was the first American to die from the virus, officials confirmed on Saturday. How the man contracted the virus is still not known. Over the weekend, new cases were confirmed in Chicago and Rhode Island. Morocco is set to postpone sports and cultural events over coronavirus fears, the government health committee has announced. It\u2019s currently unclear how widespread this measure will be. Morocco says it has tested 25 people suspected of having the coronavirus but all have been negative, and the country does not have any confirmed cases. Oman has suspended Italian tourist flights from Salala airport for a month, in an attempt to halt the spread of the virus. Qatar has also announced a temporary ban on visitors from Egypt via intermediate points, the state news agency reported on Sunday. Two new cases were confirmed in Qatar on Sunday, bringing its total to 3. A school in Dublin is set to close for two weeks after a student tested positive for coronavirus, according to the Irish Times. The teenager is the first person in the Republic of Ireland to test positive for the virus, and the case was announced on Saturday evening. The individual became ill in recent days after returning from Italy and is currently in isolation in a Dublin hospital. Students at the school are being told to self-isolate at home if they start presenting symptoms. Andrew Tatem, professor within geography and environmental science at the University of Southampton, has warned that the recent imported cases of coronavirus into China are indicative of a \u201cmove towards a global pandemic\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve reached a stage now where China\u2019s major efforts to stop the outbreak within its borders have meant that it likely has stronger coronavirus surveillance and detection capabilities than anywhere else in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that China is now detecting and reporting imported cases that are coming from Iran and the UK is an indication of how the geographical balance of this outbreak is shifting as we seemingly move towards a global pandemic.\u201d The Dominican Republic has confirmed its first case of coronavirus \u2013 a tourist visiting the country from Italy. The patient is a 62-year-old man, who is in a stable condition. He has been taken to an isolation room in a military hospital near the capital, the country\u2019s health minister, Rafael Sanchez, said at a press conference. Another tourist, a 56-year-old man from France, is under observation at hospital and awaiting test results for coronavirus. On Friday, the Dominican Republic cancelled all flights from Milan for 30 days. The government also said that all travellers retuning from Italy would have to undergo epidemiological reviews at airports. Speaking at a laboratory at the Public Health England national infection service in Colindale, north London, Boris Johnson praised the work of PHE. He said there were likely to be more cases of coronavirus but said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a great plan to tackle the spread of coronavirus and I\u2019m confident that in the NHS we\u2019ve got professionals who are able to cope with it.\u201d He also gave tips for stopping the spread of coronavirus: \u201cThe best way we can help the NHS and help ourselves to stop the spread of the illness is to wash our hands. It\u2019s 20 seconds, it\u2019s two times happy birthday. With hot water and soap.\u201d The prime minister will be chairing another Cobra meeting on coronavirus on Monday. \u201cWe will be setting out the various measures in the way public should be responding, and public bodies should be responding.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t be drawn on the details of what these measures might look like. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go now into the kind of things that might be necessary,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019ll be questions we might need to consider about very big public events.\u201d Johnson also said the government may need to consider closing schools, but expressed that he wanted them to remain open and did not want children to be sent home \u201cunnecessarily\u201d. \u201cCoronavirus is of concern, but we amply have the resources to deal with it. Believe me, we are going to beat this,\u201d he said. The number of confirmed cases in Italy has risen to almost 1,700, and the death toll has increased by five to 34, Reuters reports. There were 1,128 cases and 29 death as of last night. This is the largest jump the spread of the virus in one day, Sky News says. Good evening, I\u2019m Molly Blackall, taking over the live coverage of coronavirus for the next few hours. If you spot something I miss, do drop me a tweet: @mollyblackall. Boris Johnson has been on a visit to laboratory at the Public Health England National Infection Service in Colindale, north London. Iraq has reported six new coronavirus cases, bringing the total number of cases there to 19, Reuters reports citing the health ministry. The ministry said two of the six are in the capital Baghdad and the other four in Sulaimaniya in the north east of the country. All had recently returned from neighbouring Iran, which has had the highest number of deaths from coronavirus outside of China, where the outbreak originated. The WHO\u2019s director of pandemic diseases, Sylvie Briand, is endorsing the elbow bump and footshakes as safer alternatives to shaking hands. A patient who has tested positive for coronavirus in Rotterdam, had been staying for a week at another hospital in the Netherlands, the news site Nu.nl reports. The patient had stayed at the Beatrix hospital in nearby Gorchem, for a week without being tested, the site said. The hospital did not respond to comment but said it is closed to visitors and new patients. The reason the Louvre in Paris was forced to close on Sunday (see earlier) was that staff refused to work due to coronavirus fears, AFP reports. Around 300 staff met in the morning and voted \u201calmost unanimously\u201d not to open, Christian Galani of the CGT labour union told AFP, leaving many would-be visitors disappointed.. Louvre management later confirmed the museum was closed for the entire day, and said it would refund ticket-holders. \u201cWe apologise for any inconvenience and will keep you informed as the situation develops,\u201d the museum said on its website. On Saturday, the government announced several measures to try and curb the outbreak in France, including cancelling all gatherings of more than 5,000 people in confined spaces. \u201cThe Louvre is a confined space which welcomes more than 5,000 people a day,\u201d said Galani, adding: \u201cthere is real concern on the part of staff.\u201d One of the people who has tested positive for the virus was a resident of Bradford who had travelled to Italy while two others are from Leeds and had travelled to Iran. Dr Simon Padfield, consultant in communicable disease control for Public Health England Yorkshire and the Humber, said: \u201cPublic Health England is contacting people who had close contact with three cases of Covid-19 confirmed in West Yorkshire. \u201cOne of the cases is a resident of Bradford who became infected whilst in Italy and the other two cases are residents of Leeds who both became infected whilst in Iran.\u201d And after a case of Covid-19 was confirmed in Essex, Public Health England (PHE) East said \u201cclose contacts\u201d of the patient were being given health advice about symptoms. Dr David Edwards, consultant in health protection, said: \u201cPublic Health England is contacting people who had close contact with a confirmed case of Covid-19 who is an Essex resident. The Czech Republic has confirmed its first three cases of coronavirus, Health Minister Adam Vojtech said on Sunday. Health officials said at a news conference the three patients showed mild symptoms and had travelled from places in northern Italy. China has confirmed two new cases on Covid-19 from people who had travelled to Iran. All of a sudden, things have rather changed. If the ongoing floods have seemed to leave too many people at the top untroubled, the decisive arrival in the UK of the coronavirus has highlighted two things that were in danger of being forgotten: the most basic responsibilities of any government, and the necessity of seriousness. As cases increase, anxiety mounts and both the human and economic consequences of the virus\u2019s spread start to become clear, the smirk attached to the face of this government will need to go. Preventing a Covid-19 epidemic in the UK is looking increasingly unlikely, according to Paul Hunter, Professor in Medicine, University of East Anglia. Today\u2019s sharp increase in confirmed cases in the UK shows the country is entering the \u201cnext stage of the epidemic\u201d he said. In remarks distributed by the Science Media Centre, Prof Hunter added: \u201cThe recent sharp increase in the number of reported cases in the UK is a reminder, if any were needed, that we are moving into the next stage of the epidemic. The recent sharp increases in the number of new cases in Italy and then France, Spain and Germany confirm that COVID-19 is spreading in Europe. As yet the number of cases in the UK who have no relevant travel history remains small but even a couple of such cases indicates community spread here. The current containment strategy is still appropriate for now but we can expect to see further increases in the next few days and consequently the UK\u2019s response will move more towards the next phase of delaying rather than containing infections. Although it may still be possible to prevent a community wide epidemic this is looking increasingly unlikely and we should be prepared to cope with a more widespread epidemic on our shores.\u201d Swansea council says its schools will open as normal on Monday despite a confirmd case of covid-10 case in the city - the first in Wales. In a statement it the risk of catching the virus remains low and \u201cno extra measures\u201d need to be taken beyond those set out by Public Health Wales. Here\u2019s the latest summary: Twelve more people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK, including the second case of someone who caught the virus within the country. The case will fuel concerns that the virus is circulating undetected. Health authorities are trying to trace people who had come into contact with a 35-year man from Shenzhen who had been working in Bristol and tested positive for coronavirus. He took a Cathay Pacific flight from London Heathrow to Hong Kong on Thursday. The UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said it may be necessary to follow China\u2019s example by shutting down cities to prevent the spread of coronavirus. He also confirmed plans to bring doctors and nurses out of retirement if the outbreak escalates in the UK. Iran has said its death toll from coronavirus has reached 54 and the number of infected cases is 978. It comes just days after the ministry categorically denied reports 50 people had died from the disease. A top Italian health official has warned of a \u201ctsunami\u201d effect on the hospital system as confirmed coronavirus cases in Italy rose to 1,128. The number killed by the virus in Italy has increased to 29. The authorities in France have announced the number of confirmed cases has jumped to 100, with two deaths. The country has banned gatherings of more than 5,000 people. The Louvre in Paris was closed on Sunday afternoon as staff held a meeting about the virus. The number of confirmed cases in Spain has increased to 73. A fifth person has tested positive for the virus at the hotel in Tenerife that has been locked down after four other people staying there were diagnosed with coronavirus. Donald Trump has said all travellers from at risk areas will be screened for coronavirus after they arrive in the US. The US, Thailand and Australia have all both reported their country\u2019s first deaths from the virus. Japan reported its second death on Sunday \u2013 a man in his 70s on the island of Hokkaido. Two more doctors have died in China and the country\u2019s death tally has risen by 35 to 2,870. Infections have risen 573 to 79,824 (of which 41,825, or 52%, are listed as recovered). Italy\u2019s Serie A football season runs the risk of not finishing if more matches are postponed because of the coronavirus outbreak, Inter Milan\u2019s chief executive Giuseppe Marotta said on Sunday. Reuters reports: Inter\u2019s match at Juventus, which was to have been played later on Sunday, was one of five which were postponed by the league. The games, all in regions where sporting events have been banned by the government, had been due to be played behind closed doors. Italy has registered more than 1,100 confirmed cases and at least 29 deaths. Inter\u2019s match at home to Sampdoria was one of four which were postponed last Sunday and Marotta said a crowded fixture list meant they were running out of dates to reschedule the games. Serie A called an emergency meeting for Wednesday to discuss the consequences of the government measures and the rescheduling of matches. \u201cIf more matches are called off then, yes, we run that risk,\u201d Marotta told Gazzetta dello Sport when asked if the championship might not finish. Serving and former NHS doctors have reacted with scepticism to the idea of bringing former health professionals out of retirement as part of government plans to combat the spread of coronavirus. PA Media has further details about some of the 12 new cases in the UK. Six of the people involved had recently travelled from Italy, while two had been in Iran. These patients are from London, West Yorkshire, Greater Manchester, Hertfordshire and Gloucestershire. One of the confirmed cases is in Bury, according to Bury council, which said the patient had been taken to a specialist NHS infection centre. The news comes after the health secretary conceded it was \u201cinevitable\u201d that the deadly virus would continue to spread across the UK. A pub in Haslemere, Surrey, has been closed until further notice for deep cleaning after a customer \u201ctested positive for coronavirus\u201d. A patient in the county was confirmed as the first to catch the illness within the UK on Friday. The landlords of the Prince of Wales pub said on Facebook that they had no symptoms of the virus and that it was a \u201cprecautionary measure only\u201d. On Sunday, the Department of Health and Social Care announced every department would have a ministerial lead on the virus, and a cross-Whitehall \u201cwar room\u201d is being set up to roll out an enhanced public information campaign. Government lawyers are assessing the possibility of delaying the local authority, mayoral and police and crime commissioner elections in May if the coronavirus outbreak continues to escalate, the Guardian can disclose. An email sent to board members of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners on Saturday by its chief executive, Susannah Hancock, reveals that measures to contain the spread of the disease would also include potentially delaying the forthcoming elections. She said that the Home Office, in discussions with the Cabinet Office, had sought legal advice on postponing the elections. South Korea has reported four more coronavirus deaths in the south-eastern city of Daegu, bringing the country\u2019s death toll to 21, the Yonap news agency reports. South Korea has 3,736 confirmed cases of the disease. A widely visited church in Rome has closed over coronavirus fears. The move to shut Rome\u2019s Church of San Luigi dei Francesi, which hosts Caravaggio\u2019s The Calling of St Matthew masterpiece, came after a priest in Paris tested positive for the virus after returning from Italy. Chuang Shuk-kwan, the director of the infectious disease division of the centre for health protection, confirmed the details of the new positive case in a man in Shenzhen who had travelled from London and worked in Bristol. Speaking at a press conference on Sunday, Chuang said the passenger had been in the business class of flight CX250. The ferry the patient had taken, 3A109, had about 70 passengers, most of whom were Chinese nationals. Chuang advised all passengers on that flight or ferry to call the centre\u2019s hotline and to be \u201caware of the health situation\u201d, and seek medical help or quarantine if necessary. Cathay Pacific is helping authorities trace all passengers who flew from London to Hong Kong, after a passenger on one of its flights, who had been working in Bristol, tested positive. In a statement, it said: Cathay Pacific received notification from the health authorities in Hong Kong regarding a passenger who was recently confirmed to have contracted severe respiratory disease with Novel Infectious Agent. We were informed that the passenger had flown from London to Hong Kong via CX250 on 27 February and arrived Hong Kong on 28 February. We are following the health authorities\u2019 prescribed procedures in conducting disinfection of the aircraft and informing the operating crew and employees, as well as assisting the authorities\u2019 efforts in tracing people who were in close contact with the concerned passenger. We will continue to work closely with the authorities on the case. The man who tested positive for coronavirus in Shenzhen after flying from London last Thursday had been working in Bristol, the Chinese authorities have confirmed. A statement from the Guangdong Health Commission late on Sunday said authorities in Shenzhen had reported an \u201cimported case\u201d of the coronavirus infection, in a 35 year old male from Shenzhen who had been working in Bristol. According to the statement, the patient had travelled to Hong Kong from London on 28 February, on flight CX250 on Cathay Pacific. He landed in Hong Kong at 13:27 and at 15:30 took the ferry 3A109 to Shekou port in Shenzhen arriving at 16:32. His temperature was normal at the time of his arrival. At 16:45 he left from Shekou port and took a taxi to his home in Futian, a district of Shenzhen. \u201cThe patient wore a face mask the entire time,\u201d the statement said. On 29 February around 7am, the patient suffered from symptoms including a cough and fever. Around 10am he was driven to the hospital by family. That evening he tested positive for the virus and around 11pm he was transferred to Shenzhen no 3 hospital for treatment and quarantine. The statement said that at the moment the patient\u2019s condition was \u201cstable.\u201d The statement said that the patient had no history of travel to Hubei and that two of his colleagues in the UK had shown symptoms of cough and fever. Health authorities said that 93 close contacts of the patient had been identified. While 35 people have now tested positive for the virus in the UK, 11,715 have tested negative. One of the 12 people who have tested positive for the virus contracted it from within the UK, according to the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty. In a statement, he said: \u201cOne patient, resident in Essex, had no relevant travel and it is not yet clear whether they contracted it directly or indirectly from an individual who had recently returned from abroad; investigations are ongoing.\u201d On Friday, a man from Surrey became the first to test positive to test positive for Covid-19 without having recently been abroad. In his statement, Prof Whitty added: Three patients were close contacts of a known case, transmitted in the UK, identified as part of contact tracing. The patients who have recently travelled are from London, West Yorkshire, Great Manchester, Hertfordshire and Gloucestershire. All are being investigated and contract tracing has begun. The total number of confirmed cases in England is now 33. Following previously reported confirmed cases in Northern Ireland and Wales, the total number of UK cases is 35. The number of confirmed cases in the UK has leaped by 12 to 35. Read the full report here: The Louvre museum in Paris shut on Sunday afternoon, leaving visitors queueing up outside in the rain as staff and management held a meeting about coronavirus. A spokesperson for the museum said it was expected to open after the meeting, held with the staff doctor. Museums are not covered by government instructions for venues or events with more than 5,000 in a confined space to close until further notice. Donald Trump says all travellers from at risk areas will be screened for coronavirus after they arrive in the US. David and Sally Abel, the British passengers who caught coronavirus on the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked off Yokohama, are still being treated in an isolation unit in a Japanese hospital. In a video update on Sunday, they said they were recovering well, but Sally said she had tested positive again for the virus, after testing negative last week. David said that by next Friday they will have served four weeks in quarantine. Meanwhile, all crew members from the cruise ship off Japan have now disembarked, the country\u2019s health minister said, AFP reports. The crew began leaving the Diamond Princess on Thursday for quarantine ashore after the last of the passengers had departed. \u201cIncluding the captain, all crew members disembarked,\u201d health minister Katsunobu Kato told reporters late Sunday. Around 130 people \u2013 including the captain and 98 health ministry officials who were working aboard \u2013 tested negative for the virus as they left the vessel, he said. They will spend 14 days at government-designated dormitories before being allowed to leave Japan, while the vessel will be disinfected before sailing again. At least six people who were hospitalised after being taken off the ship have died, including a British male passenger, the health ministry said. On Sunday, a 78-year-old man evacuated from the vessel died at a Perth hospital, becoming Australia\u2019s first fatality from the disease. The quarantine has been heavily criticised after more than 700 people onboard tested positive for the virus. Here\u2019s video of what Hancock said about shutting down cities in the UK. Here\u2019s a summary of the latest developments: The UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said it may be necessary to follow China\u2019s example by shutting down cities to prevent the spread of coronavirus. He also confirmed plans to bring doctors and nurses out of retirement if the outbreak escalates in the UK. A man who has tested positive for coronavirus in Shenzhen, China, travelled there after flying into Hong Kong from London. The 35-year-old man had been working in the UK, according to local reports. Iran has said its death toll from coronavirus has reached 54 and the number of infected cases is 978. It comes just days after the ministry categorically denied reports 50 people had died from the disease. A top Italian health official has warned of a \u201ctsunami\u201d effect on the hospital system as confirmed coronavirus cases in Italy rose to 1,128. The number killed by the virus in Italy has increased to 29. The authorities in France have announced the number of confirmed cases has jumped to 100, with two deaths. The country has banned gatherings of more than 5,000 people. The number of confirmed cases in Spain has increased to 73. A fifth person has tested positive for the virus at the hotel in Tenerife that has been locked down after four other people staying there were diagnosed with coronavirus. Australia, Thailand and the US have all both reported their country\u2019s first deaths from the virus. Japan reported its second death on Sunday \u2013 a man in his 70s on the island of Hokkaido. Two more doctors have died in China and the country\u2019s death tally has risen by 35 to 2,870. Infections have risen 573 to 79,824 (of which 41,825, or 52%, are listed as recovered). Labour is calling on Matt Hancock to fully explain the emergency powers the government is planning in response to a coronavirus outbreak in a Commons update on Monday. The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said: \u201cThere are growing concerns about our part-time prime minister\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak and serious questions about capacity in our overstretched NHS. \u201cThe health secretary should come to the Commons on Monday to explain fully the emergency powers he is planning to bring in, and to update MPs on the government\u2019s response so that we can properly scrutinise it.\u201d Iran\u2019s health ministry has said the death toll from coronavirus has now reached 54 as the number of infected cases jumped overnight to 978. It comes days after the ministry categorically denied reports that 50 people had died from the disease. AP reports: The ministry\u2019s spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said new cases were confirmed in a number of cities, including Mashhad, which is home to Iran\u2019s most important Shia shrine that attracts pilgrims from across the region. Calls by Iran\u2019s civilian government to clerics to close such shrines to to the public have not been uniformly followed. The shrine in Mashhad is among those that have remained open. The new figures represent 11 more deaths than reported on Saturday and 385 new cases of infections. Health experts have warned that based on the known mortality rate of Covid-19, the number of confirmed cases is likely to be much higher than the Iranian authorities are reporting. A parent and child who attended the minor injuries unit at Sevenoaks hospital in Kent on Saturday afternoon have been advised to self-isolate at home and call NHS 111 in case they require testing for the coronavirus. The parent grew concerned when the child, who had been at school with pupils who recently returned from Italy, developed a mild temperature. As a precautionary measure, Sevenoaks hospital closed the minor injuries unit at 6.30pm on Saturday, about 90 minutes early. Existing patients continued with their treatment as normal. The unit was deep-cleaned overnight, as a further precaution, and opened as usual on Sunday morning. The rest of the hospital was unaffected. The Department of Health and Social Security did not provide further details on whether the child had been tested or was awaiting a test. A \u201csurveillance network\u201d of GP practices in Scotland will test patients with coughs and fevers and submit samples, even if patients have not travelled to an area affected by coronavirus, as part of the Scottish government plans. The measure was described as an \u201cearly warning\u201d system to alert health professionals to the possible spread of the virus. The chief medical officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood, said: \u201cHospitals and GP surgeries will now conduct tests on some patients with coughs, fevers or shortness of breath \u2013 regardless of whether they have travelled to a place where the virus is known to be spreading. \u201cNot everyone with flu will be tested, but this is a sensible step to take as a precautionary measure to give us an early warning of community transmission.\u201d A \u201cdrive through\u201d testing centre for coronavirus has also opened at the Western General hospital, Edinburgh, where patients with appointments can be tested for the virus in their cars. The Scottish government also announced that in the coming days it will jointly publish an updated action plan with the UK government, as well as the welsh and Northern Irish administrations, outlining the steps that will be taken to manage coronavirus if there is a sustained epidemic. A top Italian health official has warned of a \u201ctsunami\u201d effect on the hospital system as confirmed coronavirus cases in Italy rose to 1,128. \u201cThe situation is, frankly, an emergency from the point of view of health system organisation,\u201d Massimo Galli, a professor and director of infectious diseases at Milan\u2019s Sacco hospital, told Corriere della Sera on Sunday. \u201cIt is the equivalent of a tsunami for the number of patients with major diseases being hospitalised all together. For example, on Friday, before the new wave of cases arrived in Lombardy, there were 85 beds occupied by patients intubated for Covid-19, that\u2019s a significant share of those available.\u201d Authorities in the Lombardy region, where 552 people are infected, have asked for a hospital to be made available solely for treating coronavirus and to be able to hire retired doctors and nurses to help with the workload. There have been 29 deaths in Italy, the latest eight victims ranging between the ages of 79 and 90. Those who have died so far were suffering other serious health problems. Some 401 people have been hospitalised \u2013 105 of them in intensive care \u2013 and 543 are at home. Fifty people have recovered. Schools in Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, where there are 213 cases, and Veneto, where there 189, will be closed for another week. The virus has spread to 11 out of 20 Italian regions over the past week, wreaking havoc on the country\u2019s already fragile economy. The financial hub of Milan is endeavouring to return to normal, reopening museums and its famous Duomo, but the city was dealt a further blow after American Airlines announced it was suspending flights to Milan following the US State Department raising it travel warning for parts of Italy. Other airlines have also scrapped or reduced flights due to low demand for travel to Italy. On Friday, the government announced financial relief for those living in 11 towns still under lockdown, businesses and the tourism sector while new measures worth \u20ac3.6bn to help the economy withstand the worst outbreak of coronavirus in Europe, and the third worst in the world, will be introduced this week, finance minister Roberto Gualtieri told La Repubblica on Sunday. A man who has tested positive for coronavirus in Shenzhen, travelled there after flying into Hong Kong from London on Thursday, according to local reports. The news site Caixin reported that a 35-year-old man who had been working in the UK flew from London to Hong Kong on 27 February and arrived at noon on 28 February. He then took a ferry to Shekou, near Shenzhen and then drove to Shenzen, it reported. On Saturday he developed symptoms of a cough and fever and went to the hospital where he was confirmed positive for the virus, it said. He is being treated in isolation in a hospital in Shenzhen. According to documents seen by Caixin, health authorities in Shenzhen notified provincial officials in Guangdong as well as health authorities in Hong Kong on Sunday. 1. The public broadcaster RTHK reported that the Centre for Health Protection is appealing to anyone who travelled business class on Cathay Pacific flight CX250 from London to Hong Kong on Friday to get in touch. It said it had received notice from Guangdong authorities that a passenger on that flight was confirmed to have Covid-19. The health authorities in France have announced the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country has jumped to 100 as the government took measures to limit the spread of the virus. Of the reported cases so far, two people have died, 86 are in hospital - nine of whom are in a \u201cserious\u201d condition - and 12 people have recovered. The number of contaminations has leapt in France from 38 on Friday. Three health workers at a Paris hospital have tested positive for the coronavirus, as well as a firefighter in Rennes. In the Haute-Savoie region, where there has been a cluster of cases thought to have originated from a person who had returned from northern Italy , the mayor of La Balme-de-Sillingy, Fran\u00e7ois Daviet announced he had tested positive. France has banned gatherings of more than 5,000 people in \u201cconfined spaces\u201d and outside demonstrations in areas where the virus has been reported. Today\u2019s Paris half marathon is cancelled as well as the last day of the Agriculture Salon and the carnival at Annecy. However some sporting events going ahead. Around 2,000 schoolchildren are in self-imposed quarantine at home following advice from health officials to those who visited infected areas during the half term holidays to stay away from classes. Priests in some dioceses, including Paris, have been instructed not to put the \u2018host\u2019 into communicants\u2019 mouths but in their hands. Air France has imposed a freeze on hiring new staff and announced cost-cutting measures last week to offset the economic impact of the virus on the travel industry. People over 6o and those with underlying health conditions should try to avoid \u201ccrowded areas\u201d and \u201cplaces where you might interact with people who are sick\u201d, according to the head of the World Health Organisation, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Spain now has 73 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, according to the head of the country\u2019s Centre for the Coordination of Health Emergencies and Alerts. Speaking on Sunday morning, Fernando Sim\u00f3n said that 90% of the cases were imported or related to imported cases of the virus, adding that Spain would not be raising its alert level for the time being. Nor, he said, would it be enacting the drastic measures seen in France and Italy. A fifth person has tested positive for the virus at the hotel in Tenerife that has been locked down after four other people staying there were diagnosed with the coronavirus. The Italian national, part of the same group as the four original cases at the island\u2019s H10 Costa Adeje Palace Hotel, is now in hospital. The Canary Islands\u2019 regional health authorities said the man had been in isolation in a hotel room since 24 February and was \u201cin good state of health\u201d. Meanwhile, it appears that Ecuador\u2019s first case of the virus could have originated in Spain after a 70-year-old Ecuadorian woman living in Spain tested positive for the virus after flying from Madrid to Ecuador\u2019s second city, Guayaquil, on 14 February. According to Ecuadorian health authorities, the woman showed no symptoms of the illness on the flight. The American Physical Society has announced the cancellation of one of the world\u2019s major international scientific conferences, little more than a day before it was due to start. An announcement on its website said: \u201cDue to rapidly escalating health concerns relating to the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the 2020 APS March Meeting in Denver, Colorado, has been canceled. Please do not travel to Denver to attend the March Meeting.\u201d Around 10,000 physicists and scientists from around the world were due to attend the conference this week, and the late cancellation has caught many overseas delegates in the middle of travelling. Isolating UK cities, as the Chinese authorities did to Wuhan where coronavirus was first detected, may be necessary to stop the the spread of the outbreak, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, has conceded. Speaking to the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show, Hancock also confirmed that the NHS was planning to bring doctors out of retirement if the coronavirus becomes more widespread. Marr asked Hancock: \u201cChina, of course, isolated entire cities. Is it conceivable under any circumstance, you try and cut off the city in this country?\u201d Hancock replied: \u201cThere\u2019s clearly a huge economic and social downside to that. But we don\u2019t take anything off the table at this stage, because you\u2019ve got to make sure that you have all the tools available, if that is what\u2019s necessary. But I want to minimise the social and economic disruption.\u201d He said the government would be publishing its battle plan for the measures it would take under a worst case scenario for the outbreak. He said: \u201cIt may be necessary to close some schools, but right now, people should not be closing schools if there isn\u2019t a positive case.\u201d Hancock confirmed that other \u201cpopulation distancing measures\u201d could include banning public gatherings of more than 5,000 people as the French government has announced. He said: \u201cWe are looking at all those sorts of things, we do not rule them out.\u201d Asked if retired doctors and nurses would be asked to come out of retirement, Hancock said: \u201cWe may do. That isn\u2019t something we need right now. But the big challenge for the NHS in the event of this becoming widespread here is NHS staff themselves not being able to come to work because they\u2019re because they\u2019re ill or they\u2019re self-isolating. So it\u2019s about having the people available.\u201d He also played down a report in the Guardian that England only has 15 available beds for adults to treat the most severe respiratory failure. He said: \u201cI saw those figures published in the Guardian and they are wrong and out of date. We have 50 now, and we can ramp that up to 500. And then if necessary 5,000 beds that are able to cope with the worst impact of this virus but of course. Hancock also confirmed that non-emergency surgery, including hip and knee replacements, may be cancelled. He said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to do that. But these have to be clinical decisions. Clinicians have to make decisions about what is the most important and effective use of NHS resources. They do this all the time.\u201d Hancock also denied Labour claims Boris Johnson was shirking his responsibility by delaying chairing a Cobra emergency committee on the outbreak until Monday. He told Sky: The prime minister has been all over this. I have daily calls with him often more than once a day. And I\u2019ve been updating cabinet weekly. I\u2019ve been chairing those Cobra meetings across government \u2013 a case of ministers and officials working incredibly well together. And the prime minister is fully on top of all of this, and and that\u2019s the way it should be. Last week he did a night shift at a hospital to find out what it\u2019s really like on the frontline at two o\u2019clock in the morning. I applaud him for doing that Clearly, I\u2019m leading the operational response and working incredibly closely with him and every other member of the government. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the government is considering \u201call options\u201d for tackling the spread of coronavirus. Speaking on Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge programme, he described the outbreak as \u201ca very, very significant challenge\u201d. He said: \u201cWe are planning in case this gets much worse\u201d. Hancock insisted ministers would put the safety of people first, but they did not want to unnecessarily hit the economy and society. He said: We\u2019re considering all options. At the moment the number of cases in this country is 23. And that means that so long as people are washing hands and taking the precautions that are set out that is the right thing to do. We don\u2019t rule out taking any of these other measures. We will advice on those measures when it is right to take them because we want to minimise the economic and social disruption subject to keeping people safe. It\u2019s a balancing act, where I place the greatest weight on keeping people safe. But there\u2019s no point in doing things that aren\u2019t clinically effective. We have to be guided by the science. He added: The plan is very clear, firstly, to contain this virus, that\u2019s the stage we\u2019re in now. It means that every single case that is found here gets immediate treatment, but also we contact all of the people that that person has been in close contact with. Largely most of the cases so far, are from people who\u2019ve caught the virus elsewhere and brought it here, and we\u2019re then able to contain it. We\u2019ve put \u00a340m into trying to find a vaccine and also trying to improve the treatments for people who do have the disease. The experts say that a vaccine, even accelerated as fast as possible, is still many months off. But the potential for treatments that make the virus less of a problem if you\u2019ve got it, they are more optimistic. The final plan is to prepare for mitigation should this become endemic in this country and making sure that not only the NHS is prepared, but also all parts of society. The government has got a huge role to play, but so does every single person. At the moment, the best thing people can do is make sure that they wash their hands for 20 seconds or more. We\u2019re telling children that you\u2019ve got to wash your hands whilst you sing happy birthday to make sure that gets through very simply. If we get to a position where this is much more widespread, then of course we\u2019re we we will change the advice to deal with that. There\u2019s a danger to doing things too early because they wouldn\u2019t be effective. We are looking at every single option \u2026 with a clear battle plan for how we rise to the challenge of this. Hancock noted that stopping all flights from China, as pushed by some, had not proved successful for Italy, which is the worst affected country in Europe. Kuwait has confirmed a new case of coronavirus infection, bringing the total number of people diagnosed with the disease in the country to 46, a health ministry official told a press conference on Sunday, Reuters reports. The majority of the cases, including the one identified in the past 24 hours, are either people who had travelled to Iran or been in contact with people who were there, the official said. For the first time, Japan\u2019s professional baseball teams staged pre-season opening games behind closed doors after the country dramatically escalated its response to coronavirus by closing schools and cancelling mass events. The condition of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian woman detained in Iran, is getting \u201cworse and worse\u201d but the Iranian authorities are still refusing to test her for coronavirus, her family has said. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live, Richard said his wife\u2019s guards were \u201ckeeping away\u201d from her in case she has caught the disease. He said her \u201ccold like symptoms that have got worse and worse and they\u2019re not going away\u201d. He said: \u201cI\u2019m sure the prison is not testing partly because there\u2019s not many testing kits and partly because they don\u2019t want to know\u201d. The US, Australia and Thailand have reported their first deaths from coronavirus as two frontline doctors in China died and more countries put in place bans on large gatherings and travel restrictions. A 35-year-old male retail worker in Thailand died from Covid-19, according to the country\u2019s department of disease control on Sunday. The man had also tested positive for dengue fever. In Australia, a 78-year-old man who was on the Diamond Princess cruise ship died in a hospital in western Australia. His wife has also contracted the virus. On Saturday, US officials said a man in his 50s in Washington state had died, after being tested for the disease on Thursday. Authorities said they did not know how he had contracted the virus because he did not have any history of travel to affected areas or contact with known Covid-19 cases. On Sunday, China reported its sharpest increase in new infections in a week with 573 new cases, the highest daily rise in a week. Chinese health authorities reported 35 new deaths on Sunday, a drop from the previous day\u2019s toll of 47. A 32-year old doctor named Zhong Jinxing in the southern province of Guangxi who reportedly died from \u201coverwork\u201d on Friday after working for 33 consecutive days. Another doctor, Jiang Xueqing, 55, died on Sunday after having been infected with Covid-19, according to Chinese state media. Good morning from London, where the main news is that former health professionals could be brought out of retirement under emergency plans to combat the spread of coronavirus. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, is expected to give more details about the plans in a round of Sunday morning broadcast interviews. It comes after a further three people in England tested positive for the virus, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the UK to 23. Two of the patients had recently travelled back from Italy, while the other had returned from Asia, according to the chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty. Thailand has reported its first death from the virus - a 35-year-old retail worker who was also diagnosed with dengue fever. Japan reported its second death on Sunday - a man in his 70s on the island of Hokkaido. Australia recorded its first Covid-19 death on Sunday \u2013 a 78-year-old man who had been a passenger on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. He died in Perth and his wife is infected with the virus. The US has recorded its first death from Covid-19. A man in his 50s in Washington state, who had underlying health issues but with no travel history to affected areas. Two more doctors have died in China and the country\u2019s death tally has risen by 35 to 2,870. Infections have risen 573 to 79,824 (of which 41,825, or 52%, are listed as recovered). A second person in Australia has tested positive to the virus after returning from Iran. The government imposed travel restrictions on passengers coming from Iran. South Korea has recorded 376 more Covid-19 cases, taking the country\u2019s total to 3,526. Seventeen people have died. France and Italy have imposed strict bans on public gatherings. Ireland reported its first case of the virus, as did Ecuador, Luxembourg and Armenia. China has reported 573 new confirmed cases and 35 deaths. World stock markets are expected to fall further next week, after reports indicated China\u2019s factory output had plunged and the country\u2019s service sectors have contracted.

All cases are linked to recent travel to Italy. The woman, from northern Coahuila, was not showing symptoms. She had recently traveled to Milan. An alarming story from our Beijing correspondent, Lily Kuo, on citizen journalist Li Zehua who is missing, presumed detained. He\u2019s one of many for whom the coronavirus crisis has led to a political awakening and a demand for free speech. \u201cI don\u2019t want to remain silent, or shut my eyes and ears. It\u2019s not that I can\u2019t have a nice life, with a wife and kids. I can. I\u2019m doing this because I hope more young people can, like me, stand up,\u201d he says. The live stream, posted on Weibo, where it was later deleted, and on YouTube, shows two men in plain clothes entering the apartment and then cuts out. An interesting report from Reuters, about Indonesia, which continues to say it has seen no cases, despite some infections around the world linked to travel to or through Bali: Indonesia has the resources to cope with a coronavirus outbreak, the director of its leading infectious diseases hospital said, defending detection procedures in the Southeast Asian nation of more than 260 million, where no cases have been reported. The world\u2019s fourth most populous nation has tested 141 suspected cases, a small figure for its population, sparking concern among some medical professionals of a lack of vigilance and a risk of undetected cases. Neighbouring Malaysia has reportedly run about 1,000 tests, and Britain more than 10,000. \u201cWe can\u2019t doubt our skills and the facts we gather,\u201d said Muhammad Syahril, director of the Sulianti Saroso hospital in Jakarta, the capital, when asked why Indonesia had detected no cases. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have cases, we don\u2019t have cases,\u201d he said in an interview at the hospital on Friday. \u201cWhy would we cover it up?\u201d Reuters: A man in his 70s died on Japan\u2019s northernmost island of Hokkaido on Saturday night after testing positive for Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2, local authorities said on Sunday. The municipal government of Hokkaido said the patient was hospitalised on Jan. 17 for another disease, but started to show flu-like symptoms a few weeks later and tested positive for the coronavirus on Feb. 25. Public broadcaster NHK and other local media said authorities suspect the man may have caught the virus while in hospital. The man\u2019s death marks the sixth fatality from Covid-19 in Japan, excluding six deaths among those aboard the cruise ship Diamond Princess. The coronavirus outbreak in Hong Kong has not reached its peak yet, he Dean of the University of Hong Kong\u2019s Faculty of Medicine, Professor Gabriel Leung, warned on Sunday. RTHK reports Leung said it was too soon to tell when the outbreak would be end, and people should remain vigilant. \u201cThe rest of the world actually views Hong Kong, along with Singapore, as the gold standard in epidemic control,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at these two places, we have very similar absolute numbers of confirmed cases, yet we have a population that is one third bigger then Singapore, so - on a per capita basis - we\u2019re not doing too badly.\u201d Hong Kong has reported 95 cases and two deaths. Samsung Electronics has closed one of its factories in South Korea, according to Yonhap news agency. The mobile device factory in Gumni, near Davey, was closed after a worker tested positive for the coronavirus. It has been closed for a short time last month after an earlier case was discovered. From Reuters: Churches were closed in South Korea on Sunday with many holding online services instead, as authorities fought to rein in public gatherings, with 376 new coronavirus infections taking the tally to 3,526 cases. That came a day after the biggest daily jump of 813 cases in South Korea\u2019s battle with the largest virus outbreak outside China, said the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), which will update numbers later in the day. The death toll of 17 was unchanged from Saturday, it added. In Seoul, the capital, about a dozen worshippers were turned away from the Yoido Full Gospel Church, which put a sermon for its 560,000 followers on YouTube, filmed with a small choir instead of all 200 members and 60-strong orchestra. \u201cI had heard there would be no service, but just came to check as I live nearby, but yes, it is so empty,\u201d said one of them, Song Young-koo, as he left South Korea\u2019s biggest church. \u201cIt\u2019s a wise decision to do it online, since the virus would easily spread at mass gatherings and churches can be no exception.\u201d Some more details on that death in Thailand. Dr. Teerawat Hemachutha, Thiravat Hemachudha, Head of Emerging Disease Health Science Center Faculty of Medicine Chulalongkorn Hospital, the Thai Red Cross, posted on Facebook earlier today that the victim was a 35-year-old male retail worker who also tested positive to dengue fever. Citing an unnamed health official, Reuters is reporting that Thailand has seen its first Covid-19 death. I\u2019ll be handing over to my colleague, Helen Davidson, shortly, but before that, here\u2019s a summary of the top points so far. Australia recorded its first Covid-19 death on Sunday \u2013 a 78-year-old man who had been a passenger on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. He died in Perth and his wife is infected with the virus. The US also recorded its first death, a man in his 50s from Seattle who had underlying medical issues. Washington state\u2019s governor declared a state of emergency. The man had no history of travel to affected areas or contact with a known COVID-19 case Two more doctors have died in China and the country\u2019s death tally has risen by 35 to 2,870. Infections have risen 573 to 79,824 (of which 41,825, or 52%, are listed as recovered). South Korea has recorded 376 more Covid-19 cases, taking the country\u2019s total to 3,526. Seventeen people have died. WHO has raised the global risk level to \u201cvery high\u201d over coronavirus. Thailand reports 42nd case of Covid-19. Armenia has reported its first case of Covid-19. Thailand now has 42 cases of Covid-19, after a 21-year-old man tested positive on Saturday, the Bangkok Post reports. Sukhum Kanchanaphimai, the permanent secretary for public health, said the man\u2019s job brought him into contact with foreign tourists and he fell ill on 24 February, before seeking treatment the following day. He\u2019s currently in hospital in Bangkok. The country has not reported any deaths from the virus but, as of Sunday, authorities will have greater powers to act after the Public Health Ministry designated Covid-19 a dangerous communicable disease. Tourism in many parts of Thailand has suffered, with travellers curtailing their journeys amid fears of the virus\u2019s spread. American Airlines will suspend all US flights to Milan. It announced the move just hours after the US State Department said it was raising its travel warning for parts of Italy due to the coronavirus outbreak to Level 4 or \u201cdo not travel\u201d. This covers travel to Lombardy and Veneto, in Italy\u2019s north. American said it will suspend flights to and from Milan, from New York-JFK and Miami until 24 April, citing a reduction in demand. Vice President Mike Pence, who is heading the US response to the virus, said on Saturday that the State Department will work with Italy to coordinate medical screening of any individuals coming to the United States. Chinese state media is reporting that a doctor \u2013 32-year-old Zhong Jinxing \u2013 has died \u201cfrom overwork\u201d. The People\u2019s Daily repots that another doctor, Jiang Xueqing, 55, also died on Sunday. I\u2019m just doubling back on those Chinese figures announced today, that I mentioned at the start of the blog. Another 35 deaths were reported on Sunday, and 573 new confirmed cases. Of the deaths, all but one were in Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak. All but three of the new confirmed cases were also in Hubei. The total confirmed cases in China is 79,824, of which 41,825 (or 52%) are listed as recovered, and a total of 2,870 deaths have been recorded. Based on those figures, the case fatality rate for Covid-19 is 3.6%, which is something Chinese state media is also reporting. However, it\u2019s worth bearing in mind that there is a direct link between deaths and the number of cases reported in calculating that rate, so if people are having mild symptoms and don\u2019t go through the testing process, there\u2019s a likelihood that the eventual rate case fatality rate will be lower. We will only know this in hindsight. You may have seen reports last week that a dog in Hong Kong had tested \u201cweak positive\u201d to Covid-19. Experts in the UK told the Guardian they thought it was unlikely to be an actual infection, and that one possible explanation was that a dog had produced a false positive test as a result of close contact with a human who had the virus, or from coming in contact with the virus via touch. The dog showed no relevant symptoms of the virus authorities said and Hong Kong health authorities advised that it had no evidence that pets can be infected with Covid-19 or a source of the infection. But a spokesman from the Hong Kong Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD), said: \u201cTo ensure public and animal health, the department strongly advise mammalian pets of patients confirmed to have been infected with COVID-19 virus to be put under quarantine by the AFCD.\u201d The WHO says it is working with its partner agencies for human/animal health and is \u201cwaiting for further tests from Hong Kong\u201d, but the WHO boss, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said past experience with coronavirus and \u201cour current understanding of Covid-19 does not indicated that common household pets spread the disease or make people sick\u201d. If you\u2019re just catching up with the latest news on the virus, outbreak, a reminder that the World Health Organization has raised the risk assessment \u201cvery high\u201d globally. It also said the risk within #China remains unchanged as \u201cvery high.\u201d The WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the risk level had been elevated for two reasons difficulty in identifying cases due to non-specific symptoms &amp; the potential of undetected transmission potential for major impact on healthcare systems in some affected &amp; potentially affected countries. The WHO also released virus advice on the social media app, TikTok, in an effort it said to beat the \u201cinfodemic\u201d. South Korea has recorded 376 more Covid-19 cases, taking the country\u2019s total to 3,526. Seventeen people have died. Of the 376 new cases, 333 were in Daegu, 300km southeast of Seoul, which has been at the centre of the outbreak linked to the. Shincheonji Church of Jesus. The Yonhap agency says there were also 26 new cases reported in neighbouring North Gyeongsang Province. As of Sunday morning, South Korea was carrying out tests on 32,422 people nationwide, while 61,037 people have tested negative in total. Still on Australia, and on Sunday, the country\u2019s Home Affairs minister, Peter Dutton, said it was not possible to extend travel bans to all countries affected by the coronavirus outbreak, but he defended Australia\u2019s decision to restrict entry to people who had travelled from Iran, but not South Korea, which has many more cases. \u201cIf you look at the underreporting or the lack of reporting coming out of Iran ... there was a real concern as to whether they had a handle on the numbers,\u201d Dutton said, adding that South Korea has a more advanced health system. We are hearing a news conference from Australia, where officials have confirmed that a Western Australian man has confirmed the country\u2019s first death from Covid-19. Dr Andrew Robertson, Western Australia\u2019s chief health officer, confirms that the man travelled back to Australia from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. The man was diagnosed in the Howard Springs quarantine facility outside Darwin 9 or 10 days ago. The man, in his late 70s, passed away in the early hours of Sunday morning in intensive care in a West Australian hospital. His wife is also infected with Covid-19. Robertson who is giving the news conference, has confirmed that there is still no community transmission in Australia. The man\u2019s wife is in isolation in hospital and being monitored. Robertson is asked what Australians can do to protect themselves from the virus. He says handwashing is important but also says people should consider getting the flu shot this year. We are getting unconfirmed reports that an Australian man has died in Western Australia from Covid-19 \u2013 the country\u2019s first fatality. We are waiting for official confirmation, but media reports say he is a 78-year-old passenger from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan, and was one of the 164 Australians to be repatriated from the ship around two weeks ago. We will bring you confirmation on this as soon as we have it \u2013 we are expecting a news conference shortly. First to the US where the first death from Covid-19 has been recorded. The man was in his 50s and had underlying health issues. He died at a hospital in Kirkland, near Seattle. Officials are unsure how he was exposed to the virus. Washington state has two other presumed cases at a long-term care facility in Kirkland where more than 50 residents and staff could be showing symptoms, according to Jeffrey Duchin, head of the Washington health department\u2019s communicable disease unit. \u201cAt this point we do not have widespread community-wide transmission locally. We have transmission that\u2019s associated with an outbreak at this long-term care facility,\u201d Duchin said. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak.
