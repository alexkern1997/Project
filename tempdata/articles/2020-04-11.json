From the letter:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>\u201cLaunch a nationwide public service campaign to educate consumers about common scams targeting the economically vulnerable. Over the next several weeks, most consumers will receive checks of $1,200 or more because of the recently enacted Cares Act.

The weekend long curfew, the first of its kind within the United States geographical borders, will be enforced by tribal police, who have been authorized to sanction violators with a fine of up to $1000 and/or 30 days in jail. Essential workers such as medical staff are exempt, but must carry a letter from their employer. </p> \n  <p>On Thursday, Navajo president <strong>Jonathan Nez</strong> and vice-president <strong>Myron Lizer</strong>, announced that they were going into self-quarantine after recently coming into contact with a first responder who later tested positive for the virus. \u201cThis is real and no-one is immune from contracting the virus. We will continue to fight for our people as we self-quarantine - this is a precautionary measure,\u201d said Nez during an online town hall meeting. </p> \n  <p>The Navajo government was quick to implement prevention and mitigation measures after reporting its first case on 17 March, in an effort to minimize spread through its vast territory which stretches over parts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. This included issuing a stay at home order just two days after California, followed by an 8pm to 5am curfew. But, the virus is spreading rapidly with 558 confirmed cases including 20 deaths as of Thursday 9 April. </p> \n  <p>Last month, the US federal government approved $8bn for native communities and tribal services in its third coronavirus rescue package, but tribal leaders fear that they won\u2019t see the money until summer due to red tape and paperwork.

An updated summary: Donald Trump said whether to ease physical distancing guidelines is the biggest decision he\u2019ll ever make. He also said his appearances at the coronavirus taskforce briefings are the \u201csaddest\u201d ones he\u2019s had to do. New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, is cautiously optimistic the infection rate is slowing in his state. New York City crossed 5,000 confirmed coronavirus cases as of 5pm tonight. State officials are moving forward with vote-by-mail steps despite Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated warnings. Meanwhile, Wisconsin health officials are studying how many coronavirus cases may be linked to the state\u2019s in-person voting day. A major coronavirus outbreak at a homeless shelter in San Francisco renewed demands from advocates that the city prevent a devastating spread of infection by housing the homeless in the city\u2019s many empty hotel rooms. Activists and family members are holding socially distant protests to demand the release of loved ones incarcerated in prisons and jails across the United States. In New York tonight, activists held a candlelight vigil over social media. In Richmond, Virginia, they rallied in their cars. \u201cMy son is essential to me,\u201d one mother of a jailed 19-year-old wrote on her protest sign. Another image for the end of this day: Need a bit of comfort at the end of another long week? (Not even sure what the end of a week feels like any more?) My colleague (and journo-dad) Mario Koran has a lovely piece from earlier today about parenting, pandemics and the wise advice of the people behind Sesame Street. More than 5,000 confirmed coronavirus deaths as of 5pm tonight in New York City alone. And that is almost certainly an undercount, with many people dying of coronavirus in their homes not being counted in the official figures. Socially distant car protest for prisoner safety in Richmond, Virginia Another way to organize a protest under a stay-at-home order? Protest in your car. Dozens of people rallied from their cars in Virginia\u2019s state capital Friday afternoon to address the state\u2019s failure to keep incarcerated inmates safe during the coronavirus pandemic, ABC 8News Richmond reported. \u201cI don\u2019t want my son to die alone\u2026free my son,\u201d Shontrese Otey, who has a 19-year-old son in Richmond City Jail, told 8News. She was holding a sign that read, \u201cMy son is essential to me.\u201d What does protest look like under a stay-at-home order? This evening, activists are lighting a candle in solidarity with more than 90,000 people typically incarcerated in state prisons and jails in New York state, as coronavirus threatens to turn crowded, unsanitary prisons into death traps. The protest is being organized by New York prison abolition activists, under the hashtag #FreeThemAll4PublicHealth. The protesters are calling on New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and other local and state leaders to use their power to release everyone incarcerated in the state. Advocates have been pleading for weeks that San Francisco move people out of homeless shelters and into hotel rooms, given that the conditions inside these facilities are often unsanitary and crowded, making it easy for a virus to quickly spread. Now, there has been a major coronavirus outbreak inside a homeless shelter in San Francisco: nearly 70 residents at MSC South have tested positive, which is roughly half of all the people who were tested. San Francisco\u2019s mayor, London Breed, said the city is now moving the rest of the MSC South residents who have not tested positive into hotel rooms and quarantining those with Covid-19 inside the shelter. Jennifer Friedenbach, the director for the Coalition on Homelessness in San Francisco, said these kinds of outbreaks will happen at every shelter if the city doesn\u2019t immediately move all residents to hotels. Some have suggested the coronavirus fatality rate for unhoused people could be significantly higher than the general population, with a 10-20% dying and 30% hospitalized, she noted. \u201cThis was preventable and predictable. You can\u2019t leave people in congregate settings, you just can\u2019t,\u201d said Friedenbach, adding that the city needs to test residents of all shelters given their potential exposure at this point. \u201cThey\u2019ve waited so long.\u201d Those who remain in other shelters are now also facing strict lockdowns, where they are even more at risk of contracting the virus, said Leah Simon-Weisberg, an attorney with the Eviction Defense Collaborative. \u201cLocking them in a congregate shelter and packing hundreds of people into one place is only endangering their lives,\u201d she said. Drone footage: pandemic San Francisco The effect of the three-week-long lockdown on daily life in San Francisco is revealed in drone footage showing empty streets and deserted landmarks. San Francisco and the counties around it was the frist region in the US to announce a \u2018stay-at-home\u2019 order on 16 March, restricting all but essential activities. Black doctor says he was handcuffed outside his own home in Miami A black doctor who has been testing homeless people for coronavirus in Miami was handcuffed by a police officer outside his own home, and only released after his wife emerged from the house with identification, he told the Miami Herald. The doctor said he was putting old cardboard outside of his home for pickup. \u201cMiami police, informed of the doctor\u2019s claims, said Henderson had not called the department to complain but that they were sending an investigator to the house to look into what happened,\u201d the newspaper reported. Read the full story. The Wisconsin state health department is tracking new cases of the coronavirus to determine whether it was spread among voters during Tuesday\u2019s spring election, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in this report spotted by my Guardian colleague Kenya Evelyn. \u201cThe state Department of Health Services and local public health officials are \u201cmonitoring\u201d the relationship between new cases in the coming weeks and voting in person, agency officials said. \u201cWe will continue this important work to ensure that every case is followed up on, contacted, and anyone who may have been exposed notified,\u201d Department of Human Services secretary Andrea Palm said in a statement. \u201cWe hope the extraordinary efforts taken by local clerks, public health, voters, and poll workers helped minimize any transmission but we stand prepared to respond if that isn\u2019t the case.\u201d Palm said if voters were exposed to the virus, DHS and local public health officials will see new cases beginning next week. \u201cThis information will allow our surveillance epidemiologists the opportunity to identify if the election had any impact on the spread of Covid-19 in Wisconsin,\u201d she said. But a full picture of whether in-person voting led to more cases won\u2019t be known for several weeks, Palm said. Thousands of voters came to the polls Tuesday after a failed last-minute attempt by [Democratic] governor Tony Evers to postpone the election. Public health experts warned before and after the election took place that allowing people to vote in person could reverse progress the state has made to contain the spread of the virus. From earlier today, a bigger picture look at Wisconsin from Sam Levine: Coronavirus in a major homeless shelter; stay-at-home extended in LA Lois Beckett here picking up our live US politics coverage from the West Coast. Here in California, Los Angeles county has announced an extension of its stay-at-home order until 15 May. And in San Francisco, one of northern California\u2019s largest homeless shelters is experiencing a serious coronavirus outbreak, the city\u2019s mayor said. Read more background on how San Francisco has failed its homeless population from my colleague Vivian Ho. That\u2019s it for me. The blog is now in the capable hands of my west coast colleague Lois Beckett. To recap: Trump said whether to ease physical distancing guidelines is the biggest decision he\u2019ll ever make. New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, is cautiously optimistic the infection rate is slowing in his state. State officials are moving forward with vote-by-mail steps despite Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated warnings. Trump said his appearances at the coronavirus taskforce briefings are the \u201csaddest\u201d ones he\u2019s had to do. A fascinating report from CNN, about Trump trade adviser, China hawk and coronavirus tsar Peter Navarro\u2026 In short, Navarro \u2026 \u2026publicly said Americans had \u201cnothing to worry about\u201d while he privately warned the White House that the coronavirus pandemic could cost trillions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of American lives. Axios and the New York Times reported the Navarro memos earlier in the week. So, CNN went and looked at Navarro\u2019s comments to the media around the time he wrote those memos. Em Steck and Andrew Kaczynski report, in part: In Navarro\u2019s second memo, dated 23 February, he urged for immediate funding to \u201cminimize economic and social disruption\u201d. \u201cAny member of the Task Force who wants to be cautious about appropriating funds for a crisis that could inflict trillions of dollars in economic damage and take millions of lives has come to the wrong administration,\u201d Navarro wrote. But at a press gaggle on 24 February, Navarro assured that coronavirus was \u201cnothing to worry about for the American people\u201d under Trump\u2019s leadership. \u201cSince the day that President Trump pulled down the flights from China to the US, he has been actively leading the situation in terms of this crisis with the task force. Nothing to worry about for the American people. \u201cThis country\u2019s done a beautiful job under [the] president\u2019s leadership [sic] in terms of managing this situation. He\u2019s working on a daily basis with the task force and we\u2019re taking steps to anticipate \u2026 where the puck\u2019s gonna be. We\u2019re skating there in defense of the American people and the American economy. So you can be sure you\u2019re that in great hands with the Trump administration.\u201d Our own Julian Borger has a lot more on the kind of hands you\u2019re in with the Trump administration in the following profile of Navarro, including: Five of Navarro\u2019s books cited a China hand with a particularly pithy turn of phrase called Ron Vara, who turned out not to exist. The name is an anagram of Navarro and the imaginary expert operated as an alter ego, confirming the author\u2019s views. A former campaign adviser, Larry Remer, says: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t trust him to go out to get lunch and come back with everybody\u2019s sandwich and drink order correctly. I don\u2019t know how he could be put in charge of logistics. Former spokeswoman Lisa Ross says: \u201cPeter can be a real bully and maybe that\u2019s why Trump picked him. He wanted a bully to do the job.\u201d Here\u2019s the piece in full. It\u2019s a hell of a read, under a hell of a headline: A coalition of companies, consumer advocacy groups, and research organizations submitted a letter to Mike Pence and other executive branch leaders on Thursday arguing that more should be done to thwart online fraud surrounding the coronavirus pandemic. Spearheaded by the National Consumers League and the Alliance for Safe Online Pharmacies, the letter encouraged new guidelines around online domain registrars and other fraud prevention techniques. It was signed by more than 30 entities. Guidelines suggested include requiring domain name registrars to validate names and registration information, and to make that data accessible to federal agencies and law enforcement. This could more easily prevent scams like one case brought by the Department of Justice against coronavirusmedicalkit.com last month. The website was targeting scared consumers with misinformation, offering them fake \u201cvaccine kits\u201d for coronavirus for $4.95 when in fact there is no vaccine. \u201cThe Department of Justice will not tolerate criminal exploitation of this national emergency for personal gain,\u201d the assistant attorney general Jody Hunt of the Department of Justice\u2019s civil division said regarding the case. The letter also suggested Congress require all US-based domain name registrars to \u201cimmediately lock and suspend any domain name used to facilitate coronavirus and other public health scams\u201d. In addition to monitoring domain activity, the groups suggested the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission crack down on phishing campaigns \u2013 enticing consumers to click on malicious links \u2013 that exploit economic fears. From the letter: \u201cLaunch a nationwide public service campaign to educate consumers about common scams targeting the economically vulnerable. Over the next several weeks, most consumers will receive checks of $1,200 or more because of the recently enacted Cares Act. Scammers are already defrauding consumers by claiming they can expedite the receipt of these funds. The FTC and IRS should dramatically increase their efforts to educate consumers about these scams, and the Department of Justice should prioritize investigation and prosecution of the criminals behind them.\u201d About 74 miles of city streets will be blocked off for joggers and bikers to enjoy for Easter weekend after Libby Schaaf, the mayor of Oakland, California, announced a \u201cslow streets initiative\u201d. The move will give residents a way to get outdoors at a time when the record number of visitors who flocked to beaches and parks prompted officials to close popular recreational spots. \u201cBecause of the reduction in car traffic, we will be closing off a number of streets so that bicyclists and pedestrians can spread out and take in fresh air safely on Oakland streets, free of cars,\u201d Schaaf said Thursday. Officials at the moment have no plans to enforce the street closures through citations. Aboout 11% of the city\u2019s land is made up of 6,000 acres of parks. Streets and sidewalks make up another 20-30%, said a city official, adding that the city wanted to take advantage of its space for the sunny, holiday weekend that\u2019s expected. The initiative comes as data shows promising trends for the efforts to slow the spread of the virus in California. Across the state, the amount of travel has dropped precipitously, perhaps most dramatically in Los Angeles, where residents have witnessed the rare sight of traffic-free interstates and sunsets without smog. The data on residents\u2019 movement is part of what suggests to officials the state\u2019s coronavirus peak \u2013 expected in May \u2013 may not be as high as health experts initially feared. The rate of hospitalizations and admissions to the ICU has appeared to slow since last week, according to numbers the governor provided Friday. Trump just departed the briefing room. Friday\u2019s coronavirus taskforce press conference has ended. Fact Check: medical supplies Trump claimed the US has enough beds, ventilators, and personal protective equipment (PPE) including masks. \u201cWe\u2019re in great shape,\u201d he said. Reports of PPE shortages continue to be reported by healthcare staff and other essential workers in many parts of the country, who are reusing and recycling masks and gowns. This is taken from the CDC website: Strategies to Optimize the Supply of PPE and Equipment \u201cPPE is used everyday by healthcare personnel (HCP) to protect themselves, patients, and others when providing care. PPE helps protect HCP from potentially infectious patients and materials, toxic medications, and other potentially dangerous substances used in healthcare delivery. PPE shortages are currently posing a tremendous challenge to the US healthcare system because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Healthcare facilities are having difficulty accessing the needed PPE and are having to identify alternate ways to provide patient care.\u201d Trump: these are the saddest news conferences that I\u2019ve ever had Pressed on whether the United States has enough medical equipment and whether Trump offers too rosy a picture at these coronavirus taskforce briefings, Trump said he believed he the country has enough equipment and that he did not enjoy speaking at these pressers. The comments from the president came in response to a question from CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta. \u201cThese are the saddest conferences I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d Trump said. I don\u2019t like doing them. Why? Because I\u2019m talking about death ... there\u2019s no happy talk, Jim. This is the real deal. And I\u2019ve got to make the biggest decision of my life and I\u2019ve only started thinking about that. This is by far the biggest decision of my life.\u201d Trump went on to say the country has enough equipment. \u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018no, no, no\u2019, it\u2019s \u2018yes, yes, yes\u2019,\u201d Trump said. Fact check: what is coronavirus? Trump once again seemed to confuse bacteria with viruses when answering a question about a spike in coronavirus cases at a food processing plant in Denver. \u201cAntibiotics used to solve everything, but the germ has gotten so brilliant that antibiotics can\u2019t keep up,\u201d said Trump. Fact: coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus called Sars-CoV-2. Nothing to do with bacteria. Trump on easing social distancing: I would say without question it\u2019s the biggest decision I\u2019ve ever had to make The president said that deciding whether to ease recommendations on social distancing might be one of the biggest decisions, if not the biggest one, he\u2019ll have to make. Trump stressed he has \u201cabsolute\u201d authority to issue a national stay at home order but so far he\u2019s chosen not to use it. He said he preferred to let governors make that call and currently 95% of the country is under a stay at home order. \u201cNinety-five per cent of the country is stay at home,\u201d Trump said, pointing first to Texas, where the governor, Greg Abbott, has issued one. \u201cHe had a very strong stay at home. Ninety-five to 96% has it. South Carolina has it ... 95% of the country is covered.\u201d Trump added: \u201cConstitutionally, from a federal standpoint \u2013 if I thought there was a problem I would handle it.\u201d Trump continued: \u201cI have great authority to use it ... I have absolute authority to use it but so far our relationship with governors, I haven\u2019t had to do it. Trump to attend Robert Jeffres service Trump said he will attend the online service of Pastor Robert Jeffres. He said he would attend Easter service digitally on a laptop. \u201cI\u2019m going to be with him on Easter meaning I\u2019m going to be with him watching on a laptop,\u201d Trump said. Fact check: Boeing hasn\u2019t asked for aid Trump was asked if Boeing should be penalised for mass layoffs despite receiving federal aid. Trump claimed that Boeing, which he described as \u201cprobably the greatest company in the world\u201d, was yet to ask for aid, though he anticipated that the company would. Fact: On 17 March, Boeing requested $60bn in government aid for the aerospace industry hit by coronavirus. The company has not yet applied for a slice of the $2tn rescue package after the chief executive apparently balked at the possibility of government equity stakes in exchange for the relief. Trump plans to include governors on his new council looking at when to reopen the government. He said that includes Democrats. The president then name-checked a number of governors he gets along with. He said he just finished a phone call with New York\u2019s Andrew Cuomo. He also mentioned Phil Murphy of New Jersey. \u201cI\u2019ve actually become friends with some of the Democrat governors that I wouldn\u2019t have gotten to know. Governor Murphy of New Jersey\u2019s a very liberal guy. I\u2019m not ... Gavin Newsom. Honestly, fight or never,\u201d Trump added: \u201cI\u2019ve really developed a lot of good friendships with the governors. I think Mike DeWine, a Republican, I think he\u2019s doing a great job. \u201cI\u2019d like to have some representative governors on the council,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo far everyone\u2019s said yes. I think everyone would like to be on that council. It\u2019s a very important council.\u201d Fact check: more jobs for African Americans since Trump took office Trump said that African Americans have more jobs under his administration. Before the pandemic, the unemployment rate was falling overall but increasing for African Americans. For example, in December 2019, the unemployment rate had fallen 3.5% for all Americans and increased to 5.9% for black Americans. So far, the mass layoffs seem to have been proportionally higher for Asians and Hispanics. Last week\u2019s unemployment benefits claims\u2019 figures showed that while whites and blacks saw job loss rates rise at the same pace, the unemployment rate for blacks stood at 6.7% - 65% higher than for whites. Asked whether he would open up the US again next month if his advisers presented him with evidence that there would be a dramatic spike of coronavirus cases Trump said he wants to get it open as soon as possible. But he isn\u2019t determined, the president said in response to a question from CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta. \u201cI do say this Jim: I want to get it open as soon as possible,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI would love to open it. I\u2019m not determined.\u201d He said that he would unveil a new taskforce of counsel to advise him on dealing with coronavirus and when to reopen the country. He said he would discuss it more next week Trump said it would be bipartisan. \u201cThe one thing I didn\u2019t ask \u2018are you a Republican or Democrat\u2019 and I want their views on what they think,\u201d Trump said. Trump is not backing away from comments he made vowing to look at funding to the World Health Organization. The president said he would discuss it more next week. He also sounded that he was open to cutting funding to the organization. Surgeon General Adams was asked about urging African Americans to avoid alcohol and tobacco. He said: \u201cIf not for yourself, then for your abuela. Do it for your grand-daddy. Do it for your big mama. Do it for your pop-pop.\u201d Adams was asked if that language was appropriate. He said he felt it was because that\u2019s the language used in his family. \u201cThat was not meant to be offensive. That\u2019s the language that I use and we use,\u201d Adams said. But he added that he would make those recommendations to all American. \u201cAll Americans need to avoid these substances at all times,\u201d Adams said. Fact check: Testing Trump said \u201cthere\u2019s not a lot of issues with testing\u201d... \u201cWe\u2019ve done more testing than any country in the world.\u201d While the US has ramped up testing, it still lags behind other countries, including South Korea and Germany. South Korea has administered 486,003 tests, according to the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. With a population of 51.5m, the country has tested about 1 in every 102 people. Germany has done even better, testing every 1 in 63 people. The UK is still way behind, having tested only 1 in 230 people by Wednesday 8 April. Meanwhile, the United States, with a population of 329 million, has administered at least 2,391,119 tests, according to the Atlantic\u2019s Covid Tracking Project \u2014 so the US has tested about 1 in every 138 people. Epidemiologists prefer to use tests per capita to compare countries: \u201cI think the important clarification is that we should be considering the number of cases per 1 million population and considering a rate of people tested and not the absolute numbers,\u201d Jennifer Horney, founding director of the University of Delaware\u2019s epidemiology program, told CNN. \u201cThe absolute number of tests is not very meaningful.\u201d And despite the increase in testing, backlogs are reported in labs across the country, and many folks with symptoms - including health workers - are still struggling to access tests. Fact check: testing Trump bragged about the quality of tests in the US, boasting that \u201cwe\u2019ve made the best tests in the world\u201d. In fact, some of the initial coronavirus tests sent out to states were seriously flawed. Part of the problem came from the CDC shunned the WHO template for tests, and insisted on developing a more complicated version that correctly identified Covid-19, but also flagged other viruses \u2013 resulting in false positives. Other countries \u2013 after their first coronavirus case \u2013 swiftly asked private companies to develop their own tests. South Korea, which recorded its first case on the same day as the US, did so within a week. The US only allowed laboratories and hospitals to conduct their own tests on 29 February, almost six weeks after the first case was confirmed. Trump on warnings about reopening by 1 May: I will certainly listen Trump was pressed on whether he would heed the warnings of health officials, including some who advise him, as to whether the country could reopen by early May. Trump has reportedly been hoping to see that. At first he digressed. \u201cI listen to them about everything,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI have great respect for these people. All of them. Trump joked: \u201cIn fact I told Tony Fauci, why don\u2019t you move to New York, run against AOC, you will win easily. I kid, you know that.\u201d Asked again he didn\u2019t budge. \u201cI can only say this: I have tremendous respect for these doctors and we\u2019ve done very well,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI have great respect for these people. I\u2019m never saying bad about these people.\u201d And then pressed a third time, Trump said: \u201cI will certainly listen. I will certainly listen. There are two sides. Remember, I understand both sides of an argument very well.\u201d Fact check: oil reserves Trump said the US probably has the biggest oil reserves in the world. According to the World Population Review, Venezuela has the biggest crude oil reserves, followed by Saudi Arabia, Canada, Iran and Iraq. The US is 11th \u2013 sandwiched in between Nigeria and Kazakhstan. Mike Pence just now just urged churches and other religious \u201cto heed the guidelines\u201d and avoid gatherings of more than 10. \u201cWe\u2019re grateful that so many churches, synagogues, and places of worship have continued to do that,\u201d Pence said. Some churches and religious locations have held gatherings larger than the recommended guidelines in recent days. Factcheck: rate of spread More on Trump\u2019s claim that the rate of the virus spread is slowing down across the country, \u201cwithout exception\u201d. While the number of confirmed cases and hospital admissions have leveled off or dropped in some states including Louisiana, New York and New Jersey, the number of cases continues to increase in many states including Nebraska, Alabama, Kentucky, Texas and Arizona. Dr Jerome Adams, the US surgeon general, took the podium. He said that he helped lead a conference call with more than 400 hundred leaders in the African American community to discuss the disproportionate impact of coronavirus on the American minority community. He ticked off stats of where there is a larger number of African Americans or Hispanics who have the virus. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard the stats in New York City, Hispanics represent the majority of deaths,\u201d Adams said, going on to say: \u201cSo what\u2019s going on? Well, it\u2019s alarming but it\u2019s not surprising that people of color have a higher burden of chronic health conditions.\u201d Adams explained that \u201cthe chronic burden of medical ills is likely to make people of color\u201d more vulnerable \u201cto the ravages\u201d. \u201cWe tell people to wash their hands, but as studies show, 30% of the homes in Navajao nation don\u2019t have running water,\u201d Adams said. Adams added: \u201cBut let me be crystal clear, we do not think people of color are biologically or socially prone to\u201d [getting the disease]. Fact check: hospital admissions and death rate Trump claimed that the rate of the virus spread is slowing down across the country, \u201cwithout exception\u201d and that the death rate in the US was lower than anywhere else in the world. According to one source, the global death is 13 per million people. The US death rate is currently 54 per million, much higher than Germany at 31 per million, Portugal at 43 per million and 14 per million in Canada, but lower than Spain, France, Italy and the UK. A few minutes later Dr Deborah Birx said: \u201cWe have not reached the peak.\u201d Trump: the stock market thinks we\u2019ve done well Trump said that the stock market\u2019s recent swings show that his administration is doing well in responding to the pandemic. \u201cIn four days, we had the biggest stock market increase that we had in 50 years. That tells you that there\u2019s a pent up demand. They want to get back,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo think of it, in this horrible, dark period where this monster came and worked its horrible horrible spell over the world. Trump added: \u201cWe\u2019ve done well and I guess the market thinks we\u2019ve done well because had the biggest stock market increase\u201d recently. Trump once again touted hydroxychloroquine as a coronavirus cure. In the week beginning 30 March, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provided hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug that is also used to treat autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, with an \u201cemergency use authorization\u201d to use on coronavirus patients in some circumstances. Clinical trials to test the drug\u2019s effectiveness in treating coronavirus have begun across the world, and in the US. However, experts, including US public health officials, have warned that it is too early to know if hydroxychloroquine works. So far, the evidence that it\u2019s an effective cure for coronavirus is anecdotal and mixed. An initial French study that appeared to have launched the Trump administration\u2019s obsession with the drug has since been discredited. The drug is considered relatively safe for people without an underlying illness, but it\u2019s unclear if it is safe for severely sick Covid-19 patients, who may have incurred organ damage due to the virus. The surge in demand for the unproven hydroxychloroquine also risks shortages of the drug for those who need it most. It is used to help patients manage the chronic autoimmune disease lupus, but some are already complaining the drug is harder to come by. Fact check: death toll will be under 100,000 in the US Trump said his government\u2019s aggressive strategy had saved \u201ccountless lives and that great progress is being made\u201d. He claimed that the final death toll would be substantially under 100,000. Last week, the Whitehouse taskforce experts estimated the final death toll would likely be between 100,000 and 220,000 based on modelling. This week, the main model used lowered the estimated expected deaths toll by August to 60,400. But, Dr Anthony Fauci and others have warned that this depends on strict social distancing being implemented for months. The current death toll stands at 17,831. Trump ticked off a number of areas around the country that have seen welcome declines on the coronavirus pandemic. He said: \u201cDetroit has really started to go up and now it is stabilizing.\u201d He said he spoke with Louisiana\u2019s governor, John Bel Edwards, and that New Orleans and the state is less in need of hospital beds. And in Washington state Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019re making enough progress that the governor is able to return an army field hospital so we\u2019re going to take that hospital.\u201d Fact check: Mexican troops at the border wall Trump thanked president of Mexico, Andre\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador for sending 27,000 troops to the Mexico-US border. Fact: in January Amlo announced that 15,000 military and national guard would be deployed to the northern border. About 6,500 others are deployed to Mexico\u2019s southern border with Guatemala. The coronavirus taskforce press conference has begun. Donald Trump is here again. He began his remarks recounting his conversation with Mexican president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador on oil. Then he pivoted to coronavirus. \u201cTremendous progress is being made. I just spoke with Governor Cuomo, we had a good talk,\u201d Trump said. He said the numbers of death are \u201chorrible\u201d. \u201cNow on the other side we have the number of beds being used, we were just saying are being substantially reduced.\u201d Trump added: \u201cWe\u2019re saving hundreds of lives compared to what it could have been.\u201d Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, urged caution even as some parts of New York hit hardest by coronavirus begin to recover. Via Reuters: The top US infectious disease expert warned on Friday that even though hard-hit spots like New York are showing positive results in the battle against coronavirus, it is too early to relax restrictions on Americans. The warning from Dr Anthony Fauci came as the Trump administration\u2019s top economic officials said on Thursday they believe the US economy could start to reopen for normal business in May, despite health experts\u2019 urging for continued social distancing measures to defeat the coronavirus. Donald Trump, seeking re-election on 3 November, wants to get the economy going as soon as possible. \u201cHopefully we\u2019re going to be opening up ... very, very, very, very soon, I hope,\u201d he said on Thursday at the White House coronavirus briefing. Fauci, however, warned against relaxing restrictions too soon. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing right now is favorable signs,\u201d Fauci said in an interview on CNN, citing progress in hard-hit New York. But he added, \u201cthe one thing you don\u2019t want to do is you don\u2019t want to get out there prematurely and then wind up back in the same situation\u201d. With many Americans celebrating the Easter holiday on Sunday, Fauci said it was important to keep social distancing measures in place. \u201cNow is no time to back off,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously we\u2019re looking for the kinds of things that would indicate that we can go forward in a gradual way to essentially reopen the country to a more normal way,\u201d Fauci said, but that depends on a number of factors. House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi also warned Trump against trying to get back to normal prematurely. \u201cI would hope that the scientific community would weigh in and say, \u2018You can\u2019t do this, it is only going to make matters worse if you go out too soon,\u2019\u201d Pelosi said in an interview with Politico late on Thursday. Virginia Governor Ralph Northam has signed several new gun restrictions he championed during this year\u2019s legislative session, cementing gains by gun control advocates they hope will serve as a \u201cblueprint\u201d for states around the country. The Old Dominion has been the center of the nation\u2019s gun debate after Democrats took full control of the General Assembly last year on an aggressive gun control platform, The Associated Press writes. Tens of thousands of gun owners from around the country rallied against new gun restrictions at the state Capitol in January while lawmakers ultimately approved seven out of eight of Northam\u2019s gun-control package. The governor announced Friday he\u2019d signed bills that include requiring universal background checks on gun purchases, a red flag bill to allow authorities to temporarily take guns away from people deemed to be dangerous to themselves or others, and limited handgun purchases to one a month. \u201cThis is an exciting day for me,\u201d Northam said on a conference call with gun-control advocates. Virginia was once a socially conservative state where lawmakers in both parties viewed gun rights as sacrosanct and the National Rifle Association held great sway. But as the state has grown more urban and suburban, the gun lobby\u2019s influence has waned. A mass shooting last year in Virginia Beach made gun control a front-burning issue in Virginia and heavy spending by groups backed by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg helped Democrats flip control of the legislature in November. Gun-control advocates said Friday they\u2019re planning to replicate their success in Virginia in other states. John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, said his group plans to spend heavily in key battleground states this year like Arizona, North Carolina and Pennsylvania to elect lawmakers who support new gun restrictions. Feinblatt said polling shows a gun-control agenda is popular in those states and that Virginia is a \u201cbellwether\u201d of what\u2019s to come. The coronavirus faskforce press briefing has been moved back to 1.30pm. We\u2019ll be blogging it here. Stay tuned. Trump encourages prayer and healing this Easter even as some churches plan gatherings The president just spoke in the Oval Office to give an Easter blessing on Good Friday, where he was joined by Maryland Bishop Harry Jackson. Trump said, according to the pool report: \u201cOur people are making tremendous sacrifices to end this pandemic. Though we will not be able to gather together with one another as we normally would on Easter, we can use this sacred time to focus on prayer, reflection and growing.\u201d He did not, however, make a point of putting out a message that churches should not be holding in-person services on Sunday. While many religious leaders plan to hold services remotely, there are plentiful reports of churches coast to coast planning to defy physical distancing orders or guidelines and encouraging congregations to attend, risking the further spread of the coronavirus. Trump also said: \u201cOur brave doctors, nurses and responders, first responder, responders of all, are fighting to save lives, our workers are racing to deliver critical medical supplies. Our best scientists are working around the clock to develop life-saving therapeutics and I think they\u2019re doing really well in doing so.\u201d The president would like to see the US open back up sometime next month but economists think things could get worse. The Navajo Nation is increasing its efforts to slow down the coronavirus spread. New York governor Andrew Cuomo argued that the country needs to make an \u201cunprecedented mobilization\u201d of both private industry and the federal government to combat the coronavirus. A new CBS poll found Americans\u2019 view of how Trump is handling the pandemic continues to dip. The blog will be back soon. The daily Coronavirus Task Force press briefing is at 1 p.m. In capping off this press conference Cuomo addressed the disparities in coronavirus infections among African Americans and latinos. There have been multiple reports that the pandemic has disproportionally hit the American minority community. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a surprise that we have a disparity among the African American and Latino community,\u201d Cuomo said. He noted that systemic racism is an ongoing problem in the country and in New York. Cuomo also noted that the disparity isn\u2019t as bad in New York as other places in the country. \u201cWe are going to do more testing in African American and Latino communities.\u201d Asked about the state\u2019s stockpile of personal protective equipment (PPE) and ventilators, Cuomo sounded a calming note. \u201cWe\u2019re okay right now. We\u2019re okay. We have a stockpile where we are now relatively comfortable,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cCompared to how we are operating under these circumstances we are relatively comfortable on ventilators and PPE if.\u201d the hospitalization rate remains down. Cuomo is punting on Trump\u2019s repeated argument that the World Health Organization deserves some blame for the coronavirus pandemic\u2019s spread. \u201cThe president\u2019s point is the World Health Organization should\u2019ve been more aggressive,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cThis is not my field. I don\u2019t know.\u201d Trump has repeatedly criticized the WHO saying it is \u201cChina-centric.\u201d Trump, during a press conference on Tuesday, said first that he would put on hold funding to the WHO and then later said his administration would consider that. Cuomo: We are flattening the curve Throughout this conference Cuomo has stressed caution in moving forward even as New York sees incremental progress. \u201cIs there going to be a second wave? Let\u2019s look at the countries that have gone through this process and what can we learn from them,\u201d Cuomo said. He pointed to Hong Kong: \u201cHong Kong recorded the biggest rise of cases and a new wave of infections. Is that true? Could it happen here? Article yesterday: Italy has seen a bump in a number of cases. Before we take this step we need to make sure we are more sure and more aware than we were in the past.\u201d But Cuomo added that New York is making progress. \u201cSo where do we go from here? First keep doing what we\u2019re doing. Stay home because that works. We are flattening the curve. We must continue flattening the curve,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cWe need both diagnostic testing and anti-biotic testing and we need millions and millions of them and we need them in a matter of weeks, not months.\u201d He also said \u201cwe need to be more prepared as a nation.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want a second wave, I don\u2019t want a third wave, I want this to be it.\u201d Cuomo in this press conference is offering some of his most direct arguments he\u2019s ever made on testing and whether the private sector can carry most of the burden in providing tests and help to the public on the coronavirus. He thinks it cannot. \u201cWe need an unprecedented mobilization where government can produce these tests in the millions. New York state is doing several thousand. We need 9 million people to get back to work,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cPrivate sector on their own I don\u2019t believe will be able to come to scale.\u201d Cuomo added \u201cyou\u2019re going to need government intervention to make that happen and the federal government is in the best position to do that.\u201d The New York governor also took aim at the stimulus bills Congress has passed to help businesses weather the crisis. \u201cThey\u2019ve passed a couple already. Bu you need a fair federal stimulus bill that is not a federal pork barrel bill,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cI understand the dynamics of the US senate but this is not a time to be passing bills to make sure your home state gets enough funding. That\u2019s not what this is about. This is about helping your state come back.\u201d Cuomo urges Trump administration to set up a \u201cheroes compensation fund\u201d. Just now Cuomo urged the Trump administration to set up a \u201cheroes compensation fund\u201d to help those working on the front lines of the coronavirus crisis. He added that \u201csaying thanks is nice. Actually providing assistance is even better.\u201d Cuomo went on to say that the return to normalcy will be a gradual process. It won\u2019t be an immediate thing. That\u2019s in contrast to the hopes of Trump who has privately signaled to his colleagues that he would like things to start returning to normal by next month. \u201cThe key to reopening is going to be testing,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a light switch like you flip the economy like a light switch. It\u2019s going to be a gradual phased process and it\u2019s going to be reliant on testing.\u201d Cuomo stared his Friday presser with some mild optimism. He said that \u201cwe are cautiously optimistic that we are slowing the infection rate.\u201d Cuomo went on to say that \u201cICU admissions is actually a negative number for the first time since we started this journey.\u201d But he added that the change in intibations \u201cis a little tick higher than it\u2019s been in the past few days. The three day average is also down. The bad news is we continue to lose a tremendous number of lives and endure great pain as a state \u2014775 lives lost.\u201d He then noted a comparison to September 11th and that the lives lost \u201cshould exceed 9/11 is beyond my capacity to understand.\u201d Without evidence the president has repeatedly charged voting by mail would dilute the election process and open voting up to rampant fraud. The Associated Press reports: President Donald Trump is warning without evidence that expanding mail-in voting will increase voter fraud. But several GOP state officials are forging ahead to do just that, undermining one of Trumps arguments about how elections should be conducted amid the coronavirus outbreak. While Trump has complained that voting by mail was ripe for fraud,\u201d Republican state officials in Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia have all taken steps to ease access to mail-in ballots, following health officials warnings that voting in person can risk transmission of the deadly virus. The Republican governor of Nebraska urged voters to apply for absentee ballots. Florida\u2019s GOP chairman says the party will continue to run a robust vote-by-mail program. The disconnect between Trump and Republican state officials illustrates the abrupt, hard turn the president and his national political allies have taken on the issue. Before the coronavirus hit, many in the GOP had warmed to mail-in voting, agreeing that it can be conducted without fraud and even used to their political advantage. But Trump\u2019s hard line appears to be driven by his personal suspicions and concerns about his own reelection prospects. Statewide mail-in voting doesnt work out well for Republicans,\u201d he tweeted this week. Trumps comments put his Republican allies in states in the awkward position of trying to defend their practices without criticizing the president. Some said they agreed with Trump, even as their actions seem to suggest otherwise. Others suggested Trump was out of line. New York governor Andrew Cuomo is holding his daily press conference live at 11:30 ET. I will be liveblogging it. At 1 p.m. today Trump is holding his own daily press conference and I\u2019ll be liveblogging that one as well. Stay tuned. A growing set of Republicans are urging Trump to cool it on the daily press conferences. They\u2019re arguing that a lighter touch would benefit the president more. There\u2019s Nikki Haley, the former Trump administration ambassador to the United Nations and a potential 2024 presidential candidate, who said Trump should let \u201chis experts speak.\u201d In an interview on Fox &amp; Friends Haley praised Trump\u2019s ability to \u201cover-communicate.\u201d \u201cI think he should go and set the tone. I think he should let them put out the data. I think they should answer any questions that the press has. And then they should leave,\u201d Haley said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they need to be too long. I don\u2019t think he needs to feel like he needs to answer everything.\u201d Trump\u2019s advisers are also beginning to worry about the ripple effect of Trump\u2019s long daily press conferences. It sometimes \u201cdrowns out his message,\u201d South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham told the New York Times. He\u2019s urged Trump to cut down to a once-a-week presser. Trump, it should be noted, enjoys doing the press conferences. Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign included an image of former Obama administration ambassador to China Gary Locke in a new attack ad. Locke, a former two-term governor of Washington, is a third generation Chinese-American who was born in Seattle. The subject of the attack ad is Joe Biden and China. The use of Locke\u2019s image implies that he is some kind of Chinese official. According to The New York Times (bolds mine): The image, which appears briefly, was pulled from a 2013 event in Beijing, where Mr. Biden, now the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, shared a stage with Gary Locke, the former governor of Washington, who also served as President Barack Obama\u2019s commerce secretary and ambassador to China. Mr. Locke is Chinese-American. \u201cDuring America\u2019s crisis, Biden protected China\u2019s feelings,\u201d the online ad says, presenting a montage of clips of Mr. Biden complimenting and praising the Chinese, including the country\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, and of a news segment accusing Mr. Biden of helping his son Hunter profit off Chinese investments. The picture of Mr. Biden and Mr. Locke is spliced in among the clips. Steve Guest, the rapid response director for the Republican National Committee tweeted that Locke is not the point of the ad. Guest was responding to a tweet from Biden campaign spokesman T.J. Ducklo: Similarly, the Trump reelection team\u2019s communications director said the reason the image was included in the ad was the Chinese flag behind Biden and Locke. In a rare appearance in front of a group of mayors former President Barack Obama urged them to use experts and speak truth when publicly discussing the coronavirus pandemic. Here\u2019s the CNN report (bolds are from me): Former President Barack Obama on Thursday gave some advice to a group of mayors on how to deal with the coronavirus outbreak, saying that \u201cthe biggest mistake any (of) us can make in these situations is to misinform.\u201d Obama was speaking during a virtual meeting organized by Bloomberg Philanthropies.\u201dSpeak the truth. Speak it clearly. Speak it with compassion. Speak it with empathy for what folks are going through,\u201d Obama said, according to a press release on the virtual meeting.Obama also pushed the mayors to bring in as many smart advisers and experts as possible. \u201cThe more smart people you have around you, and the less embarrassed you are to ask questions, the better your response is going to be,\u201d Obama said. This is the fourth virtual meeting Bloomberg\u2019s group has held with mayors. Two of the previous meetings have featured speeches by former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Obama has repeatedly weighed in on the response to the virus, largely offering a more cautious message than that of President Donald Trump and advocating for protecting public health over re-starting economic activity. And Obama also urged the mayors to pay special attention to the most vulnerable. Here\u2019s his remark according to a press release from Bloomberg Philanthropies: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing disparities in how people are affected in cities and towns and communities across the country. Look out for the vulnerable. When you start looking at issues of domestic abuse and you start looking at racial disparities that are popping up in your cities, paying attention to that is the kind of leadership I know all of you aspire to. You have to be intentional about it, and dedicate folks to thinking about those issues.\u201d Here\u2019s a sign of the times: There\u2019s been an ongoing concern about how Capitol Hill lawmakers can legislate amid the coronavirus. In an interview with Politico, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi signaled the chamber is unlikely to return later this month (bolds mine): Speaker Nancy Pelosi signaled Thursday that the House is unlikely to return to session later this month, her clearest indication yet that Congress \u2014 like the rest of the country \u2014 could remain shuttered for weeks or even longer as the coronavirus crisis continues. In a half-hour interview, Pelosi issued a stark warning to President Donald Trump, urging him not to prematurely rush to reopen major segments of the country before the coronavirus is under control, which she said could further send the U.S. economy into a tailspin. \u201cNobody can really tell you that and I would never venture a guess. I certainly don\u2019t think we should do it sooner than we should,\u201d Pelosi said when asked if she still planned to bring the House back on April 20, which is the current target date. \u201cThis has taken an acceleration from when we started this\u2026Little did we know then that at this point, we\u2019d be further confined.\u201d Navajo Nation steps-up strict measures to slow down the coronavirus spread The Navajo Nation is gearing up for a 57-hour curfew which comes into effect at 8pm tonight, and will continue until 5am on Monday. The weekend long curfew, the first of its kind within the United States geographical borders, will be enforced by tribal police, who have been authorized to sanction violators with a fine of up to $1000 and/or 30 days in jail. Essential workers such as medical staff are exempt, but must carry a letter from their employer. On Thursday, Navajo president Jonathan Nez and vice-president Myron Lizer, announced that they were going into self-quarantine after recently coming into contact with a first responder who later tested positive for the virus. \u201cThis is real and no-one is immune from contracting the virus. We will continue to fight for our people as we self-quarantine - this is a precautionary measure,\u201d said Nez during an online town hall meeting. The Navajo government was quick to implement prevention and mitigation measures after reporting its first case on 17 March, in an effort to minimize spread through its vast territory which stretches over parts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. This included issuing a stay at home order just two days after California, followed by an 8pm to 5am curfew. But, the virus is spreading rapidly with 558 confirmed cases including 20 deaths as of Thursday 9 April. Last month, the US federal government approved $8bn for native communities and tribal services in its third coronavirus rescue package, but tribal leaders fear that they won\u2019t see the money until summer due to red tape and paperwork. Nez told Arizona news outlet ABC15: \u201cTo know that those dollars allocated and signed into law are supposed to go to all US citizens, but yet the first citizens of this country are being ignored by Washington.\u201d A new CBS poll finds Americans\u2019 views on Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic is dipping again. According to the poll: Views on President Trump\u2019s handling of the outbreak response have ticked down for the second consecutive week. The president is seen doing a good job by 47%, down four points from 51% last week and 53% the prior week. Now is the first time more say he\u2019s doing a bad job than a good one. The president gets comparably better marks on his handling of the economic impact of the outbreak, specifically, with 51% saying he\u2019s doing a good job. Good morning, readers. Donald Trump wants to reopen the country next month despite concerns from both economists and health experts that the coronavirus pandemic is nowhere near over. Trump, according to a Washington Post report, wants to restart business by 1 May. He\u2019s worried about how the volatile stock market and unemployment numbers will reflect his chances for reelection. Publicly, Trump seems to have the backing of some of his top aides. In an interview on CNBC on Thursday, treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin said \u201cI do\u201d when asked if he thought the country could reopen in about a month. But health experts worry that reopening the government prematurely could dramatically reverse some of the progress the country has made in fighting the virus. Trump\u2019s concerns about a struggling economy are likely to only get worse. Economists are expecting the United States to \u201csuffer its largest-ever contraction this quarter and the unemployment rate to soar to a post-Depression record, followed by a recovery that will be moderate and drawn out\u201d according to Bloomberg News.",

Globally women represent more than 70 per cent of all health care workers and in the home, women are predominantly the carers of the elderly, people with disabilities and children. With more people quarantined at home, the burden of unpaid care for women will most likely increase.</p> \n   <p>Therefore, we call on all governments in the region to assess and respond to the needs of all care workers, and to ensure that essential services for survivors of domestic violence are maintained and accessible to all women and girls.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it from this blog. My colleague Rebecca Ratcliffe has just launched a new one where you can follow developments for the next 24 hours or so. But to wrap up, here\u2019s something mournful yet joyful to enjoy: Argentina has extended its lockdown until 27 April \u2013 President Alberto Fernandez said in a televised address on Friday that the measure would be applied only in major cities. Most of the population lives in metropolitan areas like Buenos Aires, Mendoza and Cordoba. The nationwide lockdown was first mandated on March 20. Donald Trump has announced a special council to convene to discuss reopening the US economy as it tries to emerge from the Covid-19 shock. \u201cThis is beyond economic,\u201d he told reporters at his daily briefing in Washington earlier. \u201cI call it the \u2018opening our country taskforce\u2019 or \u2018opening our country council\u2019 so we don\u2019t get it confused with Mike\u2019s [Pence] taskforce, which has done so great. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to have the great business leaders, the great doctors, we\u2019re going to have a group of people. We\u2019ll probably do it by teleconference because we don\u2019t really travelling in for their own purposes. I don\u2019t think it would look good, also.\u201d Here\u2019s the full story: A very good piece from Guardian Australia reporter Ben Doherty about whether or not the government in Canberra can afford to risk relaxing controls as the curve continues to flatten. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/11/the-covid-19-exit-strategy-when-will-australia-know-the-coronavirus-battle-is-over Panama has annouced it has another 222 cases. It now has 2,974 cases of coronavirus and 74 deaths. The G20 meeting of the world\u2019s most developed nations, being held by teleconference by hosts Saudi Arabia, has been struggling to broker an agreement about oil production. But leaders have issued a rather vague statement saying that they will try to ensure that the energy sector makes a full contribution to helping the world economy recover from the coronavirus shock. It said they would work on policy responses and ensure market stability, and also annouced a \u201cshort-term\u201d policy group to monitor oil market response measures. Two of the biggest oil producers \u2013 Saudi and Russia \u2013 ramped up output last month in a shock move that sent oil prices crashing. There has since been hope of production cuts to stabilise prices but a clash between Saudi Arabia and Mexico has scotched those hopes, for now. Prices fell in trading on Friday and brent, the international crude benchmark, stands at $31. Here\u2019s a summary of the most recent news: The global death toll passes 100,000 people. According to researchers at John Hopkins University, at least 102,026 people have died as a result of the pandemic. The institution says at least 1,681,964 people have been infected, while 374,509 have recovered. Nearly 1,000 more people are confirmed dead in France. The French death toll passes 13,000, the health ministry director J\u00e9r\u00f4me Salomon said. A further 554 deaths were confirmed in French hospitals and 433 in care and retirement homes. Italy extends lockdown. Restrictions will remain in place in Italy for another three weeks, the country\u2019s prime minister has said, although a few types of shop will be allowed to reopen from next Tuesday. Giuseppe Conte said: \u201cThis is a difficult but necessary decision for which I take all political responsibility.\u201d Trump promises to listen to expert advice on reopening the economy. The US president says he is creating a second task force that will include a council tasked with deciding when to ease restrictions. But Donald Trump, who has repeatedly pushed the idea, insists he is not determined to reopen the economy if he is advised that to do so would endanger public health. Turkey puts in place a two-day lockdown in 31 provinces. The measures cover Istanbul, Ankara and other major cities, its interior ministry says, adding that the curbs will begin at midnight and end at the same time on Sunday. The country\u2019s known death toll stands at 1,006 people. Liverpool legend, Kenny Dalglish, tests positive. The 69-year-old was in hospital for treatment on a separate infection. The UK is urged to investigate if and why black, Asian and minority ethnic people are more vulnerable. The head of the British Medical Association made the call after it emerged that the first 10 doctors in the UK named as having died from the virus were all BAME. You can read a summary of the day\u2019s earlier vents here. The US has approved 661,000 loans to small businesses totalling $168bn (\u00a3134bn) under a programme to address the pandemic\u2019s fallout, the White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow says. A $2.3tn economic stimulus enacted last month allocated $349bn to loans to small businesses hurt by the crisis that can be turned into grants if they meet certain conditions. Albert Chambers, a 99-year-old second world war veteran, has been discharged from hospital after recovering from Covid-19. Chambers, who will be 100 in July, was wounded in the war and spent three years in a prison camp. He praised the treatment he had received from the NHS, saying: \u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been better.\u201d In Washington, Trump has said that deciding whether to ease recommendations on social distancing might be one of the biggest decisions, if not the biggest one, he\u2019ll have to make. Pressed on whether the United States has enough medical equipment and whether Trump offers too rosy a picture at his briefings, the president said he believes the country has enough equipment and that he did not enjoy speaking at these press conferences. The comments from the president came in response to a question from CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta. These are the saddest conferences I\u2019ve ever had. I don\u2019t like doing them. Why? Because I\u2019m talking about death ... there\u2019s no happy talk Jim. This is the real deal. And I\u2019ve got to make the biggest decision of my life and I\u2019ve only started thinking about that. This is by far the biggest decision of my life. Trump went on to say the country has enough equipment. \u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018no no no\u2019 it\u2019s yes yes yes,\u2019\u201d Trump said. Yemen has confirmed its first case, its internationally recognised government has announced. The case is a 73-year-old Yemeni national who works at the port of al-Shahr in Hadramawt province, Yemen\u2019s minister of health Nasser Baoum has told the Associated Press. The man is in stable condition, the minister added, without providing further details. The news is stoking fears that an outbreak could devastate the war-torn country\u2019s already crippled health care system. Yemen is a uniquely dangerous place for the virus to spread. Repeated bombings and ground fighting over five years of war have destroyed or closed more than half its health facilities. Deep poverty, dire water shortages and a lack of adequate sanitation have made the country a breeding ground for disease. Health officials have dreaded the virus eventual appearance in the country. Altaf Musani, a representative of the World Health Organization in Yemen, said: We have been saying since the declaration of the pandemic that the introduction of such a case in Yemen would be catastrophic. The Saudi-led coalition fighting the Iran-backed Houthi rebels declared a ceasefire on Thursday on humanitarian grounds \u2013 partly, they claimed, to prevent the spread of the pandemic. However, fighting continued unabated on Friday, diminishing hopes of a truce that could open doors for peace talks. Brazil\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro \u2013 already under fire for his cavalier reaction to the pandemic \u2013 has sparked further outrage by ignoring social distancing rules twice in the last 48 hours and being caught on camera shaking the hand of an elderly woman just seconds after wiping his nose with his wrist. The nose-wipe handshake was caught on camera by one of Brazil\u2019s major TV networks, Globo, and quickly went viral on social media. Bolsonaro\u2019s political foes and critics responded immediately. Humberto Costa, a leftwing senator, accused Brazil\u2019s president of being \u201can ally of the virus\u201d and \u201crepeatedly committing crimes against public health\u201d. Another critic, the journalist William De Lucca, tweeted: \u201cI think perhaps this is the best video showing how NOT to act during a pandemic\u201d. Bolsonaro has repeatedly attacked what he calls the media \u201chysteria\u201d over coronavirus and thumbed his nose at his own health ministry\u2019s social distancing guidelines on Thursday and Friday with high-profile trips to a bakery and a pharmacy. During both outings Bolsonaro was booed by detractors. On Friday, Brazil\u2019s coronavirus death toll rose to 1,057, up from 941 the previous day and nearly three times higher than last Friday\u2019s figure. Trump has said he plans to announce a second coronavirus task force, creating a council to focus on re-opening the country after the worst of the pandemic passes. The council is expected to include the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and White House senior economic adviser Larry Kudlow, among others, a senior administration official said earlier in the week. Trump said on Friday that state governors will also serve on the council. The UK\u2019s health minister, Matt Hancock, has promised to ramp up tests and personal protective equipment for NHS staff: Asked whether he would open up the US again next month if his advisers presented him with evidence that there would be a dramatic spike of coronavirus cases, Trump has said he wants to get it open as soon as possible. But he isn\u2019t determined, the president said in response to a question from CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta. I do say this Jim: I want to get it open as soon as possible. I would love to open it. I\u2019m not determined. He said that he would unveil a new task force of council to advise him on dealing with coronavirus and when to reopen the country. He said he would discuss it more next week Trump said it would be bipartisan. The one thing I didn\u2019t ask: \u2018Are you a Republican or Democrat?\u2019 And I want their views on what they think. Turkey is imposing a two-day lockdown in 31 provinces, including Istanbul, Ankara and other major cities, its Interior Ministry says, adding that the curbs will begin at midnight (TRT) and end at the same time on Sunday. The country\u2019s known death toll stands at 1,006 people. The Liverpool legend, Kenny Dalglish, has tested positive while in hospital for treatment for a different infection, his family have announced. The 69-year-old was admitted to hospital on Wednesday for a course of intravenous antibiotics and, in line with current procedures, underwent a test for Covid-19 despite displaying no symptoms of the illness. The test was positive and Dalglish, who remains asymptomatic, will remain in hospital for further treatment. In Washington, the US president Donald Trump has been pressed on whether he would heed the warnings of health officials, including some who advise him, as to whether the country could reopen by early May. Trump has reportedly been hoping to see that. At first he digressed. I listen to them about everything. I have great respect for these people. All of them ... In fact I told Tony Fauci, why don\u2019t you move to New York, run against AOC, you will win easily. I kid you know that. Asked again, he didn\u2019t budge. I can only say this: I have tremendous respect for these doctors and we\u2019ve done very well. I have great respect for these people. I\u2019m never saying bad about these people. And then pressed a third time Trump said: I will certainly listen. I will certainly listen. There are two sides. Remember, I understand both sides of an argument very well. It is enormously frustrating to see people ignoring physical distancing rules, England\u2019s chief nursing officer has said. Ruth May told a Downing Street briefing the best way to thank healthcare workers during the pandemic is to stay at home - especially during the Easter weekend. I was only on the way here, going over Westminster Bridge, seeing a whole hoard of cyclists coming together. It is enormously frustrating. The reason that is frustrating is because there\u2019s also still occasions where my colleagues are getting abuse from their neighbours for driving off to work ... You may have seen some TV coverage this week about what\u2019s happening in our hospitals. Dedicated, skilled, professional NHS staff calmly dealing with the mounting numbers of patients with coronavirus. They are frank about the toll it takes, both physical and emotional. And of course nurses, healthcare assistants, midwives, and other NHS staff are now among the victims of this coronavirus. Some have lost their lives. The NHS is a family and we feel their loss deeply. France\u2019s death toll has increased by nearly 1,000 to 13,197, the health ministry director J\u00e9r\u00f4me Salomon has said. The UK government must urgently investigate if and why black, Asian and minority ethnic people are more vulnerable to Covid-19, the head of the British Medical Association has said after it emerged that the first 10 doctors in the UK named as having died from the virus were all BAME. Those doctors have ancestry in regions including Asia, the Middle East and Africa. Even allowing for the overrepresentation of BAME staff in the NHS \u2013 they comprise 44% of medical staff compared with 14% of the population of England and Wales \u2013 the fact that they were all from ethnic minorities was \u201cextremely disturbing and worrying\u201d, Dr Chaand Nagpaul said. At face value, it seems hard to see how this can be random \u2013 to have the first 10 doctors of all being of BAME background. Not only that, we also know that in terms of the BAME population, they make up about a third of those in intensive care. There\u2019s a disproportionate percentage of BAME people getting ill. We have heard the virus does not discriminate between individuals but there\u2019s no doubt there appears to be a manifest disproportionate severity of infection in BAME people and doctors. This has to be addressed \u2013 the government must act now. Restrictions will remain in place in Italy for another three weeks, the country\u2019s prime minister has said, although a few types of shop will be allowed to reopen from next Tuesday. Giuseppe Conte has said: This is a difficult but necessary decision for which I take all political responsibility. The curbs on movement and the shutdown imposed on most shops and businesses across Italy were imposed on 9 March and were scheduled to expire on Monday. Among a few exceptions to the lockdown, which will now run until 3 May, Conte said bookshops, stationers and shops selling children\u2019s clothes could reopen from 14 April. He also said the economic package put together by eurozone finance ministers on Thursday is \u201cstill insufficient\u201d, adding Italy will continue to battle for the issuance of common debt through euro bonds. Apple and Google have announced an unprecedented collaboration to open up their mobile operating systems to allow for the creation of advanced contact-tracing apps, the two companies have announced. In theory, such apps could help allow nations to lift their lockdowns earlier, by letting authorities much more readily identify new clusters of infection and help those who have been exposed to a person with Covid-19 self-isolate before they themselves become infectious. They would work by using the bluetooth technology in mobile phones to keep track of every other phone a person comes into close contact with over the course of a day; if that person later finds they have Covid-19, they can use the same system to alert all those people, dating back to before they would have become infectious. Similar apps have already been trialled in nations including Singapore, but they have been held back by a combination of reduced uptake \u2013 the Singaporean app is used by 12 percept of the city, limiting its effectiveness \u2013 and difficulties in working around privacy protections built into the iOS and Android operating systems. It is those limits that Apple and Google will be lifting, the companies announced today. Canadian life could soon return to a semblance of normality if people bear down now to stop the virus\u2019s spread, Justin Trudeau, the country\u2019s prime minister, has said. But he said the risk of resurgence remained until a vaccine was developed. If we do things right, this will be the first and worst phase that we go through as a country in terms of Covid-19. Once the first phase of contagion passes, \u201cwe will be able to talk about loosening up some of the rules that are in place\u201d to get some people back to work and \u201cget things rolling again\u201d, he said. Chile has received early plaudits for its handling of the coronavirus crisis and boasts Latin America\u2019s highest testing rate for the infection. But health workers on the frontline of the outbreak fear authorities are overestimating hospitals\u2019 capacity to care for critically ill patients, writes Charis McGowan in Santiago. The country\u2019s health minister, Jaime Ma\u00f1alich, has praised Chile\u2019s health system as \u201cone of the best on the planet\u201d and insisted that enough beds had been available for critical patients. So far, Chile\u2019s Covid-19 mortality rate is 0.95% \u2013 well below the global average of 4.7% \u2013 but medics say this figure is giving authorities a false sense of security. \u201cIt\u2019s far too soon to say whether Chile is tackling this successfully,\u201d said Dr Claudia Cort\u00e9s, an infectious disease specialist in the capital, Santiago. Despite increases in the numbers of coronavirus cases in Chile\u2019s capital, the majority of the city is not under quarantine. Several districts have been on lockdown for the past two weeks, but these measures will be lifted next week in six affected neighbourhoods. Early Covid-19 cases were concentrated in Santiago\u2019s rich neighbourhoods, imported by wealthy families returning from their summer holidays in Europe. Most of those cases were treated in private hospitals. But Cort\u00e9s works between private and public hospitals attending to coronavirus patients \u2013 and she fears death rates will rocket as the virus spreads to poorer areas. The number of deaths around the world from the Covid-19 pandemic has now passed 100,000, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, 101 days after Chinese health authorities first alerted the World Health Organisation of a new coronavirus in Wuhan. The worst affected country remains Italy, with 18,849 deaths so far, according to the tally kept by the Maryland, US-based university. The US is now the second worst-affected country, with 17,925 deaths. Spain is third, with 15,970 deaths. Poland\u2019s ruling nationalists have come under fire after failing to observe health advice issued by their own government to curb the spread of coronavirus at a memorial service for the country\u2019s former president. Those who turned on the television to watch a scaled back memorial service to commemorate the 10th anniversary of a plane crash in Russia that killed president Lech Kaczynski, as well as top politicians and military officers, were shocked to see the country\u2019s leading politicians standing side by side. Critics accused Law and Justice Party (PiS) officials of flouting coronavirus restrictions that limit public gatherings and have left many cemeteries in the country closed to the public. \u201cThis is not all right. With all certainty there was a way to mark today\u2019s anniversary by following the rules that all Poles must follow, and that Poles pay fines for breaking,\u201d said Jan Grabiec, spokesman for centrist opposition party Civic Platform (PO). During the service, senior officials laid wreaths at a monument in the capital Warsaw to honour Kaczynski who died in the crash. They walked in single file, guarded by police wearing surgical masks to protect them from the coronavirus pandemic. The president, Andrzej Duda, an ally of PiS which was founded by Kaczynski and twin brother Jaroslaw, who was present at the service, expressed regret that the coronavirus outbreak in Poland made it impossible to mark the tragedy properly. The death toll from coronavirus in Italy rose by 570 to 18,849 on Friday, Lorenzo Tondo reports. Currently, 98,273 are infected with an increase of 1,4% compared with Thursday (+1,396). In th past 24 hours, 1,985 have recovered, bringing the total number of recoveries to 30,455. The Civil Protection said the overall total of cases in Italy, including the deceased, the currently infected and those who have recovered, is now 147,577, up 4,204 on Friday. The president of the Higher Health Institute, Silvio Brusaferro, told a press conference that \u201cthe curve clearly shows us a situation of decrease and that is a positive sign, but it must not make us let our guard down\u201d. Italy is set to extend the lockdown measures to stop the spread of coronavirus until 3 May. Giuseppe Conte, the prime minister, is expected to announce the new extension this afternoon. The UK health secretary has announced that 8,958 people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospital, an increase of 980 since yesterday. It means that the daily death toll in the UK has now exceeded that of Italy at the peak of its outbreak. On 27 March Italy recorded 969 deaths from Covid-19. In the UK\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said that yesterday, 19,116 tests were carried out across the UK, from which 5,706 people tested positive. The number of people currently in hospital with symptoms is 19,304. For more updates see our UK-focused live blog. South Africa\u2019s health minister this afternoon announced an expansion of an ambitious strategy of screening and tracing to fight Covid-19 which he said had already resulted in the country parting ways with those suffering \u201crapid spread\u201d, Jason Burke, the Guardian\u2019s Africa correspondent, reports from Johannesburg. \u201cFor South Africans let\u2019s be ambitious and say together we want to part ways with the trends of the west and Europe. I\u2019m not saying we are there, but \u2026 It is possible that we may be able to buck the trend and chart our own path,\u201d Zweli Mkhize told reporters, pointing to the example of South Korea as an inspiration. South Africa, the most-developed economy in sub-Saharan Africa, now has a total of just over 2,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 24 deaths. The president, Cyril Ramaphosa, announced on Thursday that a strict lockdown that began two weeks ago would continue until the end of April. Officials credit the measures with a drastic reduction of the spread of the disease but acknowledge the social and economic burden to many people is very heavy. The country faces major challenges with up to a third of its 56m population living in over-crowded townships often with poor sanitation, as well as significant numbers of HIV and tuberculosis sufferers who are vulnerable to Covid-19. However it has a relatively youthful population and one of the best health systems in Africa. A key resource is an extensive network of community health workers who, reinforced by government staff and volunteers, have been deployed to spread advice on how to fight the disease, trace contacts of potential cases of the disease and help screen entire communities. Thousands of traditional healers have also been asked to help detect cases of infection. Mkhize said tests would\u201dscale up\u201d in the coming weeks but that South Africans should get used to \u201ca new culture of social distancing and no hugs, kissing or shaking of hands\u201d. \u201cInternal transmission is slowed due to the lockdown ... However when we open those pockets that\u2019s when the problem will come, so we will anticipate a few more peaks,\u201d he said. Widespread testing has even been a challenge in North America and Europe, where some countries with large outbreaks resorted to only testing patients who are hospitalised. Ukraine has announced it is to start treating its coronavirus patients with hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug that has not been shown to be safe or effective against Covid-19 but which has been touted as effective by figures such as the US president Donald Trump. In a statement published on the Ukrainian government\u2019s website, the country\u2019s health ministry said it was expecting to receive 320,000 hydroxychloroquine tablets - enough to treat 22,000 patients - as humanitarian aid. Maxym Stepanov, the health minister, was quoted as saying: The Ministry of Health is doing its best to combat coronavirus as effectively as possible. Therefore, we have asked manufacturers to provide us with humanitarian assistance. This amount will be enough to treat over 22,000 patients with Covid-19. The ministry\u2019s statement is in a slightly odd syntax and hard to decipher. It seems to say both that the drug has already been distributed and that delivery is expected at the beginning of next week. Stepanov is quoted as saying that it will be provided \u201cfree for those patients who really need it for medical reasons.\u201d In view perhaps of the controversy surrounding the use of hydroxychloroquine for treating Covid-19, the statement adds: It should be noted that drugs with the active substance Hydroxychloroquine are used to treat patients with Covid-19 in the United States, Japan, Germany and other Western countries having advanced healthcare sector. Ukraine has so far recorded 2,203 confirmed cases of coronavirus, and 69 deaths. A case of Ebola has been detected in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, more than six weeks after the last case, the government said in a statement. The central African country planned on Sunday to declare an end to the second biggest outbreak of the disease in history, which had killed more than 2,200. The DRC currently has 215 cases of coronavirus, according to Johns Hopkins University\u2019s tally. Ireland has extended coronavirus restrictions by three weeks and postponed and cancelled secondary school exams. The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, told a media briefing in Dublin that a two-week lockdown that was due to expire on Sunday would be extended to Tuesday 5 May. He said: Many of us would like to know when things will go back to normal ... the truth is nobody knows for certain when that will be. All we can do for now is take one day at a time. Varadkar lauded the public for heeding the call to stay at home and said the sacrifice was saving lives. Quoting Ireland\u2019s Nobel poet laureate, Seamus Heaney, the taoiseach said: \u201cIf we winter this one out, we can summer anywhere.\u201d Officials announced that junior certificate exams would be cancelled and Leaving Certificate exams postponed until late July or early August. Simon Harris, the health minister, said until recently someone with Covid-19 infected about four other people and that number had fallen to around one, and needed to fall further. Kuwait has reported 83 new confirmed cases of coronavirus in the last 24 hours, taking the total number of infections to 993, with 26 patients in intensive care, Akhtar Mohammad Makoii reports. A health ministry spokesman said two of new confirmed cases are related to travel to the UK, 77 contracted the virus after direct contact with previously positive cases, and three others were under investigation. Kuwait has imposed several strict measures to contain spread of coronavirus, including cancelling all international flights and suspending schools and universities until August. Residents remain under 11-hour a day curfew. A baby born in a Mexican city stricken with an especially nasty Covid-19 outbreak has been named for the respiratory disease \u2013 and the country\u2019s coronavirus czar, David Agren in Mexico City reports. Gatell Covid Ch\u00e1vez Liz\u00e1rraga was born in the city of Monclova, a steel town of 400,000 people in northern Coahuila state, where a Covid-19 outbreak has infected more than 30 healthcare workers. The baby\u2019s parents haven\u2019t publicly stated why they christened their child \u201cGatell Covid\u201d, though the country has history of people picking odd baby names such as \u201cRobocop\u201d, \u201cTerminator\u201d and \u201cAnivdelarev\u201d (Anniversary of the revolution) \u2013 to the point that curious choices have been outlawed in some states. The name \u201cGatell\u201d refers to Hugo L\u00f3pez-Gatell, the country\u2019s 51-year-old health undersecretary, who has become the public face of Mexico\u2019s Covid-19 response and whose nightly briefings attract millions of viewers. Gatell\u2019s celebrity has surged in since he was appointed coronavirus czar by the president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador \u2013 to the point that polls show him as being more trusted on handling the pandemic the president. Mexico has recorded 3,441 Covid-19 cases and 194 deaths as of 9 April. The undersecretary has drawn comparisons to Dr Anthony Fauci as a public health official being thrust suddenly into the public eye and having to deftly deal with a difficult president, who has shown reticence in recognising the scope of the coronavirus pandemic In what could be a further blow to hopes of an end to the Covid-19 pandemic, officials in South Korea on Friday reported 91 patients thought cleared of the coronavirus had tested positive again, Reuters reports. The prospect of people being re-infected with the virus is of international concern, as many countries are hoping that infected populations will develop sufficient immunity to prevent a resurgence of the pandemic. Jeong Eun-kyeong, director of the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), told a briefing that the virus may have been \u201creactivated\u201d rather than the patients being re-infected. False test results could also be at fault, other experts said, or remnants of the virus could still be in patients\u2019 systems but not be infectious or of danger to the host or others. \u201cThere are different interpretations and many variables,\u201d said Jung Ki-suck, professor of pulmonary medicine at Hallym University Sacred Heart hospital. Nearly 7,000 South Koreans have been reported as recovered from Covid-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. \u201cThe number will only increase, 91 is just the beginning now,\u201d said Kim Woo-joo, professor of infectious diseases at Korea University Guro hospital. He said it was likely that the patients had \u201crelapsed\u201d rather than been infected a second time. France\u2019s defence ministry has confirmed that 50 members of crew aboard the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle have tested positive for the coronavirus, Kim Willsher, the Guardian\u2019s Paris correspondent, reports. Three of the sailors have been evacuated from the nuclear powered vessel by helicopter as a \u201cpreventative measure\u201d. \u201cNo worsening of the health of the sailors on board has been reported,\u201d the ministry said. A specialist medical team was flown to the Charles de Gaulle, the pride of France\u2019s naval fleet, on Wednesday after several \u201csuspected\u201d cases of coronavirus were reported. Out of 66 tests carried out, 50 were positive, the ministry said in a statement. The origin of the infection is not known; the vessel left its base at Toulon in the south of France on 21 January and has reportedly not been in contact with the outside world since 15 March. The Charles de Gaulle, which was in the Atlantic, is currently heading back to France. A gruelling ordeal for 112 Australian and New Zealand passengers on board a coronavirus-stricken Antarctic cruise ship anchored for the last 14 days off the coast of South America is nearing its end, writes Uki Go\u00f1i. The fortunate passengers will be disembarking the Greg Mortimer cruise ship in Uruguay at 6.30pm Friday to fly home on a specially-chartered medical flight. Twenty other less fortunate European, US and UK passengers will have to remain on board pending negotiations for their own return. A \u201chumanitarian corridor\u201d has been set up to shuttle the passengers from the port of Montevideo to Carrasco international airport \u201cwith all the sanitary guarantees necessary for them and for society in general,\u201d Uruguayan authorities said in a statement on Friday morning. The fate of the remaining 20 passengers, and the ship\u2019s crew of 85, mostly Swiss and Swedes, is still unclear. \u201cThe government has not yet told Aurora [the cruise company operator] whether the ship will be allowed to remain at port or will be required to go back out to anchor,\u201d Brian Meier from Chicago, one of the six Americans on board, who has been in quarantine in his cabin since 23 March, told the Guardian via WhatsApp Friday morning. The Greg Mortimer cruise ship anchored 20 kilometres off the coast of Uruguay on 27 March with at least 128 passengers and crew testing positive for coronavirus so far. The ship had left from the Argentinian southern port of Ushuaia on 15 March, for an Antarctic cruise that had to be interrupted when passengers started developing symptoms. A specially-equipped Airbus 343 with medical personnel on board, chartered from the Portuguese Hi Fly air company, will be departing for Melbourne at 1.40am on Saturday. \u201cThe plane will be set up into risk zones, with passengers seated by test results,\u201d Aurora Expeditions informed the passengers. Migration formalities have already been processed digitally to avoid any physical contact with the passengers, Uruguayan authorities said. A convoy of buses will transport them from the port to the airport, from which they will descend on the tarmac to board the plane directly. Only hand luggage is being allowed \u201cwithout manipulation of luggage to avoid contact.\u201d The fate of the remaining 20 passengers will probably depend on the results a new round of coronavirus testing by Uruguayan doctors. \u201cThe non-AU/NZ passengers were tested Wednesday evening but we haven\u2019t gotten any results back yet,\u201d Meier said. For what seems like months the coronavirus outbreak has dominated headlines around the world, but other crises are still continuing amid the pandemic. The UN\u2019s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has compiled a list of of 10 of them. While we are all affected by Covid-19, it\u2019s important to take time to remember how other people are trying to stay healthy in the midst of famine, war and economic crises. The present crisis is only compounding their struggles. A sixth person infected with the coronavirus has died in Taiwan, health minister Chen Shih-chung said on Friday. The island also recorded two new infections, bringing the total to 382 cases, he told a news conference. Movement and travel restrictions in Malaysia have been extended until at least the 28 April, even as the country reports a slowdown in new Covid-19 infections. Malaysians have been under the partial lockdown since 18 March, with only essential services open. The order had been originally due to expire on 14 April but in a televised address on Friday prime minister Muhyiddin Yassin announced the two week extension. Channel News Asia quoted him as saying: This is in line with WHO\u2019s (World Health Organization) views requesting countries not to end movement control prematurely. As has happened in a few countries, the pandemic spreads again when the movement control ends. We must be prepared for this situation for a few months. It might continue until we are truly sure we have overcome the spread of this pandemic 100%. Malaysia has the highest number of coronavirus infections in south-east Asia, reporting 4,346 cases with 70 deaths as of noon on Friday. Reuters reported Muhyiddin as saying that Malaysia had done well to keep the infection rate at 7% of patients screened, which is below the 10% benchmark set by the World Health Organization (WHO), while its 1.6% death rate is well below the 5.8% global average. Separately, the health ministry said Malaysia had likely experienced its peak in cases. The country saw its highest daily jump on March 26 when 235 new infections were reported. Health authorities in Japan appear to have published updated figures for coronavirus infections in the country. According to a report by NHK, Japan\u2019s public broadcaster, a total of 589 new cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the past 24 hours, increasing the total number of cases in the country to 6,134. Singapore has reported 198 new confirmed cases of coronavirus, including 79 linked to clusters at dormitories for foreign workers that have recently been identified as transmission hotspots. Health authorities also reported that 32 more patients had recovered from the disease and been discharged from hospital or quarantine in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of recoveries in the city state to 492. Belgium has officially recorded 325 deaths in the last 24 hours, Daniel Boffey, the Guardian\u2019s Brussels bureau chief, reports. A further 171 deaths in care homes in Flanders in late March have also been belatedly added to the death toll. The total national number of deaths is 3,019, the Belgian federal crisis centre said on Friday. The figures suggest that Belgium is disproportionately suffering during the crisis and that there is no sign of the number of deaths yet peaking. In one positive development, the number of people in intensive care has dropped slightly to 1,278 compared to the previous day of 1,285. Zambia has reported a second death from coronavirus. As in a number of African countries, its health authorities have conveniently reported the latest statistics of the coronavirus outbreak in the country as a Twitter thread. Governments in the Arab world have been told to ensure the safety and security of women and girls as they implement lockdowns and curfews to curb the spread of coronavirus. In a joint letter to governments in the Middle East, the regional directors of the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and UN Women, and the executive director of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, say: The Arab States are host to large numbers of refugees and internally displaced persons as well as vulnerable women migrant workers. Women and girls in these settings face multiple burdens and risks in accessing services. More efforts are needed to ensure their safety and well-being. We ... urge governments in the region to ensure that their message on zero tolerance to domestic violence is highlighted in their public announcements and policies, including a commitment to increase investment in services and organisations that provide services to survivors of domestic violence. The statement comes as reports come in from around the world of increases in the rates of domestic violence in countries subject to lockdowns. Outlining a number of measures for countries to take to guarantee the safety of women, and ensure their participation in decision making about how to tackle the pandemic, the UN officials add: The Covid-19 pandemic is not only a health crisis; it is also a crisis of care. Globally women represent more than 70 per cent of all health care workers and in the home, women are predominantly the carers of the elderly, people with disabilities and children. With more people quarantined at home, the burden of unpaid care for women will most likely increase. Therefore, we call on all governments in the region to assess and respond to the needs of all care workers, and to ensure that essential services for survivors of domestic violence are maintained and accessible to all women and girls. Ensuring gender justice and equality before the law remains a vital path to implementing the SDGs and protecting all people, everywhere.

Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, the president of Portugal, said on Friday he would propose next week extending a national lockdown until 1 May as the number of coronavirus cases in the country rose above 15,000. Portugal declared a 15-day state of emergency on 18 March and last week approved its extension by a further 15 days until 17 April. He said: \u201cWe have to be very focused on a fight that we haven\u2019t fully won yet. We cannot let our guard down.\u201d Rebelo de Sousa was in quarantine for two weeks last month despite testing negative for coronavirus. Portugal has so far reported 15,472 confirmed cases and 435 fatalities, far below neighbouring Spain\u2019s death toll of 15,843, the second highest in the world after Italy. Speaking at a morning show on TVI television on Friday, Antonio Costa, the prime minister, said: It would be a wrong signal for the country to lift the state of emergency. Both Costa and Rebelo de Sousa said it was critical that the Portuguese stay home during the Easter weekend, a period of time which usually incredibly busy, to avoid spreading the virus. The government has tightened restrictions further over the Easter holiday period, closing all airports to commercial flights and banning domestic travel from 9-13 April, Reuters reports. New York state is getting help from Google to overhaul a decades-old unemployment benefits system that has left laid-off workers frustrated and awaiting help, Associated Press reports. Google helped New York design a revamped website that launched on Thursday evening. The state also added 300 workers to its 700-person staff to process unemployment benefit applications. Governor Andrew Cuomo said the state Department of Labors system had crashed because of a record-breaking surge in claims amid outbreak-related layoffs. There have been 350,000 claims in the last week. So far600,000 claims over the past three weeks have been successfully processed and over 200,000 are still in partial status, according to Cuomo. The state is also trying to reduce call volume by having state workers call up individuals to follow-up with incomplete applications. Previously, applicants who left fields blank were told to call the state\u2019s unemployment system. The Spanish government has announced plans to hand out facemasks to people at metro and train stations from Monday as some non-essential workers begin returning to their jobs at the end of the country\u2019s two-week freeze on all non-vital economic activity. Factory and construction workers are set to start back next week despite warnings that the relaxation of the strict confinement policy could drive a rise in contagion. However, most shops and offices will remain closed and people are being told to carry on working from home. Spain\u2019s health minister, Salvador Illa, stressed that the nationwide lockdown that came into force on 14 March remained in place, but said the tighter restrictions introduced at the end of last month to reduce pressure on the country\u2019s overstretched hospitals were being eased. Illa pointed out that the current lockdown had been extended until 26 April, but added: Businesses that have been authorised to restart their activities may do so. It means that Spaniards can go to work and also rely on basic goods. The minister also reminded people that the country remained \u201cin a phase of very tough measures\u201d. Between Thursday and Friday, 605 people in Spain died from the virus \u2013 down from 683 during the previous 24 hours. The growth rate of new cases is currently 3%, compared with a daily average of 12% at the end of March and 20% in mid-March. Spain has now recorded 157,022 cases of Covid-19 and 15,843 deaths. German foreign minister Heiko Maas has criticised the United States\u2019 handling of the coronavirus outbreak as too slow, the latest sign of tensions between the two allies as they respond to the crisis, Reuters reports. China took \u201cvery authoritarian measures, while in the US, the virus was played down for a long time\u201d, Maas said in an interview with Der Spiegel magazine in a preview sent to the media on Friday. These are two extremes, neither of which can be a model for Europe. Germany was among countries that last week accused the United States of \u201cWild West\u201d tactics in outbidding or blocking shipments to buyers who had already signed deals for vital medical supplies. Maas told Der Spiegel that he hoped the United States would rethink its international relationships in light of the coronavirus crisis. He added that aggressive trade policies may have hurt the country\u2019s ability to procure protective equipment He said: Let\u2019s see to what extent the actions of the American government will lead to discussions in the US about whether the \u2018America First\u2019 model really works. Hello, this is Gregory Robinson, taking over the live blog for the next hour. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter to share insight or send tips, I\u2019m on @Gregoryjourno or send me an email at gregory.robinson@guardian.co.uk Japan has reported 473 new confirmed cases of coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 6,003 on Friday, according to a report on public broadcaster NHK. Earlier this week, Japan declared a state of emergency to fight the spread of the coronavirus in major population centres. It has so far recorded 112 deaths from the virus. On Friday, Kyoto became the latest prefecture to ask to be placed under the state of emergency, with the governor saying that infections were rising, and Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike said that the metropolitan government would request many businesses, including night clubs, karaoke parlours and pachinko pinball parlours to close from Saturday. The measure currently covers seven regions, including Tokyo, and gives authorities the power to ask people to stay indoors and request that businesses close. However there are no enforcement mechanisms and no penalties for those who fail to comply. The governor of Aichi prefecture had earlier called on the central government to include his region in the state of emergency. However, as coronavirus public information efforts go, my favourite is still the exercise video recorded and circulated online by the Ugandan president, Yoweri Museveni, yesterday. The official death toll from coronavirus in the US is likely to be an underestimate, according to a researcher at Johns Hopkins University, which collates tally that the Guardian relies on to gauge the extent of the pandemic. \u201cWe definitely think there are deaths that we have not accounted for,\u201d Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, told the New York Times. The paper reports that many coroners in rural areas do not have the testing kits they need to identify the disease, and now believe that some deaths in February and early March that were blamed on influenza may have in fact been due to Covid-19. Last week the US Centers for Disease Control issued new guidance instructing officials unable to test for Covid-19 to report deaths as caused by the disease \u201cif the circumstances are compelling within a reasonable degree of certainty.\u201d Three new cases of coronavirus were confirmed in Rwanda on Thursday, the country\u2019s ministry of health reports, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 113. Two of the newly identified cases were in travellers quarantined on arrival to the country, while the third was identified in a person who had been in contact with a previously identified patient. No one has yet died from Covid-19 in the country. In a statement the ministry said that all the new cases had been isolated and that contact tracing was underway. The majority of patients were asymptomatic, with none in a critical condition. Rwanda was one of the first countries in Africa to impose a lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus, including closing non-essential businesses, restricting travel between districts and cities, and ordering all people to stay indoors except for essential outings. In Mexico the Catholic church is launching an aerial assault on the coronavirus, Tom Phillips, the Guardian\u2019s Latin America correspondent, reports. Yesterday two senior Church figures - from the dioceses of Cuernavaca and Quer\u00e9taro - took to the skies to scatter blessings and ask for an end to the pandemic. \u201cWe want to provide hope at this moment of crisis, this difficult moment. People shouldn\u2019t feel unprotected by the hand of God, for God is present,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00edn Lara Becerril, Quer\u00e9taro\u2019s vicar general, told reporters before taking a helicopter flight over the state. According to the newspaper El Universal, the bishop of Cuernavaca, Ram\u00f3n Castro Castro, also went flying, using a small plane to take to the skies over Morelos state against Covid-19. Castro told reporters: We are using the most beautiful instrument we have - which is the blessing of God - at a difficult time, a moment when the outlook is so difficult, because of what is drawing near. But we know that the power of God is far greater. But Castro said divine intervention was no substitute for social distancing. \u201cStay at home,\u201d the bishop urged followers before boarding his flight. Many brothers and sisters still haven\u2019t grasped the severity of the moment. This is a very tricky situation. We are asking for God\u2019s help. But each of us should also contribute their little grain of sand .. because otherwise the situation could become even more complicated. Thirteen more people have tested positive for coronavirus in Malta, including a resident and two members of staff working at care homes, bringing the total number of cases in the Mediterranean archipelago to 350. Malta\u2019s superintendent of public health, Charmaine Gauci, said on Friday that the new cases were linked to the St Vincent de Paul and Zammit Clapp care homes, the Times of Malta reports. The resident who tested positive was an 88-year-old woman living in the St Francis Ward of the St Vincent de Paul home, who had developed a cough. The two carers, a 58-year-old man and a 51-year-old women, are volunteers working at the Zammit Clapp home. Two people, an 80-year-old and a 92-year-old have so far died from Covid-19 in the country. People aged over 65 or who have underlying health conditions have been warned not to go out in public unless necessary. Brazil\u2019s far-right president Jair Bolsonaro, a vociferous critic of social isolation who has dismissed coronavirus as \u201ca little flu\u201d, was booed and jeered by people in the capital Bras\u00edlia after he went to a bakery for a donut on Thursday night, writes Dom Phillips in Rio de Janeiro. \u201cGo home!\u201d people shouted from nearby apartment buildings, and \u201cBolsonaro out!\u201d Others could be heard banging pots and pans in videos widely shared on twitter, echoing the protests many make from home at 8.30pm every night. \u201cIN FULL PANDEMIC. Bolsonaro went back to circulating in Bras\u00edlia and created a tumult in a bakery,\u201d tweeted photojournalist Lula Marques, sharing the videos. \u201cIt was another irresponsible act by Bolsonaro putting the population\u2019s life at risk.\u201d The incident was covered on Brazil\u2019s biggest nightly news show, Jornal Nacional, and by Brazil\u2019s biggest magazine Veja. Cries of \u201cBolsonaro out\u201d were even audible in a video tweeted by the president\u2019s congressman son Eduardo Bolsonaro from the P\u00e3o Dourado \u2013 Golden Bakery \u2013 store, where the far-right populist ate a donut with his infrastructure minister, Tarc\u00edsio de Freitas, and joked with employees - who unlike the president were wearing masks - and put his arms around people for photos. He is one of just four world leaders denying the health threat of Covid-19, along with the despots of Belarus and Turkmenistan and Nicaragua\u2019s Daniel Ortega. It was the third time Bolsonaro has mingled with people in Bras\u00edlia, contravening World Health Organisation advice. He has told Brazilians to get back to work and nearly sacked his health minister for telling them to obey state governors who closed shops, schools and businesses. But Bolsonaro\u2019s rhetoric has influenced Brazilians among signs that clear signs that social distancing is disintegrating in big cities while coronavirus cases soar, with more people on the streets of Rio and S\u00e3o Paulo, Reuters reported on Thursday. Brazil had 17,857 confirmed case and 941 deaths as of Friday morning. EU and Afghan officials have discussed the solutions to mitigate economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic in Afghanistan, as the number of confirmed cases in the country reached 521 after a surge of infections in Kabul, Akhtar Mohammad Makoii reports from Herat. Thirty-seven new patients tested positive for Covid-19 in last 24 hours, 16 of them in the country\u2019s capital, Kabul, bringing the total in the city to 111. Kabul went under full lockdown on Wednesday, in a bid to contain spread of coronavirus in the city of around 6 million people. Eight new cases of Covid-19 were recorded in Herat, Afghanistan\u2019s worst affected area so far with 265 confirmed cases and four deaths. No suspected patients had tested for two days in Herat after the city ran out of testing kits. Two more infections were confirmed in Kandahar, one of Afghanistan\u2019s most populated provinces, bringing the total there to 32, amid rising concerns over thousands of migrants who returned from Pakistan in recent days. Meanwhile, members of the European Union business council in a video conference with Afghan Special Envoy discussed the solutions which can mitigate the risks of coronavirus for private sector of Afghanistan. The council also raised their concerns regarding access to food and medicines as well as raw materials for the manufacturing industry, and the importance of keeping all borders open, according to a statement. Afghanistan has so far reported 15 deaths from coronavirus and 32 recoveries. The president of Sierra Leone has announced a ban on travel between districts, as part of a bundle of coronavirus control measures falling short of a complete lockdown. In a statement published on Friday, Julius Bio also imposed a nationwide curfew between 9pm and 6am, cut the hours of civil servants, and advised people to wear masks in public. \u201cCitizens who have no strong reason to be in public places are advised to stay at home at all times,\u201d he added. The measures, due to start on Saturday and last 14 days, come after a three-day lockdown earlier this week, that local media report was marred by \u201cteething problems\u201d including police brutality. On Friday, health authorities in the country reported they had no new cases of coronavirus. Seven confirmed cases have been detected so far, and 255 people are in quarantine. Nigeria has reported 14 new confirmed cases of coronavirus, bringing the total number so far in Africa\u2019s most-populous country to 288. Thirteen of the newly detected infections were in Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s financial capital, and one was in Delta State, the location of the oil reserves that power the Nigerian economy. So far seven people have died and 51 have recovered. Lagos and Abuja, the Nigerian capital, are in their second week of a lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus, and many states have also imposed their own restrictions. Yemen announces first confirmed case of coronavirus Yemen announced the first confirmed case of coronavirus in the war-torn country, stoking fears that an outbreak could devastate an already crippled health care system. Spanish death toll continues to slow Spain recorded 605 deaths between Thursday and Friday, down from 683 during the previous 24 hours in a sign that the lockdown strategy is continuing to work and that the virus is being slowed in its tracks. The number of people who have died from the disease rose to 15,843 on Friday, up from 15,238 on Thursday. EU agrees \u20ac500bn rescue package EU finance ministers have agreed a \u20ac500bn (\u00a3430bn) rescue package for European countries hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic after Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, warned that the existence of the bloc was at stake. Russia reports new record daily rise of coronavirus cases Russia reported 1,786 more coronavirus cases on Friday, its largest daily rise so far, which took the national tally of confirmed infections to 11,917. The number of coronavirus-related deaths rose by 18 to 94, the Russian coronavirus crisis response centre said in a statement. Singapore suspends use of video-conferencing tool Zoom by teachers Singapore has suspended the use of video-conferencing tool Zoom by teachers after \u201cvery serious incidents\u201d occurred in the first week of the country\u2019s coronavirus lockdown. Philippines health ministry reports 18 new coronavirus deaths, 119 new cases The Department of Health (DOH) reported 119 new cases of Covid-19 in the Philippines, bringing the country total to 4,195. It also announced 16 new recoveries. New York makes mass graves New York City officials have hired contract labourers to bury the rising number of dead in its potter\u2019s field on Hart Island, an area which has for decades been used to bury those with no known next of kin, as New York broke its record for the largest single-day coronavirus death toll for the third consecutive day, Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Thursday. While vast numbers of countries have told citizens to stay home and practice social distancing, there is growing concern about the millions of prison inmates who remain stuck inside cramped and often squalid facilities, Rebecca Ratcliffe, the Guardian\u2019s south east Asia correspondent, reports. Footage taken inside a prison in Cambodia, released by Amnesty International, shows inmates lying side-by-side, in some cases with limbs stretched over another, because there is such little space. Last month, the UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, urged governments to reduce overcrowding, warning that the virus risks \u201crampaging through such institutions\u2019 extremely vulnerable populations\u201d. Some countries have taken action, including Iran, Indonesia and India. In Cambodia, some prisons are thought to be up to 463% over capacity. \u201cThese conditions were never acceptable. Today they are completely unconscionable,\u201d said David Griffiths, director in the office of the secretary-general at Amnesty International. The principle of \u201cherd immunity\u201d, at one stage touted by the UK government as a possible solution to the coronavirus outbreak, has taken an apparent blow after a study in Austria found less than 1% of the population is infected with coronavirus. The first such study in continental Europe, led by pollster SORA which is known for projecting election results, aimed to provide a clearer picture of the total number of infections, given gaps in testing, Reuters reports. \u201cBased on this study, we believe that 0.33% of the population in Austria was acutely infected in early April,\u201d SORA co-founder Christoph Hofinger told a news conference. Given the margin of error, the figure was 95% likely to be between 0.12% and 0.76%. Sebastian Kurz, Austria\u2019s chancellor, whose government commissioned the study and saw initial findings a few days ago, said on Monday that the rate of infection was around 1%. He said that disproved the idea of herd immunity - which requires widespread infection - as a viable policy option. In March the UK government had suggested herd immunity could provide the cornerstone to the nationwide response to the coronavirus outbreak, contrasting sharply with the detect, trace and quarantine approach taken by countries in Asia first affected and endorsed by the World Health Organization. Officials soon abandoned the plan after modelling by scientists at University College London suggested it could lead to as many as 250,000 deaths. Italy is set to extend its lockdown measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus until 3 May, Lorenzo Tondo reports from Palermo. The prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, is expected to announce the new extension in the afternoon. Meanwhile, on Thursday, the interior minister, Luciana Lamorgese, sent a directive to prefects to beef up coronavirus lockdown controls over Easter. Lamorgese said numbers of Italy\u2019s Covid-19 emergency are slowing down, but measures \u201cshould be fully operational in view of the upcoming Easter festivities, traditionally marked by an increase in traffic flows, in particular on motorways and on the main connecting extra-urban arteries of our country\u201d. Despite fears that the official figures may be seriously underestimating the number of deaths in Spain, the latest statistics from the country\u2019s health ministry suggest that the lockdown strategy is continuing to work and that the virus is being slowed in its tracks, writes Sam Jones in Madrid. Between Thursday and Friday, 605 people died from the virus - down from 683 during the previous 24 hours. The numbers were also well down on earlier this week, when the death toll rose about 740 for two consecutive days. The growth rate of new cases is currently 3%, compared with a daily average of 12% at the end of March and 20% in mid-March. Spain has now recorded 157,022 cases of Covid-19 and 15,843 deaths. However, questions persist over the numbers: recently released data from judicial authorities in Madrid suggest that 6,600 more people than usual died in the last two weeks of March, compared with the official tally of 3,500 Covid-19 deaths in the region. On Thursday, the Spanish congress approved another extension of the national lockdown that has been in force since a state of emergency was declared on 14 March. The confinement period will now last until 26 April, although the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has said another extension seems inevitable. \u201cI\u2019m sure that in two weeks\u2019 time I\u2019ll have to extend the state of emergency again,\u201d he told parliament. This is Damien Gayle taking over the coronavirus world news live blog for the next eight or so hours. I will be focusing on picking up what hasn\u2019t yet been reported from Asia, on the Middle East, Africa and Europe, and later on the east coast of the Americas as people there begin to wake up. If you have any tips or suggestions for coverage, or any comments, please send me an email to damien.gayle@theguardian.com, or a direct message to my Twitter profile, @damiengayle. That\u2019s it from me today, I\u2019m handing over the global coronavirus liveblog to my colleague Damien Gayle now, so please do contact him with any stories. A group of wealthy would-be holidaymakers who flew from Britain to France in a private jet for a few days on the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur have been turned back by police, writes my colleague Kim Willsher in Paris. Ten people arrived on the chartered aircraft from London to Marseille-Provence airport - three women and seven men. Helicopters were waiting to fly them on to Cannes on the French Riviera where they had rented a luxury villa. French police who met the flight were unimpressed. The men, aged 40-50, and women, aged 23-25, were refused permission to enter France and ordered to fly back to the UK. \u201cThey were coming for a holiday in Cannes and three helicopters were waiting on the tarmac,\u201d a border police spokesperson told AFP. \u201cWe notified them they were not allowed to enter the national territory and they left four hours later.\u201d A police source told BFMTV the pilot had been advised not to land the Embraer Legacy jet at Marseille-Provence, but did so anyway. On landing, the group made up of several nationalities - Croat, German, French, Romanian and Ukrainian - reportedly tried to pull a few strings to continue their journey. \u201cThey tried to make use of their connections and made a few phone calls,\u201d the source said. The helicopter pilots were told to return to their base and fined for breaking the strict lockdown rules. The jet, chartered by a Croatian businessman reportedly in \u201cfinance and property\u201d, arrived last Saturday, but details were only released on Thursday. French police said they would be carrying out strict checks on private aircraft arriving in France over the Easter period. All non-essential travel inside France has been banned since 17 March and a recent tightening of the lockdown restrictions mean anyone entering the country should hold an international travel certificate showing the journey is essential. The authorities in France and Britain have made it clear that travelling to a second home in either country does not qualify as \u201cessential\u201d. \u201cCrossing borders needs a legitimate or urgent reason,\u201d a police spokesperson said. BFMTV reported that nine of the jet passengers returned to the UK and the tenth chartered a private jet to Berlin. As New York deals with a mounting coronavirus death toll and dwindling morgue space, the city has shortened the length of time it will hold unclaimed remains before they are buried in its public cemetery on Hart Island. Aerial video captured workers digging graves on the island, a one-mile, limited-access strip near the Bronx. Normally, about 25 bodies a week are interred on the island, mostly for people whose families can\u2019t afford a funeral, or who go unclaimed by relatives. Operations have now increased from one day a week to five days a week, with around 24 burials each day. Warning: video contains sensitive material Palestinian health authorities have confirmed three new Coronavirus cases, amid fears that the virus is spreading in Gaza, reports Akhtar Mohammad Makoii. Three news cases have been recorded in the West Bank, pushing the total number of infections to 266 in Palestinian territories, including 13 in Gaza. All patients in Gaza are at currently in quarantine facilities. But officials have voiced concerns that a shortage of critical equipment and medical supplies could set off a rapid spread amongst the enclave\u2019s two million people. \u201cTesting at our central laboratory has stopped, after coronavirus test kits completely ran out,\u201d Gaza health ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qidra said Wednesday. The ministry is run by the enclave\u2019s Islamist rulers, Hamas. Spain recorded 605 deaths between Thursday and Friday, another fall on the previous 24 hours. The number of people who have died from the disease rose to 15,843 on Friday, up from 15,238 on Thursday. The total number of coronavirus cases rose to 157,022 on Friday from 152,446 on Thursday. The coronavirus crisis has produced some interesting ear worms, but this techno offering from Swiss TV Morning Show trio - which mixes techno track, the sound of a dripping tap and the voices of interior minister Alain Berset and president Simonetta Sommaruga telling people to stay home - is perhaps my favourite. Thanks to Guardian reader Andrea Freiermuth for sending this! A Chinese writer who published a diary during her time under lockdown in Wuhan has been subjected to widespread online criticism for publishing her book in English and German, writes my colleague Helen Davidson. Fang Fang has been accused of contributing to a negative international narrative on China\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. The popular Wuhan writer began chronicling the lockdown in late January, including criticism of the official response. \u201cHow many people have died in Wuhan and their families destroyed?\u201d she wrote on 31 January. \u201cBut so far not a single person has said sorry or taken responsibility. I\u2019ve even seen a writer use the phrase \u2018complete victory\u2019. What are they talking about?\u201d Her posts were shared widely on social media even as each was quickly deleted by censors, according to the Diplomat magazine. Yemen\u2019s internationally recognised government Friday announced the first confirmed case of coronavirus in the war-torn country, stoking fears that an outbreak could devastate an already crippled health care system, the Associated Press reports. The national emergency committee for the COVID-19 disease in Yemen\u2019s southeastern province of Hadramawt said in a tweet the patient is being treated and in stable condition, without further details. Nasser Baoum, the minister of health for Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government, told the AP the case is a 73-year-old Yemeni national who works at the al-Shahr port in Hadramawt. It comes after Saudi Arabia started a two-week unilateral ceasefire in the country, in a move designed to show its awareness of the threat the coronavirus poses to a war-torn country with only rudimentary health services. A group of North African migrants rescued from a sinking boat came ashore in Malta early on Friday, hours after the government had said no further groups would be allowed in after it closed its ports due to the coronavirus emergency, Reuters reports. The 64 migrants were rescued by the Maltese armed forces from a boat inside the Malta rescue zone south of the island and brought ashore. On Thursday Malta had followed Italy, the country that has so far seen the most deaths from the epidemic, in announcing it would no longer allow migrant boats to land due to the risk of coronavirus infection. The Maltese government said in a statement the armed forces had been monitoring the migrants for some hours before a patrol boat picked them up. However, it said Malta could not guarantee further rescues and would not allow any further disembarkation of rescued persons because resources have been strained by the COVID-19 pandemic. The new arrivals were received by soldiers wearing bio-suits shortly after midnight. They will be kept in detention. The government said: It is in the interest, and is the responsibility, of such people not to endanger themselves on a risky voyage to a country which is not in a position to offer them a secure harbour. Malta has imposed a 14-day quarantine on all travellers entering the country, closed schools and told people to stay at home during the emergency. It announced this week its first death from COVID-19, the disease associated with the coronavirus, and had 319 active cases as of Thursday, according to government figures. After a relative lull in arrivals of boat migrants from Africa, numbers had started to pick up again in the first two months of the year only to fall back sharply in March as Italy was hit by the coronavirus epidemic. Before the crisis, ships operated by aid groups regularly patrolled the coast of Libya looking to rescue migrants from flimsy boats. Most have withdrawn but one ship operated by German charity Sea-Eye returned to the area last week and picked up 150 migrants on Monday. With both Italy and Malta, the two nearest European countries, closed, it is unclear where they will be taken. The New York Times reported on Friday that the Maltese Navy had been accused of sabotaging a migrant boat off the coast of Malta after letting it drift for over a day. Indonesia has reported 219 new coronavirus cases, putting the country\u2019s total to 3,512 according to its health ministry. Oman\u2019s capital, Muscat, went under full lockdown this morning as number of confirmed coronavirus cases reach 484 in the sultanate with 27 recorded in last 24 hours, writes Akhtar Mohammad Makoii. The government announced that the isolation procedure will be implemented until April 22. The plan started 10 am this morning by \u201cactivating control and checkpoints\u201d. Oman reported its third death to Covid-19 yesterday. Singapore has suspended the use of video-conferencing tool Zoom by teachers, its education ministry said on Friday, after \u201cvery serious incidents\u201d occurred in the first week of a coronavirus lockdown that has seen schools move to home-based learning, Reuters reports. One of the incidents involved obscene images appearing on screens and strange men making lewd comments during the streaming of a geography lesson with teenage girls, according to local media reports. Zoom Video Communications Inc ZM.O has been plagued with safety and privacy concerns about its conferencing app which has seen a surge in usage as offices and schools around the world shut to try curb coronavirus infections. The Singapore government has also been using the tool to host media conferences. Aaron Loh of the ministry\u2019s educational technology division, without detailing the incidents, he said: These are very serious incidents. MOE (Ministry of Education) is currently investigating both breaches and will lodge a police report if warranted. As a precautionary measure, our teachers will suspend their use of Zoom until these security issues are ironed out. Loh said that they would further advise teachers on security protocols such as requiring secure log-ins and not sharing the meeting link beyond the students in the class. Taiwan and Germany have already put restrictions on Zoom\u2019s use, while Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google banned the desktop version of Zoom from corporate laptops on Wednesday. The company also faces a class-action lawsuit. Concerns have grown over its lack of end-to-end encryption of meeting sessions, routing of traffic through China and \u201czoombombing\u201d when uninvited guests crash meetings. Officials at Berkeley High School in California said they suspended use of the app after a \u201cnaked adult male using racial slurs\u201d intruded on what the school said was a password-protected meeting on Zoom, according to a letter to parents seen by Reuters. To address security concerns, Zoom has embarked on a 90-day plan to bolster privacy and security issues, and has also tapped former Facebook security chief Alex Stamos as an adviser. A messy compromise to unlock \u20ac500bn (\u00a3438bn) of EU support for countries hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic has been struck after Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, warned that the existence of the bloc was at stake, writes my colleague Daniel Boffey. EU finance ministers on a video conference call struck a deal late on Thursday after the Netherlands shifted on a demand for \u201ceconomic surveillance\u201d of countries benefiting from \u20ac240bn of credit lines via the European stability mechanism, a bailout fund for struggling member states. Italy and Spain have in turn accepted a delay on agreement on so-called \u201ccoronabonds\u201d that would allow member states to raise funds on the same terms from the financial markets. The issue of a \u201crecovery fund\u201d yet to be fleshed out will be put to the EU\u2019s heads of state and government at a future summit. Just a reminder that for all our UK-facing coronavirus news please do follow the updates on our UK coronavirus liveblog Russia reported 1,786 more coronavirus cases on Friday, its largest daily rise so far, which took the national tally of confirmed infections to 11,917.

The UK Foreign Office has chartered 12 more flights to bring more than 3,000 stranded UK nationals back from India, the Press Association reports. They follow seven flights that have already been arranged between April 8 and April 12 and will take the total number of Britons repatriated from India to around 5,000. A \u00a375m operation to charter flights from destinations where commercial routes have been severed due to the coronavirus pandemic was launched by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office last week. But efforts to bring people home from India have previously been criticised by travellers complaining about lengthy waiting lists and expensive fares. The new flights will leave from Goa, Amritsar, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata and Thiruvananthapuram between April 13 and April 20, with bookings opened on Friday. The Foreign Office\u2019s Minister for South Asia and the Commonwealth, Lord (Tariq) Ahmad of Wimbledon, said: We are doing all we can to get thousands of British travellers in India home. This is a huge and complex operation which also involves working with the Indian government to enable people to move within India to get on these flights. Over 300 people arrived from Goa on Thursday morning, 1,400 more will arrive over the Easter weekend, and these 12 flights next week will bring back thousands more. The Foreign Office said India is one of its priority countries for arranging charter flights, along with South Africa and Peru, due to the large number of Britons seeking to return. New York City officials have hired contract laborers to bury the rising number of dead in its potter\u2019s field on Hart Island, an area which has for decades been used to bury those with no known next of kin, writes my colleague Joan E Greve. New York broke its record for the largest single-day coronavirus death toll for the third consecutive day, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced on Thursday, as he warned the effect of the outbreak on the state\u2019s economy is expected to be more devastating than 9/11. New York recorded 799 deaths from coronavirus on Wednesday, bringing the state\u2019s total death toll to 7,067. New York has lost about the same number of people to coronavirus as the UK. Cambodia\u2019s parliament passed a law on Friday to prepare the way for a state of emergency, which Prime Minister Hun Sen has said he might have to declare to reinforce the campaign against the coronavirus, Reuters reports. Human rights groups say an emergency would give sweeping powers to Hun Sen, who Western countries have long condemned for crackdowns on opponents, civil rights groups and the media. The law allows the government under an emergency to monitor communications, control media and social media, prohibit or restrict distribution of information that could generate public fear or unrest, or that could damage national security. Ministry of Justice spokesman Chin Malin said: The purpose of making this law for Cambodia is not unique, as there is this law already in many other democratic countries. The law is intended to protect public order, security, people\u2019s interests, lives, health, property and the environment. Cambodia reported one new coronavirus case on Friday, taking its confirmed tally to 119, the health ministry said. Hun Sen was initially sceptical about the threat posed by the coronavirus but cases have been increasing and in recent weeks the government has ordered restaurants, bars and casinos to close and limited entry visas for foreigners. Hun Sen has said he might need emergency powers to help stem the outbreak. Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said Cambodia should be passing laws to protect public health not using the coronavirus as an excuse to extend government powers. He said: The Cambodian government is using the COVID-19 pandemic as a pretext to assert absolute power over all aspects of civil, political, social, and economic life all without any time limits or checks on abuses of power. The rights group Amnesty International said the law had been rammed through the legislative process with no transparency, no consultation and no due process. Group official David Griffiths said: The idea of concentrating even more unchecked power into the hands of this government is worrying in the extreme. Residents in Wuhan, where the global coronavirus pandemic began, are still being tested regularly despite relaxing its tough two-month lockdown, with the country wary of a rebound in cases even as it sets its sights on normalising the economy, writes Brenda Goh for Reuters. Concerns remain over an influx of infected patients from overseas as well as China\u2019s ability to detect asymptomatic patients, and the government in Wuhan has tried to reassure the public that it remains vigilant. Feng Jing, who runs a group of community workers looking after the Tanhualin neighborhood in Wuhan, said during a government-run tour for journalists on Friday that they would continue to carry out extensive checks on residents. She said: We carry out comprehensive heath checks everyday and keep detailed records of their health condition. Currently our neighbourhood is an epidemic-free community - it\u2019s been 45 days so far, so we don\u2019t have this situation. China reported a fall in new coronavirus cases on Friday after leaders promised to accelerate the country\u2019s economic recovery, boost domestic demand and put more people back to work. The country reported 42 new cases on Thursday, down from 63 a day earlier. Of the daily total, 38 were imported, down from 61 on Wednesday. China\u2019s central government coronavirus taskforce chaired by Premier Li Keqiang said on Thursday that they would speed up efforts to revive the economy while at the same time introducing targeted measures aimed at preventing infected people from crossing the country\u2019s border. It said China now needed to \u201cactively create favourable conditions\u201d to restore normality in the economy, though it warned there was still a risk of a rebound in cases. With the government now promising to deploy resources to tackle high-risk areas, much of the focus has shifted to Heilongjiang, which reported 28 new imported cases crossing the border from Russia on Thursday. The province has so far found 154 cases of imported infections. The Guardian and Observer\u2019s photographers have been documenting the UK coronavirus lockdown and the results are both eerie and very beautiful. This is Alexandra Topping, at the helm of the liveblog for the next four hours. My thanks to the ever excellent Helen Sullivan. If you want to get in touch, if you think we have missed a story or want to bring our attention to something - please do contact me on: alexandra.topping@theguardian.com and I\u2019m @lexytopping on Twitter. My DMs are open. That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan for today. It\u2019s rough out there, but at least we have Olive, Mabel, sports commentator Andrew Cotter and their lesson in the importance of being patient (ie staying home this weekend): \u201cStill waiting, still believing...A famous win built on patience.\u201d Here are the UK front pages on Good Friday, 10 April 2020: The WHO v coronavirus: why it can\u2019t handle the pandemic If, like me, you have been confined to your home, glued to the news and nursing ever greater anxiety about the state of the world, you have probably become familiar with the sight of the World HealthOrganization\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and his daily press briefings. Tedros, as he is known, is a calming presence in the midst of the crisis. Flanked by an international cast of scientists, he always seems confident that if we have hope, listen to the experts and pull together, we will get through this. Watching this reassuring spectacle, it is possible to imagine a world in which every nation respects the WHO\u2019s authority, follows its advice and lets it coordinate the flow of information, resources and medical equipment across national boundaries to areas of greatest need. That is not the world we live in. Australia will deploy helicopters, set up police checkpoints and hand out hefty fines to deter people from breaking an Easter travel ban, officials warned on Friday, in their toughest crackdown against the coronavirus, even as its spread slows, Reuters reports. More than half of Australians identify themselves as Christians, with many in past years attending church services or going on trips to visit family and friends during Easter public holidays that run until Monday. Police have said they will block roads and use number plate recognition technology to catch those infringing the bans. Fines for breaking social distancing rules start at A$1,000 ($620), but vary between states. The long weekend was in many ways \u201cthe most important weekend we may face in the whole course of the virus,\u201d Health Minister Greg Hunt said on Thursday. Australia had 6,152 infections by Friday, up 100 from the previous day, government figures showed, with 53 virus-related deaths. More on South Korea\u2019s cases now, which have fallen below 30 for the first time since late February. There were also new cases in the city of Daegu, until recently the epicentre of the country\u2019s outbreak, according to the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). The KCDC reported 27 new cases on Friday, the ninth day in a row the number has stayed below 100. Despite the encouraging figures, health authorities say they are still on high alert over cluster infections at churches and hospitals, as well as those linked to overseas travel, the Yonhap news agency said. The vice health minister, Kim Ganglip, urged people to continue practicing social distancing over the Easter weekend and in the run-up to next week\u2019s national assembly elections. Yemen has reported its first coronavirus case in Hadhramaut Governorate, supreme national emergency committee tweeted early on Friday. The committee added that the patient was stable and receiving health care, without elaborating. The United Nations and Western allies had pointed to the threat of coronavirus outbreak in the war-battered country. One place where masks and toilet paper are in no short supply at the moment is on Easter rabbits and lambs. Here are some of the best pictures of chocolate as this most unusual of Easter weekends begins. A reminder that you can (and are encouraged to) get in touch with me directly on Twitter @helenrsullivan with comments, tips and news from where you live. The global death toll passed 95,000 and confirmed cases grew to over 1.6 million, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. At least 95,699 people have lost their lives in the coronavirus pandemic so far. There are 1,601,984 confirmed cases worldwide. The UN chief warned coronavirus threatens global peace and security. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned the UN Security Council on Thursday that the coronavirus pandemic is threatening international peace and security, potentially leading to an increase in social unrest and violence. The US State Department criticised the World Health Organization. After Donald Trump threatened to withhold funding for the WHO, the state department has said the body was too late in sounding the alarm over Covid-19 and overly deferential to China. The World Health Organization warned the US and other countries about the risk of human-to-human transmission of Covid-19 as early as 10 January. Donald Trump has attempted to blame the WHO for the pandemic, pointing to a WHO tweet on 14 January saying \u201cthere was no human-to-human transmission\u201d. China reported fewer new cases. China has reported 42 new coronavirus cases, 38 of them imported, along with one additional death in the hardest-hit city of Wuhan.Thursday\u2019s cases are down from 63 new cases on Wednesday, and 62 a day earlier, the National Health Commission said. Daegu city, South Korea, reported zero new cases for first time. The South Korean city of Daegu, which endured the first large coronavirus outbreak outside of China, on Friday reported zero new cases for the first time since late February, as new infections across the country dropped to record lows. Boris Johnson was moved out of intensive care. A spokesperson said: \u201cThe prime minister has been moved this evening from intensive care back to the ward, where he will receive close monitoring during the early phase of his recovery.\u201d 16.8 million Americans lost their jobs in the last three weeks as the coronavirus pandemic brings the US economy to a standstill. 6.6 million of those jobs were lost in the last week alone. Pope Francis presided at a scaled-down Holy Thursday mass in an empty St Peter\u2019s Basilica. He spoke from a secondary altar behind the main one he normally uses and the occasion was attended by only two dozen people, including a few aides, nuns and a scaled-down choir. Bangladesh imposed a \u201ccomplete lockdown\u201d in its Cox\u2019s Bazaar district, which is home to over a million Rohingya refugees from neighbouring Myanmar. The UK and Ireland are expected to extend current lockdown measures over the Easter weekend. It comes as deaths in the countries continue to grow. Coronavirus threat to global peace and stability, UN chief warns Here now is the full story on UN secretary general Antonio Guterres\u2019 comments on Thursday and other important developments in the pandemic. The head of the United Nations has called the coronavirus pandemic the \u201cfight of a generation\u201d and a threat to world peace and security. The secretary general, Antonio Guterres, warned the UN security council that the pandemic had the potential to increase social unrest and violence, which would greatly undermine the world\u2019s ability to fight the disease. It was, he said, the UN\u2019s most grave test since it was founded 75 years ago and had already hindered efforts to resolve international, regional and national conflicts. A US judge on Thursday said some abortions can continue in Texas while the state battles the coronavirus pandemic, dealing a new legal setback to officials attempting to dramatically restrict access to the medical procedure, Reuters reports. US District Judge Lee Yeakel in Austin said Texas officials violated the Constitution by classifying abortion providers as covered by a state order that required postponement of non-urgent medical procedures to preserve hospital beds and equipment during the coronavirus pandemic. Yeakel\u2019s ruling, if upheld by an appeals court, would allow Texas abortion providers to proceed with medication abortions as well as procedural abortions for women who risk meeting the state\u2019s cutoff at 22 weeks of pregnancy. In a medication abortion pills are administered to terminate a pregnancy. Yeakel in his ruling described a procedural abortion as a non-surgical procedure that early in pregnancy is performed employing a technique in which a clinician uses gentle suction from a narrow, flexible tube to empty the contents of the patient\u2019s uterus. Boeing is considering a plan to cut its workforce by about 10%, which could involve buyouts, early retirements and involuntary layoffs, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. The potential job cuts are expected to largely target Boeing\u2019s commercial arm, the report added. Boeing was not immediately available for comment outside office hours. Mass burials on Bronx island New York has since the 19th century used Hart Island to bury New Yorkers with no known next of kin or whose family are unable to arrange a funeral. Typically, 25 bodies are interred each week by low-paid jail inmates working on the island, which sits off the east shore of the city\u2019s Bronx borough and is accessible only by boat. That number began increasing in March as the new coronavirus spread rapidly. They are now burying about two dozen bodies a day, five days a week, said Jason Kersten, a spokesman for the department of correction, which oversees the burials. Singapore has suspended the use of video-conferencing tool Zoom by teachers, its education ministry said on Friday, after \u201cvery serious incidents\u201d occurred in the first week of a coronavirus lockdown that has seen schools move to home-based learning. One of the incidents involved obscene images appearing on screens and strange men making lewd comments during the streaming of a geography lesson with teenage girls, according to local media reports. Zoom has been plagued with safety and privacy concerns about its conferencing app which has seen a surge in usage as offices and schools around the world shut to try curb coronavirus infections. Taiwan and Germany have already put restrictions on Zoom\u2019s use, while Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google banned the desktop version of Zoom from corporate laptops on Wednesday. The company also faces a class-action lawsuit. Concerns have grown over its lack of end-to-end encryption of meeting sessions, routing of traffic through China and \u201czoombombing\u201d when uninvited guests crash meetings. To address security concerns, Zoom has embarked on a 90-day plan to bolster privacy and security issues, and has also tapped former Facebook security chief Alex Stamos as an adviser. A 101-year-old man has returned home after being treated in hospital for coronavirus. Keith Watson was admitted to the Alexandra Hospital in Redditch for surgery last month and tested positive for Covid-19, PA media reports. But he was discharged on Wednesday and a post celebrating the recovery from the Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust has been shared thousands of times on Facebook. It said: This is Keith, he\u2019s 101 years old. He went home today after beating Coronavirus. Well done to everyone on Ward 12 at the Alexandra Hospital for looking after Keith so well for the past two weeks!\u201d Mr Watson\u2019s daughter-in-law Jo Watson told the BBC the reaction had been \u201ca bit mad\u201d. She added: \u201cWe didn\u2019t know anything about this Facebook page until a member of the family had it pop up and it\u2019s gone a bit mad. \u201cHe was in hospital having taken a tumble at his care home and needed surgery and that was a big enough ordeal at 101, but he got through that. \u201cHaving gone in for the operation is one thing and then when we learnt he was tested positive we were thinking the worst... but he\u2019s amazing for his age.\u201d The world\u2019s biggest maker of medical gloves, Top Glove Corp Bhd, plans to start producing face masks to meet rising demand from the coronavirus outbreak, aExecutive Chairman Lim Wee Chai told Reuters. The Malaysian company, which makes one out of every five gloves in the world, will have a facility ready in two months with a production capacity of 110 million masks a year. Unprecedented demand for medical and testing materials has made it harder and longer for countries to source essential equipment. Malaysia this week warned of a potential shortage of reagents, a chemical used in diagnostic tests to detect the presence of the coronavirus. The ministry said on Tuesday it had only one week\u2019s supply of reagents and it was optimising the use of the substance while it tries to secure supplies. More on Japan now. Tokyo\u2019s governor, Yuriko Koike, and Japan\u2019s government have reportedly resolved a row over how the capital\u2019s restaurant and entertainment scenes should be covered by a month-long state of emergency declared this week in response to a sharp rise in Covid-19 infections. Koike had been at loggerheads with the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, over his refusal to support stricter restrictions on businesses in Tokyo and six other areas covered by the declaration. On Friday, Japanese media reported that Koike had bowed to pressure to permit hair salons, barber shops, DIY and hardware stores to stay open, but would ask restaurants to close at 8 pm. Koike will create a fund for businesses that meet her requests to close, the public broadcaster NHK said. Abe had rejected calls to compensate such businesses, triggering concern that many would remain open throughout the state of emergency. Kenji Shibuya, head of the Institute for Population Health at King\u2019s College, London, warned that friction between Koike and the Abe administration risked blunting the impact of social distancing measures intended to ward off the kind of explosive outbreaks seen in China, the US and parts of Europe. \u201cThe tension between Koike and the cabinet will definitely damage the impact of the emergency declaration,\u201d Shibuya said. \u201cThere is zero chance of achieving 80%,\u201d he added, referring to Abe\u2019s social distancing target. A second death has been linked to Covid-19 in New Zealand, the ministry of health said. A woman in her 90s who contracted the disease at a Christchurch nursing home. New Zealand\u2019s first covid death was on March 29 on the West Coast; a woman in her 70s with underlying health conditions. Following four days of declining numbers, 44 new cases of corona were announced today, up from 29 yesterday. \u201cWe can continue to report more people recovered than new combined cases,\u201d the ministry said in a statement. \u201cThe combined total of confirmed and probable cases in New Zealand is 1283.\u201d 16 people are being treated in hospital for the illness, including 5 in ICU. Yesterday, 4520 tests were conducted around the country, with 40% of cases having links to overseas travel. The United States has doubled down on its criticism of the World Health Organization. After Donald Trump threatened to withhold funding for the WHO, the state department has said the body was too late in sounding the alarm over Covid-19 and overly deferential to China. It questioned why the Geneva-based body did not pursue a lead from Taiwan. The United States is \u201cdeeply disturbed that Taiwan\u2019s information was withheld from the global health community, as reflected in the WHO\u2019s January 14, 2020 statement that there was no indication of human-to-human transmission,\u201d a dtate department spokesperson said. \u201cThe WHO once again chose politics over public health,\u201d she said, criticising the WHO for denying Taiwan even observer status since 2016. The WHO\u2019s actions have \u201ccost time and lives,\u201d the spokesperson said. The Associated Press reports that three astronauts flew to the International Space Station on Thursday, departing the planet with little fanfare and no family members at the launch site to bid them farewell. Nasa\u2019s Chris Cassidy and Russians Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner arrived at the orbiting lab in their Soyuz capsule six hours after blasting off from Kazakhstan. They joined two Americans and one Russian who will return to Earth in a week. There was no social distancing 260 miles (420km) up: As they floated into the space station one by one, the new astronauts embraced the three already there. They had been in pre-launch quarantine for the past month. In lighter news, Australians are celebrating their bin nights \u2013 when they are allowed to leave their homes to wheel the trash out. An Australian Facebook group called Bin isolation outing has amassed almost half a million members in under two weeks. Its premise is that with social distancing measures in full force, the country\u2019s wheelie bins spend more time outside than we do \u2013 so why not dress up for those weekly walks to the curb? More now on the strong statement delivered at the United Nations\u2019 most powerful body, the Security Council, by UN chief Ant\u00f3nio Guterres. The Secretary-General called the coronavirus pandemic a \u201csignificant threat to the maintenance of international peace and security \u2013 potentially leading to an increase in social unrest and violence that would greatly undermine our ability to fight the disease.\u201d \u201cThis is the fight of a generation -- and the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the United Nations itself,\u201d he said. Guterres outlined eight threats to international peace and security posed by the pandemic: The further erosion of trust in public institutions. The economic fallout could create major stressors, particularly in fragile societies, less developed countries and those in transition. Economic instability will have particularly devastating impacts for women, who make up the vast majority of those sectors worst affected. The postponement of elections or referenda, or the decision to proceed with a vote can create political tensions and undermine legitimacy. Uncertainty created by the pandemic may create incentives for some actors to promote further division and turmoil in conflict settings. Terrorist groups may see a window of opportunity to strike while the attention of most governments is turned towards the pandemic. The weaknesses and lack of preparedness exposed by this pandemic provide a window onto how a bioterrorist attack might unfold \u2013 and may increase its risks. The crisis has hindered international, regional and national conflict resolution efforts, exactly when they are needed most. The pandemic is triggering or exacerbating various human rights challenges. Regarding that fairly all-encompassing eighth point, he said: We are seeing stigma, hate speech, and white supremacists and other extremists seeking to exploit the situation. We are witnessing discrimination in accessing health services. Refugees and internally displaced persons are particularly vulnerable. And there are growing manifestations of authoritarianism, including limits on the media, civic space and freedom of expression.\u201d The Japanese government is considering widening its state of emergency after two prefectures asked to be covered by the measures. The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, declared a state of emergency on Tuesday, asking 56 million residents in the seven hardest-hit of Japan\u2019s 47 prefectures to cut contact with other people by 70-80%, but took a more relaxed attitude towards businesses amid warnings that Japan is heading for a deep recession. The declaration covers Tokyo and six other prefectures but omits others with large urban areas. They include Aichi prefecture, home to the city of Nagoya, the carmaker Toyota and other major firms. The local governor, Hideaki Omura, said he would declare a state of emergency on Friday even if the central government refused to add Aichi to the nationwide list. \u201cIf we look at what\u2019s happened in the last week, it doesn\u2019t look good and so we\u2019re making preparations,\u201d Omura said. Aichi has about 300 confirmed Covid-19 cases. The governor of Kyoto prefecture, which has more than 160 cases, said on Friday he would also ask to be covered by the state of emergency. According to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, at least 95,699 people have lost their lives in the coronavirus pandemic. There are also now more than 1.6 million confirmed cases worldwide, with the exact figure at 1,600,427. Here are the ten countries with the highest number of cases: US: 465,329 Spain: 153,222 Italy: 143,626 France: 118,783 Germany: 118,235 China: 82,885 Iran: 66,220 United Kingdom: 65,872 Turkey: 42,282 Belgium: 24,983 What New Zealand\u2019s coronavirus response can teach the world Michael Baker and Nick Wilson write for the Guardian: New Zealand only embraced the elimination strategy in mid-March. Up until then, the country was taking a similar approach to Australia. Both countries were following their pandemic plans, which were based on managing influenza pandemics. Both were applying increasing border restrictions to \u201ckeep it out\u201d, with controls increased after 15 March to require 14-day periods of self-isolation for all arrivals. Familiar methods of case isolation, contact tracing and quarantine to stamp out cases were also being used. But then the countries diverged. On 23 March New Zealand committed to an elimination strategy. Both countries had relatively low case numbers at that time: New Zealand had reported 102 cases and no deaths and Australia had reported 1396 cases and 10 deaths. On that day the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, announced that New Zealand was going to rapidly escalate levels of physical distancing and travel restrictions, reaching the level of a full national lockdown on 26 March (level four on the alert scale). Read the full opinion piece below: An Australian minister in the New South Wales government has been fined AU$1,000 (US$620) after staying at his Central Coast holiday home and breaching a coronavirus public health order. The arts minister, Don Harwin, was spotted earlier this week at his million-dollar Pearl Beach house which is more than an hour\u2019s drive from his east Sydney primary residence. The NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, said police would investigate, alleging there was photographic evidence of another person in the holiday home. Podcast: 100 days that changed the world (part 2) After spreading from China into parts of east Asia, the coronavirus hit Europe with a major cluster in northern Italy. But while much of the continent scrambled to shut down cities, Britain left it late to go into lockdown. Michael Safi and Patrick Wintour continue the story of the outbreak\u2019s first 100 days. As the US grapples with 16.8 million job losses in the last three weeks \u2013 representing roughly one in 10 working Americans \u2013 the below image shows people waiting in their cars on Thursday for the San Antonio Food Bank in Texas. The South Korean city of Daegu, which endured the first large coronavirus outbreak outside of China, on Friday reported zero new cases for the first time since late February, as new infections across the country dropped to record lows. With at least 6,807 confirmed cases, Daegu accounts for more than half of all South Korea\u2019s 10,450 infections. The spread of infections at a church in Daegu drove a massive spike in cases in South Korea beginning in late February. South Korea on Friday reported 27 new cases as of the night before, a new low since daily cases peaked at more than 900 in late February, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). The death toll also rose by four to 208, the KCDC said. The latest dispatch from Olive and Mabel now: Here is our story on the sporty pair: A maritime patrol has filmed fin whales powering through Mediterranean waters off the coast of southern France \u2013 showing how wild animals are roaming more freely while people isolate indoors because of coronavirus. Didier Reault, who heads the park\u2019s board, says it is very rare for them to be spotted and filmed at such close quarters in the reserve\u2019s waters. \u2018The absence of human activity means the whales are far more serene, calm and confident about rediscovering their playground that they abandon when there is maritime traffic,\u2019 Reault said Early voting in South Korea\u2019s parliamentary election kicked off on Friday, with coronavirus patients casting ballots at designated stations and candidates adopting new ways of campaigning to limit the risk of contagion. Polling stations were disinfected on Thursday ahead of opening, and all voters are required to wear a mask, use sanitisers and wear gloves. Officials conducted temperature checks at the entrance. The National Election Commission (NEC) set up eight polling stations to be used by more than 3,000 coronavirus patients receiving treatment as well as 900 medical staff at treatment centres in hard-hit areas, including the capital Seoul and Daegu city. The election itself is on April 15, but officials are hoping that people will take advantage of early voting options to reduce the number of voters crowding polling locations on that day. The government is still debating plans to allow for voting by the roughly 46,500 people who have not tested positive but are in self-quarantine. The number of Americans getting on airplanes has sunk to a level not seen in more than 60 years as people shelter in their homes to avoid catching or spreading the new coronavirus, AP reports. The Transportation Security Administration screened 94,931 people on Wednesday, a drop of 96% from a year ago and the second straight day under 100,000. Historical daily numbers only go back so far, but the nation last averaged fewer than 100,000 passengers a day in 1954, according to figures from trade group Airlines for America. It was the dawn of the jet age. The de Havilland Comet, the first commercial jetliner, was just a few years old, and Boeing was running test flights with the jet that would become the iconic 707. An unassuming civil servant has become the unlikely hero of New Zealand\u2019s coronavirus crisis, earning thousands of fans online and being nominated for the country\u2019s highest honour. Dr Ashley Bloomfield is the director-general of health and the public face of the country\u2019s battle against the disease, alongside prime minister Jacinda Ardern. Since March, Bloomfield has been fronting near-daily televised press conferences and has swiftly become a figure of fascination in a nation that has enjoyed early success in the global fight against coronavirus. New Zealand writer Anna Connell jokingly changed her Twitter handle to The Ashley Bloomfield Fan Club after repeatedly admiring his cool during press conferences. Overnight, her followers began to grow, and she is now the unofficial leader of the nation\u2019s Bloomfield devotees. It is no secret that wealthy New Yorkers have fled the city in recent weeks, hoping to ride out the pandemic at their second homes, but it might still come as a surprise to learn one businessman has paid almost $2m to rent a coronavirus hideout. Property developer Joe Farrell told the New York Post he had rented out a sprawling mansion in the Long Island neighborhood of the Hamptons, a popular, expensive, summer retreat two hours east of New York City, to a \u201ctextile tycoon\u201d fleeing the pandemic. The near $2m may prove to have been ill-spent, given Long Island is now one of the worst-hit areas of New York state, but the unnamed businessman will at least have plenty of room to roam in the gigantic pile. The big drop-off in aircraft flights due to the coronavirus pandemic has created a problem for weather forecasting. Aircraft make a vital contribution to forecasts by routinely sending reports of in-flight weather conditions, and more than 1m aircraft observations were collected each day last year around the world. Thanks to Covid 19 there has been huge decline in these aircraft reports during the past month, and further reductions across the world are expected in the coming weeks. Without these reports, the quality of forecasts is likely to suffer. Hundreds of UK care home deaths not added to official coronavirus toll Hundreds of people are dying in care homes from confirmed or suspected coronavirus without yet being officially counted, the Guardian has learned. More than 120 residents of the UK\u2019s largest charitable provider of care homes are thought to have died from the virus in the last three weeks, while another network of care homes is reported to have recorded 88 deaths. Care England, the industry body, estimated that the death toll is likely to be close to 1,000, despite the only available official figure for care home fatalities being dramatically lower. The Office for National Statistics said this week that 20 people died in care homes across the whole of England and Wales in the week to 27 March. China has reported 42 new coronavirus cases, 38 of them imported, along with one additional death in the hardest-hit city of Wuhan. Thursday\u2019s cases are down from 63 new cases on Wednesday, and 62 a day earlier, the National Health Commission said. Another 1,169 suspected cases or those who tested positive but were not showing symptoms, were being monitored under isolation. China now has reported a total of 81,907 cases and 3,336 deaths from the virus. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned the UN Security Council on Thursday that the coronavirus pandemic is threatening international peace and security potentially leading to an increase in social unrest and violence that would greatly undermine our ability to fight the disease, AP reports. The UN\u2019s most powerful body, which has been silent on Covid-19 since it started circling the globe sickening and killing tens of thousands, issued its first brief press statement after the closed meeting. Guterres, who called for a cease-fire for all global conflicts on 23 March, said the crisis has hindered international, regional and national conflict resolution efforts, exactly when they are needed most. The secretary-general reiterated that the United Nations faces its gravest test since the organisation was founded 75 years ago from the pandemic and concluded saying: \u201cThis is the fight of a generation and the raison d\u00eatre of (the reason for) the United Nations itself.\u201d Care homes across globe in spotlight over Covid-19 death rates Care homes for older people across much of Europe and North America are struggling to cope with the global coronavirus pandemic, prompting allegations of inhumane treatment and calls for high-level inquiries. Appalling stories have emerged from residential homes, which have emerged as a key location for infections. People aged 70 and older are at higher risk of getting very sick or dying from the coronavirus. And people 85 and over are even more vulnerable, global figures show. In Spain, the army has reported finding dead and abandoned people in their beds after it was drafted in to help disinfect care centres. In France almost a third of all coronavirus deaths have been of residents in care homes. A Zaandam crew member who was hospitalized for days after two ill-fated cruise ships with coronavirus patients were finally allowed to dock in Florida has died, officials said. Broward County Medical Examiner Craig Mallak on Thursday confirmed the death of Wiwit Widarto, 50, of Indonesia. Widarto had tested positive for Covid-19, raising the Zaandam ship\u2019s coronavirus-related death toll to four. The man died Wednesday, six days after the Zaandam and a sister ship docked in the Fort Lauderdale port after spending two weeks at sea rejected by South American ports, said Holland America Line spokesman Erik Elvejord. He had been taken to a Florida hospital the same day the ship docked. Four elderly passengers had already died before the cruise ships arrived, and the medical examiner said earlier this week that three of those men tested positive for Covid-19. The fourth man\u2019s death was caused by a viral infection. Mallak said he tested negative for the new virus but had been dead for 12 days before he was examined. New York sees record coronavirus deaths again as Cuomo warns economic toll \u2018worse than 9/11\u2019 New York broke its record for the largest single-day coronavirus death toll for the third consecutive day, the governor announced on Thursday, as he warned the effect of the outbreak on the state\u2019s economy is expected to be more devastating than 9/11. The grim milestone came as New York City officials hired contract laborers to bury the rising number of dead in its potter\u2019s field on Hart Island, an area which has for decades been used to bury those with no known next of kin. New York recorded 799 deaths from coronavirus on Wednesday, bringing the state\u2019s total death toll to 7,067. New York has lost about the same number of people to coronavirus as the UK. As the state mourns the loss, there are also signs that social distancing is flattening the curve. Yesterday, the state recorded the lowest number of new hospitalizations since the crisis started. The number of ICU admissions and intubations are also down. Opec and its allies led by Russia agreed on Thursday to cut their oil output by more than a fifth and said they expected the United States and other producers to join in their effort to prop up prices hammered in the coronavirus crisis. A reminder that you can (and should be encouraged to!) get in touch with me directly on Twitter @helenrsullivan with comments, tips and news from where you live. Meanwhile in Zambia, the national broadcasting body on Thursday revoked the license of a private TV channel after it refused to air public messages about coronavirus, claiming it was still due payment by the government for past services. Prime Television, a popular pro-opposition channel, told authorities last month that it would not air information about Covid-19 unless it was paid for government-commissioned campaign messages during elections in 2015 and 2016. The Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) cancelled its licence with \u201cimmediate effect\u201d on Thursday, citing \u201cthe interest of public safety, security, peace and welfare\u201d. Prime Television director Gerald Shawa declined to comment on the IBA\u2019s decision. President Edgar Lungu on Thursday extended a March 25 ban on public gatherings and non-essential business operations for another two weeks, advising Zambians to observe social distance and limit movements. Unlike most of his regional counterparts, Lungu has refrained from imposing a complete lockdown for the time being. Religious leaders around the globe Thursday urged people to celebrate Good Friday and Easter from the safety of their homes. Governments warned that the hard-won gains against the scourge must not be jeopardized by relaxing social distancing over the weekend. Across Europe, where Easter is one of the busiest travel times of the year, authorities set up roadblocks and otherwise discouraged family gatherings. Amid widespread restrictions on public gatherings, major religious denominations are holding virtual services where members can watch on TV, online or on their phones. Others are arranging prayer at drive-in theaters, where people can stay in their cars. Other churches plan to move ahead with Easter, especially in states like Texas, where the governor declared religious gatherings essential services. A Houston church has installed hand-washing stations and rearranged the 1,000-person sanctuary to hold about 100 people with 6 or more feet (2 meters) between them. Pope Francis will celebrate Easter Mass in a nearly empty St. Peters Basilica instead of the huge square outside. In England, the Archbishop of Canterbury will deliver his Easter sermon by video. A staggering 16.8 million Americans lost their jobs in just three weeks in a measure of how fast the coronavirus has brought world economies to their knees. Numbers released Thursday by the US government showed that 6.6 million workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, on top of more than 10 million in the two weeks before that. That amounts to about 1 in 10 American workers the biggest, fastest pileup of job losses since the world\u2019s largest economy began keeping records in 1948. During the Great Recession it took 44 weeks \u2014 roughly 10 months \u2014 for unemployment claims to go as high as they now have in less than a month, AP reports. And still more job cuts are expected. The US unemployment rate in April could hit 15% a number not seen since the end of the Great Depression. The US, the Federal Reserve announced it will provide up to $2.3 trillion in loans targeted toward both households and businesses. The head of the International Monetary Fund warned that the global economy is headed for the worst recession since the Depression. The United Nations labor organisation said the equivalent of 195 million full-time jobs could be lost in the second quarter, while the aid organisation Oxfam International estimated half a billion people worldwide could be pushed into poverty. Hello and welcome to today\u2019s live coronavirus coverage with me, Helen Sullivan. In good news, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has left intensive care and is now in a ward at St. Thomas\u2019 Hospital. A spokesperson said that Johnson is \u201cin extremely good spirits.\u201d The pandemic continues to take an enormous toll, with close to 95,000 deaths worldwide, and 16.8 million jobs lost in the US alone. We\u2019ll be bringing you the latest developments throughout the day. Below are the main stories from the past few hours: The global death toll reached 94,850, as the US overtook Spain\u2019s total casualties. The US has now overtaken Spain with 15,774 deaths. Spain has lost 15,238 lives, according to Johns Hopkins University, but the daily death toll fell to 683 after two consecutive days of rising above 740. The toll in France passed 12,000. Boris Johnson was moved out of intensive care. The UK prime minister has been moved out of intensive care, according to Downing Street. A spokesperson said: \u201cThe prime minister has been moved this evening from intensive care back to the ward, where he will receive close monitoring during the early phase of his recovery.\u201d 16.8 million Americans have lost their jobs in the last three weeks as the coronavirus pandemic brings the US economy to a standstill. 6.6 million of those jobs were lost in the last week alone. The US economy \u2018could reopen in May\u2019. The US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said the American economy could start to reopen for business in May despite experts\u2019 emphasis on prolonged physical distancing measures to defeat the coronavirus. Eurozone finance ministers have reached an agreement on an emergency rescue package aimed at responding to the economic adversity triggered by coronavirus. The World Health Organization warned the US and other countries about the risk of human-to-human transmission of Covid-19 as early as 10 January, and urged precautions even though initial Chinese studies at that point had found no clear evidence of that route of infection. Donald Trump has attempted to blame the WHO for the pandemic, pointing to a WHO tweet on 14 January saying \u201cthere was no human-to-human transmission\u201d. Pope Francis presided at a scaled-down Holy Thursday mass in an empty St Peter\u2019s Basilica. He spoke from a secondary altar behind the main one he normally uses and the occasion was attended by only two dozen people, including a few aides, nuns and a scaled-down choir. Bangladesh imposed a \u201ccomplete lockdown\u201d in its Cox\u2019s Bazaar district, which is home to over a million Rohingya refugees from neighbouring Myanmar. The official death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in Iran passed 4,000, the country\u2019s health ministry reported on Thursday, after 117 more people were confirmed to have died from the disease in the past 24 hours. South Africa extended its lockdown by a further fortnight. South Africa\u2019s president, Cyril Ramaphosa had imposed a 21-day lockdown on the country\u2019s 56 million inhabitants on 27 March, enforced by the police and the army. Concern is growing in China over asymptomatic cases of Covid-19. According to the People\u2019s Daily, a state council body has ordered reporting and monitoring of those not showing symptoms despite carrying the virus to be stepped up. The UK and Ireland are expected to extend current lockdown measures over the Easter weekend. It comes as deaths in the countries continue to grow.",

The virtual event will be ticketed, but a price has not been announced.</p> <p>The cancellation of the giant art and music event, which has been held for three decades, will require \u201csubstantial staff layoffs, pay reductions, and other belt-tightening measures\u201d, the Burning Man organization announced on its website. It is also likely to have a serious economic impact on the state of Nevada, where Burning Man is held each year in the remote Black Rock Desert.</p> <p>The event brings Nevada $60m each year, according to Burning Man\u2019s own economic analysis, the <a href=\"https://www.rgj.com/story/life/arts/burning-man/2020/04/10/coronavirus-burning-man-2020-canceled-tickets-refunded/5132668002/\">Reno Gazette-Journal reported</a>.</p> <p>\u201cYes, we are heartbroken.

In the time of coronavirus, a gathering of thousands in a temporary tent city, in an empty stretch of desert where there is no running water and virtually no soap, was an obvious public health concern.</p> <p>For buyers who purchased tickets early, Burning Man will offer refunds of its $475 tickets and $140 vehicle passes to the weeklong event. But the organization is asking ticket buyers to donate the funds to the organization if they are able to afford to do so, to help the organization survive into the next year.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re committed to providing refunds to those who need them,\u201d the group said in a post announcing the cancellation on its website. \u201cIf you have the means, it is our sincerest hope that you will consider donating all or a portion of your ticket value.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/burningman/status/1248778281681408000\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In the interest of the health &amp; wellbeing of our community, we have decided not to build Black Rock City this year.

      "bodyText": "The organizers of Burning Man announced on Friday that they will not be assembling 80,000 people in the Nevada desert this summer to build giant works of art and then set them on fire. Instead, due to an ongoing global pandemic, they will hold a \u201cVirtual Burning Man\u201d, which they hope will attract 100,000 participants. \u201cOn a virtual playa, there\u2019s no limit to who can participate,\u201d the group said. The virtual event will be ticketed, but a price has not been announced. The cancellation of the giant art and music event, which has been held for three decades, will require \u201csubstantial staff layoffs, pay reductions, and other belt-tightening measures\u201d, the Burning Man organization announced on its website. It is also likely to have a serious economic impact on the state of Nevada, where Burning Man is held each year in the remote Black Rock Desert. The event brings Nevada $60m each year, according to Burning Man\u2019s own economic analysis, the Reno Gazette-Journal reported. \u201cYes, we are heartbroken. We know you are too,\u201d the group said in a statement, but cited concerns over \u201cpublic health and the well-being of our participants, staff, and neighbors in Nevada\u201d. Burning Man is the latest in a series of cancellations of major events scheduled for the summer and fall, from the summer Olympics in Japan to the Glastonbury music festival in England. For weeks, Burning Man had held off definitively cancelling its annual event, though it had postponed its main ticket sales, which were slated to begin on 1 April. Burning Man, which started out as a gritty, counterculture experiment, has become an increasingly global and celebrity-studded event, drawing DJs, tech executives, hedge fund managers, and wealthy partygoers from Europe and around the world. In the time of coronavirus, a gathering of thousands in a temporary tent city, in an empty stretch of desert where there is no running water and virtually no soap, was an obvious public health concern. For buyers who purchased tickets early, Burning Man will offer refunds of its $475 tickets and $140 vehicle passes to the weeklong event. But the organization is asking ticket buyers to donate the funds to the organization if they are able to afford to do so, to help the organization survive into the next year. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to providing refunds to those who need them,\u201d the group said in a post announcing the cancellation on its website. \u201cIf you have the means, it is our sincerest hope that you will consider donating all or a portion of your ticket value.\u201d Marian Goodell, the CEO of the Burning Man Project, said in a video that the festival was not truly cancelled. \u201cBurning Man is a culture,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are not defined by one aspect.\u201d Alongside its announcement, the group released a link to a new website encouraging Burners to volunteer to build the new Virtual Burning Man, with the 2020 theme \u201cmultiverse\u201d, by organizing people, hosting an art event or workshop, creating digital theme camps or imagining a virtual playa, the Burning Man term for the open desert. Everyone would be invited to attend the virtual art festival in the virtual desert, organizers said. \u201cWe invite you to imagine a new reality where 100,000 people converge to imagine, explore, celebrate, and take care of one another in these uncertain times,\u201d the site suggested. \u201cBlack Rock City 2020 is in the multiverse,\u201d Goodell said.",

Yet it is countered with one cruel irony: with most residents of these cities strictly confined to their homes, few have any way to appreciate this newly fresh air, except through an open window or a during speedy trip to the supermarket.</p> <p>In Delhi, air quality index (AQI) levels are usually a severe 200 on a good day (anything above 25 is deemed unsafe by World Health Organization). During peak pollution periods last year they soared well into a life-threatening 900 and sometimes off the measurable scale. But as Delhi\u2019s 11m registered cars were taken off the roads and factories and construction were ground to a halt, AQI levels have regularly fallen below 20.

As someone with asthma, she said the city\u2019s air, normally thick with pollution, was usually a health nightmare. But now: \u201cThe air is clear, the skies are blue. I see the evening stars with clarity and hear the chirruping of excited birds at this unexpected bonus they have received.\u201d</p> <p>While India\u2019s powerful car lobby has long disputed that cars are a major cause of Delhi\u2019s pollution, Sunita Narain, director of the Centre for Science and Environment, said the lockdown and resulting rapid drop in pollution showed once and for all just what a polluting role vehicles had in the city.</p> <p>Narain also stressed that while she wished Delhi was like this \u201call the time\u201d, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t want people to say \u2018Oh, environmentalists are celebrating this lockdown:\u2019 we are not. This is not the solution. But whatever the new normal is post-Covid-19, we have to make sure we take this breath of fresh air and think about the serious efforts we need to deal with pollution in Delhi.\u201d</p> <p>It is not just Delhi experiencing the clearest skies in years. As pollution dropped to its lowest level in three decades this week this week, residents of Jalandhar in Punjab woke up to an incredible sight in the distance: the Dhauladhar mountain range in Himachal Pradesh.

      "bodyText": "The screenshots began to circulate on Delhi WhatsApp groups last week, captioned with varying expressions of disbelief. Having checked the air quality index, something of a sadistic morning ritual among residents of India\u2019s capital, most could not believe their eyes. Gone was the familiar menacing red banner, indicating how each intake of breath is really just a toxic blast on the lungs, replaced instead by a healthy, cheerful green. Could it really be that Delhi\u2019s pollution levels now fell into the category of \u2026 \u201cgood\u201d? \u201cIt\u2019s positively alpine!\u201d exclaimed one message. A nationwide lockdown imposed across India on 24 March to stop the spread of the coronavirus \u2013 the largest lockdown of its kind attempted anywhere \u2013 has led to widespread chaos and suffering, especially among the country\u2019s 300 million poor. Yet in Delhi, the world\u2019s most polluted city, it has also resulted in some of the freshest air the capital has seen in decades. It is a lockdown silver lining being repeated across the world, as toxic megacities such as Bangkok, Beijing, S\u00e3o Paulo and Bogot\u00e1, where varying coronavirus restrictions have been imposed, all reported an unprecedented decline in pollution. Yet it is countered with one cruel irony: with most residents of these cities strictly confined to their homes, few have any way to appreciate this newly fresh air, except through an open window or a during speedy trip to the supermarket. In Delhi, air quality index (AQI) levels are usually a severe 200 on a good day (anything above 25 is deemed unsafe by World Health Organization). During peak pollution periods last year they soared well into a life-threatening 900 and sometimes off the measurable scale. But as Delhi\u2019s 11m registered cars were taken off the roads and factories and construction were ground to a halt, AQI levels have regularly fallen below 20. The skies are suddenly a rare, piercing blue. Even the birdsong seems louder. Dr Shashi Tharoor, a politician and author who has been vocal on environmental issues, said he hoped that it was a wake-up call. \u201cThe blissful sight of blue skies and the joy of breathing clean air provides just the contrast to illustrate what we are doing to ourselves the rest of the time,\u201d said Tharoor. \u201cToday the typical Delhi AQI hovers around 30 and one blissful afternoon, after a spurt of rain, it dropped to 7.\u201d \u201cSeven,\u201d Tharoor exclaimed again in disbelief. \u201cIn Delhi! Pure joy!\u201d. Tharoor\u2019s sister Smita, who was visiting from the UK when the lockdown was imposed and found herself stuck in Delhi, was equally effusive. As someone with asthma, she said the city\u2019s air, normally thick with pollution, was usually a health nightmare. But now: \u201cThe air is clear, the skies are blue. I see the evening stars with clarity and hear the chirruping of excited birds at this unexpected bonus they have received.\u201d While India\u2019s powerful car lobby has long disputed that cars are a major cause of Delhi\u2019s pollution, Sunita Narain, director of the Centre for Science and Environment, said the lockdown and resulting rapid drop in pollution showed once and for all just what a polluting role vehicles had in the city. Narain also stressed that while she wished Delhi was like this \u201call the time\u201d, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t want people to say \u2018Oh, environmentalists are celebrating this lockdown:\u2019 we are not. This is not the solution. But whatever the new normal is post-Covid-19, we have to make sure we take this breath of fresh air and think about the serious efforts we need to deal with pollution in Delhi.\u201d It is not just Delhi experiencing the clearest skies in years. As pollution dropped to its lowest level in three decades this week this week, residents of Jalandhar in Punjab woke up to an incredible sight in the distance: the Dhauladhar mountain range in Himachal Pradesh. The peaks, which are over 120 miles away, had not been sighted on the Punjab horizon for almost 30 years. It is the absence of cars on some of the world\u2019s most congested roads that seems to be making the most crucial differences. Thailand\u2019s capital, Bangkok, which only last month had closed schools because the pollution got so bad, has experienced a similar transformation in the air since partial lockdown, mainly due to the fall in road traffic. \u201cWe can see quite a big gap between the air quality standard that we have [compared with this time last year],\u201d says Tara Buakamsri, Thailand director for Greenpeace. But residents of Bangkok lamented how the places to enjoy the fresh air were swiftly disappearing. Playgrounds, sporting grounds and even parks, a rare source of solace in the bustling, intensely urban environs of Bangkok, have all now been shut. \u201cI feel sad for the old people who use the park to hang out and meet friends. I think they will be so sad at home,\u201d said Nantawan Wangudomsuk, 31, a producer who used to run in the parks. Across South America\u2019s most populous city of S\u00e3o Paulo, ground zero of Brazil\u2019s brewing coronavirus crisis, notorious traffic queues and smoggy horizons are also giving way to calm streets and clearer skies. During weekday rush-hour, downtown S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Jo\u00e3o Goulart elevated highway \u2013 nicknamed Minhoc\u00e3o, the Big Worm \u2013 normally heaves with traffic as thousands of cars cram four narrow lanes and beeping motorbikes weave through daringly small spaces.

That\u2019s not until June.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just biding my time and trying to talk about the book. I just started an Instagram for the first time in my life.

He speaks with evident delight of a common phenomenon: a fascination with Lincoln formed \u201cas a fourth-grade boy\u201d, on reading \u201ca picture biography\u201d and \u201cfeeling drawn even to his face\u201d.</p> <p>Lincoln is the president who really did come from nothing, who went to Washington from what was then the wild and unruly west, who spoke of government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/04/abraham-lincoln-president-gettysburg-address\">of the people, by the people, for the people</a>, who oversaw the preservation of the union and the end of slavery, and who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/from-the-archive-blog/2015/apr/14/president-lincoln-assassination-1865\">killed in cold blood on Good Friday 1865</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThere is this feeling of sadness inside Lincoln that we don\u2019t get with most of our famous leaders,\u201d Widmer says. \u201cAnd this sadness shows a deeper capacity for reason and someone who\u2019s experienced a great deal in life, which was true.</p> <p>\u201cLater I graduated to reading his speeches and so many of them are beautifully written. I think we still consider him the most eloquent of our presidents.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I never had a feeling politically that did not spring from the sentiments embodied in the Declaration of Independence</p> <footer> <cite>Abraham Lincoln</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Widmer wrote speeches for Bill Clinton and advised Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state. He happily accounts himself a \u201cspeech nerd\u201d, so we happily discuss one of Lincoln\u2019s lesser-known addresses, which he gave <a href=\"http://hd.housedivided.dickinson.edu/node/25114\">at Independence Hall in Philadelphia</a> on 22 February 1861.</p> <p>But there\u2019s something to get out of the way. The place of Lincoln, and books about him, in a nation jaggedly divided again.</p> <p>Lincoln\u2019s life, Widmer says, \u201cis a story of incredible survival against adversity. And more than survival, really, sort of winning on every possible front. And whenever we fail again, which we do pretty routinely, I think he still speaks to us and helps us to be better than we might be otherwise.\u201d</p> <p>You may see where this is heading. Covid-19 is ravaging the land and to some Lincoln\u2019s successor in the White House, the 45th president, seems to be losing the fight.</p> <p>I ask the inevitable question, prompted by interviews with historians of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/08/sidney-blumenthal-lincoln-politics-trump-republicans\">Lincoln</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/28/david-blight-on-frederick-douglass-i-call-him-beautifully-human\">Frederick Douglass</a> but also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/20/where-memory-leads-saul-friedlander-holocaust-history-trump\">the Holocaust</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/09/sarah-bakewell-at-the-existentialist-cafe-book-interview\">Jean-Paul Sartre</a>. Does Widmer\u2019s book contain lessons for readers in America under Trump?</p> <p>\u201cWell,\u201d he says, picking his words with care, \u201cI hope it does. I think one of the reasons we read history is for insights into our present.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/28/david-blight-on-frederick-douglass-i-call-him-beautifully-human\">David Blight on Frederick Douglass: 'I call him beautifully human'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Maybe such caution is born of Widmer\u2019s Clintonian background \u2013 he\u2019s an alumnus of the same White House as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/08/sidney-blumenthal-lincoln-politics-trump-republicans\">Sidney Blumenthal</a>, now three volumes into a five-volume life of Lincoln but a bete noire for many Trump supporters. Maybe it isn\u2019t. Widmer continues.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be too nakedly political. I want to reach out to all Americans from all backgrounds, I really do.

      "bodyText": "Ted Widmer has published a book about a time of national crisis, in a time of national crisis. Lincoln on the Verge follows the 16th president on his 13-day journey to Washington in February 1861, civil war imminent, the union falling apart. Almost 160 years later, a coronavirus outbreak has killed 17,000 Americans and infected hundreds of thousands more. Widmer, distinguished lecturer at Macaulay Honors College of the City University of New York, will not be riding the rails himself, to college towns and bookstores. \u201cIt\u2019s surreal,\u201d he says, from lockdown in Rhode Island. \u201cI still have one [event] at the Lincoln Presidential Library in Springfield, Illinois. That\u2019s not until June. \u201cI\u2019m just biding my time and trying to talk about the book. I just started an Instagram for the first time in my life. So, I\u2019m trying to do my part.\u201d A conversation with Widmer would be fascinating in less trying times \u2013 or more. He speaks with evident delight of a common phenomenon: a fascination with Lincoln formed \u201cas a fourth-grade boy\u201d, on reading \u201ca picture biography\u201d and \u201cfeeling drawn even to his face\u201d. Lincoln is the president who really did come from nothing, who went to Washington from what was then the wild and unruly west, who spoke of government of the people, by the people, for the people, who oversaw the preservation of the union and the end of slavery, and who was killed in cold blood on Good Friday 1865. \u201cThere is this feeling of sadness inside Lincoln that we don\u2019t get with most of our famous leaders,\u201d Widmer says. \u201cAnd this sadness shows a deeper capacity for reason and someone who\u2019s experienced a great deal in life, which was true. \u201cLater I graduated to reading his speeches and so many of them are beautifully written. I think we still consider him the most eloquent of our presidents.\u201d Widmer wrote speeches for Bill Clinton and advised Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state. He happily accounts himself a \u201cspeech nerd\u201d, so we happily discuss one of Lincoln\u2019s lesser-known addresses, which he gave at Independence Hall in Philadelphia on 22 February 1861. But there\u2019s something to get out of the way. The place of Lincoln, and books about him, in a nation jaggedly divided again. Lincoln\u2019s life, Widmer says, \u201cis a story of incredible survival against adversity. And more than survival, really, sort of winning on every possible front. And whenever we fail again, which we do pretty routinely, I think he still speaks to us and helps us to be better than we might be otherwise.\u201d You may see where this is heading. Covid-19 is ravaging the land and to some Lincoln\u2019s successor in the White House, the 45th president, seems to be losing the fight. I ask the inevitable question, prompted by interviews with historians of Lincoln and Frederick Douglass but also the Holocaust and Jean-Paul Sartre. Does Widmer\u2019s book contain lessons for readers in America under Trump? \u201cWell,\u201d he says, picking his words with care, \u201cI hope it does. I think one of the reasons we read history is for insights into our present.\u201d Maybe such caution is born of Widmer\u2019s Clintonian background \u2013 he\u2019s an alumnus of the same White House as Sidney Blumenthal, now three volumes into a five-volume life of Lincoln but a bete noire for many Trump supporters. Maybe it isn\u2019t. Widmer continues. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be too nakedly political. I want to reach out to all Americans from all backgrounds, I really do. While writing this book I was conscious of how much I learned from my Republican grandmother. \u201cI think Lincoln\u2019s example shows how important it is to be an ethical person, which he was, very unusually for politicians in his own time as well as ours. He was uncomfortable talking about himself and he tried to give the credit to others. \u201cBut he also had a long view. He tried to say to Americans, \u2018It\u2019s really important to get democracy right, because so many other people are depending on us, not just people in this country, with and without political rights, but other countries who are trying to become more democratic.\u2019 \u201c\u2026 And he was thinking a lot about the future too. He mentions the 20th century in a few speeches. And so I think he was trying to reach out to us. And I think we should not be ashamed about looking back to him. \u201cHow can we be the most ethical people? How can we choose the wisest leaders? How can we get back to factuality? There are facts that bolster Republican arguments and there are facts that bolster Democratic arguments. But to at least admit the facts will make us a better country.\u201d \u2018The most sublime statement\u2019 Back to Philadelphia. I suggest Lincoln\u2019s speech there in 1861 should be better known. Before Independence Hall, Lincoln had spoken as a candidate, in his great debates with Stephen Douglas, and he had spoken as a lawyer, when he went to Cooper Union in New York and took the case for slavery to pieces. But when he spoke in Philadelphia, he spoke as a leader \u2013 as the president he was about to become \u2013 for the very first time. The key to the speech lies in the simple statement that Lincoln \u201cnever had a feeling politically that did not spring from the sentiments embodied in the Declaration of Independence\u201d. It\u2019s actually a lawyerly bit of phrasing, a neat dodge of those who point out that the Declaration doesn\u2019t say \u201cwomen\u201d and that Thomas Jefferson, the man who wrote \u201call men are created equal\u201d, owned slaves himself. Widmer calls it \u201cthe most sublime statement of what it means to be an American, of the human rights that belong, in fact, to all people on Earth. \u201cAnd Lincoln says it beautifully and in a very short speech, but by doing that he brilliantly takes the problems of 1861 and sets them in a much wider frame.

      "bodyText": "Jem on Ria What were you hoping for? To pretend that everything in the world isn\u2019t weird right now, and do something a normal single person would do at a normal time in history. First impressions? She\u2019s cute. What did you talk about? How we have both been doing abnormal things like handstands and self-tattoos. Celebrity crushes, living in London, and how she would probably win any pub quiz. Any awkward moments? I went to get my takeaway pizza and locked myself out of my flat. Good table manners? I think both of us were scared the camera would freeze on us pulling an unflattering face while eating. How long did you stay on the call? About three and a half hours. Best thing about Ria? Her call centre chic headset. And her laugh. Did you introduce her to your housemates? My only housemates are plants, but she nearly met the security guard when he knocked on the door to get the spare key back. Describe Ria in three words Pretty, smart, optimistic. What do you think she made of you? She probably thought I was an idiot for locking my keys in my flat. Any connection issues? I thought she was rude because she kept interrupting me, but I realised it was a delay on the connection. And... did you swap numbers? I asked for her number over email while I was sitting outside my flat, because I thought we\u2019d have to finish the date on WhatsApp video from the corridor. How did the call end? I started yawning because I\u2019d been up since 4am. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? It felt a bit unnatural to say goodbye and press a button. Marks out of 10? Maybe a 4. I can\u2019t say it was any more than that without devaluing how nice it would have been to meet her in person. Would you meet again in person once physical distancing is over? Yes. I hope so. Ria on Jem What were you hoping for? A laugh, a good story and for the video not to freeze while I was shoving in pizza. First impressions? Her tattoos and room full of houseplants hinted she was a lot cooler than me. What did you talk about? Coronavirus apocalypse, bisexuality, cheesy chips and how Piers Morgan finally saying something intelligent (about the virus) signified the end times. Any awkward moments? She got locked out of her flat. I thought it might have been a really inventive way to end the date, so I was glad when she came back. Good table manners? I think we may both have eaten really quickly to try to stop the video freezing mid-bite (we failed). How long did you stay on the call? About three hours. Best thing about Jem? She was really easy to talk to. Did you introduce her to your housemates? No, I think we managed to avoid too much awkwardness given the strange situation. She\u2019d get on with my friends normally, though. Describe Jem in three words Funny, easygoing, creative. What do you think she made of you? Hopefully she didn\u2019t think I managed to make self-isolation worse. Any connection issues? The video call kept letting only one of us see the other. And\u2026 did you swap numbers? We did. How did the call end? We both started catching each other\u2019s yawns. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? She wouldn\u2019t have got locked out. Marks out of 10? It feels unfair to score without meeting her in person. Would you meet in person? She asked me out for a drink when this is all over, so why not? \u2022 Self-isolation doesn\u2019t mean you have to stop looking for love, and Blind Date will continue with online video dates.

They\u2019ve got signs up, but you don\u2019t need to teach me the new etiquette. I\u2019ve got a knack for it. I know this isn\u2019t good for me. If my social reluctance isn\u2019t regularly challenged, I will quickly become irretrievably weird. After a circuit of the neighbourhood, I return home. My wife is in the sitting room, engaged in some furious form of needlework. \u201cDid you remember lemons?\u201d she says. \u201cThere are no lemons out there,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s a post-lemon environment.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s in the bag?\u201d she says. \u201cI got an artisanal loaf,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd limes. They had shitloads of limes.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019ll do,\u201d she says. My phone pings in my pocket. \u201cChrist,\u201d I say. \u201cPeople keep sending me links to the Houseparty app.\u201d \u201cNot really your sort of thing,\u201d my wife says. \u201cWhat isn\u2019t?\u201d says the youngest one, leaning his head through the door. \u201cDad\u2019s got to go on Houseparty,\u201d my wife says. \u201cI tried it last night,\u201d he says. \u201cYou just sit there in little squares, drinking.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything worse,\u201d I say. At 7.30pm, I am watching the news when my phone pings again, with another link. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta do this,\u201d I say. \u201cNot here,\u201d my wife says. \u201cGo in the kitchen.\u201d I fill a glass of wine to the brim, open my laptop and download the app. I locate my friend\u2019s account and click on it. He appears in a square, with his glass of wine. \u201cHey!\u201d he says. \u201cThere he is!\u201d He is with his wife, and they are talking to my agent. \u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to speak with you,\u201d my agent says. This seems less like a virtual party and more like a staged intervention. \u201cHi,\u201d I say. \u201cI don\u2019t really get this.\u201d A flurry of overlapping, distorted speech follows. Another box appears, with another friend in it, someone I have not spoken to in months. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say. Another square opens, this time with a complete stranger in it. My agent introduces us. \u201cHello,\u201d I say. A stranger arrives, then another. This is like the kind of party I would leave early, but it\u2019s followed me home. Actually it\u2019s worse than that, because I can see my own face. Do I always look that panicked? Suddenly, with a gust of feedback, my original friend\u2019s square freezes, turns blue, and disappears. \u201cUh-oh,\u201d I say. Another square goes blue. I realise I\u2019m one technical glitch away from not knowing anyone here. I imagine a worst-case scenario in which, after a series of accidents, I am left alone in a virtual room with Margaret Atwood. She doesn\u2019t suffer fools gladly, I hear. We are unlikely to hit it off. \u201cI should really start cooking,\u201d I say. \u201cYes, me too,\u201d says my agent. I close the lid of my laptop as my wife walks in. \u201cWell, I\u2019m never doing that again,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m not sure why you did it in the first place,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you need me, I\u2019ll be staring at my seeds,\u201d I say.",

      "body": "<p>A hunger crisis is rapidly developing among British people in lockdown, as millions report having to go without meals, food charities and local government have warned.</p> <p>Just three weeks into the lockdown, the Food Foundation said that 1.5 million Britons reported not eating for a whole day because they had no money or access to food. Some 3 million people in total were in households where someone had been forced to skip some meals. More than 1 million people reported losing all their income because of the pandemic, with over a third of them believing they would not be entitled to any government help.</p> <p>The foundation\u2019s findings are based on a YouGov poll carried out across England, Scotland and Wales this week. Its director, Anna Taylor, said the crisis was too big to be left to food banks and local authorities without funding. \u201cThis needs urgent and substantial investment from central government which needs to put money directly into the pockets of families who can\u2019t afford food.\u201d</p> <p>Charities running food banks are also struggling to cope with a huge rise in people coming to them for emergency parcels. Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network, said she feared the government was being too slow to respond and the situation was \u201cspiralling out of control\u201d. She said: \u201cFood banks in our network are seeing as much as a 300% increase in footfall compared to this time last year but are still struggling to source enough appropriate food.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/08/food-bank-run-out-stock-before-coronavirus-lockdown-ends\">Our food bank could run out of stock before the coronavirus lockdown ends</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Local authorities told the Guardian that the Food Foundation findings reflected what they are seeing on the ground. In Liverpool, for example, there has been a 150% increase in emergency grants from the council to people who have no food or money for electricity since the lockdown.</p> <p>The city has a highly developed network of food banks and food distribution charities which have increased their operations rapidly in the last few weeks.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/10/uk-food-waste-charity-fareshare-donations-lockdown\">FareShare, the nationwide distributor of surplus food</a>, is now open longer hours in Liverpool \u2013 from 7am to 10pm \u2013 and has distributed \u00a3380,000 worth of goods to families in need in the last five days.</p> <p>Football fans supporting food banks have also raised \u00a3150,000 to buy more stock but the city\u2019s assistant mayor, Jane Corbett, said families were being hit by \u201cthe double whammy of austerity and Covid-19\u201d and charity was not enough on its own.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/23/tell-us-have-you-been-affected-by-the-coronavirus\">Tell us: how have you been affected by the coronavirus?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She warned that the local authority could not pay for the impact of the pandemic without funding from government. \u201cThe fragility of our current social security system is now being seen in stark relief; extreme pressure on food banks is just one clear example. Our budget has been cut by 63% since 2013.\u201d</p> <p>The numbers reporting going hungry in the last three weeks are 1.5 to two times higher than those experiencing hunger over a whole year in recent times, according to Dr Rachel Loopstra, lecturer in nutrition at King\u2019s College London. \u201cThey suggest the Covid-19 lockdown has had a swift and devastating impact on the population\u2019s ability to access sufficient food, both for economic reasons and because of self-isolation,\u201d she said. YouGov polled 4,343 adults from 7-9 April and weighted its figures to represent all British adults.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: \u201cPublic safety and making sure that those most at risk from the virus get the support they need is our top priority. People should stay at home, to help protect our NHS and save lives.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re working with the groceries industry, local government, local resilience and emergency partners to ensure essential items are delivered as soon as possible to the most vulnerable.\u201d<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "A hunger crisis is rapidly developing among British people in lockdown, as millions report having to go without meals, food charities and local government have warned. Just three weeks into the lockdown, the Food Foundation said that 1.5 million Britons reported not eating for a whole day because they had no money or access to food. Some 3 million people in total were in households where someone had been forced to skip some meals. More than 1 million people reported losing all their income because of the pandemic, with over a third of them believing they would not be entitled to any government help. The foundation\u2019s findings are based on a YouGov poll carried out across England, Scotland and Wales this week. Its director, Anna Taylor, said the crisis was too big to be left to food banks and local authorities without funding. \u201cThis needs urgent and substantial investment from central government which needs to put money directly into the pockets of families who can\u2019t afford food.\u201d Charities running food banks are also struggling to cope with a huge rise in people coming to them for emergency parcels. Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network, said she feared the government was being too slow to respond and the situation was \u201cspiralling out of control\u201d. She said: \u201cFood banks in our network are seeing as much as a 300% increase in footfall compared to this time last year but are still struggling to source enough appropriate food.\u201d Local authorities told the Guardian that the Food Foundation findings reflected what they are seeing on the ground. In Liverpool, for example, there has been a 150% increase in emergency grants from the council to people who have no food or money for electricity since the lockdown. The city has a highly developed network of food banks and food distribution charities which have increased their operations rapidly in the last few weeks. FareShare, the nationwide distributor of surplus food, is now open longer hours in Liverpool \u2013 from 7am to 10pm \u2013 and has distributed \u00a3380,000 worth of goods to families in need in the last five days. Football fans supporting food banks have also raised \u00a3150,000 to buy more stock but the city\u2019s assistant mayor, Jane Corbett, said families were being hit by \u201cthe double whammy of austerity and Covid-19\u201d and charity was not enough on its own. She warned that the local authority could not pay for the impact of the pandemic without funding from government. \u201cThe fragility of our current social security system is now being seen in stark relief; extreme pressure on food banks is just one clear example. Our budget has been cut by 63% since 2013.\u201d The numbers reporting going hungry in the last three weeks are 1.5 to two times higher than those experiencing hunger over a whole year in recent times, according to Dr Rachel Loopstra, lecturer in nutrition at King\u2019s College London. \u201cThey suggest the Covid-19 lockdown has had a swift and devastating impact on the population\u2019s ability to access sufficient food, both for economic reasons and because of self-isolation,\u201d she said. YouGov polled 4,343 adults from 7-9 April and weighted its figures to represent all British adults. A government spokesperson said: \u201cPublic safety and making sure that those most at risk from the virus get the support they need is our top priority. People should stay at home, to help protect our NHS and save lives. \u201cWe\u2019re working with the groceries industry, local government, local resilience and emergency partners to ensure essential items are delivered as soon as possible to the most vulnerable.\u201d",

On 7 March Carlson <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/carlson-felt-obligation-meet-trump-virus-69675590\">delivered a warning in person</a> to Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI would say without question it\u2019s the biggest decision I\u2019ve ever had to make,\u201d Donald Trump said on Friday, contemplating when and how he will relax physical distancing guidelines and reopen the American economy. In one ear, he has medical experts pleading caution. In the other, Fox News urges the opposite. The conservative TV network has been widely condemned for downplaying the threat of Covid-19 even as it took measures to protect its own staff. And with the projected death toll poised to avoid the worst-case scenario, some hosts are resuming their gung-ho attitude. \u201cAt some point, the president is going to have to look at Drs Fauci and Birx and say, we\u2019re opening on May 1,\u201d Laura Ingraham tweeted this week. \u201cGive me your best guidance on protocols, but we cannot deny our people their basic freedoms any longer.\u201d Tomi Lahren, a host on Fox Nation, added bluntly: \u201cIt\u2019s time to start the reopen of America.\u201d The symbiotic relationship between the Trump administration and Fox News has long been chronicled. Ideas and personnel move back and forth. The president is a regular interviewee and the host Sean Hannity once spoke at a Trump rally. Indeed, on some occasions Fox News echoes, amplifies and refines Trump\u2019s message, while on others the president takes his cue from its programming. Sean Spicer, a host on the conservative Newsmax channel and former Trump White House press secretary, said: \u201cThere\u2019s no question about it that he watches a lot of Fox and you can tell by the tweets and the comments and his actions. He\u2019ll tweet out, \u2018I just saw on Fox &amp; Friends\u2019 or \u2018Hannity segment tonight\u2019. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a debatable point. I don\u2019t think the White House would debate that. I hope not.\u201d But when the coronavirus outbreak began, the stakes rose. While Fox News reporters did cover it, some opinion hosts rhymed with Trump in comparing it to flu and accusing liberals of whipping up hysteria. On 3 March, Jesse Watters, a co-host of The Five, boasted: \u201cYou want to know how I really feel about the coronavirus, Juan? If I get it, I\u2019ll beat it \u2026 I\u2019m not afraid of the coronavirus and no one else should be that afraid either.\u201d Watters later admitted he was wrong, but this and remarks from Hannity, Jeanine Pirro and other Fox News and conservative media stars will live in infamy in a video compilation produced by The Daily Show with Trevor Noah, under the title: \u201cSaluting the Heroes of the Coronavirus Pandumbic\u201d. What effect did these comments have? Four in five Fox News viewers surveyed by Pew Research said they believed the media had exaggerated the risks of the virus. An open letter to Fox Corporation\u2019s chairman, Rupert Murdoch, and chief executive, Lachlan Murdoch, signed by 74 journalism professors and leading journalists, described Fox News misinformation as \u201ca danger to public health\u201d. It argued: \u201cAs the virus spread across the world, Fox News hosts and guests minimized the dangers, accusing Democrats and the media of inflating the dangers (in Sean Hannity\u2019s words) to \u2018bludgeon Trump with this new hoax\u2019. Such commentary encouraged Donald Trump to trivialize the threat and helped obstruct national, state and local efforts to limit the coronavirus.\u201d Hannity was unrepentant. He told Newsweek: \u201cGo to my website and you\u2019ll see irrefutable evidence that I have taken this seriously way before most in the media did. I warned in January that it was dangerous because it was highly contagious, but some people were asymptomatic, so it would spread quickly.\u201d Some of the Trump old guard, such as Steve Bannon and Tucker Carlson, were quicker to recognise the virus could not be wished away. On 7 March Carlson delivered a warning in person to Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. On 9 March he told Fox News viewers: \u201cPeople you trust, people you probably voted for, have spent weeks minimising what is clearly a very serious problem. \u201cIt\u2019s just partisan politics, they say: \u2018Calm down. In the end, this is just like the flu and people die from that every year. Coronavirus will pass, and when it does, we will feel foolish for worrying about it.\u2019 \u201cThat\u2019s their position. But they\u2019re wrong.\u201d On 13 March Trump declared a national emergency, and soon after called himself a \u201cwartime president\u201d. Hannity and others fell into line, denying they had ever sought to downplay the virus. \u2018Major responsibility\u2019 Dan Cassino, a political scientist at Fairleigh Dickinson University and author of Fox News and American Politics: How One Channel Shapes American Politics and Society, said: \u201cSome of the primetime shows have been better at shaping [Trump] than others. Hannity is all about repeating what the president says. \u201cHannity isn\u2019t leading him except sometimes on rhetoric: he\u2019s very good at taking what Trump is saying and making it fit the mould of conservatism. Tucker Carlson has been more effective on pushing him into certain positions. We saw it on the air and, according to reports, in a personal capacity.\u201d It did not take long for conservative media to backslide. Predictive models now suggest the final US death toll could be around 60,000, staggering by any measure, but significantly lower than a projection on 31 March of between 100,000 and 240,000 deaths. Several hosts on Fox News and elsewhere have floated the conspiracy theory that the numbers might be exaggerated, using unrelated medical conditions in an effort to paint Trump in a negative light in an election year. Even Carlson said: \u201cThere may be reasons people seek an inaccurate death count. When journalists work with numbers, there sometimes is an agenda.\u201d Carlson has also suggested the crisis \u201cmay have passed\u201d, even as America approaches half a million cases amid hellish scenes of crowded hospitals and island burials in New York. The right has also attacked Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, fitting a longstanding narrative that derides experts and the so-called \u201cdeep state\u201d. And there has been cheerleading for Trump\u2019s promotion of hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug that is unproven for treating coronavirus. Federal guidelines on physical distancing expire on 30 April. Trump is hurtling towards a life-and-death decision on whether to extend them or, with millions of jobs already lost, at least partly restart the economy. He promised on Friday: \u201cI will look at both sides of the argument.\u201d But could Fox News tilt the balance again? Sidney Blumenthal, a former adviser to President Bill Clinton, said: \u201cFox News bears major responsibility for the vulnerability of the public to coronavirus and the fatalities, just as Trump does. Trump has said that he\u2019s not responsible. He is, and so is Fox News. They are linked together in responsibility for the consequences of coronavirus. \u201cThere\u2019s a moral dimension that flows from irresponsibility on which you have put hundreds of millions of people at risk for their lives, not only heedless but knowingly. But the idea that Rupert Murdoch, any more than Donald Trump, could be shamed by their moral culpability is dealing in the fantastic.\u201d",

But there are things you can do to relieve the pressure.</p> <p>First, ask your existing provider whether it can upgrade you to a faster fibre package without any loss of service, or the need for an engineer visit. This will largely depend on what\u2019s available in your area, but in many cases it should be possible.</p> <p>Then look at the small things that can make a difference. For example, did you know that a microwave oven can interfere with your wifi signal?

Popular alternatives include <a href=\"https://www.speedtest.net/\">Speedtest.net</a> and <a href=\"https://fast.com/en/gb/\">Netflix\u2019s Fast</a> speed checker, both for Android and iOS.</p> <p><strong>Reduce the pressure on your connection</strong></p> <p>One of the problems is that there will often be lots of devices attached to wifi at the same time. Tablets and smartphones often work in the background, so try switching off wifi reception when you are not using them. With a laptop, make sure as few applications as possible are connected to the internet, says Rory Stoves, at the comparison site Uswitch. And you might want to stagger when people are online.</p> <p><strong>Keep your router away from other devices</strong></p> <p>Cordless phones, baby monitors, halogen lamps, dimmer switches, stereos and computer speakers, TVs and monitors can all affect your wifi if they are too close to your router, says the regulator.</p> <p>Also, place your router on a table or shelf rather than on the floor \u2013 and reboot it if you haven\u2019t done so for a while. \u201cMake sure it is in a place where you\u2019re going to be accessing the internet most often,\u201d Stoves says.</p> <p><strong>Get a new router</strong></p> <p>If you have had your router for a few years, you might be able to get an updated one that has more powerful wifi. Check with your broadband provider but it may involve resigning a contract.</p> <p>If your provider can\u2019t help, consider replacing your router with a third-party one. Prices start at about \u00a370, rising to \u00a3150 for more powerful ones.</p> <p><strong>Wired rather than wireless</strong></p> <p>You could try using an ethernet cable to connect your computer directly to your router , which should give you a faster, more reliable connection, and can be picked up for as little as \u00a31.</p> <p>They have a \u201ccat\u201d number \u2013 the higher the number, the greater the maximum transmission speed and bandwidth. The latest high-spec ones are cat 8, though many people will not need one that fast. However, aim for at least cat 5.</p> <p>This is a complex and jargon-filled world. However, Guardian Money looked at ethernet cables in June 2019, and the websites Digital Trends and TheTechLounge have published March 2020 guides on the best available.</p> <p><strong>Make use of the free help offered by many broadband providers</strong></p> <p>Some companies offer tools that could make life easier. Virgin Media\u2019s Connect app lets customers check their wifi signal strength, pause wifi to certain devices and reboot their hub.</p> <p><strong>Gadgets and gizmos</strong></p> <p>There are lots of kit out there that can give your wifi a lift. Typically, a wifi booster (or wifi extender) \u2013 a smallish device you simply plug in \u2013 amplifies your signal. They are a good solution for bigger properties where you can plug them into the parts of the house that you struggle to get a decent signal, says Uswitch.</p> <p>If the Virgin Media Connect app finds any of these blackspots, it may try to sell you a booster for a typical extra \u00a33 a month. Be aware, however, you can get a decent one for about \u00a315.</p> <p>A pricier one that has been praised for its ease of use is the Netgear Nighthawk X4S tri-band wifi range extender. Unlike some, this keeps the same wifi name and password that you already have. But at \u00a3110-plus, it\u2019s not cheap.</p> <p><strong>Down your streaming</strong></p> <p>Turn off HD streaming if you are streaming a lot, says Stoves. With Netflix, for example, you can log in to its website, and under My Profile, select Playback Settings, and then change the data usage setting.</p> <h2><strong>What about switching provider?</strong></h2> <p>Many people in Britain are getting a poor service from their broadband provider and/or are overpaying. Under normal circumstances, many would be advised to consider switching, but the UK authorities are \u2013 understandably \u2013 not keen to encourage large numbers to switch right now because of the pressure on the networks and a wish to prioritise essential work, such as connecting up the new Nightingale coronavirus hospitals.</p> <p>The consumer group Which? was going to issue a press release in late March revealing the findings of its survey of internet service providers, but it has been delayed as it does not want to create a situation where lots of people are trying to switch because their provider has not scored particularly well.</p> <p>Ofcom says owing to these pressures, it may not be possible to switch at the moment. However, if you still want to, it is worth asking whether it is possible.</p> <p>Home visits by engineers have been halted temporarily, except for vulnerable customers, but if you have a superfast \u201cfibre to the cabinet\u201d connection, which millions do, then switching is electronic.</p> <p>Zen Internet says it came top of the latest Which? survey, with an 84% score, while the big four that dominate the market \u2013 BT, Sky, TalkTalk and Virgin Media \u2013 scored 50-60%.</p> <p>Richard Tang, Zen\u2019s founder and chairman, says switching takes 10 working days. It tends to happen overnight or very early in the morning, and typically people will not notice any impact, but there can be up to 30 minutes downtime.</p> <p>Tang says in recent weeks the company has had an increase in new customers, some of whom have been buying services for their elderly parents.</p>",

Also, place your router on a table or shelf rather than on the floor \u2013 and reboot it if you haven\u2019t done so for a while. \u201cMake sure it is in a place where you\u2019re going to be accessing the internet most often,\u201d Stoves says. Get a new router If you have had your router for a few years, you might be able to get an updated one that has more powerful wifi. Check with your broadband provider but it may involve resigning a contract. If your provider can\u2019t help, consider replacing your router with a third-party one. Prices start at about \u00a370, rising to \u00a3150 for more powerful ones. Wired rather than wireless You could try using an ethernet cable to connect your computer directly to your router , which should give you a faster, more reliable connection, and can be picked up for as little as \u00a31. They have a \u201ccat\u201d number \u2013 the higher the number, the greater the maximum transmission speed and bandwidth. The latest high-spec ones are cat 8, though many people will not need one that fast. However, aim for at least cat 5. This is a complex and jargon-filled world. However, Guardian Money looked at ethernet cables in June 2019, and the websites Digital Trends and TheTechLounge have published March 2020 guides on the best available. Make use of the free help offered by many broadband providers Some companies offer tools that could make life easier. Virgin Media\u2019s Connect app lets customers check their wifi signal strength, pause wifi to certain devices and reboot their hub. Gadgets and gizmos There are lots of kit out there that can give your wifi a lift. Typically, a wifi booster (or wifi extender) \u2013 a smallish device you simply plug in \u2013 amplifies your signal. They are a good solution for bigger properties where you can plug them into the parts of the house that you struggle to get a decent signal, says Uswitch. If the Virgin Media Connect app finds any of these blackspots, it may try to sell you a booster for a typical extra \u00a33 a month. Be aware, however, you can get a decent one for about \u00a315. A pricier one that has been praised for its ease of use is the Netgear Nighthawk X4S tri-band wifi range extender. Unlike some, this keeps the same wifi name and password that you already have. But at \u00a3110-plus, it\u2019s not cheap. Down your streaming Turn off HD streaming if you are streaming a lot, says Stoves. With Netflix, for example, you can log in to its website, and under My Profile, select Playback Settings, and then change the data usage setting. What about switching provider? Many people in Britain are getting a poor service from their broadband provider and/or are overpaying. Under normal circumstances, many would be advised to consider switching, but the UK authorities are \u2013 understandably \u2013 not keen to encourage large numbers to switch right now because of the pressure on the networks and a wish to prioritise essential work, such as connecting up the new Nightingale coronavirus hospitals. The consumer group Which? was going to issue a press release in late March revealing the findings of its survey of internet service providers, but it has been delayed as it does not want to create a situation where lots of people are trying to switch because their provider has not scored particularly well. Ofcom says owing to these pressures, it may not be possible to switch at the moment. However, if you still want to, it is worth asking whether it is possible. Home visits by engineers have been halted temporarily, except for vulnerable customers, but if you have a superfast \u201cfibre to the cabinet\u201d connection, which millions do, then switching is electronic. Zen Internet says it came top of the latest Which? survey, with an 84% score, while the big four that dominate the market \u2013 BT, Sky, TalkTalk and Virgin Media \u2013 scored 50-60%. Richard Tang, Zen\u2019s founder and chairman, says switching takes 10 working days. It tends to happen overnight or very early in the morning, and typically people will not notice any impact, but there can be up to 30 minutes downtime. Tang says in recent weeks the company has had an increase in new customers, some of whom have been buying services for their elderly parents.",

It may seem premature, in the midst of what Emmanuel Macron <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/26/emmanuel-macron-drafts-french-military-into-coronavirus-war-video\">has described</a> as \u201ca war against an invisible enemy\u201d, to consider the political and economic consequences of a distant peace. Few attempt a definitive review of a play after the first three scenes.</p> \n<p>Yet world leaders, diplomats and geopolitical analysts know they are living through epoch-making times and have one eye on the daily combat, the other on what this crisis will bequeath the world. Competing ideologies, power blocs, leaders and systems of social cohesion are being stress-tested in the court of world opinion.</p> \n<p>Already everyone in the global village is starting to draw lessons. In France, Macron has predicted \u201cthis period will have taught us a lot. Many certainties and convictions will be swept away. Many things that we thought were impossible are happening. The day after when we have won, it will not be a return to the day before, we will be stronger morally.

In Italy, the former prime minister Matteo Renzi has called for a commission into the future. In Hong Kong, graffiti reads: \u201cThere can be no return to normal because normal was the problem in the first place.\u201d Henry Kissinger, the US secretary of state under Richard Nixon, says rulers must prepare now to transition to a post-coronavirus world order.</p> \n<p>The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCHARDtalk/status/1243207828317274112?s=20\">said</a>: \u201cThe relationship between the biggest powers has never been as dysfunctional. Covid-19 is showing dramatically, either we join [together] ... or we can be defeated.\u201d</p> \n<p>The discussion in global thinktanks rages, not about cooperation, but whether the Chinese or the US will emerge as leaders of the post-coronavirus world.</p> \n<p>In the UK, the debate has been relatively insular. The outgoing Labour leadership briefly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/25/corbyn-uses-final-pmqs-press-johnson-coronavirus-response\">searched for vindication</a> in the evident rehabilitation of the state and its workforce. The definition of public service has been extended to include the delivery driver and the humble corner shop owner.

In The Road to 1945, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/04/paul-addison-obituary\">Paul Addison</a>\u2019s definitive account of how the second world war helped turn Britain to the left, he quotes the diary of the journalist JL Hodson in September 1944: \u201cNo excuses any more for unemployment and slums and underfeeding. We have shown in this war we British don\u2019t muddle through. Using even half the vision and energy and invention and pulling together we\u2019ve done in this war and what is there we cannot do? We\u2019ve virtually exploded the argument of old fogies and Better Notters who said we cannot afford this and mustn\u2019t do that. Our heavy taxation and rationing of food has willy nilly achieved some levelling up of the nation.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the same vein, Boris Johnson has been forced to unleash the state, but the impact in Britain seems more noticeable on civil society than politics. The famously standoffish British are no longer bowling alone. The sense of communal effort, the volunteer health workers, the unBritish <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/pots-pans-passion-britons-clap-their-support-for-nhs-workers-again\">clapping on doorsteps</a>, all add to the sense that lost social capital is being reformed. But there is not yet much discussion of a new politics. Perhaps the nation, exhausted by Brexit, cannot cope with more introspection and upheaval.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In Europe, the US and Asia the discussion has broadened out. Public life may be at a standstill, but public debate has accelerated. Everything is up for debate \u2013 the trade-offs between a trashed economy and public health, the relative virtues of centralised or regionalised health systems, the exposed fragilities of globalisation, the future of the EU, populism, the inherent advantage of authoritarianism.</p> \n<p>It is as if the pandemic has turned into a competition for global leadership, and it will be the countries that most effectively respond to the crisis that will gain traction. Diplomats, operating out of emptied embassies, are busy defending their governments\u2019 handling of the crisis, and often take deep offence to criticism. National pride, and health, are at stake.<strong> </strong>Each country looks at their neighbour to see how quickly they are \u201cflattening the curve\u201d.</p> \n<p>The Crisis Group thinktank, in assessing how the virus will permanently change international politics, suggests: \u201cFor now we can discern two competing narratives gaining currency \u2013 one in which the lesson is that countries ought to come together to better defeat Covid-19, and one in which the lesson is that countries need to stand apart in order to better protect themselves from it.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe crisis also represents a stark test of the competing claims of liberal and illiberal states to better manage extreme social distress. As the pandemic unfolds it will test not only the operational capacities of organisations like the WHO and the UN but also the basic assumptions about the values and political bargains that underpin them.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ebc8c583b87d36fcabd9c92e18e046d599bfb23a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebc8c583b87d36fcabd9c92e18e046d599bfb23a/0_55_4330_2597/1000..jpg\" alt=\"A Russian plane delivers medical equipment to Spain\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Russian plane delivers medical equipment to Spain.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jos\u00e9 Jordan/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Many are already claiming that the east has won this war of competing narratives. The South Korean philosopher Byung-Chul Han, in an influential essay <a href=\"https://elpais.com/ideas/2020-03-21/la-emergencia-viral-y-el-mundo-de-manana-byung-chul-han-el-filosofo-surcoreano-que-piensa-desde-berlin.html\">in El Pa</a><a href=\"https://elpais.com/ideas/2020-03-21/la-emergencia-viral-y-el-mundo-de-manana-byung-chul-han-el-filosofo-surcoreano-que-piensa-desde-berlin.html\">\u00eds</a>, has argued the victors are the \u201cAsian states like Japan, Korea, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan or Singapore that have an authoritarian mentality which comes from their cultural tradition [of] Confucianism. People are less rebellious and more obedient than in Europe. They trust the state more. Daily life is much more organised. Above all, to confront the virus Asians are strongly committed to digital surveillance. The epidemics in Asia are fought not only by virologists and epidemiologists, but also computer scientists and big data specialists.\u201d</p> \n<p>He predicts: \u201cChina will now be able to sell its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/the-new-normal-chinas-excessive-coronavirus-public-monitoring-could-be-here-to-stay\">digital police state</a> as a model of success against the pandemic. China will display the superiority of its system even more proudly.\u201d He claims western voters, attracted to safety and community, might be willing to sacrifice those liberties. There is little liberty in being forced to spend spring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/uks-covid-19-lockdown-could-crumble-as-frustration-grows-police-warn\">shut in your own flat</a>.</p> \n<p>Indeed, China is already on a victory lap of sorts, believing it has deftly repositioned itself from the culprit to the world\u2019s saviour. A new generation of young assertive Chinese diplomats have taken to social media to assert their country\u2019s superiority. Michel Duclos, the former French ambassador now at the Institut Montaigne, has accused China of \u201cshamelessly trying to capitalise on the country\u2019s \u2018victory against the virus\u2019 to promote its political system. The kind of undeclared cold war that had been brewing for some time shows its true face under the harsh light of Covid-19.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ba9786c6-c779-4063-8bf9-1d3009eb7c70\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3qV7R2iYVXg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The Harvard international relations theorist Stephen Walt thinks China may succeed. Offering a first take<a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/04/03/united-states-can-still-win-coronavirus-pandemic-power/\"> to Foreign Policy magazine</a>, he suggests: \u201cCoronavirus will accelerate the shift of power and influence from west to east.

      "bodyText": "Andr\u00e0 tutto bene, the Italians have taught us to think, but in truth, will everything be better the day after? It may seem premature, in the midst of what Emmanuel Macron has described as \u201ca war against an invisible enemy\u201d, to consider the political and economic consequences of a distant peace. Few attempt a definitive review of a play after the first three scenes. Yet world leaders, diplomats and geopolitical analysts know they are living through epoch-making times and have one eye on the daily combat, the other on what this crisis will bequeath the world. Competing ideologies, power blocs, leaders and systems of social cohesion are being stress-tested in the court of world opinion. Already everyone in the global village is starting to draw lessons. In France, Macron has predicted \u201cthis period will have taught us a lot. Many certainties and convictions will be swept away. Many things that we thought were impossible are happening. The day after when we have won, it will not be a return to the day before, we will be stronger morally. We will draw the consequences, all the consequences.\u201d He has promised to start with major health investment. A Macronist group of MPs has already started a Jour d\u2019Apr\u00e8s website. In Germany, the former Social Democratic party foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel has lamented that \u201cwe talked the state down for 30 years\u201d, and predicts the next generation will be less naive about globalisation. In Italy, the former prime minister Matteo Renzi has called for a commission into the future. In Hong Kong, graffiti reads: \u201cThere can be no return to normal because normal was the problem in the first place.\u201d Henry Kissinger, the US secretary of state under Richard Nixon, says rulers must prepare now to transition to a post-coronavirus world order. The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has said: \u201cThe relationship between the biggest powers has never been as dysfunctional. Covid-19 is showing dramatically, either we join [together] ... or we can be defeated.\u201d The discussion in global thinktanks rages, not about cooperation, but whether the Chinese or the US will emerge as leaders of the post-coronavirus world. In the UK, the debate has been relatively insular. The outgoing Labour leadership briefly searched for vindication in the evident rehabilitation of the state and its workforce. The definition of public service has been extended to include the delivery driver and the humble corner shop owner. Indeed, to be \u201ca nation of shopkeepers\u201d, the great Napoleonic insult, no longer looks so bad. The obvious and widely drawn parallel has been, as so often in Britain, the second world war. In The Road to 1945, Paul Addison\u2019s definitive account of how the second world war helped turn Britain to the left, he quotes the diary of the journalist JL Hodson in September 1944: \u201cNo excuses any more for unemployment and slums and underfeeding. We have shown in this war we British don\u2019t muddle through. Using even half the vision and energy and invention and pulling together we\u2019ve done in this war and what is there we cannot do? We\u2019ve virtually exploded the argument of old fogies and Better Notters who said we cannot afford this and mustn\u2019t do that. Our heavy taxation and rationing of food has willy nilly achieved some levelling up of the nation.\u201d In the same vein, Boris Johnson has been forced to unleash the state, but the impact in Britain seems more noticeable on civil society than politics. The famously standoffish British are no longer bowling alone. The sense of communal effort, the volunteer health workers, the unBritish clapping on doorsteps, all add to the sense that lost social capital is being reformed. But there is not yet much discussion of a new politics. Perhaps the nation, exhausted by Brexit, cannot cope with more introspection and upheaval. In Europe, the US and Asia the discussion has broadened out. Public life may be at a standstill, but public debate has accelerated. Everything is up for debate \u2013 the trade-offs between a trashed economy and public health, the relative virtues of centralised or regionalised health systems, the exposed fragilities of globalisation, the future of the EU, populism, the inherent advantage of authoritarianism. It is as if the pandemic has turned into a competition for global leadership, and it will be the countries that most effectively respond to the crisis that will gain traction. Diplomats, operating out of emptied embassies, are busy defending their governments\u2019 handling of the crisis, and often take deep offence to criticism. National pride, and health, are at stake. Each country looks at their neighbour to see how quickly they are \u201cflattening the curve\u201d. The Crisis Group thinktank, in assessing how the virus will permanently change international politics, suggests: \u201cFor now we can discern two competing narratives gaining currency \u2013 one in which the lesson is that countries ought to come together to better defeat Covid-19, and one in which the lesson is that countries need to stand apart in order to better protect themselves from it. \u201cThe crisis also represents a stark test of the competing claims of liberal and illiberal states to better manage extreme social distress. As the pandemic unfolds it will test not only the operational capacities of organisations like the WHO and the UN but also the basic assumptions about the values and political bargains that underpin them.\u201d Many are already claiming that the east has won this war of competing narratives. The South Korean philosopher Byung-Chul Han, in an influential essay in El Pa\u00eds, has argued the victors are the \u201cAsian states like Japan, Korea, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan or Singapore that have an authoritarian mentality which comes from their cultural tradition [of] Confucianism. People are less rebellious and more obedient than in Europe. They trust the state more. Daily life is much more organised. Above all, to confront the virus Asians are strongly committed to digital surveillance. The epidemics in Asia are fought not only by virologists and epidemiologists, but also computer scientists and big data specialists.\u201d He predicts: \u201cChina will now be able to sell its digital police state as a model of success against the pandemic. China will display the superiority of its system even more proudly.\u201d He claims western voters, attracted to safety and community, might be willing to sacrifice those liberties. There is little liberty in being forced to spend spring shut in your own flat. Indeed, China is already on a victory lap of sorts, believing it has deftly repositioned itself from the culprit to the world\u2019s saviour. A new generation of young assertive Chinese diplomats have taken to social media to assert their country\u2019s superiority. Michel Duclos, the former French ambassador now at the Institut Montaigne, has accused China of \u201cshamelessly trying to capitalise on the country\u2019s \u2018victory against the virus\u2019 to promote its political system. The kind of undeclared cold war that had been brewing for some time shows its true face under the harsh light of Covid-19.\u201d The Harvard international relations theorist Stephen Walt thinks China may succeed. Offering a first take to Foreign Policy magazine, he suggests: \u201cCoronavirus will accelerate the shift of power and influence from west to east. South Korea and Singapore have shown the best response and China has managed well in the aftermath of its initial mistakes. The governments\u2019 response in Europe and the US has been very sceptical and likely to weaken the power of the western brand.\u201d Many on the European left, such as the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj \u017di\u017eek, also fear an authoritarian contagion, predicting in the west \u201ca new barbarism with a human face \u2013 ruthless survivalist measures enforced with regret and even sympathy, but legitimised by expert opinions\u201d. By contrast, Shivshankar Menon, a visiting professor at Ashoka University in India, says: \u201cExperience so far shows that authoritarians or populists are no better at handling the pandemic. Indeed, the countries that responded early and successfully, such as Korea and Taiwan, have been democracies \u2013 not those run by populist or authoritarian leaders.\u201d Francis Fukuyama concurs: \u201cThe major dividing line in effective crisis response will not place autocracies on one side and democracies on the other. The crucial determinant in performance will not be the type of regime, but the state\u2019s capacity and, above all, trust in government.\u201d He has praised Germany and South Korea. South Korea is in fact selling itself as the democratic power, in contrast to China, that has best handled the crisis.

      "body": "<p>Companies whose bosses take pay cuts during the Covid-19 crisis should be wary of handing them lucrative share awards at the same time, investment advisers have warned.</p> <p>Amid pressure from investment firms such as Schroders, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2020/apr/02/schroders-is-right-to-warn-on-executive-pay-now-it-can-lead-by-example\">demanded that company directors \u201cshare the pain\u201d</a> of coronavirus, a flurry of executives have accepted wage reductions, made charity donations or waived bonuses.</p> <p>But some firms, including those receiving state support to pay \u201cfurloughed\u201d staff, have gone ahead with controversial long-term incentive plans (LTIPs) that hand directors sizeable stock awards if they hit targets.</p> <p>On Thursday, insurer Prudential announced executive pay cuts \u201cin the light of the current situation and the need for continued restraint in executive remuneration\u201d.</p> <p>For chief executive Michael Wells, that meant a salary reduction of \u00a323,000, to \u00a31.15m.</p> <p>Less than four hours later, in a separate disclosure, the insurer handed Wells an LTIP worth \u00a3878,873 at current share prices.</p> <p>He will not get anything for three years and will have to meet stretching performance criteria to receive the maximum amount of 83,782 shares.</p> <p>But the stock could be worth significantly more by the time the scheme pays out in April 2023, if markets rebound once the Covid-19 pandemic eases.</p> <p>Prudential was approached for comment.</p> <p>ITV directors including chief executive Carolyn McCall volunteered to take a 20% pay cut and forfeit their 2020 bonuses.</p> <p>Three days later, ITV announced LTIPs and other share-based bonus payments, including some related to 2019, a year for which investors will receive no dividend.</p> <p>The payments, which come despite ITV putting some staff on the state-backed furlough scheme, would be worth \u00a33.2m to McCall alone, even at current low share prices.</p> <p>A spokesperson pointed out that ITV \u201cretains full discretion to adjust final outcomes under the awards to ensure that they are warranted [\u2026] taking into account all relevant factors\u201d.</p> <p>Channel 4 has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/05/channel-4-pays-millions-in-bonuses-amid-coronavirus-tv-ad-slump\">already paid out millions in bonuses</a> to bosses and staff while opening talks with the government about potentially tapping an emergency \u00a375m credit facility.</p> <p>At Reach, owner of the Daily Mirror and Daily Express newspapers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/06/mirror-publisher-to-furlough-almost-1000-employees-and-cut-pay-reach-covid-19\">nearly 1,000 staff are going on furlough</a>, meaning they will be paid 80% of their salary.</p> <p>Senior staff including boss Jim Mullen will also forfeit 20% of their pay. On 30 March, Mullen was handed a 750,000-share LTIP worth more than \u00a3650,000 at present.

      "bodyText": "Companies whose bosses take pay cuts during the Covid-19 crisis should be wary of handing them lucrative share awards at the same time, investment advisers have warned. Amid pressure from investment firms such as Schroders, which demanded that company directors \u201cshare the pain\u201d of coronavirus, a flurry of executives have accepted wage reductions, made charity donations or waived bonuses. But some firms, including those receiving state support to pay \u201cfurloughed\u201d staff, have gone ahead with controversial long-term incentive plans (LTIPs) that hand directors sizeable stock awards if they hit targets. On Thursday, insurer Prudential announced executive pay cuts \u201cin the light of the current situation and the need for continued restraint in executive remuneration\u201d. For chief executive Michael Wells, that meant a salary reduction of \u00a323,000, to \u00a31.15m. Less than four hours later, in a separate disclosure, the insurer handed Wells an LTIP worth \u00a3878,873 at current share prices. He will not get anything for three years and will have to meet stretching performance criteria to receive the maximum amount of 83,782 shares. But the stock could be worth significantly more by the time the scheme pays out in April 2023, if markets rebound once the Covid-19 pandemic eases. Prudential was approached for comment. ITV directors including chief executive Carolyn McCall volunteered to take a 20% pay cut and forfeit their 2020 bonuses. Three days later, ITV announced LTIPs and other share-based bonus payments, including some related to 2019, a year for which investors will receive no dividend. The payments, which come despite ITV putting some staff on the state-backed furlough scheme, would be worth \u00a33.2m to McCall alone, even at current low share prices. A spokesperson pointed out that ITV \u201cretains full discretion to adjust final outcomes under the awards to ensure that they are warranted [\u2026] taking into account all relevant factors\u201d. Channel 4 has already paid out millions in bonuses to bosses and staff while opening talks with the government about potentially tapping an emergency \u00a375m credit facility. At Reach, owner of the Daily Mirror and Daily Express newspapers, nearly 1,000 staff are going on furlough, meaning they will be paid 80% of their salary. Senior staff including boss Jim Mullen will also forfeit 20% of their pay. On 30 March, Mullen was handed a 750,000-share LTIP worth more than \u00a3650,000 at present. Like ITV, Reach said it could adjust payouts retrospectively if they balloon. G4S granted LTIPs worth a notional \u00a39m this week to 10 senior staff. The security firm has stressed that it could retrospectively adjust LTIP payouts and said directors were taking no 2020 bonus. Investment institutions managing pension fund money will be watching closely to make sure firms rein in any LTIPs artificially inflated by stock market recovery. \u201cIn the overall context of the company, the experience of the workforce, the experience of shareholders, companies should think about making a gesture,\u201d said Hans-Christoph Hirt of Federated Hermes, which advises investors holding $877bn (\u00a3700bn) of assets. \u201cIf there\u2019s a relatively quick recovery there may be windfall profits that are not really related to company performance but to the fact that there was a crisis and the government supported the overall economy.\u201d He also warned against the temptation to redraw LTIP criteria in favour of bosses who might otherwise face diminished rewards. \u201cIt is critical not to allow readjustment of performance targets at this point,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you start to fiddle around with them and say things have changed and targets need to be lowered, pay wouldn\u2019t go down for 2020.\u201d Shareholder advisory group Pirc would also be happy to see the back of LTIPs. \u201cIt happened during the banking crisis,\u201d said Tim Bush, Pirc\u2019s head of governance. \u201cThe fall in share price created volatility that helped executives meet the rise in share price criteria. \u201cThis crisis has shown that they are not aligned with the interests of shareholders.\u201d Amid renewed scrutiny on pay, executive sacrifices are proving varied. Monzo founder-boss Tom Blomfield will forego a year\u2019s pay worth \u00a31m, while Sky\u2019s Jeremy Darroch has pledged half his more than \u00a31m salary to pandemic relief. BT\u2019s chief Philip Jansen, who has himself had coronavirus, matched Darroch\u2019s donation. Bank bosses, accustomed by now to outrage over corporate greed, have weighed in to differing degrees, under pressure from the Bank of England to show restraint. Alison Rose, boss of state-backed RBS, offered up 25% of salary and all of her bonus. Lloyds executives will lose only their bonuses. There is new parsimony at Persimmon, the housebuilder castigated for the \u00a376m bonus handed to former boss Jeff Fairburn. Its board is taking a 20% pay cut and foregoing bonuses while workers are furloughed. Meanwhile BAE Systems has said it will review its pay plans at the half year.

The charity, which runs a network of about 200 food banks, said Bezos\u2019s donation was the biggest it had ever received, and \u201ccountless lives will be changed because of his generosity\u201d.</p> <p>However, critics pointed out that the $100m donation made public by Bezos represents less than 0.1% of his estimated $123bn fortune.</p> <p>Amazon is also pumping $25m into an <a href=\"https://amazonrelieffund.org/\">\u201cAmazon Relief Fund\u201d</a> to support delivery drivers and \u201cseasonal employees under financial distress\u201d.</p> <p>Fran Perrin, a daughter of supermarket heir and philanthropist Lord Sainsbury, said now was the time for billionaires such as Bezos to start \u201cgiving back to society in the biggest way possible\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you want to give more,\u201d Perrin said of other very wealthy people. \u201cI think people in a position to be able to, should give as much as they can. I think that\u2019s perfectly reasonable.\u201d</p> <p>Perrin, who has committed to giving away all of the Sainsbury\u2019s fortune she inherited, this week pledged \u00a32.5m emergency funding to help people struggling with the economic fallout of the lockdown. The extra money has been provided via her <a href=\"https://indigotrust.org.uk/\">Indigo Trust</a> charity, to which she had already donated \u00a310m.</p> <p>\u201cWe are currently in a national emergency to which charities and wealthy individuals need to immediately respond and play their part,\u201d Perrin said. \u201cThere is a huge, huge need for funds to support people and demand will only grow. It\u2019s a perfect storm.\u201d</p> <p>Luke Hildyard, who campaigns against excessive executive remuneration at the <a href=\"http://highpaycentre.org/\">High Pay Centre</a>, said all donations should be welcome, but he added: \u201cVery generous individual grants can obscure the fact that on the whole, wealthy people\u2019s charitable giving is pretty minimal. Indeed, studies show that poor people donate more than rich, as a proportion of their income.\u201d</p> <p>Perrin said she would like to tell reluctant billionaires that helping to solve the world\u2019s problems could be \u201cthe most rewarding challenge you\u2019ve ever faced\u201d.</p> <p>Her message, she said, would be: \u201cYou have a skillset that has made all this money. Now imagine what you could do if you turned those skills to solving the world\u2019s problems. This may be the biggest contribution you can make to the world. Give yourself the gift of knowing you did everything you could.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Donors</strong></h2> <p><strong>The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation </strong>has pledged an immediate $100m towards detection, isolation and vaccine development. Gates has said he is prepared to spend billions in the longer term to develop and produce a vaccine. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a few billion dollars we\u2019ll waste on manufacturing for the constructs that don\u2019t get picked because something else is better,\u201d Gates said on The Daily Show. \u201cBut a few billion in this, the situation we\u2019re in, where there\u2019s trillions of dollars ... being lost economically, it is worth it.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Jack Dorsey</strong> pledged to donate $1bn (\u00a3800m) to fund coronavirus research to help \u201cdisarm this pandemic\u201d. Dorsey, who co-founded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter\">Twitter</a> in 2006 and went on to co-found payments company Square, is donating $1bn of Square shares to a charitable fund, called Start Small, to \u201cfund global Covid-19 relief\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s richest people are being urged to urgently donate big chunks of their fortunes to the global effort to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, and help millions of people across the globe whose lives have been thrown into crisis by Covid-19. Some billionaires \u2013 including Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey \u2013 have committed huge amounts of their money to fund solutions to the unfolding crisis. But other members of the wealthy elite have been criticised for pledging only small fractions \u2013 if any - of their fortunes to address the worst-ever global health emergency, which is set to trigger an economic crisis on the scale of the 1930s Great Depression. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon and the world\u2019s richest person, has donated $100m (\u00a380m) to food bank charity Feeding America. The charity, which runs a network of about 200 food banks, said Bezos\u2019s donation was the biggest it had ever received, and \u201ccountless lives will be changed because of his generosity\u201d. However, critics pointed out that the $100m donation made public by Bezos represents less than 0.1% of his estimated $123bn fortune. Amazon is also pumping $25m into an \u201cAmazon Relief Fund\u201d to support delivery drivers and \u201cseasonal employees under financial distress\u201d. Fran Perrin, a daughter of supermarket heir and philanthropist Lord Sainsbury, said now was the time for billionaires such as Bezos to start \u201cgiving back to society in the biggest way possible\u201d. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you want to give more,\u201d Perrin said of other very wealthy people. \u201cI think people in a position to be able to, should give as much as they can. I think that\u2019s perfectly reasonable.\u201d Perrin, who has committed to giving away all of the Sainsbury\u2019s fortune she inherited, this week pledged \u00a32.5m emergency funding to help people struggling with the economic fallout of the lockdown. The extra money has been provided via her Indigo Trust charity, to which she had already donated \u00a310m. \u201cWe are currently in a national emergency to which charities and wealthy individuals need to immediately respond and play their part,\u201d Perrin said. \u201cThere is a huge, huge need for funds to support people and demand will only grow. It\u2019s a perfect storm.\u201d Luke Hildyard, who campaigns against excessive executive remuneration at the High Pay Centre, said all donations should be welcome, but he added: \u201cVery generous individual grants can obscure the fact that on the whole, wealthy people\u2019s charitable giving is pretty minimal. Indeed, studies show that poor people donate more than rich, as a proportion of their income.\u201d Perrin said she would like to tell reluctant billionaires that helping to solve the world\u2019s problems could be \u201cthe most rewarding challenge you\u2019ve ever faced\u201d. Her message, she said, would be: \u201cYou have a skillset that has made all this money. Now imagine what you could do if you turned those skills to solving the world\u2019s problems. This may be the biggest contribution you can make to the world. Give yourself the gift of knowing you did everything you could.\u201d Donors The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has pledged an immediate $100m towards detection, isolation and vaccine development. Gates has said he is prepared to spend billions in the longer term to develop and produce a vaccine. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a few billion dollars we\u2019ll waste on manufacturing for the constructs that don\u2019t get picked because something else is better,\u201d Gates said on The Daily Show. \u201cBut a few billion in this, the situation we\u2019re in, where there\u2019s trillions of dollars ... being lost economically, it is worth it.\u201d Jack Dorsey pledged to donate $1bn (\u00a3800m) to fund coronavirus research to help \u201cdisarm this pandemic\u201d. Dorsey, who co-founded Twitter in 2006 and went on to co-found payments company Square, is donating $1bn of Square shares to a charitable fund, called Start Small, to \u201cfund global Covid-19 relief\u201d. He said the donation was about \u201c28% of my wealth\u201d. Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder, has committed $30m to the Gates Foundation and Wellcome Trust\u2019s joint research project, the Covid-19 Therapeutics Accelerator. Zuckerberg has an estimated $67bn fortune. Jack Ma, China\u2019s richest person, has pledged 100m yuan ($14.5m) to \u201csupport the development of a coronavirus vaccine\u201d. Ma has an estimated $44bn fortune. Hans Rausing, grandson of the Swedish founder of Tetra Pak, has donated \u00a316.5m to charities and other groups supporting the NHS. George Soros, the multibillionaire former hedge fund manager and philanthropist, has pledged \u20ac2m to support the \u201cunprecedented emergency\u201d in Milan and his native Hungary. \u201cI was born in Budapest, in the middle of the Great Depression,\u201d Soros said in a statement. \u201cI lived through world war two, the Arrow Cross rule, and the siege in the city. I remember what it is like to live in extreme circumstances.\u201d Madonna has donated $1m to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, to help in the creation of a vaccine. George and Amal Clooney have pledged $1m (\u00a3803,000) to six coronavirus causes including the NHS, relief charities in the Lombardy region of Italy and Lebanese food banks.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cI\u2019d always wanted a brother,\u201d says Declan Aumpu, the first time we meet. It\u2019s April 2017, and I am 23 years old. Dec, 26, has arrived in the back of a friend\u2019s van after a big night out. He is clearly nervous and has hardly slept. I\u2019m anxious, too.</p> <p>It\u2019s strange that we have never met, especially since so many people know we are half-brothers, and I gulp back feelings of regret and shame. We don\u2019t look much alike, beside our smiles, which curl up on the left-hand side of our mouths, but there is an instant connection; an immediate ease in each other\u2019s company. As we embrace outside the Merlin\u2019s Cave pub in Chalfont St Giles, south Buckinghamshire, it\u2019s like being reunited with an old friend.</p> <p>Later, in the pub, Dec tells me he was \u201cforever envious of the bond that brothers seemed to share\u201d, a feeling that only grew when, around the age of eight, he found out about me. He also explains that this is not our first meeting: more than two decades ago, we spontaneously played together with a boules set in a pub garden in nearby Chalfont St Peter, where our parents had grown up. Dec\u2019s mum, Tracey, beckoned him away as soon she realised who I was. I had no idea of the identity of my fleeting playmate. </p> <p>Dec drinks Stella; mine is a Guinness. The barman asks who I am, since Dec is a regular here, and Dec proudly says that I\u2019m his brother. Noticing the height difference between us (I\u2019m 6ft 4in and Dec is 5ft 8in), the barman raises an eyebrow and makes a joke about me being put into a grow bag at an early age.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The onus is on the siblings who have grown up with both their parents to reach out to their half-siblings</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I only learned of Dec\u2019s existence relatively recently. When my parents first got together in 1991, my dad, Nick, then 27, told my mother, Mandy, 26, about a rumour going around that he had recently fathered a child; he said it wasn\u2019t true, and my mum believed him. Soon afterwards, they moved from Chalfont St Peter to the more affordable town of Fenny Stratford, near Milton Keynes, where they had me and my younger brother, Rory. My mum heard nothing more about this rumour until many years later, when my uncle Andy referred to my dad\u2019s \u201cother son\u201d during a conversation with my aunt Judy; she later told my mother.</p> <p>Not wanting to disrupt Rory\u2019s GCSEs, Mum spent the next six months silently seething, before confronting Dad. Clearly regretful and contrite, he eventually told us about our half-brother as we slowly chewed paneer at an Indian buffet in July 2016. He claimed he had been warned to stay away from his baby son after his friendship with Tracey broke down, and that he had duly done so. Tracey has since said she had wanted him to be either a constant presence in Dec\u2019s life, or not present at all, and he had conceded that he was not ready to be a father. I was, and still am, bewildered: the dad I knew had never shied away from truth and responsibility.</p> <p>Once the news had sunk in, I got in touch with Dec, a landscape gardener and builder, on Facebook, and we arranged to meet. We settled on the Merlin\u2019s Cave, where he and my dad had met a handful of times since 2010, after my parents separated and my dad sent Tracey a Facebook friend request. Dec is keen to build a relationship with Dad, but neither of them are very good at texting each other back, never mind socialising or making time for enriching activities. Nor am I.</p> <p>Dec tells me that, growing up in Chalfont St Peter, most people viewed his connection to the Busbys as a matter not to be spoken about. Tracey struggled for money, and they spent time in a homeless hostel before moving to the next village. \u201cI still get called \u2018the bastard Busby\u2019 down the pub,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd at school, there were these girls who would viciously bully me for not having a dad.\u201d This prompted Tracey to tell him that his dad had another family. Then, at the age of eight, Dec was diagnosed with diabetes, and took part in a genetic study; through this, he discovered our father\u2019s name, and those of his half-siblings.</p> <p>Dec and I both spent large parts of our childhoods alone; he is an only child, while Rory is six years younger than me, and we didn\u2019t really connect until later in life. \u201cIf we\u2019d been introduced when we were younger, it would have been a different experience,\u201d Dec says now, three years after that first meeting. \u201cBut now you\u2019re my little brother.\u201d We may not see each other regularly, but we find comfort in keeping in touch to discuss our partners, work, family and the coronavirus. Just like brothers would.</p> <p>How does it feel for other siblings united in later life? Almost one in five British families have been <a href=\"https://www.standalone.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/StandAlonePrevalenceRESEARCH3.pdf\" title=\"\">touched by estrangement</a>, according to research by the charity Stand Alone, and a million children across the UK have <a href=\"https://www.centreforsocialjustice.org.uk/core/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/CSJ-Press-Release-Lone-Parents.pdf\" title=\"\">no significant contact with their father</a>. Reenee Singh, a psychotherapist and CEO of the Association of Family Therapy, is clear about the emotional burden associated with this: \u201cIt can be very difficult for half-siblings to grow up knowing they have a family somewhere they\u2019re not in contact with,\u201d she says. \u201cIf their existence was a secret, it can leave them feeling confused, vulnerable, unprotected and insecure.\u201d</p> <p>However, she warns against rushing into a meeting with an estranged sibling, pointing out that it is better to exchange photos, letters or messages on social media first. In my own case, she says: \u201cYou\u2019re old enough to forge your own adult relationship and to bridge the gap between him and your father. The onus is on the siblings who have grown up with both their parents to reach out to their half-siblings.\u201d</p> <p>Reunions aren\u2019t always straightforward, as the 2018 documentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/28/three-identical-strangers-the-bizarre-tale-of-triplets-separated-at-birth\" title=\"\">Three Identical Strangers</a>, about triplets separated at birth, tragically showed. Although the three brothers experienced a joyful reunion, followed by fame and success, they all struggled with mental health issues. One of the siblings, Eddy, took his own life in 1995. Meanwhile, plenty of people live their lives never knowing the whole story about their families or how many siblings they have.</p> <p>My meeting with Dec had raised questions for us both, and made me want to speak to other people who had experienced something similar. How had they found their long-lost siblings? Had they been able to reconcile their different upbringings and move beyond pondering what might have been?</p> <h2>\u2018You don\u2019t realise you\u2019ve got space for another sibling. But when one turns up, it\u2019s great\u2019: Sandy Busek, 53, and Paul Busek, 51</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6eca6d36e641fab08da3d525d353c5eb32c2ea53\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6eca6d36e641fab08da3d525d353c5eb32c2ea53/0_2372_6003_5403/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sandy and Paul Busek\" width=\"1000\" height=\"900\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018He\u2019s a nicer guy, but I\u2019m better-looking,\u2019 jokes Paul Busek (right) of Sandy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Harry Borden/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sandy, who lives in Petworth, West Sussex, was brought up in Carlisle by his grandparents. His father, Jan, disappeared shortly after he was born, and remarried twice, fathering a number of other children, including Paul. \u201cI wasn\u2019t close with my mum,\u201d Sandy says. \u201cShe was more like an aunt to me. As a kid, you feel a sense of abandonment. For about two and a half years from the age of 12, I was a carer for my grandmother when my grandfather was at work.\u201d</p> <p>When he was 18, Sandy visited Jan and his family in south Wales, to work out whether he should invite him to his wedding. It was during this visit that he discovered he had two younger siblings, Paul and Chantelle. But according to Paul, his parents told him that Sandy\u2019s visit \u2013 during which he was told to stay upstairs \u2013 had been to ask for money. Further attempts to talk to his parents about his half-brother were quickly shut down. This may explain why, when Sandy tried to make contact with Paul 15 years ago, his friend request on Facebook was rejected. Paul says he simply wasn\u2019t ready for another sibling, to share his father, or to grapple with his family\u2019s past.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I wouldn\u2019t say we look like twins, but we are very similar. I felt driven to meet him because we clearly shared DNA</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Two years later, when Sandy was 40, and he and his wife were expecting their first child, he made a fresh attempt to get to know his half-siblings, first making contact with Chantelle. \u201cWe met up in Ireland and got on well,\u201d Sandy says. Then, in 2018, when looking for other Buseks online, he happened to send a friend request to Lucy, Paul\u2019s daughter, not realising she was his niece. \u201cShe printed a photo of me from Facebook and shoved it under his nose,\u201d Sandy says.</p> <p>\u201cMy wife was gobsmacked,\u201d Paul recalls. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we look like twins, but we are very similar. I felt driven to meet him because we clearly shared DNA.\u201d In September 2018, Paul contacted Sandy on LinkedIn. They didn\u2019t waste any time: three weeks later, Sandy flew to Bahrain to meet Paul, who works for a defence company in Saudi Arabia. According to Paul, the half-brothers got along \u201clike a house on fire\u201d, and later he and his family visited Sandy in the UK. \u201cYou don\u2019t realise you\u2019ve got space for another sibling, but when one turns up it\u2019s like, \u2018OK, yeah, this is great\u2019,\u201d Paul says.</p> <p>They noticed a number of coincidences. Sandy is teetotal, and Paul rarely drinks. They both enjoy luxury cars and clay pigeon shooting. Both brothers are 6ft 1in, weigh 105kg, and wear near-identical spectacles. They also have a similar fashion sense; on the day they met for the first time, both were dressed in blue-and-white striped polo shirts. \u201cWe look so similar,\u201d Paul says. \u201cIncredibly similar bad taste, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s spooky how many similarities there are,\u201d Sandy agrees. \u201cBut there are differences, too: I was wrapped up in cotton wool by my grandparents, while he\u2019s more of an alpha male after 26 years in the military.\u201d</p> <p>Paul says: \u201cI think he\u2019s probably a nicer guy than me. He\u2019s a bit more placid, more level-headed, but that might be the different nurturing he had from his side: I lived with our old man, he didn\u2019t. He\u2019s starting to see a less polished side to me as I open up.\u201d Then he jokes: \u201cI think he gets insanely jealous that I\u2019m better-looking.\u201d</p> <p>Although Sandy wishes he had grown up closer to his parents and half-siblings, he remains pragmatic. \u201cI don\u2019t sit here thinking life could\u2019ve been so much better, but I have got some catching up to do.\u201d This will become easier now that Paul\u2019s family are planning a move from the Middle East to nearby Midhurst in West Sussex. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know that part of the country, but when we visited Sandy we thought, \u2018Bloody hell, we like it here\u2019,\u201d Paul says. \u201cWhenever I\u2019m back in the UK, my priority is to see my family and kids \u2013 and my brother.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018I knew there was something different.

He remembers his stepfather, who had his own children, being unkind to him and his sister, not allowing them to celebrate their birthdays. When Dougie discovered his real surname at the age of 11, after it was read out from his birth certificate during his communion, he began asking questions. \u201cBut I was always told to shut up.\u201d</p> <p>Then, one night, an aunt \u201cspilled the beans\u201d. He remembers learning that his mother had left his Irish father, Hugh, without explanation, in the early stages of her pregnancy with Dougie, not telling him she was bearing a child. \u201cAfter that, it was always on my mind,\u201d he says. \u201cI had known from a young age there was something different about me, but if I asked it was, \u2018lift the carpet, sweep it under\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Dougie left home at 15 and moved to Ireland to work in construction in 1972. He didn\u2019t start looking for his family in earnest until 2009, when he was made redundant. With his daughter, Katrina, Dougie began to do his research. They learned that, after the war, Hugh had worked in coal mines in Derbyshire; Katrina tracked down his details from a list of workers from the period. \u201cI was rattling, shaking, thinking, \u2018What am I going to do now?\u2019\u201d Dougie says. By then, Hugh was seriously ill: he ignored their letters and denied the connection over the phone. Eventually he relented, asking if Katrina could send some pictures.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019re brothers and sisters. It feels like we\u2019ve known each other since birth. I couldn\u2019t ask for anything better</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Three months later, Hugh invited Dougie and his wife, Sally, to visit him in Derbyshire. Jo, Dougie\u2019s half-sister, remembers opening the door to them in September 2012: \u201cI looked at this poor, very nervous man who looked like he could have been my dad\u2019s brother and said: \u2018We couldn\u2019t disown you,\u2019\u201d she says now. \u201cHe was one of us, for sure.\u201d</p> <p>Dougie, who now lives in Kildare, south-west of Dublin, says he felt intense relief. \u201cI went, \u2018That\u2019s it: mission accomplished.\u2019 The first thing Jo told me was: \u2018The apple hasn\u2019t fallen far from the tree.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Jo, who also lives in Ireland, had only found out about Dougie an hour before meeting him. \u201cI was in England on work business and went to visit my dad,\u201d she recalls. \u201cHe kept saying things like, \u2018Ach, some fella from Scotland wants to come and see me.\u2019 But just before he arrived, he said: \u2018He says I could be his father.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Dougie never found out what sparked his mother\u2019s sudden flight. \u201cI never asked any awkward questions,\u201d he says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to go in bull-headedly. I set out to find him, and when I did, there was an ease there. There was no resentment.\u201d Dougie continued to speak to his father regularly on the phone and, after he died in November 2017, kept in contact with Jo, who lives three hours north of him in Donegal. Now their families spend holidays together. \u201cWe\u2019re brothers and sisters,\u201d he says. \u201cIt feels like we\u2019ve known each other for years, since birth. I couldn\u2019t ask for anything better.\u201d At family events, Dougie is often confused with his father. Five years ago, at a funeral, a cousin gasped in horror, thinking she had seen a ghost. </p> <p>Last summer, Jo arranged for Dougie and Sally to join her on a trip in their father\u2019s home county of Donegal, to scatter Hugh\u2019s ashes. Dougie did the honours: \u201cI broke down,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought I would never get to that stage. The whole trip brought me closer to my roots.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re really close now,\u201d Jo says. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely part of the family.\u201d The spare room is now known as Dougie and Sally\u2019s room, and they bought each other almost identical gifts for Christmas \u2013 shortbread biscuits in packaging featuring Highland terriers. \u201cIt\u2019s really bizarre, the connection we have.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018As an orphan, you fantasise about being in a family.

Peggy is mixed race, but her mother and the man who thought he had fathered her were white. Her birth caused shockwaves, and her mother suddenly disappeared from her life when she was two weeks old. She also left behind Peggy\u2019s half-sister, Linda, with whom she shared a cot.</p> <p>Peggy was put into an orphanage, and moved around the UK by the authorities, eventually ending up in a foster home at the age of 13. \u201cGrowing up, I was always told I was Jamaican,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it was being an orphan that defined me.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI\u2019d always wanted a brother,\u201d says Declan Aumpu, the first time we meet. It\u2019s April 2017, and I am 23 years old. Dec, 26, has arrived in the back of a friend\u2019s van after a big night out. He is clearly nervous and has hardly slept. I\u2019m anxious, too. It\u2019s strange that we have never met, especially since so many people know we are half-brothers, and I gulp back feelings of regret and shame. We don\u2019t look much alike, beside our smiles, which curl up on the left-hand side of our mouths, but there is an instant connection; an immediate ease in each other\u2019s company. As we embrace outside the Merlin\u2019s Cave pub in Chalfont St Giles, south Buckinghamshire, it\u2019s like being reunited with an old friend. Later, in the pub, Dec tells me he was \u201cforever envious of the bond that brothers seemed to share\u201d, a feeling that only grew when, around the age of eight, he found out about me. He also explains that this is not our first meeting: more than two decades ago, we spontaneously played together with a boules set in a pub garden in nearby Chalfont St Peter, where our parents had grown up. Dec\u2019s mum, Tracey, beckoned him away as soon she realised who I was. I had no idea of the identity of my fleeting playmate. Dec drinks Stella; mine is a Guinness. The barman asks who I am, since Dec is a regular here, and Dec proudly says that I\u2019m his brother. Noticing the height difference between us (I\u2019m 6ft 4in and Dec is 5ft 8in), the barman raises an eyebrow and makes a joke about me being put into a grow bag at an early age. I only learned of Dec\u2019s existence relatively recently. When my parents first got together in 1991, my dad, Nick, then 27, told my mother, Mandy, 26, about a rumour going around that he had recently fathered a child; he said it wasn\u2019t true, and my mum believed him. Soon afterwards, they moved from Chalfont St Peter to the more affordable town of Fenny Stratford, near Milton Keynes, where they had me and my younger brother, Rory. My mum heard nothing more about this rumour until many years later, when my uncle Andy referred to my dad\u2019s \u201cother son\u201d during a conversation with my aunt Judy; she later told my mother. Not wanting to disrupt Rory\u2019s GCSEs, Mum spent the next six months silently seething, before confronting Dad. Clearly regretful and contrite, he eventually told us about our half-brother as we slowly chewed paneer at an Indian buffet in July 2016. He claimed he had been warned to stay away from his baby son after his friendship with Tracey broke down, and that he had duly done so. Tracey has since said she had wanted him to be either a constant presence in Dec\u2019s life, or not present at all, and he had conceded that he was not ready to be a father. I was, and still am, bewildered: the dad I knew had never shied away from truth and responsibility. Once the news had sunk in, I got in touch with Dec, a landscape gardener and builder, on Facebook, and we arranged to meet. We settled on the Merlin\u2019s Cave, where he and my dad had met a handful of times since 2010, after my parents separated and my dad sent Tracey a Facebook friend request. Dec is keen to build a relationship with Dad, but neither of them are very good at texting each other back, never mind socialising or making time for enriching activities. Nor am I. Dec tells me that, growing up in Chalfont St Peter, most people viewed his connection to the Busbys as a matter not to be spoken about. Tracey struggled for money, and they spent time in a homeless hostel before moving to the next village. \u201cI still get called \u2018the bastard Busby\u2019 down the pub,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd at school, there were these girls who would viciously bully me for not having a dad.\u201d This prompted Tracey to tell him that his dad had another family. Then, at the age of eight, Dec was diagnosed with diabetes, and took part in a genetic study; through this, he discovered our father\u2019s name, and those of his half-siblings. Dec and I both spent large parts of our childhoods alone; he is an only child, while Rory is six years younger than me, and we didn\u2019t really connect until later in life. \u201cIf we\u2019d been introduced when we were younger, it would have been a different experience,\u201d Dec says now, three years after that first meeting. \u201cBut now you\u2019re my little brother.\u201d We may not see each other regularly, but we find comfort in keeping in touch to discuss our partners, work, family and the coronavirus. Just like brothers would. How does it feel for other siblings united in later life? Almost one in five British families have been touched by estrangement, according to research by the charity Stand Alone, and a million children across the UK have no significant contact with their father. Reenee Singh, a psychotherapist and CEO of the Association of Family Therapy, is clear about the emotional burden associated with this: \u201cIt can be very difficult for half-siblings to grow up knowing they have a family somewhere they\u2019re not in contact with,\u201d she says. \u201cIf their existence was a secret, it can leave them feeling confused, vulnerable, unprotected and insecure.\u201d However, she warns against rushing into a meeting with an estranged sibling, pointing out that it is better to exchange photos, letters or messages on social media first. In my own case, she says: \u201cYou\u2019re old enough to forge your own adult relationship and to bridge the gap between him and your father. The onus is on the siblings who have grown up with both their parents to reach out to their half-siblings.\u201d Reunions aren\u2019t always straightforward, as the 2018 documentary Three Identical Strangers, about triplets separated at birth, tragically showed. Although the three brothers experienced a joyful reunion, followed by fame and success, they all struggled with mental health issues. One of the siblings, Eddy, took his own life in 1995. Meanwhile, plenty of people live their lives never knowing the whole story about their families or how many siblings they have. My meeting with Dec had raised questions for us both, and made me want to speak to other people who had experienced something similar. How had they found their long-lost siblings? Had they been able to reconcile their different upbringings and move beyond pondering what might have been? \u2018You don\u2019t realise you\u2019ve got space for another sibling. But when one turns up, it\u2019s great\u2019: Sandy Busek, 53, and Paul Busek, 51 Sandy, who lives in Petworth, West Sussex, was brought up in Carlisle by his grandparents. His father, Jan, disappeared shortly after he was born, and remarried twice, fathering a number of other children, including Paul. \u201cI wasn\u2019t close with my mum,\u201d Sandy says. \u201cShe was more like an aunt to me. As a kid, you feel a sense of abandonment. For about two and a half years from the age of 12, I was a carer for my grandmother when my grandfather was at work.\u201d When he was 18, Sandy visited Jan and his family in south Wales, to work out whether he should invite him to his wedding. It was during this visit that he discovered he had two younger siblings, Paul and Chantelle. But according to Paul, his parents told him that Sandy\u2019s visit \u2013 during which he was told to stay upstairs \u2013 had been to ask for money. Further attempts to talk to his parents about his half-brother were quickly shut down. This may explain why, when Sandy tried to make contact with Paul 15 years ago, his friend request on Facebook was rejected. Paul says he simply wasn\u2019t ready for another sibling, to share his father, or to grapple with his family\u2019s past. Two years later, when Sandy was 40, and he and his wife were expecting their first child, he made a fresh attempt to get to know his half-siblings, first making contact with Chantelle. \u201cWe met up in Ireland and got on well,\u201d Sandy says. Then, in 2018, when looking for other Buseks online, he happened to send a friend request to Lucy, Paul\u2019s daughter, not realising she was his niece. \u201cShe printed a photo of me from Facebook and shoved it under his nose,\u201d Sandy says. \u201cMy wife was gobsmacked,\u201d Paul recalls. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we look like twins, but we are very similar. I felt driven to meet him because we clearly shared DNA.\u201d In September 2018, Paul contacted Sandy on LinkedIn. They didn\u2019t waste any time: three weeks later, Sandy flew to Bahrain to meet Paul, who works for a defence company in Saudi Arabia. According to Paul, the half-brothers got along \u201clike a house on fire\u201d, and later he and his family visited Sandy in the UK. \u201cYou don\u2019t realise you\u2019ve got space for another sibling, but when one turns up it\u2019s like, \u2018OK, yeah, this is great\u2019,\u201d Paul says. They noticed a number of coincidences. Sandy is teetotal, and Paul rarely drinks. They both enjoy luxury cars and clay pigeon shooting. Both brothers are 6ft 1in, weigh 105kg, and wear near-identical spectacles. They also have a similar fashion sense; on the day they met for the first time, both were dressed in blue-and-white striped polo shirts. \u201cWe look so similar,\u201d Paul says. \u201cIncredibly similar bad taste, too.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s spooky how many similarities there are,\u201d Sandy agrees. \u201cBut there are differences, too: I was wrapped up in cotton wool by my grandparents, while he\u2019s more of an alpha male after 26 years in the military.\u201d Paul says: \u201cI think he\u2019s probably a nicer guy than me. He\u2019s a bit more placid, more level-headed, but that might be the different nurturing he had from his side: I lived with our old man, he didn\u2019t. He\u2019s starting to see a less polished side to me as I open up.\u201d Then he jokes: \u201cI think he gets insanely jealous that I\u2019m better-looking.\u201d Although Sandy wishes he had grown up closer to his parents and half-siblings, he remains pragmatic. \u201cI don\u2019t sit here thinking life could\u2019ve been so much better, but I have got some catching up to do.\u201d This will become easier now that Paul\u2019s family are planning a move from the Middle East to nearby Midhurst in West Sussex. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know that part of the country, but when we visited Sandy we thought, \u2018Bloody hell, we like it here\u2019,\u201d Paul says. \u201cWhenever I\u2019m back in the UK, my priority is to see my family and kids \u2013 and my brother.\u201d \u2018I knew there was something different. But I was told to lift the carpet and sweep it under\u2019: Dougie Lothian, 69, and Jo Fowler, 68 Dougie grew up in Edinburgh in the 1950s, and never felt a sense of belonging. He remembers his stepfather, who had his own children, being unkind to him and his sister, not allowing them to celebrate their birthdays. When Dougie discovered his real surname at the age of 11, after it was read out from his birth certificate during his communion, he began asking questions. \u201cBut I was always told to shut up.\u201d Then, one night, an aunt \u201cspilled the beans\u201d. He remembers learning that his mother had left his Irish father, Hugh, without explanation, in the early stages of her pregnancy with Dougie, not telling him she was bearing a child. \u201cAfter that, it was always on my mind,\u201d he says. \u201cI had known from a young age there was something different about me, but if I asked it was, \u2018lift the carpet, sweep it under\u2019.\u201d Dougie left home at 15 and moved to Ireland to work in construction in 1972. He didn\u2019t start looking for his family in earnest until 2009, when he was made redundant. With his daughter, Katrina, Dougie began to do his research. They learned that, after the war, Hugh had worked in coal mines in Derbyshire; Katrina tracked down his details from a list of workers from the period. \u201cI was rattling, shaking, thinking, \u2018What am I going to do now?\u2019\u201d Dougie says. By then, Hugh was seriously ill: he ignored their letters and denied the connection over the phone. Eventually he relented, asking if Katrina could send some pictures. Three months later, Hugh invited Dougie and his wife, Sally, to visit him in Derbyshire. Jo, Dougie\u2019s half-sister, remembers opening the door to them in September 2012: \u201cI looked at this poor, very nervous man who looked like he could have been my dad\u2019s brother and said: \u2018We couldn\u2019t disown you,\u2019\u201d she says now. \u201cHe was one of us, for sure.\u201d Dougie, who now lives in Kildare, south-west of Dublin, says he felt intense relief. \u201cI went, \u2018That\u2019s it: mission accomplished.\u2019 The first thing Jo told me was: \u2018The apple hasn\u2019t fallen far from the tree.\u2019\u201d Jo, who also lives in Ireland, had only found out about Dougie an hour before meeting him. \u201cI was in England on work business and went to visit my dad,\u201d she recalls. \u201cHe kept saying things like, \u2018Ach, some fella from Scotland wants to come and see me.\u2019 But just before he arrived, he said: \u2018He says I could be his father.\u2019\u201d Dougie never found out what sparked his mother\u2019s sudden flight. \u201cI never asked any awkward questions,\u201d he says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to go in bull-headedly. I set out to find him, and when I did, there was an ease there. There was no resentment.\u201d Dougie continued to speak to his father regularly on the phone and, after he died in November 2017, kept in contact with Jo, who lives three hours north of him in Donegal. Now their families spend holidays together. \u201cWe\u2019re brothers and sisters,\u201d he says. \u201cIt feels like we\u2019ve known each other for years, since birth. I couldn\u2019t ask for anything better.\u201d At family events, Dougie is often confused with his father. Five years ago, at a funeral, a cousin gasped in horror, thinking she had seen a ghost. Last summer, Jo arranged for Dougie and Sally to join her on a trip in their father\u2019s home county of Donegal, to scatter Hugh\u2019s ashes. Dougie did the honours: \u201cI broke down,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought I would never get to that stage. The whole trip brought me closer to my roots.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re really close now,\u201d Jo says. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely part of the family.\u201d The spare room is now known as Dougie and Sally\u2019s room, and they bought each other almost identical gifts for Christmas \u2013 shortbread biscuits in packaging featuring Highland terriers. \u201cIt\u2019s really bizarre, the connection we have.\u201d \u2018As an orphan, you fantasise about being in a family. Everything clicked\u2019: Peggy Mills, 60, and Linda Sturman, 62 Peggy\u2019s identity crisis began the moment she was born, in Brixton, south London, in 1959. Peggy is mixed race, but her mother and the man who thought he had fathered her were white. Her birth caused shockwaves, and her mother suddenly disappeared from her life when she was two weeks old. She also left behind Peggy\u2019s half-sister, Linda, with whom she shared a cot. Peggy was put into an orphanage, and moved around the UK by the authorities, eventually ending up in a foster home at the age of 13. \u201cGrowing up, I was always told I was Jamaican,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it was being an orphan that defined me. People would tell me I didn\u2019t have the nose to be African-Caribbean. I felt my whole life that I didn\u2019t belong. People had minimal expectations of me, and called me \u2018half-caste\u2019.\u201d She went on to suffer from dissociative disorders, and struggled with drug misuse, self-harm and bulimia. She met her husband, and had two daughters with him, but Peggy says he was abusive and she continued to struggle. \u201cEvery time something happened to my daughter, if she fell down or hurt herself, my subconscious returned to how I was never cuddled when I was younger.\u201d She remembers being in her early 30s and hearing a radio interview with John Cleese about Families And How To Survive Them, the bestselling self-help book he co-authored with therapist Robin Skynner in 1983. The interview referenced an experiment in which people who know nothing about each other have to decide who to pair up with for an activity. \u201cThe two people who have not grown up with their family always go together,\u201d Peggy says. \u201cI recognised myself in this: I have lots of friends, but I still keep myself slightly separated. I just started crying.\u201d Peggy decided she needed to track down her family. Years before, on her 18th birthday, the Church of England had given her a piece of paper with her parents\u2019 and siblings\u2019 names on. In 1998, with the help of the Salvation Army, she found her elder half-brother Jack, who had grown up with his father, and away from their shared mother. But she could not find Linda, nor her eldest half-sister, Angela, who had been adopted. After her marriage unravelled, Peggy moved with her girls to the US in 2002, where she felt more at home. In 2009, she received a message on the family history site Ancestry from Mark, the husband of a 51-year-old Linda Sturman, asking her to confirm her name and date of birth. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m Mark, and I think I\u2019m married to your sister.\u2019 I cried all weekend.\u201d The contact came after Linda\u2019s father had unexpectedly told his family about Peggy and Angela, over Sunday lunch, before his death. \u201cIt was a shock,\u201d Linda says. \u201cI said I needed to go home and process everything, and then I tried to find my sisters. I looked at the birth registrations in Brixton, and found them.\u201d Peggy describes their first meeting, over a meal in Twickenham, south-west London, as being \u201clike two pieces of a jigsaw coming together\u201d. Angela, now 63, and the eldest of the three sisters, was also there, thanks to Mark\u2019s detective work. She had been adopted as a child due to her parents\u2019 chaotic lives, and given another surname. She was living in Hastings, unaware that her family were looking for her. \u201cI\u2019d always thought I could be walking down the streets past my sister or my brother,\u201d Peggy says. \u201cBut this was for real, and we just fitted. There was none of the baggage other people have \u2013 no, \u2018You did this to me when we were 12\u2019.\u201d Peggy has stayed close to Linda. All four siblings meet up in Gorleston-on-Sea, where Linda lives, whenever Peggy is back in the UK. \u201cLinda and I both have mild depression,\u201d Peggy says. \u201cWe don\u2019t carry it around like a bad energy, but stuff happens that takes you back, and we\u2019ll give each other pep talks. We hold each other up.\u201d Linda also had a difficult upbringing: although she remained with her birth father, she never heard from her mother again. She says her father would often leave her in the care of friends while he was away working as a lorry driver. \u201cWe have a good bond,\u201d Linda says. \u201cI feel as if I\u2019ve known her for ever. We have different surnames, so it would have been impossible to find one another without modern technology.\u201d With the help of Mark, a keen amateur genealogist who trawled old newspapers and records to build a family tree, Peggy discovered that her father, Henwood Adrian, was actually from Guyana, and that she also has Congolese and Nigerian ancestry. \u201cIt has given me an identity and a sense of pride,\u201d Peggy says. \u201cBeing mixed race, people ask you: \u2018Where are you from?\u2019, \u2018What\u2019s your heritage?\u2019. It\u2019s nice not to have to lie or make something up.\u201d Peggy says it is only since meeting Linda, and the rest of her maternal family, that she has finally begun to overcome her pervading sense that she doesn\u2019t belong. \u201cIt\u2019s a gift that as an orphan you would fantasise about,\u201d Peggy says. \u201cYou dream about being in a family, as a unit. After I connected with them, it all clicked \u2013 I started to heal.\u201d",

This is Calla Wahlquist with the main stories on Saturday 11 April. Australian travellers to arrive home More than 1,200 Australians are expected to land at Melbourne\u2019s Tullamarine airport this weekend, with flights from Peru, India and Uruguay. The flight from Uruguay is bringing home passengers of the Antarctic cruise ship Greg Mortimer. Victoria\u2019s deputy chief health officer, Dr Annaliese van Diemen, said the Victorian and commonwealth governments had \u201creports that up to 70% of these patients have tested positive to Covid-19\u201d. Australia\u2019s deputy chief medical officer, Nick Coatsworth, said the \u201centire operation has been meticulously planned\u201d. The returning passengers will be medically screened, tested for Covid-19 if necessary, and transported by Victorian authorities to hotels to undergo 14 days of mandatory isolation. New Zealanders on the flight will board a second charter flight home. An emergency medical officer team will be on standby to assess all passengers as the international flights come in, and paramedics will also be on hand to take passengers to hospital if necessary. Australia\u2019s death toll rises to 56 The death toll in Australia has reached 56, with two more deaths \u2013 a 91-year-old woman in New South Wales, and a man in his 80s in Victoria \u2013 reported on Saturday. However, the daily case numbers have stabilised or fallen in Queensland, NSW and Victoria, the states with the largest number of cases from community transmission. Meanwhile the Tasmanian premier, Peter Gutwein, said authorities would \u201cring-fence\u201d health facilities in Burnie after an outbreak among health workers at the North West regional hospital spread to the North West private hospital. Healthcare workers, their households and any patient who was discharged from either facility from 27 March onwards has been asked to self-quarantine at their homes. \u201cRing-fencing is what we need to do, and ring-fencing is what we are going to do,\u201d Gutwein said. More closures due to crowds at Bondi The popular Bondi to Bronte coastal walk in Sydney has been closed by the local council, with fines for those who ignore newly erected barriers at entry points, because large crowds were continuing to visit the area despite orders to stay home. Bondi is a hotspot for Covid-19 and people have been advised to exercise elsewhere. \u201cUnfortunately, closing the coastal walk was the only way the council could help ensure that public health orders could be maintained along the walk,\u201d the Waverley mayor, Paula Masselos, said. \u201cI appreciate that this temporary closure will be met with frustration from some residents.

I encourage people to be a tourist in their own suburb and find places to exercise on other streets and parks.\u201d \u2018Nuanced approach\u2019 to lifting restrictions Coatsworth said Australia needed to take a \u201cnuanced\u201d approach to reducing the restrictions imposed to stop the spread of coronavirus. His comments came as experts warned against a quick reversal of restrictions. \u201cI think another way to put it might be that it was very fast into the restrictions and they were very widespread, and it needs to be very nuanced on the way out,\u201d Coatsworth said. \u201cSo you need to be very clear about if you\u2019re lifting a restriction, that you have done everything you can to try and understand exactly what the implications of that lifting would be before you actually implemented it.\u201d NRL says it could restart season \u2018tomorrow\u2019 The NRL has written permission to resume its season and has been specifically exempted from public health orders, meaning it could, if it chose, resume as planned on 28 May, the Australian Rugby League Commission chairman, Peter V\u2019landys, said. \u201cIn reality we could do it tomorrow if we wanted to, but we\u2019re not going to because we\u2019re going to let the infection rate continue its stabilisation,\u201d V\u2019landys told Nine newspapers. The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, who reportedly got a call from V\u2019landys on Friday reminding him of the league\u2019s apparent exemption from the public health orders, said the decision to resume the season would not be made by politicians. \u201cIt\u2019s a \u2018have a discussion with health authorities to see if it can be done safely\u2019 [scenario],\u201d he said.

      "body": "<p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/anne-tyler\">Anne Tyler</a>\u2019s UK tour for her latest novel became an early victim of the coronavirus, and her publisher announced that the 78-year-old would be conducting all media interviews by phone from the safety of her home in Baltimore, Tyler felt some relief, but mainly she felt guilt. She is one of the world\u2019s most acclaimed modern novelists, winner of both a Pulitzer (for <em>Breathing Lessons</em>, 1988) and the National Book Critics Circle award (for <em>The Accidental Tourist</em>, 1995, which was turned into an Oscar-winning film) and a finalist for the Man Booker (<em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/04/a-spool-of-blue-thread-anne-tyler-review\">A Spool of Blue Thread</a></em>, 2015) and the Women\u2019s prize for fiction (<em>Ladder of Years</em> from 1995, and <em>A Spool of Blue Thread</em>). But until 2012, she maintained a silence as assiduous as that of Thomas Pynchon or JD Salinger. She never liked \u2013 and still doesn\u2019t, but needs must in today\u2019s world \u2013 talking about how she does what she does, because that leads to self-consciousness, which is never good for creativity.</p> <p>So she was \u201ckind of relieved\u201d when the tour was cancelled. \u201cBut I remember I used to pray the school would burn down before a math test the next day. Yet if it had actually burned down I would have felt <em>so</em> guilty. So now I\u2019m thinking, \u2018Oh dear, be careful what you wish for!\u2019\u201d she says.</p> <p>Phone interviews are generally frustrating, a mess of missed connections and awkward interruptions. But Tyler has a manner that is as open and engaging as her prose, her conversation punctuated by charming anachronisms such as \u201cbestir\u201d and \u201calas\u201d, and it soon feels as if I know her as well as I know her brilliantly drawn characters. As I, too, am now working from home I start by apologising for the background noise of children and dogs. \u201cOh I love to hear children and dogs! That sounds good to me. I love normal life,\u201d she says.</p> <p>For the past half-century, Tyler has been the pre-eminent novelist of normal life. She is famously good at summing up a character in a precise line (\u201cShe had not grown fuller or softer with age. She was like certain supermarket vegetables that turn from green to withered without ever ripening\u201d \u2013 from <em>Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant</em>, 1982), but twice she tells me she is \u201cno good at plot, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed\u201d. It\u2019s true that no one would mistake aTyler novel for a John Grisham, but no one can match her evocation of the moments that build up a life: the awkward family meals, the day your spouse suddenly seems like a stranger, trying to make sense of how you have become the adult you are today, the conflicted gestures we make at trying to be good. \u201cTime passing is a plot. You can\u2019t not have something happen if the years go by,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5b84ebed63786a57def3726937a1794c436444fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b84ebed63786a57def3726937a1794c436444fd/0_0_320_499/320.jpg\" alt=\"Anne Tyler Redhead by the Side of the Road\" width=\"320\" height=\"499\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>As a child, Tyler\u2019s favourite book was the American classic <em>The Little House</em> by Virginia Lee Burton, about a house watching a city sprout up around it. Her fans \u2013 who have ranged from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/johnupdike\">John Updike</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jacquelinewilson\">Jacqueline Wilson</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/nickhornby\">Nick Hornby</a> \u2013 will recognise her memory of hoping the school would burn down as classic Tyler: her novels are studded with adult characters evoking childhood sensations, pleating time, revealing the truth of the adult through the child they were. In 2018\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/24/clock-dance-anne-tyler-review\">Clock Dance</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/24/clock-dance-anne-tyler-review\">,</a> a widow compares recovering from grief to \u201crainy days in her childhood when she would resign herself to staying in, reading or watching daytime TV, and then in the afternoon the sun would break through unexpectedly and she would think, Oh. I guess I can go outside now. Isn\u2019t that \u2026 a good thing, I guess.\u201d In <em>The Accidental Tourist</em>, Macon Leary empathetically imagines his young son Ethan\u2019s last moments before he was killed in a violent crime: \u201cmeekly moving to the kitchen with the others, placing his hands flat against the wall as he was ordered and no doubt bouncing slightly on the balls of his feet\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m more in touch with my emotions and the visceral sensory from childhood than any other part of life. I don\u2019t know if it helps with creativity, but I do know that when I talk to other writers they talk about their childhood in great detail,\u201d Tyler says. (She also still has residues of that childlike belief that one can make something happen by thinking about it. Just as she used to worry she would cause the school to burn down through wishing it, when I ask how she could bear to write the scene of Ethan\u2019s murder in <em>The Accidental Tourist</em>, she says she deliberately made him younger than her two daughters were then, \u201cso I wouldn\u2019t think as they came up to that age, \u2018Oh no, what have I set in motion?\u2019\u201d)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I am very comfortable writing as a man, and I think that\u2019s because I had really good men in my life</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Her new novel, <em>Redhead by the Side of the Road</em>, her 23rd, features many of the usual Tyler tropes. Its protagonist, Micah, is a man, as so many of Tyler\u2019s greatest characters are, which is partly why she has so many male fans. Writing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/13/why-men-love-anne-tyler-novels\">in this paper</a> in 2012, Mark Lawson put her cross-gender appeal down to the way \u201cshe deals sympathetically and redemptively with male fecklessness and helplessness\u201d. Tyler grew up with three brothers and was happily married for 34 years to Taghi Mohammad Modarressi, an Iranian psychiatrist, until his death in 1997. \u201cI am very comfortable writing as a man, and I think that\u2019s because I had really good men in my life. They made me feel comfortable and I thought, \u2018OK, they\u2019re not so different from me,\u2019\u201d she says.</p> <p>Like many of Tyler\u2019s male characters \u2013 Ian in <em>Saint Maybe</em>, Barnaby in <em>A Patchwork Planet</em>, Jesse in <em>Breathing Lessons</em>, Ezra in <em>Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant</em> \u2013 Micah has let his life drift past him after a youthful regret. Like Macon in <em>The Accidental Tourist</em>, he tries to counter the loss of control over his life by adhering to self-coined rules about when he cleans the kitchen, how he makes the bed, how he drives. \u201cMicah\u201d even sounds like \u201cMacon\u201d, but when I ask Tyler if the echo was deliberate she says no. \u201cBut I do often have fantasies about my characters ending up in the same little part of town and running into one another, so I can picture Micah and Macon doing that.\u201d</p> <p>Like all of Tyler\u2019s characters, Micah lives in Baltimore, as Tyler herself has done for more than 50 years. She has said that she\u2019s a writer so she can live out different lives, but it seems that whatever life she imagines, she always wants to live in Baltimore. \u201cYes, that\u2019s probably true. It\u2019s a city with character, but it is also laziness on my part \u2013 by setting the book here I don\u2019t have to do much research,\u201d she says with easy self-deprecation. I cannot let that pass: her books are full of meticulous research, such as the accurate period details in her decades-spanning family sagas, <em>The Amateur Marriage</em> and <em>A Spool of Blue Thread</em>. She meticulously writes her books out in longhand multiple times, and then reads them into a recorder and listens back to make sure the dialogue suits each character and there are no clangers. The idea that Tyler defaults to anything in her books out of laziness is nonsense \u2013 she just loves her city.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s true, I do love it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, it was a total accident that I came to the city, it was just for my husband\u2019s job. For the first two years we were saying, \u2018We made a mistake, let\u2019s go back.\u2019 But then you sink in, little by little.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike her other novels, <em>Redhead </em><em>by the Side of the Road</em> features multiple references to current events. Micah avoids watching the news because it\u2019s too \u201cdepressing\u201d, but he can\u2019t block out the \u201cunspeakably sad\u201d bulletins from his clock radio: \u201ca mass shooting in a synagogue; whole families are dying in Yemen; immigrant children torn from their parents will never, ever be the same, even if by some unlikely chance they are reunited tomorrow.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/02/redhead-by-the-side-of-the-road-by-anne-tyler-review-quietly-profound\">Redhead by the Side of the Road by Anne Tyler review \u2013 quietly profound</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI was writing the book already by the time Trump was in office and all that was going on. So I consciously felt it would be immoral to pretend life was just la la la. I don\u2019t want to be one of those people who ties their novel to current events so it\u2019s practically out of a newspaper, but at the same time I felt I should mention that it is an unhappy time,\u201d she says. Her books often end optimistically, showing human kindness. But is she having trouble maintaining that optimism about humanity in the current political climate? She hesitates for a second. \u201cNot up close, if you know what I mean. Up close you\u2019ll always see things to be optimistic about.\u201d</p> <p>Tyler grew up in Quaker communities around the south and midwest, the eldest of four children. She did not attend mainstream school until she was 11, and a common theme in her books is a character looking at the \u201cnormal\u201d world and trying to understand how it works, such as Micah feeling bewildered by the happy couples he sees on his morning jogs, or Aaron flummoxed by marriage in <em>The Beginner\u2019s Goodbye</em>: \u201cIt seemed we just never quite got the hang of being a couple the way other people did. We should have taken lessons or something; that\u2019s what I tell myself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne of the first things that happened when I joined the school was I was surrounded by these girls and they were asking me all these questions. One said, \u2018Do you have a boyfriend?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m only 11.\u2019 And she said, \u2018I know, do you have a boyfriend?\u2019 And I thought, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m in another world here.\u2019 It was very tough to figure out, and I remember it very clearly,\u201d Tyler says. While at university, she started to write short stories, and then published her first novel, <em>The Tin Can Tree,</em> when she was 23. Aside from a five-year break to raise her daughters, she has written steadily ever since.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was a better writer when I was younger. I took more time. It\u2019s not as if I\u2019m in a rush now, but I trust the reader more</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI know the world does not need another book from me, but I have nothing else to do with myself. I have no hobbies. So then I feel guilty when I say to my agent, \u2018I seem to have another book ready if you want to take a look at it \u2026\u2019\u201d she says. Her ideal day would involve several hours of \u201cgood involved writing, the kind when you suddenly look up and three hours have gone by\u201d.</p> <p>While liking Tyler\u2019s books is as uncontroversial as liking chocolate, there have been some criticisms over the years, some more fair than others. Those who dismiss her as sentimental (\u201cour foremost NutraSweet novelist\u201d, one American critic wrote) overlook the biting humour in her work. \u201cRepetitive\u201d is more merited, although the familiar plots are shells for her elegant writing and characterisation, which are never boring. Yet I\u2019ve found some of her more recent novels less satisfying than her mid-career peak of <em>Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant</em>, <em>The Accidental Tourist</em> and <em>Breathing Lessons</em>. The New York Times\u2019 former book critic Michiko Kakutani <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/06/books/the-beginners-goodbye-by-anne-tyler.html\">put it more strongly</a> in 2012 when she complained that instead of the \u201cintimate knowledge of her characters\u2019 inner lives\u201d we get in Tyler\u2019s earlier books, the characters in <em>The Beginner\u2019s Goodbye</em> are \u201cirritating stick figures\u201d.</p> <p>But Tyler is her own best critic. She recently reread <em>The Accidental Tourist</em> for the first time in many years. \u201cAnd one of the things I thought was, \u2018I think I was a better writer when I was younger.\u2019\u201d What made her think that? \u201cI was more detailed, I took more time. It\u2019s not as if I\u2019m in a rush now, but I trust the reader more. I don\u2019t feel like I have to say that much about the character\u2019s inner feelings. But then as I read <em>The Accidental Tourist</em> I thought, \u2018Well, it\u2019s kind of nice to see all of Macon\u2019s inner feelings there.\u2019\u201d Aptly for a writer who always sees the best in her characters, Tyler\u2019s mistake was perhaps trusting some of her readers too much.</p> <p>Her daughters live in Philadelphia and San Francisco, and Tyler knows she has a tendency towards self-isolation, whether there\u2019s a global pandemic or not, \u201cand I don\u2019t think that\u2019s always healthy\u201d. So \u201cto bring the world into me\u201d, she has \u2013 when life is normal \u2013 regular nights at her home with friends, including a weekly friendship group she calls \u201cWine Therapy\u201d. She is already working on her next book, \u201cand once again, it\u2019s about a family and set in Baltimore\u201d, she says in a tone of pure self-mockery. Then with the grace that comes from a lifetime of self-knowledge, sinking in little by little, she adds, \u201cAnd I love all that.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Redhead by the Side of the Road</em> is published by Chatto.</p></li> </ul>",

Her fans \u2013 who have ranged from John Updike to Jacqueline Wilson to Nick Hornby \u2013 will recognise her memory of hoping the school would burn down as classic Tyler: her novels are studded with adult characters evoking childhood sensations, pleating time, revealing the truth of the adult through the child they were. In 2018\u2019s Clock Dance, a widow compares recovering from grief to \u201crainy days in her childhood when she would resign herself to staying in, reading or watching daytime TV, and then in the afternoon the sun would break through unexpectedly and she would think, Oh. I guess I can go outside now. Isn\u2019t that \u2026 a good thing, I guess.\u201d In The Accidental Tourist, Macon Leary empathetically imagines his young son Ethan\u2019s last moments before he was killed in a violent crime: \u201cmeekly moving to the kitchen with the others, placing his hands flat against the wall as he was ordered and no doubt bouncing slightly on the balls of his feet\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m more in touch with my emotions and the visceral sensory from childhood than any other part of life. I don\u2019t know if it helps with creativity, but I do know that when I talk to other writers they talk about their childhood in great detail,\u201d Tyler says. (She also still has residues of that childlike belief that one can make something happen by thinking about it. Just as she used to worry she would cause the school to burn down through wishing it, when I ask how she could bear to write the scene of Ethan\u2019s murder in The Accidental Tourist, she says she deliberately made him younger than her two daughters were then, \u201cso I wouldn\u2019t think as they came up to that age, \u2018Oh no, what have I set in motion?\u2019\u201d) Her new novel, Redhead by the Side of the Road, her 23rd, features many of the usual Tyler tropes. Its protagonist, Micah, is a man, as so many of Tyler\u2019s greatest characters are, which is partly why she has so many male fans. Writing in this paper in 2012, Mark Lawson put her cross-gender appeal down to the way \u201cshe deals sympathetically and redemptively with male fecklessness and helplessness\u201d. Tyler grew up with three brothers and was happily married for 34 years to Taghi Mohammad Modarressi, an Iranian psychiatrist, until his death in 1997. \u201cI am very comfortable writing as a man, and I think that\u2019s because I had really good men in my life. They made me feel comfortable and I thought, \u2018OK, they\u2019re not so different from me,\u2019\u201d she says. Like many of Tyler\u2019s male characters \u2013 Ian in Saint Maybe, Barnaby in A Patchwork Planet, Jesse in Breathing Lessons, Ezra in Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant \u2013 Micah has let his life drift past him after a youthful regret. Like Macon in The Accidental Tourist, he tries to counter the loss of control over his life by adhering to self-coined rules about when he cleans the kitchen, how he makes the bed, how he drives. \u201cMicah\u201d even sounds like \u201cMacon\u201d, but when I ask Tyler if the echo was deliberate she says no. \u201cBut I do often have fantasies about my characters ending up in the same little part of town and running into one another, so I can picture Micah and Macon doing that.\u201d Like all of Tyler\u2019s characters, Micah lives in Baltimore, as Tyler herself has done for more than 50 years. She has said that she\u2019s a writer so she can live out different lives, but it seems that whatever life she imagines, she always wants to live in Baltimore. \u201cYes, that\u2019s probably true. It\u2019s a city with character, but it is also laziness on my part \u2013 by setting the book here I don\u2019t have to do much research,\u201d she says with easy self-deprecation. I cannot let that pass: her books are full of meticulous research, such as the accurate period details in her decades-spanning family sagas, The Amateur Marriage and A Spool of Blue Thread. She meticulously writes her books out in longhand multiple times, and then reads them into a recorder and listens back to make sure the dialogue suits each character and there are no clangers. The idea that Tyler defaults to anything in her books out of laziness is nonsense \u2013 she just loves her city. \u201cIt\u2019s true, I do love it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, it was a total accident that I came to the city, it was just for my husband\u2019s job. For the first two years we were saying, \u2018We made a mistake, let\u2019s go back.\u2019 But then you sink in, little by little.\u201d Unlike her other novels, Redhead by the Side of the Road features multiple references to current events. Micah avoids watching the news because it\u2019s too \u201cdepressing\u201d, but he can\u2019t block out the \u201cunspeakably sad\u201d bulletins from his clock radio: \u201ca mass shooting in a synagogue; whole families are dying in Yemen; immigrant children torn from their parents will never, ever be the same, even if by some unlikely chance they are reunited tomorrow.\u201d \u201cI was writing the book already by the time Trump was in office and all that was going on. So I consciously felt it would be immoral to pretend life was just la la la. I don\u2019t want to be one of those people who ties their novel to current events so it\u2019s practically out of a newspaper, but at the same time I felt I should mention that it is an unhappy time,\u201d she says. Her books often end optimistically, showing human kindness. But is she having trouble maintaining that optimism about humanity in the current political climate? She hesitates for a second. \u201cNot up close, if you know what I mean. Up close you\u2019ll always see things to be optimistic about.\u201d Tyler grew up in Quaker communities around the south and midwest, the eldest of four children. She did not attend mainstream school until she was 11, and a common theme in her books is a character looking at the \u201cnormal\u201d world and trying to understand how it works, such as Micah feeling bewildered by the happy couples he sees on his morning jogs, or Aaron flummoxed by marriage in The Beginner\u2019s Goodbye: \u201cIt seemed we just never quite got the hang of being a couple the way other people did. We should have taken lessons or something; that\u2019s what I tell myself.\u201d \u201cOne of the first things that happened when I joined the school was I was surrounded by these girls and they were asking me all these questions. One said, \u2018Do you have a boyfriend?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m only 11.\u2019 And she said, \u2018I know, do you have a boyfriend?\u2019 And I thought, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m in another world here.\u2019 It was very tough to figure out, and I remember it very clearly,\u201d Tyler says. While at university, she started to write short stories, and then published her first novel, The Tin Can Tree, when she was 23. Aside from a five-year break to raise her daughters, she has written steadily ever since. \u201cI know the world does not need another book from me, but I have nothing else to do with myself. I have no hobbies. So then I feel guilty when I say to my agent, \u2018I seem to have another book ready if you want to take a look at it \u2026\u2019\u201d she says. Her ideal day would involve several hours of \u201cgood involved writing, the kind when you suddenly look up and three hours have gone by\u201d. While liking Tyler\u2019s books is as uncontroversial as liking chocolate, there have been some criticisms over the years, some more fair than others. Those who dismiss her as sentimental (\u201cour foremost NutraSweet novelist\u201d, one American critic wrote) overlook the biting humour in her work. \u201cRepetitive\u201d is more merited, although the familiar plots are shells for her elegant writing and characterisation, which are never boring. Yet I\u2019ve found some of her more recent novels less satisfying than her mid-career peak of Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant, The Accidental Tourist and Breathing Lessons. The New York Times\u2019 former book critic Michiko Kakutani put it more strongly in 2012 when she complained that instead of the \u201cintimate knowledge of her characters\u2019 inner lives\u201d we get in Tyler\u2019s earlier books, the characters in The Beginner\u2019s Goodbye are \u201cirritating stick figures\u201d. But Tyler is her own best critic. She recently reread The Accidental Tourist for the first time in many years. \u201cAnd one of the things I thought was, \u2018I think I was a better writer when I was younger.\u2019\u201d What made her think that? \u201cI was more detailed, I took more time. It\u2019s not as if I\u2019m in a rush now, but I trust the reader more. I don\u2019t feel like I have to say that much about the character\u2019s inner feelings. But then as I read The Accidental Tourist I thought, \u2018Well, it\u2019s kind of nice to see all of Macon\u2019s inner feelings there.\u2019\u201d Aptly for a writer who always sees the best in her characters, Tyler\u2019s mistake was perhaps trusting some of her readers too much. Her daughters live in Philadelphia and San Francisco, and Tyler knows she has a tendency towards self-isolation, whether there\u2019s a global pandemic or not, \u201cand I don\u2019t think that\u2019s always healthy\u201d. So \u201cto bring the world into me\u201d, she has \u2013 when life is normal \u2013 regular nights at her home with friends, including a weekly friendship group she calls \u201cWine Therapy\u201d. She is already working on her next book, \u201cand once again, it\u2019s about a family and set in Baltimore\u201d, she says in a tone of pure self-mockery. Then with the grace that comes from a lifetime of self-knowledge, sinking in little by little, she adds, \u201cAnd I love all that.\u201d Redhead by the Side of the Road is published by Chatto.",

Without this baseline infrastructure, the policy of test, trace and treat could not have been sustained or expanded to the degree that it has. Likewise, effective leadership cannot achieve much if it lacks a well-oiled public service system that can deliver.</p> \n<p>Take South Korea\u2019s biggest international airport, Incheon. As a publicly managed airport, it is <a href=\"https://www.worldairportawards.com/worlds-top-10-airports-2019/\">consistently ranked</a> among the best in the world. Likewise, the Seoul metro system is world renowned for its cheap fares and efficiency, making it one of the <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/world-best-metro-systems/index.html\">top five</a> underground systems. By far the most impressive aspect is South Korea\u2019s single-payer healthcare system which was ranked the first among OECD countries in 2015. Although hospitals in Korea are mostly privately run, 97% of the Korean population is covered by the compulsory national health insurance scheme. This balance between privatised hospitals and public insurance system has ensured universal accessibility and ample resources, proving its effectiveness in the coronavirus crisis.</p> \n<p>How did South Korea achieve this? Unlike in western Europe after the second world war, establishing a welfare system was not the priority of the dictatorships that ruled the country. Like many developing nations in Asia, the emphasis was on industrialisation and economic growth. At the same time, the dictatorship invested heavily in public infrastructure, viewing it as indispensable to Korea\u2019s growing industries. In <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/heapol/article/24/1/63/598886\">1977</a>, the country\u2019s first national health insurance system was introduced, although this was nothing like the comprehensive healthcare of today.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Citizens became increasingly emboldened in their relationship with the state, forcing governments to take their wellbeing seriously</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The restoration of democracy in 1987 did not change this state-led economic model and infrastructure management. What changed, however, was the attitude of the people. The toppling of the military dictatorship in 1987 was the result of a series of nationwide protests. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, South Korea saw numerous mass civil protests against a wide range of issues, from the import of US beef to government mismanagement of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/27/south-korea-chung-hong-won-resigns-ferry-sinking\">ferry accident</a> in 2014. The apex of this mass mobilisation were the demonstrations against the previous president, Park Geun-hye. The protests continued from October 2016 to March 2017. On 3 December 2016, an estimated <a href=\"http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20161203000136\">2.3 million people</a> took to the streets, almost 4% of the entire population. These subsequently led to Park\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/12/half-a-million-south-koreans-celebrate-impeaching-of-president-park-geun-hye\">impeachment</a> and imprisonment.</p> \n<p>Korean politics since the 1990s can thus be characterised as a period during which citizens became increasingly emboldened in their relationship with the state, forcing governments to take their wellbeing seriously. One area that this has been the most conspicuous is in public transportation, energy and healthcare. For the average person, these are everyday services that all citizens have the right to enjoy, and which are paid for by taxpayers\u2019 money. To put it in more utilitarian terms, they are the most tangible barometers with which to judge the government\u2019s commitment to its citizens. Failure to improve their qualities and manage them properly almost always leads to a loss of votes for the ruling party in upcoming elections.</p> \n<p>This sensitivity to public services and responsiveness to hold government accountable has been the spur behind the improvement of South Korea\u2019s public services for the past 20 years. It also makes privatisation difficult to accept. Not only does it go against the ingrained sense of communal entitlement but also, seeing that services have improved under government, many question the logic of selling them to private companies.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"15ba1c07-a175-467d-89ed-756d44480b14\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kRNt8LQRWl4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The irony is that for many years, Koreans believed that having world-class public services was equivalent to becoming more democratic and thus more western. Many were unaware of the widespread privatisation and outsourcing of public services that was taking place in the west at the same time. The coronavirus crisis plunging Europe into chaos has shattered this idealised image. As far as Koreans are concerned, this has been a vindication of a supposed \u201cKorean model\u201d which they have fought for over many years. It is unlikely that it will go away anytime soon.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Tae Hoon Kim is a South Korean geopolitical and economic analyst based in Stockholm, Sweden</p>",

Likewise, effective leadership cannot achieve much if it lacks a well-oiled public service system that can deliver. Take South Korea\u2019s biggest international airport, Incheon. As a publicly managed airport, it is consistently ranked among the best in the world. Likewise, the Seoul metro system is world renowned for its cheap fares and efficiency, making it one of the top five underground systems. By far the most impressive aspect is South Korea\u2019s single-payer healthcare system which was ranked the first among OECD countries in 2015. Although hospitals in Korea are mostly privately run, 97% of the Korean population is covered by the compulsory national health insurance scheme. This balance between privatised hospitals and public insurance system has ensured universal accessibility and ample resources, proving its effectiveness in the coronavirus crisis. How did South Korea achieve this? Unlike in western Europe after the second world war, establishing a welfare system was not the priority of the dictatorships that ruled the country. Like many developing nations in Asia, the emphasis was on industrialisation and economic growth. At the same time, the dictatorship invested heavily in public infrastructure, viewing it as indispensable to Korea\u2019s growing industries. In 1977, the country\u2019s first national health insurance system was introduced, although this was nothing like the comprehensive healthcare of today. The restoration of democracy in 1987 did not change this state-led economic model and infrastructure management. What changed, however, was the attitude of the people. The toppling of the military dictatorship in 1987 was the result of a series of nationwide protests. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, South Korea saw numerous mass civil protests against a wide range of issues, from the import of US beef to government mismanagement of a ferry accident in 2014. The apex of this mass mobilisation were the demonstrations against the previous president, Park Geun-hye. The protests continued from October 2016 to March 2017. On 3 December 2016, an estimated 2.3 million people took to the streets, almost 4% of the entire population. These subsequently led to Park\u2019s impeachment and imprisonment. Korean politics since the 1990s can thus be characterised as a period during which citizens became increasingly emboldened in their relationship with the state, forcing governments to take their wellbeing seriously. One area that this has been the most conspicuous is in public transportation, energy and healthcare. For the average person, these are everyday services that all citizens have the right to enjoy, and which are paid for by taxpayers\u2019 money. To put it in more utilitarian terms, they are the most tangible barometers with which to judge the government\u2019s commitment to its citizens. Failure to improve their qualities and manage them properly almost always leads to a loss of votes for the ruling party in upcoming elections. This sensitivity to public services and responsiveness to hold government accountable has been the spur behind the improvement of South Korea\u2019s public services for the past 20 years. It also makes privatisation difficult to accept. Not only does it go against the ingrained sense of communal entitlement but also, seeing that services have improved under government, many question the logic of selling them to private companies. The irony is that for many years, Koreans believed that having world-class public services was equivalent to becoming more democratic and thus more western. Many were unaware of the widespread privatisation and outsourcing of public services that was taking place in the west at the same time. The coronavirus crisis plunging Europe into chaos has shattered this idealised image. As far as Koreans are concerned, this has been a vindication of a supposed \u201cKorean model\u201d which they have fought for over many years. It is unlikely that it will go away anytime soon. \u2022 Tae Hoon Kim is a South Korean geopolitical and economic analyst based in Stockholm, Sweden",

      "body": "<p>Last month, as the reality of life under lockdown began to sink in, I asked my family if they had any particular concerns. Without hesitation, my eldest, who is 16, asked: \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you normal?\u201d This was day one of no school, and she was right. I wasn\u2019t normal; nothing about this situation was normal. I really struggled to find any sort of equilibrium for a long time. What helped us was implementing a \u201csubmarine\u201d routine, whereby the day is strictly portioned up, as it is in the locked-down conditions of the submariner, starting with a 7am reveille on weekdays. And in among the fear, panic and worry (most of my family is in Italy, and my mother, like so many elderly parents, thinks the rules don\u2019t apply to her) there have come pockets of calm, new normality and even small shards of joy. But still, the questions haven\u2019t stopped. These are the three that readers have been asking me the most over the last few weeks.</p> <h2>How can I hold space for my own worries regarding Covid-19 without it affecting my children? Is it possible to avoid lying to them that everything is fine, and let them know that I\u2019m worried, without overwhelming them?</h2> <p>It\u2019s a huge task. I think we have to accept it is going to affect them, but we can try to control how much. In these extreme times, we\u2019re going to get a lot of things wrong as parents. When you are stretched emotionally, it\u2019s hard to be even \u201cgood enough\u201d at times. This is a huge learning curve in acceptance: of ourselves, others, the situation.</p> <p>Child and adolescent psychotherapist Rachel Melville-Thomas (<a href=\"https://childpsychotherapy.org.uk/\" title=\"\">childpsychotherapy.org.uk</a>) explained to me that we need to recreate the \u201c\u2018pegs\u2019, the natural markers that children have in their usual life, such as getting to school, having break time, eating lunch, talking to friends. We all need, especially now, a predictable cadence to the day, and by dividing it up into a routine, we also help reduce anxiety.\u201d Broken down into chunks of time, life seems less overwhelming. This, in turn, will give you pockets of respite.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Don\u2019t dismiss children\u2019s concerns with, \u2018Don\u2019t be silly\u2019 or \u2018Don\u2019t worry.\u2019 That doesn\u2019t work</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Routines are formulaic, but bring predictability, and, crucially, you don\u2019t have to feel guilty for saying: \u201cAsk me that at lunchtime.\u201d I know that if I don\u2019t \u201chold space\u201d, as therapists call it, it can affect the emotional wellbeing of the whole family. No one can be constantly interrupted without going mad.</p> <p>Melville-Thomas explained that even young children can get into the new pattern of the day and will learn to keep (some) questions to specific times; after all, they do this at school.</p> <p>As to how not to overwhelm them, Melville-Thomas said, \u201cDon\u2019t dismiss their concerns with, \u2018Don\u2019t be silly\u2019 or \u2018Don\u2019t worry.\u2019 That doesn\u2019t work. \u2018Tell me more\u2019 is a great question to ask children, as is \u2018Tell me what you know.\u2019\u201d It also buys you thinking time.</p> <p>\u201cVery young children don\u2019t need to know more than \u2018There\u2019s a very bad flu going round that makes people quite sick, so we\u2019re doing our bit to stop it spreading by not going out and by washing our hands,\u2019\u201d she added. Always remember the golden rule with children: listen to the question and answer just the question asked, factually, calmly and age-appropriately. It\u2019s OK to say you don\u2019t know. You don\u2019t have to have the answer to everything: no one does at the moment.</p> <p>Older children and teenagers will be able to see or hear the news, but they might hide their worries. Melville-Thomas recommended asking them, \u201cHow are your friends dealing with this at the moment?\u201d Coming at it via a third person may open up a bigger conversation.</p> <p>\u201cWhatever restrictions you had on their phones and social media before, keep them,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd we all react more badly to news at night so, ideally, no screens in their bedrooms.\u201d Everyone needs a news break. But I would also stress that children won\u2019t have the usual emotional support of their school friends, so encourage phone/video calls if they want them.</p> <h2>How do I approach talking to my parents about what to do if the worst happens?</h2> <p>It\u2019s never easy to talk about serious illness and death, but we must remember that talking about it doesn\u2019t mean it will happen. If it does, knowing what a loved one wanted will bring you focus and peace.</p> <p>Kathryn Mannix, a palliative care doctor and author of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/drkathrynmannix\" title=\"\">With</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/drkathrynmannix\" title=\"\">The End</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/drkathrynmannix\" title=\"\">In Mind: How To Live And Die Well</a>, said, \u201cHaving these conversations is less upsetting than not having them and then finding you needed to.\u201d She suggested that one way in may be to talk about it as something that will affect all of you, not just elderly family members. Do this either on the phone or a family Skype session. \u201cYou can say, \u2018We need to talk about this for, say, 20 minutes, then we can talk about something else.\u2019 But approach it by saying, \u2018If any of us were to die, or get seriously ill, what do we want?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Things to think about, Mannix said, include: \u201cIf I can\u2019t have the funeral that I would like, what should my family do as a form of commemoration once such things are allowed?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Make sure family members can use a smartphone/Skype and have a tablet and charger to use if they have to go to hospital</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The last conversations that Mannix sees on deathbeds come down to three messages: I love you, I\u2019m sorry, or thank you. So if there are people you want to say these things to, do that now. I know this is quite scary, but as Mannix says, \u201cWhen we are dealing with people at the end of their lives, the messages [they give to those left behind] are so important for people to carry into their grief and bereavement.\u201d</p> <p>Another thing to talk about is what to do if any of us become very seriously ill. Mannix explained: \u201cTo decide whether a ventilator is the right treatment, intensive-care practitioners will look at a person\u2019s ability to recover. They may ask loved ones if the patient would agree to be on a ventilator; if they would want to be saved even if the quality of life [afterwards] is not one that they would value. The doctor needs to make a medical decision partly based on what\u2019s possible but, because we won\u2019t be well enough to discuss it, our families need to know what matters most to us.\u201d</p> <p>On a practical level, make sure family members know how to use a smartphone/Skype and have a tablet, charger and cables (all name-labelled) to use if they have to go to hospital. You may not be able to visit in person, and if you want to stay in touch, there may not be enough tech in wards to go round.</p> <p>None of this is easy, Mannix admitted, but it may open the door to an important conversation we have all avoided until now.</p> <p>The bereavement charity Cruse (<a href=\"http://cruse.org.uk/\" title=\"\">cruse.org.uk</a>) is a great resource if people are bereaved, and has lots of useful, Covid-19-specific information online.</p> <h2>We live in a small house. How can we all rub along together for the next however many weeks? We\u2019re spending way more time together than usual and clashing over parenting styles.</h2> <p>A routine, as detailed in my first answer, is really important. You may even have to implement a bathroom rota for ablutions. What we have to remember, says family and couples therapist Chris Mills, is that \u201ccaptivity is not natural for us. So if we are reactive or stroppy, it\u2019s the tensions created by being forced together. We\u2019re designed to nest together and come together, but also to have freedom of movement and interaction with others.\u201d</p> <p>Mills recommends looking for \u201cways of keeping a distance, of having headspace\u201d from other members of the family (I can\u2019t stress enough how important boundaries are in these enforced conditions). Consider either taking your state-approved daily exercise separately if you can, or having time apart in different areas. Under strain, we can become highly volatile, and may explode over things we would previously have laughed at or brushed aside. Even talking about this, and acknowledging it, can help (saying sorry also really matters).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/03/how-can-i-shift-some-of-mental-load-of-family-life-on-to-my-husband\">How can I shift some of the mental load of family life on to my husband?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Another useful thing to try, advised Mills, is, if possible, to ask \u201cwhat each family member wants to achieve that day\u201d. This allows some flexibility within a routine, and takes into account daily moods and rhythms. Some days, for example, your partner may feel more able to take on responsibilities than you; on those days, maybe you can negotiate more \u201cyou\u201d time.</p> <p>As for differing parenting styles, Mills advises, \u201cIn this situation, nobody\u2019s good or bad. It\u2019s not about one person winning or losing, but you do have to find a way \u2013 at least while on lockdown \u2013 of provisionally agreeing so that there\u2019s a system in place to get through this. It\u2019s about being pragmatic, not philosophical.\u201d</p> <p>You both have to recognise that, really, you just have to get the job done, whatever that job is: the children learning, or eating. We don\u2019t have the luxury of pontificating over parenting styles at the moment.</p>",

You don\u2019t have to have the answer to everything: no one does at the moment. Older children and teenagers will be able to see or hear the news, but they might hide their worries. Melville-Thomas recommended asking them, \u201cHow are your friends dealing with this at the moment?\u201d Coming at it via a third person may open up a bigger conversation. \u201cWhatever restrictions you had on their phones and social media before, keep them,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd we all react more badly to news at night so, ideally, no screens in their bedrooms.\u201d Everyone needs a news break. But I would also stress that children won\u2019t have the usual emotional support of their school friends, so encourage phone/video calls if they want them. How do I approach talking to my parents about what to do if the worst happens? It\u2019s never easy to talk about serious illness and death, but we must remember that talking about it doesn\u2019t mean it will happen. If it does, knowing what a loved one wanted will bring you focus and peace. Kathryn Mannix, a palliative care doctor and author of With The End In Mind: How To Live And Die Well, said, \u201cHaving these conversations is less upsetting than not having them and then finding you needed to.\u201d She suggested that one way in may be to talk about it as something that will affect all of you, not just elderly family members. Do this either on the phone or a family Skype session. \u201cYou can say, \u2018We need to talk about this for, say, 20 minutes, then we can talk about something else.\u2019 But approach it by saying, \u2018If any of us were to die, or get seriously ill, what do we want?\u2019\u201d Things to think about, Mannix said, include: \u201cIf I can\u2019t have the funeral that I would like, what should my family do as a form of commemoration once such things are allowed?\u201d The last conversations that Mannix sees on deathbeds come down to three messages: I love you, I\u2019m sorry, or thank you. So if there are people you want to say these things to, do that now. I know this is quite scary, but as Mannix says, \u201cWhen we are dealing with people at the end of their lives, the messages [they give to those left behind] are so important for people to carry into their grief and bereavement.\u201d Another thing to talk about is what to do if any of us become very seriously ill. Mannix explained: \u201cTo decide whether a ventilator is the right treatment, intensive-care practitioners will look at a person\u2019s ability to recover. They may ask loved ones if the patient would agree to be on a ventilator; if they would want to be saved even if the quality of life [afterwards] is not one that they would value. The doctor needs to make a medical decision partly based on what\u2019s possible but, because we won\u2019t be well enough to discuss it, our families need to know what matters most to us.\u201d On a practical level, make sure family members know how to use a smartphone/Skype and have a tablet, charger and cables (all name-labelled) to use if they have to go to hospital. You may not be able to visit in person, and if you want to stay in touch, there may not be enough tech in wards to go round. None of this is easy, Mannix admitted, but it may open the door to an important conversation we have all avoided until now. The bereavement charity Cruse (cruse.org.uk) is a great resource if people are bereaved, and has lots of useful, Covid-19-specific information online. We live in a small house. How can we all rub along together for the next however many weeks? We\u2019re spending way more time together than usual and clashing over parenting styles. A routine, as detailed in my first answer, is really important. You may even have to implement a bathroom rota for ablutions. What we have to remember, says family and couples therapist Chris Mills, is that \u201ccaptivity is not natural for us. So if we are reactive or stroppy, it\u2019s the tensions created by being forced together. We\u2019re designed to nest together and come together, but also to have freedom of movement and interaction with others.\u201d Mills recommends looking for \u201cways of keeping a distance, of having headspace\u201d from other members of the family (I can\u2019t stress enough how important boundaries are in these enforced conditions). Consider either taking your state-approved daily exercise separately if you can, or having time apart in different areas. Under strain, we can become highly volatile, and may explode over things we would previously have laughed at or brushed aside. Even talking about this, and acknowledging it, can help (saying sorry also really matters). Another useful thing to try, advised Mills, is, if possible, to ask \u201cwhat each family member wants to achieve that day\u201d. This allows some flexibility within a routine, and takes into account daily moods and rhythms. Some days, for example, your partner may feel more able to take on responsibilities than you; on those days, maybe you can negotiate more \u201cyou\u201d time. As for differing parenting styles, Mills advises, \u201cIn this situation, nobody\u2019s good or bad. It\u2019s not about one person winning or losing, but you do have to find a way \u2013 at least while on lockdown \u2013 of provisionally agreeing so that there\u2019s a system in place to get through this. It\u2019s about being pragmatic, not philosophical.\u201d You both have to recognise that, really, you just have to get the job done, whatever that job is: the children learning, or eating. We don\u2019t have the luxury of pontificating over parenting styles at the moment.",

I\u2019ve learned to be patient with the process and to enjoy the mistakes.\u201d Clay planters, imprinted with the shapes of leaves or flowers, and pots are produced on the wheel in small batches. Natural imperfections \u2013 random wobbles, the drip of a fugitive glaze \u2013 are encouraged. \u201cWe take a studio approach to the work, which makes it different from mass-produced garden pots.\u201d The scheme is co-founded with Create London, an organisation that works with artists on projects that benefit local communities through charities, social enterprise and cultural spaces. \u201cI think that supporting young people to learn practical skills and work together is pretty much the most important thing I can think of right now,\u201d says Hadrian Garrard, chief executive of Create. \u201cThere\u2019s an amazing spirit of collective endeavour at the pottery.\u201d Hoxton Gardenware already has commissions \u2013 for the British Council\u2019s new HQ in Stratford and the conservatory at the Barbican. Plans for pots to go on sale in local shops and at Broadway Market have been put on hold, like pretty much all of life during the coronavirus pandemic. But existing and online orders are being delivered. \u201cWe hope that by arranging contact-free delivery and collection we can help people get on with their gardening at home during this strange spring,\u201d says Angell. \u201cThat\u2019s a nice transfer from the work of people making pots to something that can entertain people at home.\u201d As Garrard points out, the pots do more than please their new owners. \u201cOur priority is to get some money into the hands of the young people who have been working on the project and to support the pottery at this really uncertain time. We have to keep going where we can because we all want to look forward to the future with hope and positivity. There\u2019s nothing quite as hopeful as a young plant growing in a beautiful new pot on a sunny day, is there?\u201d",

It\u2019s not supposed to be states\u2019 stockpiles that they then use.\u201d Whittington replied: \u201cThe national stockpiles are designed precisely in order to make them available to those who need them in moments of crisis. The attitude of this administration, and certainly Jared Kushner\u2019s particular remarks on this, are pretty surprising and ultimately not very helpful.\u201d \u2018Lip service to federalism\u2019 The story of the United States is a long one. Elasticity is built into the system. Looking ahead, everyone sees something different. \u201cI\u2019d be surprised if what we\u2019re seeing now results in a substantial permanent change in the relationship between the states and the federal government,\u201d Whittington said. Super said a drainage of power from the states, if it comes to that, would produce a more empowered federal government. \u201cThe old argument against so-called big government is that states could do it,\u201d Super said. \u201cWe\u2019re here proving that they can\u2019t. \u201cWe\u2019re also proving that whatever people once believed about the importance of states, they don\u2019t believe it any more, and that federal politicians will pay lip service to federalism but show states no respect at all when it matters the most.\u201d In Mitchell\u2019s view, other leaders of the conservative movement are unlike Trump, because they see practical value in shared economic prosperity and shared defense, and because they believe in the story that winds it all together: the story of America. \u201cThey seem to be concerned enough that the United States of America survive in some form, whereas I don\u2019t really get that sense with Trump,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s goal is to keep him and the six people he cares about rich and out of jail. There\u2019s nothing really beyond that that\u2019s motivating him in a bigger picture. \u201cThat\u2019s not a good foundation on which to build a functioning country, let alone a functioning democracy.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>If anyone was destined to make our current situation more bearable, it\u2019s Thundercat. Not only has the bass-playing, kitten ear-wearing, genre-blurring musician just released a new album \u2013 let\u2019s call it a self-isolation soundtrack. But, having worked with the likes of Snoop Dogg, Childish Gambino, Pharrell Williams and Erykah Badu, he has enough entertaining stories to last a lockdown.</p> <p>Such as the time he met <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/prince\">Prince</a> at one of the late star\u2019s infamous house parties. \u201cI was drunk, dancing, and he walks up and he\u2019s got them platform sandals, and he\u2019s got his shirt all shiny and stuff. And he goes: \u2018That\u2019s not how you do the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/dec/26/guardianobituaries.usa\">James Brown</a> [shuffle].\u2019 And then he promptly did the James Brown in sandals, but I think he had just had hip surgery. So I think he may have moved a little too quick.\u201d Or when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/jonimitchell\">Joni Mitchell</a> mocked him when she saw his leg tattoo of his bass hero, Jaco Pastorius. \u201cThey were close friends and played together. She said to me: \u2018Man, I loved him too, but I wouldn\u2019t get him inked on me.\u2019 And everybody laughed.\u201d</p> <p>We meet in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in mid-March, when things have already started seeming strange. \u201cIt feels like the opening scene in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4UcGhaS42A\" title=\"\">The Big Lebowski</a>, tumbleweed blowing down the street,\u201d says the 35-year-old, real name Stephen Bruner. Just like any other pre-show interview, we are sitting in a hotel restaurant. Except this time there is no show. A theatre looms opposite, its neon sign unlit, the words \u201cpostponed\u201d glaring out front. Everything is closed. A week previously, Brad Pitt had been spotted at Bruner\u2019s LA gig \u2013 \u201cit was pretty wild,\u201d he concurs. But now: tumbleweed. As with so many musicians this spring, the rest of his tour has been cancelled.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ormQQG2UhtQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ormQQG2UhtQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>And yet, Bruner seems unfazed by the global pandemic taking place outside, or the fact he is about to release a fourth album in the middle of it. \u201cI think I\u2019ve just accepted that everything is terrible,\u201d he says. This lockdown is \u201cwhat has to happen because our president\u2019s a jackass. He let the coronavirus in. He just <em>let it</em> <em>in</em>. And probably had the intention to let it in just enough so he could get to [save the day and] stay president. Backfire!\u201d</p> <p>That attitude might sound a little nonchalant, but this has become a bit of a running theme. His new album is titled It Is What It Is, as if serving as a shrug of acquiescence at how unexpected and vicious life can be, after a few unusual years. In 2017, his screwball, falsetto-funk album <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4xGQDKDHBI&amp;list=OLAK5uy_k210B4ojZQpxfcgQI_6gLYcecIPKGCe8c\">Drunk</a>, a 26-track joyride through subjects as disparate as police brutality and being friend-zoned, had taken him to a much wider audience. It featured stars such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktuQhDLYic&amp;list=OLAK5uy_k210B4ojZQpxfcgQI_6gLYcecIPKGCe8c&amp;index=22\">Pharrell</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV8HYokDWeE&amp;list=OLAK5uy_k210B4ojZQpxfcgQI_6gLYcecIPKGCe8c&amp;index=10\">Kendrick Lamar</a> and Mac Miller, appeared in best album lists everywhere and made genre hilariously irrelevant as he took out big, fat, fluorescent marker pens and liberally daubed over jazz-funk fusion, cosmic soul, prog, R&amp;B and lurid comedy skits like a 21st-century <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/13/fank-zappa-hot-rats-album-music-anniversary\">Frank Zappa</a>.</p> <p>Until then, Bruner had been best known for being the oddball bass player who contributed to Lamar\u2019s seminal <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJe0rcvkpRg&amp;list=PLFvR2bZRQluxdZmyfSj5mW5mvNmtvt6Un&amp;index=2\">To Pimp </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJe0rcvkpRg&amp;list=PLFvR2bZRQluxdZmyfSj5mW5mvNmtvt6Un&amp;index=2\">a Butterfly</a> \u2013 winning a Grammy for the track <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw6Y5h_cLN4&amp;list=PLFvR2bZRQluxdZmyfSj5mW5mvNmtvt6Un&amp;index=5\">These Walls</a> \u2013 as well as nimble noodling on childhood pal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/kamasi-washington\">Kamasi Washington</a>\u2019s acclaimed jazz album <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQRBzSN9Vw&amp;list=OLAK5uy_kjCOsQy9suACJkg5RBls_0ZOfzpT6Tovc\">The Epic</a>, various releases by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/flying-lotus\">Flying Lotus</a> (his longtime co-producer), including their soundtrack for Donald Glover\u2019s hit TV show Atlanta, and on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/aug/02/mac-miller-swimming-review\">Mac Miller\u2019s 2018 album Swimming</a>. After Drunk\u2019s success, Bruner puts it casually, he felt \u201clike I woke up in a different place\u201d. He is now an eccentric visionary as likely to appear on the cover of experimental music magazine The Wire as he is to perform on primetime American chat show Jimmy Kimmel or have his songs covered by Ariana Grande.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c7ac32e5cc82e9d260e43a2f366e8f9398733655\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7ac32e5cc82e9d260e43a2f366e8f9398733655/0_417_3840_4800/800.jpg\" alt=\"Thundercat performing at FYF Fest, 2017.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thundercat performing at FYF Fest, 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rich Fury/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet despite this upward trajectory, the lows have been tough to take. Bruner struck up a close friendship with Mac Miller \u2013 you can see their doe-eyed bromance in their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrR_gm6RqCo\" title=\"\">Tiny Desk concert video</a> in August 2018. But it was the last performance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/09/mac-miller-obituary\">Miller would do</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/09/mac-miller-obituary\">: a month later he </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/09/mac-miller-obituary\">died, aged 26</a>, from an accidental overdose. Bruner spoke to him the night before; in the morning, he was gone. \u201cIt scared the shit out of me,\u201d says Bruner. Did he know Mac was in trouble? \u201cI mean, <em>we</em> were in trouble,\u201d he says, twirling one of his thin, bleached dreadlocks, \u201cbut you don\u2019t realise it all the time. It\u2019s sex, drugs and rock\u2019n\u2019roll. It\u2019s real. You ride the line, you don\u2019t know how close you are sometimes. Do I think he meant to die? No, I don\u2019t think he did. Even though that sometimes creeps in there because you\u2019re always on the edge of a knife. Sometimes you mess up. That happens a lot.\u201d</p> <p>Miller\u2019s death made Bruner confront some hard truths about his own lifestyle. \u201cI\u2019ve been drinking forever,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s such a part of me. I was always that guy who\u2019s missing one of his shoes, covered in blood.\u201d He knew something had to change. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do the same things I\u2019d done before,\u201d he says. \u201cWitnessing my best friend pass away under such dark pretenses \u2026 I\u2019ve done that already. I watched it happen to Austin Peralta,\u201d the late musician about which much of 2013\u2019s Apocalypse was written. \u201cI was posed with this moment where it was like: either it\u2019s your turn to go or you walk the other way. That\u2019s what it felt like. You\u2019re gonna stop or you\u2019re gonna die.\u201d</p> <p>He got depressed, and then he got dumped, just before he was about to propose. \u201cMy best friend died and then the person I was in love with left me within the same couple of months,\u201d he says. \u201cIn my mind, I was right on the verge of getting married. And it broke my heart.\u201d After that, Bruner brought in some radical self-care measures. He stopped drinking, took up boxing and started being smarter about food. He\u2019s not sure whether he\u2019ll give up alcohol for good yet but adds: \u201cI just go with how I feel, and how I feel is that that part of my life has stopped. I am a different person right now.\u201d</p> <p>Bruner is a little more designer these days, with Gucci in place of the Native American headdresses and kneepads he used to wear. He is more philosophical in person than his George Clinton-rivalling style suggests, though that doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t tweet about \u201cbeating the meat\u201d. His new album reflects this duality. Building on the squelchy hot mess of Drunk, It Is What It Is combines bananas interludes with songs about heartbreak, loss and, to quote one song title, \u201cexistential dread\u201d. Fair Chance, featuring rappers Ty Dolla $ign and Lil B, is a stunning tribute to Miller, Bruner\u2019s lambent bass sounding like rippling streams underneath. Unrequited Love pulls no punches about loneliness. The lyrics are as scrapbook-specific as they are funny: on Dragonball Durag, he sings to a potential lover: \u201cI may be covered in cat hair but I still smell good.\u201d</p> <p>Bruner says that these tossed-off thoughts help him to live in the moment and face hard truths, just like the work of his comedian friends, of which he has many. (One, standup Zack Fox, appears as a pilot on his new track Overseas.) Music and comedy, says Bruner, \u201care the places where you have to be most honest. The reason we love guys like Dave Chappelle and Jim Carrey is because they bare their soul. The better you are at that, the better you are at what you do. It\u2019s the same principle with music, especially with jazz: you\u2019re putting yourself out there.\u201d</p> <p>Bruner\u2019s own forays into furiously fast frettage with his brother Ronald Jr and friends such as Kamasi Washington helped lay the groundwork for LA\u2019s recent jazz renaissance. But Bruner was unconcerned by the genre\u2019s rigid rules: he also liked Slipknot and spent his high school years playing in thrash-punk band Suicidal Tendencies with his brother; he doesn\u2019t see \u201cseparation\u201d between scenes. </p> <p>Bruner\u2019s music frequently steamrolls over notions of taste. To some, the feathery soft-rock sounds of the 1970s often dubbed \u201cyacht rock\u201d denote all kinds of uncool; yet, on Drunk, he teamed up with Kenny Loggins and Michael McDonald and it made perfect sense. He\u2019s also keen to continue to respect legacy. New single Black Squalls brings together 64-year-old Steve Arrington of 70s funk band Slave and 21-year-old the Internet guitarist Steve Lacy (Childish Gambino hops on the final verse). Bruner says that many young musicians don\u2019t know where the music they\u2019re making came from, so it\u2019s \u201cimportant to show that connectivity\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9069c6cd71a2a665f575e69913b04860afee6858\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9069c6cd71a2a665f575e69913b04860afee6858/0_0_3500_2334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thundercat\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pika performance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos G/The1point8</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Black Qualls also defines \u201cwhat it means to be a young black artist right now,\u201d says Bruner, such as feeling paranoid, even guilty, about one\u2019s success, and \u201cwanting to hide your ability, just to be OK\u201d. He started delving into deeper subject matter after working on To Pimp a Butterfly. \u201cIt became like: what else do you have to say?\u201d says Bruner. \u201cI would walk into sessions,\u201d where Lamar would be giving \u201chis take on what he just saw and what he experienced emotionally. It was breathtaking. And I\u2019d be like: I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to do with this.

      "bodyText": "If anyone was destined to make our current situation more bearable, it\u2019s Thundercat. Not only has the bass-playing, kitten ear-wearing, genre-blurring musician just released a new album \u2013 let\u2019s call it a self-isolation soundtrack. But, having worked with the likes of Snoop Dogg, Childish Gambino, Pharrell Williams and Erykah Badu, he has enough entertaining stories to last a lockdown. Such as the time he met Prince at one of the late star\u2019s infamous house parties. \u201cI was drunk, dancing, and he walks up and he\u2019s got them platform sandals, and he\u2019s got his shirt all shiny and stuff. And he goes: \u2018That\u2019s not how you do the James Brown [shuffle].\u2019 And then he promptly did the James Brown in sandals, but I think he had just had hip surgery. So I think he may have moved a little too quick.\u201d Or when Joni Mitchell mocked him when she saw his leg tattoo of his bass hero, Jaco Pastorius. \u201cThey were close friends and played together. She said to me: \u2018Man, I loved him too, but I wouldn\u2019t get him inked on me.\u2019 And everybody laughed.\u201d We meet in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in mid-March, when things have already started seeming strange. \u201cIt feels like the opening scene in The Big Lebowski, tumbleweed blowing down the street,\u201d says the 35-year-old, real name Stephen Bruner. Just like any other pre-show interview, we are sitting in a hotel restaurant. Except this time there is no show. A theatre looms opposite, its neon sign unlit, the words \u201cpostponed\u201d glaring out front. Everything is closed. A week previously, Brad Pitt had been spotted at Bruner\u2019s LA gig \u2013 \u201cit was pretty wild,\u201d he concurs. But now: tumbleweed. As with so many musicians this spring, the rest of his tour has been cancelled. And yet, Bruner seems unfazed by the global pandemic taking place outside, or the fact he is about to release a fourth album in the middle of it. \u201cI think I\u2019ve just accepted that everything is terrible,\u201d he says. This lockdown is \u201cwhat has to happen because our president\u2019s a jackass. He let the coronavirus in. He just let it in. And probably had the intention to let it in just enough so he could get to [save the day and] stay president. Backfire!\u201d That attitude might sound a little nonchalant, but this has become a bit of a running theme. His new album is titled It Is What It Is, as if serving as a shrug of acquiescence at how unexpected and vicious life can be, after a few unusual years. In 2017, his screwball, falsetto-funk album Drunk, a 26-track joyride through subjects as disparate as police brutality and being friend-zoned, had taken him to a much wider audience. It featured stars such as Pharrell, Kendrick Lamar and Mac Miller, appeared in best album lists everywhere and made genre hilariously irrelevant as he took out big, fat, fluorescent marker pens and liberally daubed over jazz-funk fusion, cosmic soul, prog, R&amp;B and lurid comedy skits like a 21st-century Frank Zappa. Until then, Bruner had been best known for being the oddball bass player who contributed to Lamar\u2019s seminal To Pimp a Butterfly \u2013 winning a Grammy for the track These Walls \u2013 as well as nimble noodling on childhood pal Kamasi Washington\u2019s acclaimed jazz album The Epic, various releases by Flying Lotus (his longtime co-producer), including their soundtrack for Donald Glover\u2019s hit TV show Atlanta, and on Mac Miller\u2019s 2018 album Swimming. After Drunk\u2019s success, Bruner puts it casually, he felt \u201clike I woke up in a different place\u201d. He is now an eccentric visionary as likely to appear on the cover of experimental music magazine The Wire as he is to perform on primetime American chat show Jimmy Kimmel or have his songs covered by Ariana Grande. Yet despite this upward trajectory, the lows have been tough to take. Bruner struck up a close friendship with Mac Miller \u2013 you can see their doe-eyed bromance in their Tiny Desk concert video in August 2018. But it was the last performance Miller would do: a month later he died, aged 26, from an accidental overdose. Bruner spoke to him the night before; in the morning, he was gone. \u201cIt scared the shit out of me,\u201d says Bruner. Did he know Mac was in trouble? \u201cI mean, we were in trouble,\u201d he says, twirling one of his thin, bleached dreadlocks, \u201cbut you don\u2019t realise it all the time. It\u2019s sex, drugs and rock\u2019n\u2019roll. It\u2019s real. You ride the line, you don\u2019t know how close you are sometimes. Do I think he meant to die? No, I don\u2019t think he did. Even though that sometimes creeps in there because you\u2019re always on the edge of a knife. Sometimes you mess up. That happens a lot.\u201d Miller\u2019s death made Bruner confront some hard truths about his own lifestyle. \u201cI\u2019ve been drinking forever,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s such a part of me. I was always that guy who\u2019s missing one of his shoes, covered in blood.\u201d He knew something had to change. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do the same things I\u2019d done before,\u201d he says. \u201cWitnessing my best friend pass away under such dark pretenses \u2026 I\u2019ve done that already. I watched it happen to Austin Peralta,\u201d the late musician about which much of 2013\u2019s Apocalypse was written. \u201cI was posed with this moment where it was like: either it\u2019s your turn to go or you walk the other way. That\u2019s what it felt like. You\u2019re gonna stop or you\u2019re gonna die.\u201d He got depressed, and then he got dumped, just before he was about to propose. \u201cMy best friend died and then the person I was in love with left me within the same couple of months,\u201d he says. \u201cIn my mind, I was right on the verge of getting married. And it broke my heart.\u201d After that, Bruner brought in some radical self-care measures. He stopped drinking, took up boxing and started being smarter about food. He\u2019s not sure whether he\u2019ll give up alcohol for good yet but adds: \u201cI just go with how I feel, and how I feel is that that part of my life has stopped. I am a different person right now.\u201d Bruner is a little more designer these days, with Gucci in place of the Native American headdresses and kneepads he used to wear. He is more philosophical in person than his George Clinton-rivalling style suggests, though that doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t tweet about \u201cbeating the meat\u201d. His new album reflects this duality. Building on the squelchy hot mess of Drunk, It Is What It Is combines bananas interludes with songs about heartbreak, loss and, to quote one song title, \u201cexistential dread\u201d. Fair Chance, featuring rappers Ty Dolla $ign and Lil B, is a stunning tribute to Miller, Bruner\u2019s lambent bass sounding like rippling streams underneath. Unrequited Love pulls no punches about loneliness. The lyrics are as scrapbook-specific as they are funny: on Dragonball Durag, he sings to a potential lover: \u201cI may be covered in cat hair but I still smell good.\u201d Bruner says that these tossed-off thoughts help him to live in the moment and face hard truths, just like the work of his comedian friends, of which he has many. (One, standup Zack Fox, appears as a pilot on his new track Overseas.) Music and comedy, says Bruner, \u201care the places where you have to be most honest. The reason we love guys like Dave Chappelle and Jim Carrey is because they bare their soul. The better you are at that, the better you are at what you do. It\u2019s the same principle with music, especially with jazz: you\u2019re putting yourself out there.\u201d Bruner\u2019s own forays into furiously fast frettage with his brother Ronald Jr and friends such as Kamasi Washington helped lay the groundwork for LA\u2019s recent jazz renaissance. But Bruner was unconcerned by the genre\u2019s rigid rules: he also liked Slipknot and spent his high school years playing in thrash-punk band Suicidal Tendencies with his brother; he doesn\u2019t see \u201cseparation\u201d between scenes. Bruner\u2019s music frequently steamrolls over notions of taste. To some, the feathery soft-rock sounds of the 1970s often dubbed \u201cyacht rock\u201d denote all kinds of uncool; yet, on Drunk, he teamed up with Kenny Loggins and Michael McDonald and it made perfect sense. He\u2019s also keen to continue to respect legacy. New single Black Squalls brings together 64-year-old Steve Arrington of 70s funk band Slave and 21-year-old the Internet guitarist Steve Lacy (Childish Gambino hops on the final verse). Bruner says that many young musicians don\u2019t know where the music they\u2019re making came from, so it\u2019s \u201cimportant to show that connectivity\u201d. Black Qualls also defines \u201cwhat it means to be a young black artist right now,\u201d says Bruner, such as feeling paranoid, even guilty, about one\u2019s success, and \u201cwanting to hide your ability, just to be OK\u201d. He started delving into deeper subject matter after working on To Pimp a Butterfly. \u201cIt became like: what else do you have to say?\u201d says Bruner. \u201cI would walk into sessions,\u201d where Lamar would be giving \u201chis take on what he just saw and what he experienced emotionally. It was breathtaking. And I\u2019d be like: I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to do with this. Other than that take it and realise that there is so much more that I have to keep pushing the point on.\u201d With its refrain of \u201cno more living in fear\u201d, the track feels eerily prescient. Bruner says the message is open to interpretation \u201cdepending on where you\u2019re coming from \u2013 but because of where I come from, it is damn near literal\u201d. In the lyrics he sings: \u201cWanna post this on the Gram, but don\u2019t think I should.\u201d (At the start of this year, rapper Pop Smoke was murdered in a robbery at his house after posting on Instagram, while in March 2019, Nipsey Hussle was shot dead in a parking lot.) \u201cIt\u2019s an unfortunate reality we live in when it comes to stuff like that,\u201d says Bruner. The unfortunate reality that we are also living in is that, after this interview concludes, self-isolation is on the cards. But Bruner remains unperturbed: he writes most of his music alone anyway, he says, and enjoys spending time with his cat, Tron. \u201cShe still pees on everything. It reminds me to stay feral.\u201d He\u2019s not worried about what happens next. \u201cI\u2019m about as worried as I\u2019ve been since I was five,\u201d he says. \u201cI used to be infatuated with nuclear war. I remember realising then the power that man has over man in general \u2013 what we\u2019re capable of doing to each other terrified me. After that, I just accepted it. We just do arbitrary, stupid shit to each other.\u201d He references the cartoon meme of a smiling dog sitting in a burning house and telling himself: \u201cThis is fine.\u201d \u201cThe moments that I thought I was gonna die, I was just like, this is fine. This makes sense. It really freaks my friends out because whenever you can see something happening, I calm down. It\u2019s just what it is.\u201d It Is What It Is is out now",

resume play</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The <strong>NRL</strong> plans to conduct regular temperature checks and employ strict handwashing protocols when (if) games resume in May.</p> \n  <p>The ARL commission\u2019s chairman, <strong>Peter V\u2019landys,</strong> has also insisted the NRL has been given the go-ahead from government authorities to resume next month. </p> \n  <p>Here\u2019s the AAP report: </p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p><em>NRL players will have their temperatures taken before they can go on to the field, and it will be checked at least three times on game day.</em></p> \n   <p><em>The NRL will implement strict biosecurity measures on the return to training next month, before the competition\u2019s planned resumption on 28 May.</em></p> \n   <p><em>Central to that will be the heath of its players. </em></p> \n   <p><em>The NRL must ensure it has minimised any risk to players, and guidelines off the field will be well beyond the government\u2019s public health measures.</em></p> \n   <p><em>Players can stay at home ... but could be asked to move if they live in a virus hotspot.</em></p> \n   <p><em>They will also be asked to self-isolate in the same manner that was floated before the competition was suspended. </em></p> \n   <p><em>\u201cThey can stay at home,\u201d V\u2019landys said.</em></p> \n   <p><em>\u201cAnd as long as we have some pretty strict biosecurity measures ... we are pretty confident the risk will be extremely minimal.</em></p> \n   <p><em>\u201cEach player\u2019s temperature could be taken at least three times while they are in...our venues, they will have to wash their hands (and) they will have to undertake other biosecurity measures.\u201d</em></p> \n   <p><em>V\u2019landys has also managed to keep racing on the track during the virus in his role as chief executive of Racing NSW.</em></p> \n   <p><em>Rugby league\u2019s measures had already been discussed by the NRL after the opening two rounds, and would have come into place last month had the competition not been suspended.</em></p> \n   <p><em>V\u2019landys insisted the game had been given official permission to resume next month from government authorities.</em></p> \n   <p><em>It had also been in constant contact with the NSW premier\u2019s office, as well as the sports department.</em></p> \n   <p><em>A meeting between the NRL and broadcasters this week will give a clearer recommendation on season structure, before Wayne Pearce\u2019s Apollo committee reconvenes on Friday.</em></p> \n   <p><em>Pearce has already confirmed to AAP that a number of contingency plans will be put in place in case games are postponed due to a contamination.</em></p> \n   <p><em>But after watching Australia\u2019s curve begin to flatten, V\u2019landys is increasingly confident that would not be an issue and any question marks over the return will be erased.</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p

Before I go, here is what you need to know of the day\u2019s developments: South Australia has recorded only one new case, and nearly half of those who contracted Covid-19 in the state have now recovered. Numbers of new confirmed cases have either stabilised or fallen in Queensland, NSW and Victoria, despite more testing being conducted. The ACT recorded no new cases. Two more deaths have been recorded, taking the national toll to 56. A 91-year-old woman died in NSW, and a man in his 80s died in Victoria. In Tasmania, there is particular concern about an outbreak in the north-west, particularly in two hospitals. The Tasmanian government is adopting new measures to stop the outbreak spreading. The NRL insists it has been given the green light by the government to resume matches next month. It says it will adopt regular temperature testing and hand-washing protocols for safety. The Bondi to Bronte walk, one of Sydney\u2019s most popular, has been closed after walkers continued to ignore advice on social distancing. Helicopters patrolled the walk today and barriers and barricades were erected. In Uruguay, 112 Australians and New Zealanders who were aboard the Antarctic cruise ship Greg Mortimer, which has been anchored off the coast of South America for 14 days after a coronavirus outbreak on board, are being allowed to dock and disembark. Australian and New Zealand citizens will be allowed to fly home on a special chartered medical flight. The Australian government has announced $100m in funding this week to help charities provide emergency relief during the coronavirus downturn. Although the Western Australian government has warned they will close beaches if physical distancing requirements are not adhered to, so far they remain open to the public. It\u2019s just as well, as Perth residents sweltered through a 39.5C day, the hottest April day ever. You can read more here: A group of Australians required to quarantine in the Rydges hotel in Brisbane have banded together to create this video. \u201cOn the bus ride to the hotel, we created a WhatsApp group. Lots of good chat going on and a few fun projects to pass the time,\u201d wrote Jeff Osborne on Instagram. As mentioned earlier, the popular Bondi to Bronte walk was closed after walkers continued to ignore the advice on social distancing. Helicopters were patrolling the walk today and barriers and barricades were being erected. But, while Australia closes its paths, other cities have been opening new ones, giving over now empty roads to pedestrians. This allows those on their daily walk more space to social distance. Laura Laker has the full report here: The ABC reporter Emilia Terzon tweeted this unconventional, but still delightful, retirement home birthday celebration. SA Health says that only one person has tested positive to Covid-19 in the past day. Nearly half of the state\u2019s 429 cases have now been cleared of the disease. Seven remain in hospital, four in a critical condition. As mentioned earlier on the blog, the NRL insists it\u2019s been given the green light by government to resume matches next month. But today the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said she had not approved a return. If you are keen to learn more you can read the full report here: Cruise companies have been among the hardest hit in the Covid-19 crisis. Virtually every operator has had to suspend business and stories of stranded passengers across the world have plagued them in recent weeks. Not to mention the new \u201cfloating Petri dish\u201d association. Wealth correspondent Rupert Neate has this report on the challenges this industry now faces. This is just one of many interesting interactions police have had with the public over the Easter weekend. Federal Labor says the $100m package the government announced to assist charities through the Covid-19 crisis does not go far enough. Here is some of what the shadow assistant minister for treasury and charities, Andrew Leigh, said in a press conference today: Today\u2019s package is [a] $100m announcement for food relief charities, emergency services providers and financial counselling. $16m of this was announced a fortnight ago and is being re-announced today. Labor welcomes the support being provided to the sector, but we have to keep it in perspective. This is a significant sector, so the $100m package announced today is less than 1/1000th of the size of the charity sector. Labor calls on the government to ensure that charities that are providing early childhood services, charities providing disability support are able to stay afloat in these troubling times. There are charities right now missing out on jobkeeper. We call on Josh Frydenberg to use his personal authority under the legislation to allow those significant charities to be brought back in. West Australian businesses are pessimistic about the chances of a post-coronavirus economic rebound, with most expecting conditions to worsen in 2021. This report via AAP: A joint survey by WA Super and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry WA released on Saturday highlights fears the economic toll will stretch well beyond current efforts to suppress the deadly coronavirus in Australia. Business confidence has plunged to a three-year low, with 86 per cent of surveyed WA firms expecting conditions to persist or worsen in the short term. Three in five WA businesses expect the state economy to continue to worsen in 2021. State and federal stimulus measures have provided some relief but many businesses are struggling to access finance. WA Super chief executive Fabian Ross says businesses must adopt long-term thinking to get through the significant disruption. \u201cIt is my view that we will get through this crisis, and knowing how resourceful WA people are, we will see new opportunities and innovations arise,\u201d he said. The state government last month unveiled a $1 billion relief package aimed at households and small businesses, including reduced electricity bills, payroll tax relief and waived licence fees. The arrangements will be in place until September 30 when they will be reviewed ahead of the state budget, which has been deferred to October 8. I\u2019m going to hand over to reporter Matilda Boseley now, who will take you through the rest of the evening. Thanks for sticking with me today. Police in NSW and Queensland have just released new information about their Covid-19 related crackdowns. In Queensland, police have issued 462 fines worth $616,308. In NSW, police have charged 10 people and issued 50 infringement notices since their last update yesterday. Police have issued 38 court attendance notices and 295 infringement notices since 17 March. The new enforcement in NSW includes: Fining a man $1,000 for sitting on a garden bed in Ultimo, Sydney without a reasonable excuse. Charging an 18-year-old man who \u201cclaimed to have no knowledge of Covid-19\u201d in Sydney\u2019s west. The man was allegedly breaching a domestic violence order. He has been charged with family violence offences and failing to comply with a public health direction. Fining a man $1,000 after being called to conduct a welfare check on him. The man was noticed wandering around on the road \u201crambling incoherently\u201d in Banora Point. Police said he was in breach of his bail conditions and was \u201cunable to provide a reasonable explanation for being away from his home\u201d. Police said he was warned previously and had stolen goods on him. Fining a man $1,000 for attending Albury police station and telling officers he wanted to \u201chang out\u201d. He was seen outside the station twice later that day, despite being told to go home, police said. The NRL saga continues. A bit earlier today, the NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, suggested the NRL would need to talk to NSW Health before resuming play next month, as it intends to do. But the ARLC chair, Peter V\u2019landys, has again insisted that the NRL has all the clearances it needs from NSW already. V\u2019landys has told AAP that he had checked with state authorities about whether the NRL was covered by an exemption to public health orders issued on 31 March. The government had told him it was. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a letter from the coordinator confirming that we can train and play,\u201d V\u2019landys told AAP. \u201cSo I could dot the \u2018I\u2019s and cross the \u2018T\u2019s; I got a separate letter off the department which is the State Emergency Operations Centre that is implementing the health order. \u201cAnd it says it does not preclude the NRL from commencing the competition. It says in the absence of crowds at relevant stadiums.\u201d From AAP: Qantas has hit back at union suggestions the airline is not adequately supporting its cabin crews who are ferrying stranded Australians home from overseas during the coronavirus crisis. The ACTU says Qantas flight crews are concerned about insufficient health protections and leave entitlements should they be exposed, fall ill or are required to self-isolate. But a spokesman for Qantas said the airline had fully complied with the requirements of Australia\u2019s chief medical officer in relation to the quarantine exemptions for air crew. It rejected the ACTU\u2019s claim that if a cabin crew member fell sick because of the virus, the airline would not cover the cost of a hotel should the individual elect to stay in one for their 14-day quarantine. The airline is operating the federal government\u2019s rescue flights for a month and the cabin crew would be paid a full month\u2019s roster, which covers any work they do plus self-isolation in the month. Qantas Group\u2019s medical director, Ian Hosegood, says the risk to staff \u201cremains low\u201d. \u201cWe have put in place increased measures to protect our people while they are at work, and our customers, including enhanced cleaning at airports and on aircraft and providing necessary safety equipment,\u201d he said. The ACTU said 59 Qantas staff have been infected by Covid-19 and four families or flatmates were confirmed to have contracted the virus, with several more suspected cases awaiting test results. AAP reporter Benita Kolovos has tweeted about what sounds like a truly awful experience at a funeral today. Police stood watching over her papou\u2019s funeral to enforce social distancing. The funeral director said police had been at every service he had run since 22 March. Coatsworth says there is no concern about non-Covid-19 medication shortages. He also says there is no direct concern about an increased spread of Covid-19 in winter, although the cold will increase other respiratory illnesses, such as influenza. There is no evidence at the moment ... about a seasonal effect of Covid-19. The concern about winter is that there are other respiratory diseases like influenza which do have a seasonal component to them. With all the data we have with tracking flu in the community, with the social distancing that people have been doing, those numbers are plummeting. Which is just another great indicator of why this policy is actually working and that Australians are doing what is asked of them. He says it\u2019s too early to start talking about the relaxation of restrictions in Australia. He says it would need to be a very \u201cnuanced\u201d approach to relaxing restrictions. I think another way to put it might be that it was very fast into the restrictions and they were very widespread, and it needs to be very nuanced on the way out. So you need to be very clear about if you\u2019re lifting a restriction, that you have done everything you can to try and understand exactly what the implications of that lifting would be before you actually implemented. So whether it is slow or not, needs to be very targeted and focused and that is how it going to be I suspect Coatsworth is asked about plans by the NRL to return to playing next month. He says it\u2019s a matter for the state government, but: I think at the Australian principal health committee level, we have to have an approach which covers all codes and I think at this point in time it is that we don\u2019t have training and we don\u2019t have matches and we keep social distancing, which is the object of not having sporting events. We do understand though that sport is a major part of the Australian psyche. Coatsworth says it\u2019s critical that people continue to treat other, non-Covid-19 health conditions, including by undergoing regular pathology testing. I think at a broad level, you don\u2019t want other underlying health conditions to get worse because people are afraid of Covid-19. This is an absolutely critical message and I will say to Australians that because they have done so well in flattening this curve, the chance of you actually encountering someone with Covid-19 when you get your pathology test is actually extraordinarily low. If you want to get a pathology test, an influenza vaccine, to do something where you [have] face to face ..., then by all means go and do it. Just follow exactly what we have been saying. If you have got a cold, don\u2019t do it on that day. If you need to discuss things with your doctor, get in touch with them via telehealth first. Coatsworth said the return of Australians from Uruguay, where they are disembarking a ship with a 70% infection rate, has been \u201cmeticulously planned\u201d. Well, there are obviously medical concerns about that which is why this entire operation has been meticulously planned, led by the cruise ship operator but with the support of the departments of health and foreign affairs, border force, and the Victorian government. This is a very important thing that we have to get right but equally we have to bring these Australians back ... I am aware of the detailed plans to meet that aircraft when it arrives tomorrow morning. Making sure that all of the passengers get a thorough medical assessment ... and then depending on that medical assessment, either go to hospital \u2013 and the hospitals are prepared for that \u2013 or go into a hotel quarantine. Nick Coatsworth, the federal deputy chief medical officer, is discussing new measures to expand Medicare-supported telehealth services, which are important to allow Australians to continue receiving healthcare during a time of social distancing. He says there have been 3m consultations with 2.4 million patients. Coatsworth says the tough measures Australia has adopted are working, but acknowledges they have been difficult. I just want to make a particular statement about how difficult this has been for Australians, in particular during this difficult time over the Easter break. We have asked you to change the way we live as Australians essentially overnight. And essentially overnight, we\u2019ve come together as Australians and done just that. And it\u2019s because of that reason that we can continue to give you, for several days now and including today, good news about the number of cases that are occurring. But we need to sustain those gains. We need to keep those number of cases low. We need to have that opportunity now to chart our way through and out the other side of this Covid-19 epidemic He is asked about the spread of Covid-19 among frontline health workers, and whether the lack of personal protective equipment is a factor. I don\u2019t think a lack of masks or PPE has anything to do with current situations in Victoria and New South Wales. As I said, the national medical stockpile has been releasing millions of masks, not only surgical mask but and 95 masks for airborne production. The number of masks within the Australian healthcare community at the moment is sufficient and we are supplying them in very large quantities to the states and territories. Including [more than] 11m that have come in during the past week. So, no, I don\u2019t that is a factor. A little more detail on those flights coming back into Melbourne this weekend. As reported, Victorian authorities are expecting stranded Australians to return from Peru, India and Uruguay this weekend. More than 1,200 Australians are expected to land at Tullamarine airport this weekend. The flight from Uruguay is bringing passengers of the Greg Mortimer cruise ship home. About 70% of Greg Mortimer passengers have tested positive for Covid-19. The state government has issued a statement detailing the steps it will take to avoid any inadvertent spread from the returning passengers. Each passenger will be subject to \u201cstrict quarantine protocols\u201d. They will be medically screened, tested for Covid-19 if necessary, and transported to hotels for their 14 days\u2019 isolation. Victoria\u2019s deputy chief health officer, Dr Annaliese van Diemen, said local health authorities have been working closely with the federal government to plan for the Uruguay flight in particular. A field emergency medical officer team will be deployed to assess all the passengers, and paramedics will be on standby. Passengers who are displaying symptoms will also be taken to hospital for assessment and testing, if needed. All passengers returning from Uruguay will be taken to the same hotel for quarantine. Some returning New Zealanders will board private charter flights home. \u201cSignificant planning has been undertaken to ensure that the movement of the passengers and staff from the Uruguay flight is as safe as possible for them, and for the wider Victorian community,\u201d van Diemen said. \u201cOur team has detailed safety arrangements in place and they will be followed to the letter to protect Victorians and protect our hospital system.\u201d Just back to the NRL for a moment. We reported earlier that Peter V\u2019landys, the ARLC chair, said the sport had been given the go-ahead by government to resume matches next month. That doesn\u2019t seem to accord with the messaging of the NSW government, which says the NRL must discuss its proposal with health authorities before kicking off again. The health minister, Brad Hazzard, said on Saturday the matter was an issue for NSW Health, and not for politicians. \u201cIt\u2019s a \u2018have a discussion with health authorities to see if it can be done safely\u2019 [scenario],\u201d Hazzard said. Unions are calling for more information about a BHP mineworker who tested positive to Covid-19 in central Queensland. The CFMEU says it has had no information about exposure to others and the contact tracing efforts. AAP reports: BHP announced late on Good Friday that a worker at its Blackwater mine, about 200km west of Rockhampton, had tested positive to the coronavirus but he had not been on the site since 1 April. CFMEU Mining and Energy Queensland\u2019s president, Stephen Smyth, says the union has received minimal information about the positive test, including potential exposure and how tracing would take place. \u201cIn this case, there are multiple points of potential cross-contamination including machinery, transport, mess facilities and camp accommodation,\u201d Smyth said on Saturday. \u201cWorkers across the whole operation need reassurance that all of these risks have been identified, that they are being managed, and that all potential exposure will be appropriately tracked.\u201d BHP said the worker was at home in the Rockhampton region and was receiving healthcare and support. \u201cAll workers currently on shift were also temperature-tested by our paramedic overnight and no abnormal temperatures were returned,\u201d the company said in a statement posted on its Facebook page. Victoria\u2019s deputy chief health officer, Dr Annaliese van Diemen, says a large number of Australians will return to Melbourne this weekend, including people from India, Peru and other areas. Tomorrow Victoria is expecting a large number of people to return from Uruguay now that the Greg Mortimer cruise ship is to be allowed to dock after a trip to Antarctica. Its Australian and New Zealand passengers are being evacuated on a medical flight to Australia. Van Diemen says 70% of the passengers are thought to be infected. And tomorrow we are expecting a flight from Uruguay which will contain a number of people, over 100, from the cruise ship Greg Mortimer ... We have reports that up to 70% of these patients have tested positive to Covid-19. The government has been working very, very closely with the cruise ship operators to organise this fight to come back to Australia. Everyone on that flight from Uruguay will be assessed. If they are deemed to need testing, they will be tested. The retail and fast-food workers union, the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association, says it would \u201cwelcome members returning to work\u201d if safe. It said some retailers outside of those considered to be essential services are looking to reopen their stores. The union said it would welcome that where safe to do so, but will be guided by state and federal government news. \u201cThe SDA would like to see business resuming where it is safe for staff and shoppers to do so, but would not support anything that would undermine the national effort and the restrictions imposed to defeat Covid-19,\u201d its national secretary, Gerard Dwyer, said. Unions say Qantas flight crews are being exposed to greater risk to Covid-19 while rescuing stranded Australians from overseas and are not being properly protected. AAP has reported that the Australian Council of Trade Unions fears Qantas staff are being given insufficient health protections and left with inadequate leave entitlements if they do fall ill. The ACTU says Qantas cabin crews ferrying people back to Australia are becoming infected, as are their families. Passengers returning from overseas are required to enter into mandatory self-isolation for 14 days, but Qantas staff are not. ACTU president Michele O\u2019Neil said the exemption means there is no hotel room or support should crew or their family fall sick. \u201cThis is a completely unacceptable way for Qantas to be treating its staff,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is incumbent on Qantas to provide a safe working environment for its staff and to honour people\u2019s earned entitlement leave.\u201d A total of 59 Qantas staff have been infected by Covid-19 and four families/flatmates are confirmed to have contracted the virus. Several more suspected cases await test results. From AAP: Two NSW men have been charged in separate incidents of allegedly spitting on police officers. The first incident took place on Friday afternoon in Ashcroft in south-west Sydney, with a 24-year-old man verbally abusing police after being told to move on from a carpark. He then allegedly spat at a male police officer and mentioned coronavirus while being arrested. He has since been fined $5,000 and charged. The man was refused bail to appear before Parramatta bail court on Saturday. In the other incident, on Friday evening a female police officer was spat at by a 62-year-old man in Metford in the NSW Hunter region. The man had approached officers as a 36-year-old man was being arrested over an alleged domestic violence-related incident. He has been fined $5,000 and charged with assault and resisting a police officer, and will appear at Newcastle bail court on Saturday. The younger man was also charged with punching a police officer in the head during his arrest. Let\u2019s just take a moment to sum up what we\u2019ve learned today. Two more deaths have been recorded, taking the national toll to 56. A 91-year-old woman died in NSW, and a man in his 80s died in Victoria. There is cause for continued optimism in Queensland, NSW and Victoria, where the numbers of new confirmed cases have either stabilised or fallen, despite more testing being conducted. Queensland has described its infection rate as \u201cincredibly low\u201d and has recorded only nine new cases. NSW has recorded 44 new cases, and Victoria has 24 new cases. Tasmania recorded 11 new cases. The ACT recorded no new cases. Authorities across the country have urged Australians to stay at home over the Easter long weekend. In Tasmania, there is particular concern about an outbreak in the north-west, particularly in two hospitals. The Tasmanian government is adopting new measures to stop the outbreak spreading. The NRL insists it has been given the green light by government to resume matches next month. It says it will adopt regular temperature testing and hand-washing protocols for safety. The Bondi to Bronte walk, one of Sydney\u2019s most popular, has been closed after walkers continued to ignore the advice on social distancing. Helicopters have been patrolling the walk today and barriers and barricades are being erected. In Uruguay, 112 Australians and New Zealanders are aboard the Antarctic cruise ship Greg Mortimer which has been anchored off the coast of South America for 14 days after a coronavirus outbreak on board. The ship is now being allowed to dock and disembark. Australian and New Zealand citizens will be allowed to fly home on a special chartered medical flight. The Australian government has announced $100m in funding this week to help charities provide emergency relief during the coronavirus downturn. The Victorian government has released more detail on its Covid-19 statistics. I mentioned a little earlier that the number of cases had increased by 24 from yesterday, up to 1,265. Most (1,012) are in metropolitan Melbourne. Another 234 are in regional Victoria. That total is made up of 661 men and 604 women. The cases range from babies to those in their early 90s. The government says there are 118 cases that \u201cmay have been acquired through community transmission\u201d. Forty-four people are in hospital, including 15 in intensive care. More than 67,000 Victorians have been tested. The ACT has just released new data on its Covid-19 cases. It has recorded no new cases. The total remains at 103 confirmed cases with two deaths. Four patients are still in hospitals. Sixty-two have recovered and released from self-isolation. Authorities are still investigating three cases, including an intensive care unit nurse and a close contact of the nurse. The acting ACT chief health officer, Dr Vanessa Johnston, praised the effort of Canberrans in flattening the curve. \u201cAs I have said all this week, please stay home this Easter long weekend. Do not travel to the coast or interstate or gather in large groups with family and friends,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cIf you do need to go out for essential reasons, then complying with the rules on physical distancing and practising good hand and respiratory hygiene are the most important tools in slowing the spread of Covid-19.\u201d Labor has urged the federal government not to end Covid-19 stimulus measures too soon. Labor\u2019s Amanda Rishworth has told the ABC that doing so may damage the economic recovery. AAP reports: Labor is urging the Morrison government not to be too hasty in removing stimulus measures once the coronavirus pandemic is declared over for fear of damaging the economic recovery. The government has spent more than $320bn in recent weeks in its attempt to shield the economy from the worst impacts of Covid-19, including funding to keep workers employed, to improve unemployment benefits and provide free childcare. A Liberal backbencher, Julian Leeser, said he entered parliament seeking not to increase the size of government, but added these were \u201cextraordinary times\u201d. \u201c[These measures] are to deal with a specific and unprecedented set of circumstances that the world is facing and that Australia is facing,\u201d he told ABC television on Saturday. \u201cIt is why the measures that have been devised here are targeted and that they\u2019re temporary. There is no indication that these measures will be going on for all time.\u201d However, Rishworth warned against setting an arbitrary time rame for withdrawing support. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got to see where the world is in six months time, in a year\u2019s time,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they do it too quickly, if they do not closely calibrate it, what we could have is prolonged economic downturn, which will not be good.\u201d A few development from Bondi, a Covid-19 hotspot. The local council has made what it says is \u201cthe difficult decision\u201d to close the Bondi to Bronte coastal walk, one of the most popular in Sydney. Barriers are being erected at entry points and fines will be issued to those who ignore the closure. Waverley council said the decision was needed because large crowds were continuing to visit the area despite advice to stay home or find alternative places to exercise. \u201cUnfortunately, closing the coastal walk was the only way the council could help ensure that public health orders could be maintained along the walk,\u201d the mayor, Paula Masselos, said. \u201cI appreciate that this temporary closure will be met with frustration from some residents. I also appreciate how important it is for people to be able to exercise for mental health. I encourage people to be a tourist in their own suburb and find places to exercise on other streets and parks.\u201d Meanwhile, our reporter Ben Doherty has reported that a police helicopter is patrolling the coastal walk. Kerry Chant, the chief medical officer, gave some detail of the latest death. A 91-year-old woman with pre-existing health conditions died in hospital, with an unknown source of infection. She is asked about the premier\u2019s comment that \u201cthe worst is yet to come\u201d. When can we expect the worst? She says community transmission rates have come down, which is pleasing. But a vaccine is still a long way off. Our approach has been to buy us time, to get our health system prepared, and to also make sure that we have got those essential tools that will need to tackle Covid-19 over time. That relates to having supplies of testing kits and using new, innovative testing kits which allow us to do the testing faster and quicker [and] to scale up public health contact tracing facilities. But these are all matters that are under consideration as we look at what is happening around the world, as well as also sharing some of the scientific advances about treatments and vaccines, and have those discussions with the community around the course ahead of us. An NSW police assistant commissioner, Karen Webb, says authorities were repatriating about 1,100 people who had completed their 14 days of quarantine at Sydney hotels. I understand the operation is going smoothly, and more than half of those people have already left and are safely on their way home. Police have also been made aware that there are no cars on the road, either metropolitan or country roads, and we are very appreciative that people are listening to the messages and staying home. Police have arrested two people, one for being outside without a reasonable excuse. The other, she said, spat at police during a family violence incident. He was issued a $5,000 fine. Spitting or coughing at public officials is disgusting, it is against the law. It is disgusting at any time, but particularly during Covid-19. Kerry Chant, the state\u2019s chief medical officer, says 88 tests of the Ruby Princess crew have been conducted. Another 44 positive cases were identified. I also want to update you on the testing that was conducted on the Ruby Princess, among the crew. There were a total of 88 tests undertaken, and those tests were undertaken on those with mild respiratory symptoms, and those that were recovering from the illness on board the ship. 44 cases were positive, identified. Those tests are not unexpected given the COVID on the ship and I just want to stress that there is a combination of those that are recovering, and as part of our recovery process, we are testing them for clearance as well as those who have got some mild respiratory symptoms. There is action being taken, and I am pleased to say we are working cooperatively with Border Force, Aspen and New South Wales Health. The New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, is urging residents to stay at home over Easter, not attend church, and not hold family gatherings. NSW authorities say they have recorded 44 new cases, taking the total to 2,857. Another death has been recorded. That takes the state toll to 23 and the national toll to 56. About 212 people are being treated by NSW health. The health minister, Brad Hazzard, says: On behalf of the community and on behalf of our government I express our condolences to that person\u2019s family. It doesn\u2019t matter what the time, it is always tough when a family member [dies], and this is the toughest of times. So we are thinking of you. Berejiklian says the number of tests being conducted has increased, but the number of confirmed cases has remained stable. She says this is \u201cvery pleasing\u201d. But we are nowhere near out of the woods. The worst is yet to hit us. But the early signs are encouraging that the restrictions are having a positive impact. When we look at what we are going through in NSW, in Australia, compared to other parts of the world, we can take stock and say that we have done the right thing at the right time, and we really need to continue that. New Zealand authorities have just reported two more Covid-19 deaths, taking the country\u2019s death toll to four. AAP reports: A Christchurch man in his 70s and a Wellington man in his 80s both died on Good Friday after being admitted to hospital. Both had underlying health conditions, as did the previous two Kiwis to die after contracting coronavirus. The Christchurch man is the second to die from a cluster linked to the Rosewood rest home. The director of public health, Caroline McElnay, said she \u201ccannot rule out further serious illnesses or deaths\u201d from that cluster. So far, 30 people have tested positive to coronavirus at Rosewood, making it one of the country\u2019s most significant clusters. \u201cToday\u2019s news reinforces our move to alert level four,\u201d McElnay said. \u201cThis can be a very serious disease ... We want you to know that our health system will do everything it can to support the fight against Covid-19.\u201d Health officials also announced 29 new cases of the disease on Saturday, confirming New Zealand\u2019s trend towards control of the disease. There were 49 recoveries on Good Friday. The total number of cases is now 1,312. Fifteen New Zealanders are being treated for coronavirus in hospital: five are in intensive care and one Dunedin patient is listed as critical. Queensland police are speaking about implementing the state\u2019s tough border and travel restrictions. Queensland\u2019s police chief, Katarina Carroll, said Queensland residents and residents of border towns who come into the state must have a pass. She says there has been a \u201cdramatic change\u201d to the requirements overnight. Those coming from one of 13 declared Covid-19 hotspots will need a special \u201cred\u201d pass and will be ordered to isolate for 14 days. Carroll says: Our strategy has been that we will always communicate, show compassion, then compliance. If there is blatant disregard, and there has been ... people will be issued with an infringement notice. Police on the Gold Coast say they have intercepted 200 vehicles on the M1. They\u2019ve turned 11 vehicles around because they had no reason to go to the Gold Coast. No infringement notices were issued. Drones are also being used to warn people to get off the beach. The NRL plans to conduct regular temperature checks and employ strict handwashing protocols when (if) games resume in May. The ARL commission\u2019s chairman, Peter V\u2019landys, has also insisted the NRL has been given the go-ahead from government authorities to resume next month. Here\u2019s the AAP report: NRL players will have their temperatures taken before they can go on to the field, and it will be checked at least three times on game day. The NRL will implement strict biosecurity measures on the return to training next month, before the competition\u2019s planned resumption on 28 May. Central to that will be the heath of its players. The NRL must ensure it has minimised any risk to players, and guidelines off the field will be well beyond the government\u2019s public health measures. Players can stay at home ... but could be asked to move if they live in a virus hotspot. They will also be asked to self-isolate in the same manner that was floated before the competition was suspended. \u201cThey can stay at home,\u201d V\u2019landys said. \u201cAnd as long as we have some pretty strict biosecurity measures ... we are pretty confident the risk will be extremely minimal. \u201cEach player\u2019s temperature could be taken at least three times while they are in...our venues, they will have to wash their hands (and) they will have to undertake other biosecurity measures.\u201d V\u2019landys has also managed to keep racing on the track during the virus in his role as chief executive of Racing NSW. Rugby league\u2019s measures had already been discussed by the NRL after the opening two rounds, and would have come into place last month had the competition not been suspended. V\u2019landys insisted the game had been given official permission to resume next month from government authorities. It had also been in constant contact with the NSW premier\u2019s office, as well as the sports department. A meeting between the NRL and broadcasters this week will give a clearer recommendation on season structure, before Wayne Pearce\u2019s Apollo committee reconvenes on Friday. Pearce has already confirmed to AAP that a number of contingency plans will be put in place in case games are postponed due to a contamination. But after watching Australia\u2019s curve begin to flatten, V\u2019landys is increasingly confident that would not be an issue and any question marks over the return will be erased. From AAP\u2019s Colin Brinsden: The federal opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, is \u201cencouraged but not complacent\u201d about the decreasing rates of new Covid-19 cases, saying it shows that social distancing is working. \u201cThis needs to continue for some time yet,\u201d the Labor leader told Sky News on Saturday. There are 6,215 cases of Covid-19 in Australia; 55 people have died. Albanese, a rugby league fanatic, expressed caution about the NRL attempting to restart the season on 28 May, saying the priority had to be people\u2019s health. \u201cIt would be bad if we sent the wrong messages by trying to have rugby league games played at a time when we are still telling people to isolate,\u201d he said. Although there was nothing wrong with people preparing, the final go-ahead needed to consider the health of players, coaches and support staff. \u201cAlso the health of other Australians who might get the wrong message if people were running around the football field,\u201d he said. In his Easter message, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the inability to gather should not diminish Christians\u2019 hope, and they should live out their faith by staying home and supporting loved ones. The outbreak on Tasmania\u2019s north-west coast, Gutwein says, has occurred in health facilities, including the Northwest regional hospital and Northwest private hospital. Gutwein says the state will \u201cring-fence\u201d the area to take control of the outbreak. Operational control has now been taken from Northwest private hospital and will be managed by a dedicated outbreak management team. I want to say to the staff and frontline health workers on the north-west coast that this is a particularly difficult time for you. We understand that. It is a particularly difficult time for the community in which you are embedded. We will do everything that we possibly can to support you. We will do everything that we possibly can in taking the steps ... to ensure that we quarantine this disease. ... Some of them will be difficult, but we will ask you to work with us and ensure we can get on top of this and control this outbreak. Ring-fencing is what we need to do, and ring-fencing is what we are going to do. The Tasmanian government has announced new quarantine measures for those who have worked in, or been treated at, the hospitals. Some healthcare workers have already been asked to quarantine. Now their households will also be asked to quarantine at home. Any patient who has been discharged from 27 March has been asked to self-quarantine at their homes. The Tasmanian premier, Peter Gutwein, is speaking now. He says the state has recorded another 11 cases of coronavirus, bringing the total to 122 positive cases. He says 52 people have recovered, leaving 70 positive cases in the state. He says there is an outbreak on Tasmania\u2019s north-west coast. The state is particularly vulnerable to Covid-19, due to its demographics. We have a vulnerable community, an older community, a community that has in certain parts of its population more examples of underlying health challenges and other difficulties that people face. That is one of the reasons why we have been so strident in the position that we have taken in terms of ensuring that people follow the rules. It is why we put in place the border controls sooner than other states. It is why we lead in terms of cruise ships. It is why we have put in place the very strict rules in terms of shacks and coastal communities, because we want to protect the most vulnerable Tasmanians, and it is important that we all play our part to do that. Victoria\u2019s health minister, Jenny Mikakos, has announced another death due to Covid-19. A man in his 80s has died in hospital. There are also now 1,265 confirmed cases in Victoria, up from 1,241 yesterday. That includes 118 confirmed cases that authorities say may indicate community transmission, an additional two from yesterday. Mikakos said 44 people are in hospital and 15 are in intensive care. About 986 have recovered and more than 67,000 Victorians have now been tested. Miles is asked when a Covid-19 vaccination could arrive. He says realistically it is 18 months away, but the relaxation of drug laws will allow it to be distributed to Queenslanders as quickly as possible. Scientists right around the world, including right here in Queensland, are working hard to find a vaccine. A number of candidate vaccines have been identified; some of them are on their way to animal trials right now. We do hope that that vaccine is not too far away. However, even 12 months would be considered a very ambitious time frame; 18 months is probably more reasonable. The wait for a vaccine could be some time but it is important we do everything we can to prepare for that. That includes ensuring we have manufacturing capability, distribution capability, as well as now administration capability. That is what we are getting ready for. Miles says that, despite Queensland\u2019s successes, social distancing must be persevered with. It is incredibly important we keep that up but it is true to say that we are now expecting, if we can keep this up, [fewer] Queenslanders to get sick, [fewer] Queenslanders to end up in hospital, [fewer] Queenslanders to end up in ICU requiring ventilation and, ultimately, [fewer] Queenslanders dying from this awful disease, and I think it is really important for us all to remember that that is why we\u2019re doing this, so that other members of our community don\u2019t die from this illness. The Queensland health minister, Steven Miles, is giving an update on the latest Covid-19 developments. He says Queensland has recorded nine confirmed cases of Covid-19 overnight. Miles says there has been a \u201cdramatic decline\u201d in the weekly average of new cases. That is particularly encouraging because Queensland has been conducting more tests due to relaxed eligibility criteria. The nine overnight brings our total for the week, our seven-day total, to 77. When I spoke to you last Saturday it was 274. The Saturday before that it had peaked at 380. We have seen, in just two weeks, a very dramatic decline in the weekly average number of cases. It is now five days since we relaxed those testing criteria to do more community testing, where we thought there could have been community spread on the Gold Coast, in Brisbane and in Cairns. I\u2019m pleased to report that we haven\u2019t seen an increase in positive tests. in fact, the number of positive tests have continued to decrease over that time. The number of tests per day had dropped to roughly 600 from a peak of about 3,000. It is now back up over 2,000. We did 2,149 tests overnight. Considering that number of positive is just nine, that is a positive testing rate of just 0.42 over the past 24 hours \u2013 incredibly low by global standards. Miles also announces he is relaxing the state\u2019s drug therapy laws to give pharmacists the power to deliver the Covid-19 vaccine when it eventually arrives. Pharmacists will also be given the power to deliver a wider range of \u201cemergency medications\u201d if people can\u2019t get to their prescribing medical practitioner. To allow pharmacists a wider range of options for emergency medications, so that if people can\u2019t get to their prescriber they will be able to access emergency medications. To widen the circumstances in which pharmacists can substitute medications, but, most importantly, we are amending our drug therapy protocols so that pharmacists will be able to, when we have a Covid-19 vaccine, deliver that vaccine. That means that communities right across the state, everywhere in this state, will have very quick access to the vaccine when it comes. Hi everyone. Christopher Knaus here, taking over from Calla Wahlquist. Just turning to one of our nearest neighbours, Papua New Guinea, for a moment. Reporter Kalolaine Fainu has filed this shocking piece on PNG\u2019s preparations for Covid-19. The report reveals that medical staff in one hospital learned they were treating a Covid-19 patient when they saw the prime minister announce it at a press conference. The report says: The first that staff at Nonga General hospital in Papua New Guinea heard that they had been treating someone with coronavirus was when they saw the country\u2019s prime minister announce it in televised press conference on Monday. They had been treating the patient, a volunteer health worker at the hospital, for pneumonia. She originally came into the hospital in late March, but recovered and was discharged before her symptoms worsened and she was readmitted. \u201cThis person wasn\u2019t put into isolation or even a different ward,\u201d said Margaret Melke, a nurse in Rabaul district, where Nonga Hospital is. \u201cShe has been walking around freely in the past few days and talking with us, so we are scared. We all left the hospital and are waiting for someone to come and explain what is happening.\u201d We have just been sent this image of Sydney Fish Market staff taking temperature checks on customers yesterday, Good Friday, on what is usually one of the market\u2019s busiest days of the year. Photographer Peter Murphy said police were also monitoring the queues. And with that I will hand over for a few hours to my colleague Christopher Knaus. Four women \u201cpartying\u201d in a short-term rental property and five people sharing an Uber are among 183 people fined by police in Victoria for allegedly breaching social distancing or self-isolation laws at the start of the Easter long weekend. A spokesman for Victoria police said 893 spot checks were conducted on homes in the 24 hours to 11am yesterday. Police said they discovered \u201cmultiple instances of private gatherings at residential properties\u201d. Other alleged breaches were seven friends drinking in a schoolyard, and people fined for breaching public health orders while dealing drugs. (Those people also faced separate charges for, well, dealing drugs.) Quarantine call-out: tell us how you\u2019re getting home Does your stay in mandatory quarantine finish today? We are interested in talking to people who are making their way home after being quarantined for 14 days and who may be facing difficulties with domestic flights being cancelled. If that is you, please get in touch with Matilda Boseley at matilda.boseley@theguardian.com Let\u2019s go to Uruguay now, where 112 Australians and New Zealanders are aboard the Antarctic cruise ship Greg Mortimer which has been anchored off the coast of South America for 14 days after a coronavirus outbreak on board. Australian and NZ passengers were scheduled to disembark in Uruguay at 6.30pm Friday (7.30am Saturday AEST) to fly home on a special chartered medical flight. Twenty other less fortunate European, US and UK passengers will have to remain on board pending negotiations for their return home. A \u201chumanitarian corridor\u201d has been set up to shuttle passengers from the port of Montevideo to Carrasco international airport \u201cwith all the sanitary guarantees necessary for them and for society in general\u201d, Uruguayan authorities said on Friday morning. The fate of the remaining 20 passengers, and the ship\u2019s crew of 85, mostly Swiss and Swedes, is still unclear. \u201cThe [Uruguayan] government has not yet told Aurora [the cruise company operator] whether the ship will be allowed to remain at port or will be required to go back out to anchor,\u201d Brian Meier from Chicago, one of the six Americans on board, who has been in quarantine in his cabin since 23 March, told me via WhatsApp on Friday morning. The Greg Mortimer anchored 20km off the coast of Uruguay on 27 March with at least 128 coronavirus positive passengers and crew so far. The ship had left the Argentinian southern port of Ushuaia on 15 March on an Antarctic cruise that had to be interrupted when passengers started developing symptoms. A specially equipped Airbus 343 with medical personnel on board, chartered from the Portuguese Hi Fly air company, will leave for Melbourne at 1.40am Saturday. \u201cThe plane will be set up into risk zones, with passengers seated by test results,\u201d Aurora Expeditions told the passengers. Migration formalities have been processed digitally to avoid any physical contact with the passengers, Uruguayan authorities said. A convoy of buses will transport them from the port to the airport, from which they will descend on to the tarmac to board the plane. Only hand luggage is being allowed \u201cwithout manipulation of luggage to avoid contact\u201d. The fate of the remaining 20 passengers will probably depend on the results of a new round of coronavirus testing by Uruguayan doctors. \u201cThe non-AU/NZ passengers were tested Wednesday evening but we haven\u2019t got any results back yet,\u201d Meier told me. While we are talking about possible exit strategies, Guardian Australia\u2019s editor, Lenore Taylor, has written about the need to think very carefully before lifting social distancing restrictions. She writes: Governments have started to talk about the trade-offs involved in various exit plan options. Understandably, they are approaching the topic tentatively, because most of us will stay housebound for months, and because of the serious potential consequences of even a small relaxation of the rules. The national cabinet has asked health experts for advice and Australia-specific modelling. But these are not judgments that can be made solely on the basis of economic calculations or epidemiological forecasting. They are moral and ethical questions that require not just our heads but also our hearts. You can read Lenore\u2019s full piece here. Police in Queensland have fined 289 people with breaching social distancing laws and the ban on non-essential travel, issuing fines totalling $385,526. The figures, provided by AAP, were current on Friday morning so they probably would have increased by now. Among those fined were 18 people in 10 vehicles in an industrial area of Loganholme. Police have described the group as \u201choons\u201d. It follows an alleged illegal car rally in Brisbane last Saturday when a large group split across 150 cars gathered in a warehouse car park. Queensland introduced tighter border restrictions at midnight last night, requiring all Queenslanders returning home from interstate to present a Queensland entry pass, which can be applied for online here. The existing green entry and vehicle passes are now void. Residents must then self-quarantine for 14 days if they have been to an area declared a Covid-19 hotspot \u2013 which includes Sydney \u2013 unless their travel was for an essential purpose. Interstate freight transport services remain exempt from the border rules. The ABC\u2019s election analyst Antony Green has gone through the numbers from the Brisbane local government elections. Unsurprisingly, voting on polling day was significantly down. As I mentioned earlier, Ben Doherty has been taking a look at what the end of the lockdown period might look like in Australia. This week the prime minister, Scott Morrison, indicated restrictions might be lifted state by state at some undetermined time, with smaller states with lower infection rates providing a test case for larger states to follow. Doherty writes: Tasmania, with fewer cases, and the geographic advantage of being a small island with firmly established biosecurity laws, may be able to move sooner than other states. Those areas hardest hit by Covid-19 cases \u2013 New South Wales, Victoria and south-east Queensland \u2013 are likely to be the last to be able to move. South Australia, with a low and falling infection rate and the highest per capita testing rate in the country, could also be an early mover. Prof Lyn Gilbert, the chair of the infection prevention and control expert advisory group that reports to the nation\u2019s chief health officers, has warned restrictions could wax and wane with the rate of infections. \u201cEveryone wants to know when it will end, and I know the politicians are desperate to be able to say when it will end, but I think we\u2019ve got to be cautious,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the only way to do it properly is to watch what\u2019s happening and calibrate the response according to what\u2019s happening. And if restrictions were lifted, at least partly, and the numbers started to go up again, they\u2019d probably have to be reimposed.\u201d You can read the full piece here. The Australian government has announced $100m in funding to help charities provide emergency relief during the coronavirus downturn. It includes $37m to be shared among 200 emergency relief organisations to help them boost support and update their service delivery methods to comply with social distancing guidelines. The funding also includes $16m to be split between Foodbank Australia, SecondBite and OzHarvest, which provide food parcels to growing numbers of vulnerable people, and $7m to help the Red Cross provide emergency relief. Another $20m will go towards financial counselling services like the national debt helpline and problem gambling hotlines. The social services minister, Anne Ruston, said the commonwealth already funded financial counselling support to 115,000 people a year. The additional funding will provide support to another 50,000 people. The final $20m will go towards Good Shepherd to offer 40,000 people access to a no-interest loans scheme. Ruston also announced a national coordination group to coordinate emergency relief across Australia: Many people reaching out to these services may have never needed this type of assistance before so we need to make sure we have the right supports in place to help people through this period and bounce back stronger when it\u2019s over. I have been in constant communication with the sector which has told me what they need and we are responding. NRL chairman Peter V\u2019Landys has told the Sydney Morning Herald that the league has permission to resume the competition \u201ctomorrow if we wanted to\u201d, appearing to crush our collective dreams of NRL island. It comes after the deputy chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, hosed down suggestions the NRL could resume its season on 28 May, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t think they [the NRL] are a law unto themselves.\u201d V\u2019Landys said the NRL had written permission from the NSW state emergency operations centre to resume, and said he had rung the NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, on Friday to remind him that they were \u201cexempted in the health order\u201d. He told News Corp that Kelly \u201cunfortunately is unaware of the health order and our dealings with the relevant authorities\u201d. V\u2019Landys told the SMH: In reality we could do it tomorrow if we wanted to, but we\u2019re not going to because we\u2019re going to let the infection rate continue its stabilisation. What we have juggled is to make sure we are no threat to the community\u2019s health by spreading the virus. But I can\u2019t see how we spread the virus if the players who are going there are all negative and playing each other in a sterile situation when we know they\u2019re all negative. We\u2019ve got to go back to some sort of normality at some point in time. We just can\u2019t be like this for the rest of our lives. And we would not do it if the risk wasn\u2019t so low. We were playing and were allowed to play at 23% infection rate. It\u2019s down to 1.48%. You should be able to get back. On Friday the NRL has suggested it could resume its season on 28 May. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the coronavirus crisis in Australia. First, a large operation is under way to move the 1,300 people who have completed their mandatory 14-day quarantine in Sydney. They are the first group to have completed the hotel-based quarantine after returning to Australia on 28 March. Some have had their plans to return home interstate frustrated by the cancellation of domestic flights. On Friday, Virgin Australia suspended all domestic flights except one daily run from Sydney to Melbourne. They are the only people who should be on the move this weekend. Police have repeatedly warned they will crack down on anyone travelling for Easter. Yesterday the NSW arts minister, Don Harwin, resigned after being fined $1,000 for staying at his Central Coast holiday home in breach of a Covid-19 public health order. In Tasmania, the premier, Peter Gutwein, has warned that helicopters will fly along the north-west coast to see if anyone has breached orders to stay home by visiting their coastal shacks. And in Western Australia, the captain of the Fremantle Dockers, Nat Fyfe, has been cleared by police of what appeared to be breach of the travel ban after he was spotted surfing at Margaret River. Beaches in WA remain open, but the premier, Mark McGowan, warned they would be closed if they attracted crowds. As of last night there are 6,203 cases of Covid-19 confirmed in Australia, and 54 people have died after testing positive to the disease. Globally the death toll has passed 100,000, with 980 people dying in the UK alone in the past 24 hours. The daily incidence curve is continuing to fall. And experts have begun to consider Australia\u2019s path out of this crisis, as Ben Doherty has reported in this in-depth piece. More on that a bit later.

These are the human beings who, for decades, politicians have blamed for holding down wages, ruining \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/17/four-in-10-people-think-multiculturalism-undermines-british-culture-immigration\">British culture</a>\u201d and overburdening public services.</p> <p>If the government forges ahead with its plans, recognising them as key workers will be just a momentary suspension of the norm. Many of them were dismissed as low skilled before the crisis, and it seems they will be once again when it\u2019s over.</p> <p>The government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/18/uk-to-close-door-to-non-english-speakers-and-unskilled-workers\">post-Brexit immigration plans</a> are a mix of salary thresholds and a clear determination to stop people it deems to be low skilled coming to the UK. It seems that it plans to change the system in some ways, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/19/immigration-proposal-english-language\">expanding</a> an already unfair, discriminatory system for non-EU migrants to include their EU counterparts. Swept up into this category will likely be some of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/07/immigration-policy-will-bar-half-a-million-care-workers-from-eu\">people </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/07/immigration-policy-will-bar-half-a-million-care-workers-from-eu\">it is praising now</a>: the migrant care workers, hospital porters, bus drivers and cleaners who are keeping us safe and keeping society functioning.</p> <p>Your value, the rights you can access, whether you can settle in this country: none of that should be decided by your job or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jul/04/golden-visa-immigration-deal-british-citizenship-home-office\">how much money</a> you have in your bank account. But neither should it take a crisis to make this clear; you shouldn\u2019t have to risk your life or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/06/coronavirus-crisis-nhs-not-drained-migrants-sustained-died-frontline\">die trying to help others</a> to be seen as a human being.</p> <p>The sacrifices people are making should be recognised and remembered. But their humanity should not depend on how they help \u201cus\u201d. For decades this has been exactly the kind of immigration system politicians have argued for: one where migrants who benefit \u201cus\u201d and \u201cour economy\u201d are \u201callowed\u201d to come here, and everyone else is a problem. People moving to the UK have for too long been treated as disposable commodities, their rights determined by how useful they are seen to be. This is the very essence of the points-based system.</p> <p>That\u2019s why the government sometimes chooses to apply the rules differently to particular groups of people. It can, for instance, give out <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/nhs-frontline-workers-visas-extended-so-they-can-focus-on-fighting-coronavirus\">automatic one-year visa extensions</a> to some health workers, at the same time as doubling down on the immigration system that <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/coronavirus-nhs-visa-extensions-uk-doctors-nurses-a9444056.html\">dismisses other key workers</a>.</p> <p>So, if a shift is happening in society, it can\u2019t just be piecemeal. We cannot repeat the same dehumanising ideas, where people are either framed as \u201ccockroaches\u201d and \u201cillegals\u201d, or as \u201cproductive\u201d and \u201cuseful\u201d workers; bad migrants v good migrants. Recognising low-skilled workers as key workers should be a starting point, not an end point, to change the immigration debate. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-inequality-managers-zoom-cleaners-offices\">Coronavirus is not some great leveller: it is exacerbating inequality right now | Owen Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The government\u2019s treatment of all migrants matters. As it has reissued statements on low-skilled workers, it has been remarkably quiet on certain key migrants\u2019 rights issues during this crisis. Over the past few weeks I\u2019ve spoken to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/30/hostile-environment-covonavirus-crisis-britain-migrants\">people who are terrified</a> about becoming destitute because the conditions attached to their visa bar them from accessing financial support. There are those who are scared to access healthcare because of the hostile environment. And the charity Detention Action has found that not only are people still being put in immigration detention, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/coronavirus-detention-immigration-removal-centre-brook-house-home-office-a9458206.html\">some are being detained</a> when presenting with coronavirus symptoms. These people are consistently overlooked because they aren\u2019t seen to matter.</p> <p>But if recognising our common humanity is something we can do when Boris Johnson is admitted to intensive care, the same should be possible for all people, regardless of their immigration status. All migrants\u2019 rights should matter. Not just in a crisis, but all the time.</p> <p>\u2022 Maya Goodfellow is a writer and academic, and the author of Hostile Environment: How Immigrants Became Scapegoats</p>",

Millions of key workers in the UK are migrants \u2013 approximately 23% of all hospital staff, including 29% of doctors and 18% of nurses, 20% of agricultural workers, more than 40% of food production workers and 18% of care workers, rising to 59% in London. These are the human beings who, for decades, politicians have blamed for holding down wages, ruining \u201cBritish culture\u201d and overburdening public services. If the government forges ahead with its plans, recognising them as key workers will be just a momentary suspension of the norm. Many of them were dismissed as low skilled before the crisis, and it seems they will be once again when it\u2019s over. The government\u2019s post-Brexit immigration plans are a mix of salary thresholds and a clear determination to stop people it deems to be low skilled coming to the UK. It seems that it plans to change the system in some ways, while expanding an already unfair, discriminatory system for non-EU migrants to include their EU counterparts. Swept up into this category will likely be some of the people it is praising now: the migrant care workers, hospital porters, bus drivers and cleaners who are keeping us safe and keeping society functioning. Your value, the rights you can access, whether you can settle in this country: none of that should be decided by your job or how much money you have in your bank account. But neither should it take a crisis to make this clear; you shouldn\u2019t have to risk your life or die trying to help others to be seen as a human being. The sacrifices people are making should be recognised and remembered. But their humanity should not depend on how they help \u201cus\u201d. For decades this has been exactly the kind of immigration system politicians have argued for: one where migrants who benefit \u201cus\u201d and \u201cour economy\u201d are \u201callowed\u201d to come here, and everyone else is a problem. People moving to the UK have for too long been treated as disposable commodities, their rights determined by how useful they are seen to be. This is the very essence of the points-based system. That\u2019s why the government sometimes chooses to apply the rules differently to particular groups of people. It can, for instance, give out automatic one-year visa extensions to some health workers, at the same time as doubling down on the immigration system that dismisses other key workers. So, if a shift is happening in society, it can\u2019t just be piecemeal. We cannot repeat the same dehumanising ideas, where people are either framed as \u201ccockroaches\u201d and \u201cillegals\u201d, or as \u201cproductive\u201d and \u201cuseful\u201d workers; bad migrants v good migrants. Recognising low-skilled workers as key workers should be a starting point, not an end point, to change the immigration debate. The government\u2019s treatment of all migrants matters. As it has reissued statements on low-skilled workers, it has been remarkably quiet on certain key migrants\u2019 rights issues during this crisis. Over the past few weeks I\u2019ve spoken to people who are terrified about becoming destitute because the conditions attached to their visa bar them from accessing financial support. There are those who are scared to access healthcare because of the hostile environment. And the charity Detention Action has found that not only are people still being put in immigration detention, some are being detained when presenting with coronavirus symptoms. These people are consistently overlooked because they aren\u2019t seen to matter. But if recognising our common humanity is something we can do when Boris Johnson is admitted to intensive care, the same should be possible for all people, regardless of their immigration status. All migrants\u2019 rights should matter. Not just in a crisis, but all the time. \u2022 Maya Goodfellow is a writer and academic, and the author of Hostile Environment: How Immigrants Became Scapegoats",

The result has been huge waits to talk to benefits staff on the phone. So if you are about to claim for the first time, how do you do it, and what can you expect?</p> <h2><strong>How to claim</strong></h2> <p>Anna Stevenson, a welfare and benefits specialist at the financial charity Turn2Us, says the first thing new claimants need to do is to assemble all their financial data, and then use a benefits calculator \u2013 there is one on the <a href=\"https://benefits-calculator.turn2us.org.uk/AboutYou\">Turn2us website</a> \u2013 which will give a good indication of the sum payable.</p> <p>While people do not need a national insurance number to claim, details of rent and any outstanding earnings and mortgage costs will be required.</p> <p>The biggest bar to many will be the fact that anyone with savings of \u00a316,000 or more is not eligible to make a claim. They can only apply for jobseeker\u2019s allowance (JSA) of \u00a374.35 a week, and will receive no help with their rent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb8cb6d3b1c2590cf4d0400aeea7a5fab7173a18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb8cb6d3b1c2590cf4d0400aeea7a5fab7173a18/0_0_5123_3415/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Government and NHS advert for claiming universal credit in Birmingham city centre\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The coronavirus crisis has led to empty high streets and job losses.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Kemp/In Pictures via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All applicants are expected to file their claim <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit/how-to-claim?step-by-step-nav=7c08bbbf-a1ca-4cf5-850d-d9f2c796c750\">online</a>, or via the helpline. At the start, claimants must verify their identity \u2013 so have your passport or driving licence to hand.</p> <p>One of the big stumbling blocks has been that large numbers of claimants have been unable to do this online, often because they moved house recently or because some of their documents do not match up. It has lead to reports of people spending many hours on hold. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said this week it aimed to have a simpler ID system in place in the next few days.</p> <p>Once over that hurdle, applicants must input details of any income they are yet to be paid, any savings they have, the income of other members of their household (spouse or partner plus any adult children), and their housing costs, such as rent or outstanding mortgage.</p> <p>Problems can arise when trying to make an appointment to have the claim processed, says Stevenson. \u201cUniversal credit claimants have to make this appointment within 30 days of completing their applications and, for the claim to be approved, the interview must happen. Previously, this took place at the jobcentre but this is now being done over the phone. Again, people have been reporting that it is impossible to get through.\u201d</p> <p>The DWP accepts there have been long waiting times, and said on Thursday it was ending the need to call up. Instead, it said, its staff will be \u201cproactively calling claimants if they need to check any of the information provided as part of the claim, as well as messaging them on their online journal to confirm details\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>What will I get?</strong></h2> <p>It is difficult to generalise as each person\u2019s calculation is based on their household income, how much rent they pay, number of children etc \u2013 see the scenarios below.</p> <p>However, a single person over 25 will receive \u00a3410 a month, or about \u00a394 a week basic benefit, provided they have no other income.</p> <p>An unemployed couple on universal credit will receive \u00a3594 a month. If they have two children they will be paid a further \u00a3516 a month, provided the first child was born before April 2017.</p> <p>They will also receive help with their rent \u2013 formerly called housing benefit \u2013 although in many cases it will cover only 70-80% of what they pay their landlord.</p> <p>Stevenson says this is because the maximum rent that is claimable payable is set locally, and varies according to the local housing allowance. That rate is set at the lower 30% of rents in each area of the UK.</p> <p>Claimants are also entitled to help with their council tax, although again this will not always cover the full amount. This has to be claimed direct from your local council.</p> <h2><strong>Can I get help with my mortgage?</strong></h2> <p>This will come as a shock to many. If you are applying for universal credit and do not have any earnings, you can receive 2.61% of your outstanding mortgage made as a monthly payment, but this does not become payable until you have been claiming benefits and not earning for nine months.</p> <p>Someone with an outstanding mortgage of \u00a3150,000 would receive \u00a3326 a month (2.61% of 150,000 divided by 12) after nine months. However, this is a loan that accrues interest and has to be paid back, either before or when the house is sold.</p> <h2><strong>When will I get the payments, and can I get an advance?</strong></h2> <p>Universal credit is paid monthly in arrears and there is a five- to six-week wait for the payments to start. Those needing money immediately can claim an interest-free loan called an Advance within the first month, three days after filing the claim.</p> <h2><strong>Is there any other help available?</strong></h2> <p>Local authorities can sometimes help bridge the gap between the sum offered by universal credit to pay rent and the actual rent paid, known as discretionary housing payments. There is a limited amount of money available, so councils usually give preference to applications showing the greatest need.</p> <p>Turn2Us says claimants could also be eligible for support from almost 2,000 charitable funds that offer grants to help people struggling to get by. The <a href=\"http://www.turn2us.org.uk/get-support/Benefits-and-Coronavirus%5Dwebsite\">website</a> will signpost people towards this help, or you can call its helpline on 0808 802 2000.</p> <h2><strong>My income has dropped dramatically but I still have some work, can I apply too?</strong></h2> <p>Yes. Dan Rust, a benefits expert at Turquoise Training, says universal credit is also there to help workers whose hours and income have been reduced as a result of a partial shutdown.</p> <p>\u201cIf you are getting statutory sick pay because you are self-isolating, or if you are doing fewer hours at work, you should claim universal credit to top up your income,\u201d he says.</p> <h2><strong>I am (was) self-employed, can I apply?</strong></h2> <p>Yes, and you should, even if you expect help to come from the government\u2019s self-employed scheme. The government has also removed the floor on earnings that it previously used to limit payouts to those earning below the minimum wage from their self-employment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d0069774be8e97d72e037d83b102985d577e70b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0069774be8e97d72e037d83b102985d577e70b2/0_356_8260_4956/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A family at home\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Claimants may be eligible for support from charitable funds that offer grants to help people struggling to get by.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andriy Popov/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>How much can claimants expect to get?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Family with both parents working, but one has lost income</strong></p> <p>A manager is laid off after the owner shut his restaurant. He is 35 and married to a nurse who earns \u00a324,000 a year. They have two children, aged nine and seven, and a \u00a3600-per-month mortgage. They have savings of \u00a38,000.</p> <p>The nurse will still receive her net pay of \u00a31,663, while he will get universal credit payments of \u00a3351 per month, or \u00a381 a week. But any help with the mortgage will come only after nine months of not working. </p> <p><strong>Self-employed freelance worker, lost nearly all earnings</strong></p> <p>A freelance (self-employed) camera operator who used to make films at Pinewood Studios still receives \u00a3150 a month in royalties, but all other work has dried up. He lives alone in a rented two-bedroom house in St Albans, for which he pays \u00a31,400 a month.</p> <p>He will receive only \u00a3798 towards his housing costs and a total universal credit payment of \u00a31,058 per month. But this leaves him with a total income significantly less than his rent.</p> <p><strong>Self-employed consultant, 55, lost all earnings</strong><strong> but has savings</strong></p> <p>A self-employed management consultant now has no work. He has paid off his mortgage and he and his wife have Isa savings of \u00a360,000.</p> <p>Unfortunately, he is not entitled to any help. Their savings are too high to apply for universal credit, and he is not eligible for JSA, because he is self-employed. Had he been an employee, he would have got \u00a374.35 a week JSA.</p> <p><strong>Single person, 22, lost pub job</strong><strong> and has moved back in with parents</strong></p> <p>This person had a short-term contract but has been laid off from his job in a pub, and has no income. He does not pay rent to his parents, so will receive the basic \u00a3343 a month.</p> <p><strong>Laid-off mobile phone salesman whose wife works </strong><strong>at a supermarket</strong></p> <p>He has no work, while she earns \u00a31,100 a month net. They have three children aged six, nine and 11. They pay rent of \u00a31,500 a month in Manchester.</p> <p>They will receive only \u00a3723 a month towards their rent, meaning he will receive a total universal credit payment of \u00a31,561 per month, a little over their rent commitments.</p> <p><strong>An estate agent who used to earn \u00a350,000</strong></p> <p>He has been laid off. His partner earns \u00a340,000 gross in sales and is still being paid 100% by her employer. She has \u00a320,000 in savings; he has \u00a31,000. Their mortgage is \u00a31,100 a month.</p> <p>Again, he is not eligible for universal credit as their joint savings are too high. With two years of NI contributions, all he can claim is the new-style JSA of \u00a374.35 per week, for 26 weeks. Once their savings fall below \u00a316,000 he can claim universal credit.</p> <p><strong>Single person over 25</strong><strong> who lives in a shared flat</strong><strong> in east London.</strong></p> <p>He has been laid off so there is no income. He pays \u00a3450 a month in rent, inclusive of all bills and council tax, for his flatshare. He has savings of \u00a32,000, which is dwindling fast.</p> <p>He will be eligible for the shared accommodation rate for housing costs, which is up to \u00a3591 per month, and in total will receive \u00a3860 per month.</p> <p><em>Figures supplied by Dan Rust, a benefits expert</em><em> at Turquoise Training.

Once over that hurdle, applicants must input details of any income they are yet to be paid, any savings they have, the income of other members of their household (spouse or partner plus any adult children), and their housing costs, such as rent or outstanding mortgage. Problems can arise when trying to make an appointment to have the claim processed, says Stevenson. \u201cUniversal credit claimants have to make this appointment within 30 days of completing their applications and, for the claim to be approved, the interview must happen. Previously, this took place at the jobcentre but this is now being done over the phone. Again, people have been reporting that it is impossible to get through.\u201d The DWP accepts there have been long waiting times, and said on Thursday it was ending the need to call up. Instead, it said, its staff will be \u201cproactively calling claimants if they need to check any of the information provided as part of the claim, as well as messaging them on their online journal to confirm details\u201d. What will I get? It is difficult to generalise as each person\u2019s calculation is based on their household income, how much rent they pay, number of children etc \u2013 see the scenarios below. However, a single person over 25 will receive \u00a3410 a month, or about \u00a394 a week basic benefit, provided they have no other income. An unemployed couple on universal credit will receive \u00a3594 a month. If they have two children they will be paid a further \u00a3516 a month, provided the first child was born before April 2017. They will also receive help with their rent \u2013 formerly called housing benefit \u2013 although in many cases it will cover only 70-80% of what they pay their landlord. Stevenson says this is because the maximum rent that is claimable payable is set locally, and varies according to the local housing allowance. That rate is set at the lower 30% of rents in each area of the UK. Claimants are also entitled to help with their council tax, although again this will not always cover the full amount. This has to be claimed direct from your local council. Can I get help with my mortgage? This will come as a shock to many. If you are applying for universal credit and do not have any earnings, you can receive 2.61% of your outstanding mortgage made as a monthly payment, but this does not become payable until you have been claiming benefits and not earning for nine months. Someone with an outstanding mortgage of \u00a3150,000 would receive \u00a3326 a month (2.61% of 150,000 divided by 12) after nine months. However, this is a loan that accrues interest and has to be paid back, either before or when the house is sold. When will I get the payments, and can I get an advance? Universal credit is paid monthly in arrears and there is a five- to six-week wait for the payments to start. Those needing money immediately can claim an interest-free loan called an Advance within the first month, three days after filing the claim. Is there any other help available? Local authorities can sometimes help bridge the gap between the sum offered by universal credit to pay rent and the actual rent paid, known as discretionary housing payments. There is a limited amount of money available, so councils usually give preference to applications showing the greatest need. Turn2Us says claimants could also be eligible for support from almost 2,000 charitable funds that offer grants to help people struggling to get by. The website will signpost people towards this help, or you can call its helpline on 0808 802 2000. My income has dropped dramatically but I still have some work, can I apply too? Yes. Dan Rust, a benefits expert at Turquoise Training, says universal credit is also there to help workers whose hours and income have been reduced as a result of a partial shutdown. \u201cIf you are getting statutory sick pay because you are self-isolating, or if you are doing fewer hours at work, you should claim universal credit to top up your income,\u201d he says. I am (was) self-employed, can I apply? Yes, and you should, even if you expect help to come from the government\u2019s self-employed scheme. The government has also removed the floor on earnings that it previously used to limit payouts to those earning below the minimum wage from their self-employment. How much can claimants expect to get? Family with both parents working, but one has lost income A manager is laid off after the owner shut his restaurant. He is 35 and married to a nurse who earns \u00a324,000 a year. They have two children, aged nine and seven, and a \u00a3600-per-month mortgage. They have savings of \u00a38,000. The nurse will still receive her net pay of \u00a31,663, while he will get universal credit payments of \u00a3351 per month, or \u00a381 a week. But any help with the mortgage will come only after nine months of not working. Self-employed freelance worker, lost nearly all earnings A freelance (self-employed) camera operator who used to make films at Pinewood Studios still receives \u00a3150 a month in royalties, but all other work has dried up. He lives alone in a rented two-bedroom house in St Albans, for which he pays \u00a31,400 a month. He will receive only \u00a3798 towards his housing costs and a total universal credit payment of \u00a31,058 per month. But this leaves him with a total income significantly less than his rent. Self-employed consultant, 55, lost all earnings but has savings A self-employed management consultant now has no work. He has paid off his mortgage and he and his wife have Isa savings of \u00a360,000. Unfortunately, he is not entitled to any help. Their savings are too high to apply for universal credit, and he is not eligible for JSA, because he is self-employed. Had he been an employee, he would have got \u00a374.35 a week JSA. Single person, 22, lost pub job and has moved back in with parents This person had a short-term contract but has been laid off from his job in a pub, and has no income. He does not pay rent to his parents, so will receive the basic \u00a3343 a month. Laid-off mobile phone salesman whose wife works at a supermarket He has no work, while she earns \u00a31,100 a month net. They have three children aged six, nine and 11. They pay rent of \u00a31,500 a month in Manchester. They will receive only \u00a3723 a month towards their rent, meaning he will receive a total universal credit payment of \u00a31,561 per month, a little over their rent commitments. An estate agent who used to earn \u00a350,000 He has been laid off. His partner earns \u00a340,000 gross in sales and is still being paid 100% by her employer. She has \u00a320,000 in savings; he has \u00a31,000. Their mortgage is \u00a31,100 a month. Again, he is not eligible for universal credit as their joint savings are too high. With two years of NI contributions, all he can claim is the new-style JSA of \u00a374.35 per week, for 26 weeks. Once their savings fall below \u00a316,000 he can claim universal credit. Single person over 25 who lives in a shared flat in east London. He has been laid off so there is no income. He pays \u00a3450 a month in rent, inclusive of all bills and council tax, for his flatshare. He has savings of \u00a32,000, which is dwindling fast. He will be eligible for the shared accommodation rate for housing costs, which is up to \u00a3591 per month, and in total will receive \u00a3860 per month.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Tuesday 17 March </strong><strong>2020</strong></h2> <p>I know you don\u2019t want to read another coronavirus diary. Frankly, neither do I. Maybe I can strike a different tone. Here goes. Today I levitated above the fridge and when I was more confident with my technique, stretched out my arm and opened the fridge door to see what was inside it. I have not been panic shopping, but I am panicking all the same. At this time the underpaid cashiers and shelf stackers in supermarkets are not highly respected workers \u2013 neither are most of the people who will keep the infrastructure of the country from collapsing. Like many self-employed writers, all my international literary events and teaching commitments are cancelled. With this in mind my fridge is not overflowing, but in retrospect I wish I had bought more flour \u2013 it will soon become hard to find. Everywhere, the city trees are in blossom. Which reminds me of a quote from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/30/interview-with-anais-nin-archive-1970\">Ana\u00efs Nin</a>. \u201cAnd the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom.\u201d At this moment we are all tight inside the bud where it feels safer. One of the two lifts in my block of flats (more than a hundred apartments) is broken. We are now using the stairs.</p> <h2><strong>Wednesday 18 March </strong></h2> <p>When I hear an ambulance siren it is now more ominous than it was before the plague. My daughter arrives home from university with a big suitcase. It looks as if there will no summer term. She is anxious about infecting me. No hugs, no kissing. This was how upper-middle-class Edwardians lived in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/dec/02/julian-barnes-i-was-wrong-about-em-forster\">EM Forster novels</a>, physically distant from their families, no unseemly expressions of love and affection. Perhaps it is how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/enid-blyton\">Enid Blyton</a>\u2019s schoolgirls at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/20/downton-for-kids-bbc-brings-forward-malory-towers-adaptation\">Malory Towers</a> lived with their parents when they returned from boarding school in the late 1940s. We are learning to live like this.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6524be269a3e20e62d25aea1a4c65748faa9361e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6524be269a3e20e62d25aea1a4c65748faa9361e/0_0_175_289/175..jpg\" alt=\"First Term at Malory Towers\" width=\"175\" height=\"289\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I am trying to keep cheerful for both my daughters \u2013 the oldest lives away from home. Yet they both tell me they are nervous by how eerily calm I am about becoming ill with Covid-19. It seems, they say, that I have accepted the possibility that I will die, and they would prefer it if I freaked out more. After all, temporary morgues are being built around the country. Later, when I Google a recipe for shortbread with my younger daughter, the words that come up at the top of the search are \u201cshort of breath\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Thursday 19 March</strong></h2> <p>Who invented the virus language? Self-isolation, social distancing. Once these were sad, shameful phrases. Now they have flipped into something that is good for us and for the nation. Residents in my block of flats have set up a community WhatsApp group. People are helping each other out and have volunteered to shop for key workers living in our block. We also have our own version of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/singing-stops-italy-fear-social-unrest-mount-coronavirus-lockdown\">Naples</a>. The opera singer downstairs is practising an aria. Colleagues who teach are having to do so online. Zoom seems to be the technology of choice; their students are now scattered all over the world, so they have to agree on a time zone that works for everyone. I hear from friends in Paris that a baby racoon is sleeping on their fire escape.</p> <h2><strong>Friday 20 March</strong></h2> <p>No more schools, cafes, restaurants, cinemas, theatres, pubs restaurants, gyms. Swans and cormorants are diving for fish in the newly clear waters of Venice\u2019s canals. The government announces that it will offer help with the nation\u2019s wage bill and is looking into a rescue package for the self-employed. I am discovering that I am not that good at coping with uncertainty. Good news: the lift has been repaired in my block. All the same, we do not travel between the floors together. Once we wished each other a good evening after a day at work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f9b13d83070e2c88ab7eb6e3ac17e3a88baf3253\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9b13d83070e2c88ab7eb6e3ac17e3a88baf3253/0_0_3072_1843/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Clean waters in Venice\u2019s Grand Canal, March 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clean waters in Venice\u2019s Grand Canal, March 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrea Merola/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Sunday 22 March</strong></h2> <p>Mother\u2019s Day. My flat is full of purple tulips and scented lilies. My own mother died five years ago. I have written extensively about her and continue to do so. I wish I had thanked her for holding our family together when she was alive. Who am I really speaking to when I write about my mother? If she was living through this time now, she would be 86. I would have wanted her life to be regarded as important as everyone else.</p> <h2><strong>Monday 23 March</strong></h2> <p>The UK is locked down. Police will now have the power to fine people if they leave their homes for reasons other than shopping for basic necessities, exercising, medical need, providing care for a vulnerable person, or if they are a key worker travelling to work.

      "bodyText": "Tuesday 17 March 2020 I know you don\u2019t want to read another coronavirus diary. Frankly, neither do I. Maybe I can strike a different tone. Here goes. Today I levitated above the fridge and when I was more confident with my technique, stretched out my arm and opened the fridge door to see what was inside it. I have not been panic shopping, but I am panicking all the same. At this time the underpaid cashiers and shelf stackers in supermarkets are not highly respected workers \u2013 neither are most of the people who will keep the infrastructure of the country from collapsing. Like many self-employed writers, all my international literary events and teaching commitments are cancelled. With this in mind my fridge is not overflowing, but in retrospect I wish I had bought more flour \u2013 it will soon become hard to find. Everywhere, the city trees are in blossom. Which reminds me of a quote from Ana\u00efs Nin. \u201cAnd the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom.\u201d At this moment we are all tight inside the bud where it feels safer. One of the two lifts in my block of flats (more than a hundred apartments) is broken. We are now using the stairs. Wednesday 18 March When I hear an ambulance siren it is now more ominous than it was before the plague. My daughter arrives home from university with a big suitcase. It looks as if there will no summer term. She is anxious about infecting me. No hugs, no kissing. This was how upper-middle-class Edwardians lived in EM Forster novels, physically distant from their families, no unseemly expressions of love and affection. Perhaps it is how Enid Blyton\u2019s schoolgirls at Malory Towers lived with their parents when they returned from boarding school in the late 1940s. We are learning to live like this. I am trying to keep cheerful for both my daughters \u2013 the oldest lives away from home. Yet they both tell me they are nervous by how eerily calm I am about becoming ill with Covid-19. It seems, they say, that I have accepted the possibility that I will die, and they would prefer it if I freaked out more. After all, temporary morgues are being built around the country. Later, when I Google a recipe for shortbread with my younger daughter, the words that come up at the top of the search are \u201cshort of breath\u201d. Thursday 19 March Who invented the virus language? Self-isolation, social distancing. Once these were sad, shameful phrases. Now they have flipped into something that is good for us and for the nation. Residents in my block of flats have set up a community WhatsApp group. People are helping each other out and have volunteered to shop for key workers living in our block. We also have our own version of Naples. The opera singer downstairs is practising an aria. Colleagues who teach are having to do so online. Zoom seems to be the technology of choice; their students are now scattered all over the world, so they have to agree on a time zone that works for everyone. I hear from friends in Paris that a baby racoon is sleeping on their fire escape. Friday 20 March No more schools, cafes, restaurants, cinemas, theatres, pubs restaurants, gyms. Swans and cormorants are diving for fish in the newly clear waters of Venice\u2019s canals. The government announces that it will offer help with the nation\u2019s wage bill and is looking into a rescue package for the self-employed. I am discovering that I am not that good at coping with uncertainty. Good news: the lift has been repaired in my block. All the same, we do not travel between the floors together. Once we wished each other a good evening after a day at work. Sunday 22 March Mother\u2019s Day. My flat is full of purple tulips and scented lilies. My own mother died five years ago. I have written extensively about her and continue to do so. I wish I had thanked her for holding our family together when she was alive. Who am I really speaking to when I write about my mother? If she was living through this time now, she would be 86. I would have wanted her life to be regarded as important as everyone else. Monday 23 March The UK is locked down. Police will now have the power to fine people if they leave their homes for reasons other than shopping for basic necessities, exercising, medical need, providing care for a vulnerable person, or if they are a key worker travelling to work. The stereotype that we are a reserved nation who don\u2019t very much like to touch each other seems to have blown out the window. Social distancing feels like unlearning every muscle memory in my body. Wednesday 25 March We now have a brand new baby in our block. Everyone feels uplifted and relieved that he is healthy and doing well. Thursday 26 March In our block there are balconies facing three directions, the front carpark, the back carpark and the communal gardens.

      "body": "<p>The first person confirmed to have tested positive for the coronavirus in the US by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was a resident of Snohomish county, Washington.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/us-rural-hospitals-coronavirus-crisis-face-shutdowns\">Coronavirus threatens survival of US rural hospitals on frontlines of crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That was on 21 January. In the weeks that have followed, the state, which has a population of more than 7.5 million people, has seen over 9,000 confirmed cases, including 421 deaths.</p> <p>Washington\u2019s governor, Jay Inslee, has closed schools, ordered a halt to all elective surgeries and issued a stay-home mandate, which involves a ban on all gatherings and the closure of all businesses, except grocery stores, pharmacies, gas stations and other essential companies. Last week, he extended that order to 4 May, saying that was \u201cabsolutely the soonest we possibly could achieve our ends to keep our loved ones safe.\u201d</p> <p>But though the path back to \u201cnormal\u201d life is still some way off, the state\u2019s early and comprehensive response looks to be flattening the curve of coronavirus infections. With the worsening of the financial crisis brought on by the public health emergency, that has prompted the questions: when, and how, could this end?</p> <p>Dr Anthony Fauci, America\u2019s leading expert on infectious diseases, recently explained that it will be clear the outbreak is nearing its conclusion in the US when the number of new infections is approaching almost zero and the number of deaths is not far behind.</p> <p>\u201cI believe that in a few months, hopefully, that we\u2019ll get it under control enough that it won\u2019t be as frightening as it is now, but it will not be an absent threat,\u201d he told the New York Times.</p> <p>Washington saw the initial outbreak of the virus in the US and, after the infection struck a nursing home in the state, reported the country\u2019s highest numbers of cases and deaths for weeks. But the state has since moved far behind hotspot states like New York, which has a far greater population of almost 20 million. Today, Washington state has the 11th-highest number of cases in the US, according to the CDC.</p> <p>A projection from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, an independent population health research center at UW Medicine, shows that Washington hit its peak in coronavirus deaths 11 days ago, with 24 fatalities. In contrast, New York\u2019s peak is projected to hit this week.</p> <p>Washington\u2019s low numbers can be attributed to the simple fact that its cities are less dense than those in states like New York. Its communities may also be following social distancing measures more closely.</p> <p>But officials also tested and found cases of coronavirus early, then quickly proceeded to ramp up preparedness, explained Hilary Godwin, dean of the University of Washington school of public health.</p> <p>\u201cOur hospitals have been preparing, building up capacity,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce we got to the point where we had to do social distancing because the number of cases was so great, we were really well positioned and were able to roll those things out really systematically.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Scott Lindquist, Washington state\u2019s epidemiologist for communicable diseases, said officials are paying particularly close attention to the percentage of people evaluated who test positive for Covid-19.</p> <p>He explained that at the beginning of this outbreak, the state was seeing 3% of people tested test positive, but as of Wednesday last week, that had increased to at least 7%. He said over one or two weeks, he would want to see the average stay consistently below 7%, as that would make it clear the numbers are trending down and thus the situation is improving.</p> <p>Lindquist said officials would also want to see a clear trend that shows the percentage of hospitalizations for people with corona-like illnesses and the number of deaths decreasing. These measures would offer a very clear indication about how much coronavirus is still in the community, he said.

      "bodyText": "The first person confirmed to have tested positive for the coronavirus in the US by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was a resident of Snohomish county, Washington. That was on 21 January. In the weeks that have followed, the state, which has a population of more than 7.5 million people, has seen over 9,000 confirmed cases, including 421 deaths. Washington\u2019s governor, Jay Inslee, has closed schools, ordered a halt to all elective surgeries and issued a stay-home mandate, which involves a ban on all gatherings and the closure of all businesses, except grocery stores, pharmacies, gas stations and other essential companies. Last week, he extended that order to 4 May, saying that was \u201cabsolutely the soonest we possibly could achieve our ends to keep our loved ones safe.\u201d But though the path back to \u201cnormal\u201d life is still some way off, the state\u2019s early and comprehensive response looks to be flattening the curve of coronavirus infections. With the worsening of the financial crisis brought on by the public health emergency, that has prompted the questions: when, and how, could this end? Dr Anthony Fauci, America\u2019s leading expert on infectious diseases, recently explained that it will be clear the outbreak is nearing its conclusion in the US when the number of new infections is approaching almost zero and the number of deaths is not far behind. \u201cI believe that in a few months, hopefully, that we\u2019ll get it under control enough that it won\u2019t be as frightening as it is now, but it will not be an absent threat,\u201d he told the New York Times. Washington saw the initial outbreak of the virus in the US and, after the infection struck a nursing home in the state, reported the country\u2019s highest numbers of cases and deaths for weeks. But the state has since moved far behind hotspot states like New York, which has a far greater population of almost 20 million. Today, Washington state has the 11th-highest number of cases in the US, according to the CDC. A projection from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, an independent population health research center at UW Medicine, shows that Washington hit its peak in coronavirus deaths 11 days ago, with 24 fatalities. In contrast, New York\u2019s peak is projected to hit this week. Washington\u2019s low numbers can be attributed to the simple fact that its cities are less dense than those in states like New York. Its communities may also be following social distancing measures more closely. But officials also tested and found cases of coronavirus early, then quickly proceeded to ramp up preparedness, explained Hilary Godwin, dean of the University of Washington school of public health. \u201cOur hospitals have been preparing, building up capacity,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce we got to the point where we had to do social distancing because the number of cases was so great, we were really well positioned and were able to roll those things out really systematically.\u201d Dr Scott Lindquist, Washington state\u2019s epidemiologist for communicable diseases, said officials are paying particularly close attention to the percentage of people evaluated who test positive for Covid-19. He explained that at the beginning of this outbreak, the state was seeing 3% of people tested test positive, but as of Wednesday last week, that had increased to at least 7%. He said over one or two weeks, he would want to see the average stay consistently below 7%, as that would make it clear the numbers are trending down and thus the situation is improving. Lindquist said officials would also want to see a clear trend that shows the percentage of hospitalizations for people with corona-like illnesses and the number of deaths decreasing. These measures would offer a very clear indication about how much coronavirus is still in the community, he said. Although hospitalizations have been increasing, deaths have been staying fairly steady. Given these current trends, how much time could it take the state to get to a point when it would seriously consider easing social distancing restrictions? \u201cI definitely would say it\u2019s not days,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s weeks to months. But again, if things turn around very quickly, we\u2019re talking just a couple weeks.\u201d More than a third of the cases in Washington have been reported in King county, which includes Seattle. According to a recent study conducted by the Institute for Disease Modeling, a private research institute in Bellevue, Washington, King county has seen a significant decrease in virus transmissions, probably due to strict social distancing measures. The researchers found that in late February each infected individual in the county was spreading the virus to an average of two or three other people. By 18 March, that number had been essentially cut in half, with people on average infecting 1.4 additional people. But, of course, in order to actually see a drop in new cases, on average each individual with coronavirus would need to infect less than one other person. Godwin said when making a decision about social distancing restrictions, it\u2019s not necessarily a matter of getting the number of new cases and deaths down to zero. The trick is to get that number down low enough so that \u201cwe would be more like we were at the early phase of the epidemic, when the health department could do contact tracing for each case and could make sure anyone who got infected was self-quarantined\u201d, she said. However, Godwin said if Washington were to get the virus under control and removed its stay-home mandate, a \u201csecond wave\u201d of infections could still occur. Godwin said it may be a matter of Washington officials letting up for a little bit or releasing some constraints and then having to simply see how things go. But she warned that different virus timelines across US states could hamper efforts, especially if people from states that have not contained the virus continue to travel domestically. Dr Jeff Duchin, health officer for public health, Seattle and King county, said during a recent press conference that for the Seattle area or any community to transition out of comprehensive social distancing measures, there needs to be widespread availability of testing with very rapid turnaround time, and a robust healthcare system that is both heavily monitored and has the bandwidth to care for the sick.

If you\u2019re showing symptoms of coronavirus, or have been diagnosed, wearing a mask can also protect others. So masks are crucial for health and social care workers looking after patients and are also recommended for family members who need to care for someone who is ill \u2013 ideally both the patient and carer should have a mask.</p> \n<p>However, masks will probably make little difference if you\u2019re just walking around town or taking a bus so there is no need to bulk-buy a huge supply.</p> \n<h2><strong>Claim: \u2018It is mutating into a more deadly strain\u2019</strong></h2> \n<p>All viruses accumulate mutations over time and the virus that causes Covid-19 is no different. How widespread different strains of a virus become depends on natural selection \u2013 the versions that can propagate quickest and replicate effectively in the body will be the most \u201csuccessful\u201d. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean most dangerous for people though, as viruses that kill people rapidly or make them so sick that they are incapacitated may be less likely to be transmitted.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/nsr/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nsr/nwaa036/5775463\">Genetic analysis</a> by Chinese scientists of 103 samples of the virus, taken from patients in Wuhan and other cities, suggests that early on two main strains emerged, designated L and S. Although the L strain appeared to be more prevalent than the S strain (about 70% of the samples belonged to the former), the S branch of the virus was found to be the ancestral version.</p> \n<p>The team behind this research suggested that this may indicate the L strain is more \u201caggressive\u201d, either transmitting more easily or replicating faster inside the body. However, this theory is speculative at this stage \u2013 there haven\u2019t yet been direct comparisons to see whether people who catch one version of the virus are more likely to pass it on or suffer more severe symptoms.</p> \n<h2><strong>Claim: \u2018It is no more dangerous than winter flu\u2019</strong></h2> \n<p>Many individuals who get coronavirus will experience nothing worse than seasonal flu symptoms, but the overall profile of the disease, including its mortality rate, looks more serious. At the start of an outbreak the apparent mortality rate can be an overestimate if a lot of mild cases are being missed. But Bruce Aylward, a WHO expert, who led an international mission to China to learn about the virus and the country\u2019s response, said this has not been the case with Covid-19. The evidence did not suggest that we were only seeing the tip of the iceberg. If borne out by further testing, this could mean that current estimates of a roughly 1% fatality rate are accurate. This would make Covid-19 about 10 times more deadly than seasonal flu, which is estimated to kill between 290,000 and 650,000 people a year globally.</p> \n<h2><strong>Claim: \u2018It only kills the elderly, so younger people can relax\u2019</strong></h2> \n<p>Most people who are not elderly and do not have underlying health conditions will not become critically ill from Covid-19. But the illness still has a higher chance of leading to serious respiratory symptoms than seasonal flu and there are other at-risk groups \u2013 health workers, for instance, are more vulnerable because they are likely to have higher exposure to the virus. The actions that young, healthy people take, including reporting symptoms and following quarantine instructions, will have an important role in protecting the most vulnerable in society and in shaping the overall trajectory of the outbreak.</p> \n<h2><strong>Claim: \u2018You need to be with an infected person for 10 minutes\u2019</strong></h2> \n<p>For flu, some hospital guidelines define exposure as being within six feet of an infected person who sneezes or coughs for 10 minutes or longer. However, it is possible to be infected with shorter interactions or even by picking the virus up from contaminated surfaces, although this is thought to be a less common route of transmission.</p> \n<h2><strong>Claim: \u2018A vaccine could be ready within a few months\u2019</strong></h2> \n<p>Scientists were quick out of the gates in beginning development of a vaccine for the new coronavirus, helped by the early release of the genetic sequence by Chinese researchers. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/when-will-a-coronavirus-vaccine-be-ready\">The development of a viable vaccine continues apace</a>, with several teams now testing candidates in animal experiments. However, the incremental trials required before a commercial vaccine could be rolled out are still a lengthy undertaking \u2013 and an essential one to ensure that even rare side-effects are spotted. A commercially available vaccine within a year would be quick.\u2019</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>Due to the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the coronavirus outbreak, this article is being regularly updated to ensure that it reflects the current situation at the date of publication.

This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean most dangerous for people though, as viruses that kill people rapidly or make them so sick that they are incapacitated may be less likely to be transmitted. Genetic analysis by Chinese scientists of 103 samples of the virus, taken from patients in Wuhan and other cities, suggests that early on two main strains emerged, designated L and S. Although the L strain appeared to be more prevalent than the S strain (about 70% of the samples belonged to the former), the S branch of the virus was found to be the ancestral version. The team behind this research suggested that this may indicate the L strain is more \u201caggressive\u201d, either transmitting more easily or replicating faster inside the body. However, this theory is speculative at this stage \u2013 there haven\u2019t yet been direct comparisons to see whether people who catch one version of the virus are more likely to pass it on or suffer more severe symptoms. Claim: \u2018It is no more dangerous than winter flu\u2019 Many individuals who get coronavirus will experience nothing worse than seasonal flu symptoms, but the overall profile of the disease, including its mortality rate, looks more serious. At the start of an outbreak the apparent mortality rate can be an overestimate if a lot of mild cases are being missed. But Bruce Aylward, a WHO expert, who led an international mission to China to learn about the virus and the country\u2019s response, said this has not been the case with Covid-19. The evidence did not suggest that we were only seeing the tip of the iceberg. If borne out by further testing, this could mean that current estimates of a roughly 1% fatality rate are accurate. This would make Covid-19 about 10 times more deadly than seasonal flu, which is estimated to kill between 290,000 and 650,000 people a year globally. Claim: \u2018It only kills the elderly, so younger people can relax\u2019 Most people who are not elderly and do not have underlying health conditions will not become critically ill from Covid-19. But the illness still has a higher chance of leading to serious respiratory symptoms than seasonal flu and there are other at-risk groups \u2013 health workers, for instance, are more vulnerable because they are likely to have higher exposure to the virus. The actions that young, healthy people take, including reporting symptoms and following quarantine instructions, will have an important role in protecting the most vulnerable in society and in shaping the overall trajectory of the outbreak. Claim: \u2018You need to be with an infected person for 10 minutes\u2019 For flu, some hospital guidelines define exposure as being within six feet of an infected person who sneezes or coughs for 10 minutes or longer. However, it is possible to be infected with shorter interactions or even by picking the virus up from contaminated surfaces, although this is thought to be a less common route of transmission. Claim: \u2018A vaccine could be ready within a few months\u2019 Scientists were quick out of the gates in beginning development of a vaccine for the new coronavirus, helped by the early release of the genetic sequence by Chinese researchers. The development of a viable vaccine continues apace, with several teams now testing candidates in animal experiments. However, the incremental trials required before a commercial vaccine could be rolled out are still a lengthy undertaking \u2013 and an essential one to ensure that even rare side-effects are spotted. A commercially available vaccine within a year would be quick.\u2019 Due to the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the coronavirus outbreak, this article is being regularly updated to ensure that it reflects the current situation at the date of publication.

Two websites for leading Chinese universities appear to have recently published and then removed pages that reference a new policy requiring academic papers dealing with Covid-19 to undergo extra vetting before they are submitted for publication. Research on the origins of the virus is particularly sensitive and subject to checks by government officials, the notices posted on the websites of Fudan University and the China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) said. Both the deleted pages were accessed from online caches. Prof Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London, said the Chinese government had a heavy focus on how the evolution and management of the virus is perceived since the early days of the outbreak. \u201cIn terms of priority, controlling the narrative is more important than the public health or the economic fallout,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean the economy and public health aren\u2019t important. But the narrative is paramount.\u201d With the virus having infected more than a million people worldwide and caused heavy casualties particularly across Europe and the US, details about its origin and the first weeks of the pandemic \u2013 when there was a cover-up by local officials \u2013 may be considered particularly sensitive. \u201cIf these documents are authentic it would suggest the government really wants to control the narrative about the origins of Covid-19 very tightly,\u201d said Tsang of the reports of new regulations. China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) appears to have published and then deleted new requirements that academic papers dealing with the origins of the virus be approved by China\u2019s ministry of science and technology before publication. The university\u2019s academic committee was expected to first go through the research \u201cwith an emphasis on checking the accuracy of the thesis, as well as whether it is suitable for publication,\u201d the regulation said. \u201cWhen the checks have been completed, the school should report to the Ministry of Science and Technology [MOST], and it should only be published after it has [also] been checked by MOST,\u201d it said. Despite its name, the geosciences university announced elsewhere on its website that it was carrying out coronavirus research. A separate document obtained by the Guardian, which could not be independently verified, appears to be from the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University and also said publication of research into the origins of Covid-19 would need approval from the science and technology ministry. Another notice, which appears to have been published on 9 April by the school of information science and technology at Fudan University in Shanghai, called for \u201cstrict and serious\u201d management of papers investigating the source of the outbreak. Papers could only be submitted for publication after being approved by a special office. Email, names and phone numbers provided on the notice suggested that office was part of China\u2019s ministry of education. A source who alerted the Guardian to cached versions of the websites, and who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said they were concerned by what appeared to be an attempt by Chinese authorities to intervene in the independence of the scientific process. The person said researchers submitting academic papers on other medical topics did not have to vet their work with government ministries before seeking publication. A technical analysis of the cached websites indicated that the posts were published on verified university websites before they were removed. The Guardian could not independently verify that they reflected a new government policy. The notices appear to be part of a broader push to manage research on the virus. The science and technology ministry said on 3 April that ongoing clinical research on the coronavirus must be reported to authorities within three days or be halted. In March China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, published an essay that included \u201ctracing the origin of the virus\u201d on a list of national priorities. It was referenced by the science and technology ministry shortly before the universities posted their orders. The Chinese government did not reply to a request for comment sent by the Guardian to the Chinese embassy in Washington. While the exact origin of the pandemic is still not certain, one commonly held hypothesis is that it began following an interaction between a human and an animal at the Huanan seafood \u201cwet market\u201d in Wuhan. Scientists have said the virus probably originated in bats and then passed through an intermediary animal before infecting the first human. Scientists believe the transmission was similar to that in the 2002 outbreak of Sars. Some criticism of China has focused on why the government did not shut down wet markets after the previous outbreaks of coronaviruses. Kevin Carrico, a senior research fellow of Chinese studies at Monash University, said he was not aware of any specific recent change to rules for academic research in China in connection to Covid-19, but the documents were generally consistent with efforts by China to control the narrative of the pandemic. \u201cThey are seeking to transform it from a massive disaster to one where the government did everything right and gave the rest of the world time to prepare,\u201d Carrico said. Carrico said those efforts had been evident in communications ranging from government pronouncements at the highest level to public sentiment on social media. \u201cThere is a desire to a degree to deny realities that are staring at us in the face \u2026 that this is a massive pandemic that originated in a place that the Chinese government really should have cleaned up after Sars,\u201d he said. Around a month ago senior Chinese diplomats, officials and state media all publicly encouraged speculation that the new coronavirus could have come from outside the country. The foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian suggested without evidence that the US military might have brought the virus to Wuhan.",

Women using code words to escape domestic violence There\u2019s been a huge spike in domestic violence around the world because of the Covid-19 lockdown. With help harder to access, people are finding creative workarounds. A new initiative in France encourages people experiencing abuse to say a codeword (\u201cmask19\u201d) to a pharmacist at a drugstore to get help. In the UK the Silent Solution system allows victims to alert police without saying anything; you dial 999 operators and then press 55. Rihanna has donated $2.1m to help domestic violence victims in lockdown While some celebrities are responding to the crisis with cringey renditions of Imagine, Rihanna has opened her wallet to help the most vulnerable. Last month she worked with Jay-Z\u2019s foundation to donate $2m to support undocumented workers, prisoners, homeless people, the elderly and children of frontline health workers in Los Angeles and New York. Fertility treatments delayed amid pandemic The coronavirus crisis has shuttered most fertility clinics, leading to heartache and uncertainty for people needing help to conceive. \u201cI\u2019m numb at this point,\u201d one woman told CBS News. \u201cIt\u2019s the norm with IVF that there\u2019s ups and downs, but you never get used to the phone call that says \u2026 you can\u2019t move on.\u201d There have been a lot of jokes about a \u2018quarantine baby boom\u2019, but for some people an extended lockdown may mean they\u2019ll never be able to conceive. Kayleigh McEnany is Trump\u2019s new press secretary Kayleigh McEnany is Trump\u2019s fourth spokesperson and replaces Stephanie Grisham, who did not hold a single press conference during her time on the job. As you would expect from a mouthpiece for Trump, McEnany has a history of spouting racist lies. She has embraced birtherism and once tweeted: \u201cHow I Met Your Brother -- Never mind, forgot he\u2019s still in that hut in Kenya. #ObamaTVShows.\u201d Rental rooms to avoid \u2018coronavirus divorces\u2019 Kasoku, a Japanese version of Airbnb, has found a new revenue stream during the Covid-19 crisis: avoiding-divorces-as-a-service. The startup is offering accommodation for frustrated husbands or wives sick of being at home with their spouses. Your fully furnished unit comes with a 30-minute divorce consultation. \u2018I will never jeopardize the beans\u2019 It\u2019s probably fake, nevertheless this quarrel over quarantine beans had the internet making a lot of noise this week. On that note: have a good weekend.",

      "body": "<p>Twelve months ago Alice Powell described her return to motor racing as a new lease of life. After four years without a drive she grasped her chance in the all-female W Series with unbridled verve. However, with her career resurgent the opportunity to build on her success has been wrenched away by the coronavirus-induced sporting shutdown. It has struck Powell as a body blow. \u201cThe thought of having another year not racing is pretty gutting,\u201d she says bluntly.</p> <p>Powell fears there may be no racing this year but is emphatic that if that is necessary to defeat the virus, then every sport must take it on the chin. \u201cMy other half thinks that we might not go racing at all,\u201d she says. \u201cI say: \u2018Don\u2019t be silly,\u2019 but in the back of my mind I think he could be right. That is really upsetting because last year was my time back racing after being out for a long time.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/apr/10/vacuum-month-sport-that-never-was-barney-ronay\">Everything exists in a vacuum in the month that never was | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After lack of funding forced her out of racing to the extent that she believed her career was all but over, last year Powell finished the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/may/03/jamie-chadwick-sets-practice-pace-in-encouraging-start-to-w-series\" title=\"\">inaugural W Series</a> on a high. The 27-year-old from Oxford won the final round at Brands Hatch and was third in the championship. Her performances caught the attention, new seats opened up and another season in the W Series beckoned. But the promise of 2020 lies in tatters and the outbreak may yet finish it off.</p> <p>It has clearly been a major disappointment and she admits to finding the situation depressing, but there is no pause as Powell immediately acknowledges the bigger picture. \u201cIf it means we can fight the virus, stop it from spreading, prevent illness and deaths then of course we should not go racing,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cPeople\u2019s health is much more important. Clearly, there are far more important things in the world than us getting back in a car.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad24844a1a40ca2383b110e76b424919cbf7b7fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad24844a1a40ca2383b110e76b424919cbf7b7fc/0_95_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Celebrating victory in the W Series race at Brands Hatch last season.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Celebrating victory in the W Series race at Brands Hatch last season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Childs/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhen races started to get cancelled it really hit home. But it is absolutely the right decision. You can put so many lives at risk and we need to stop this spreading. The number of people at a racetrack, hundreds and thousands of people, you can\u2019t keep social distance at a racetrack. So it is the right thing to do.\u201d</p> <p>The W Series is no exception to the sporting lockdown. The DTM \u2013 the German touring car championship \u2013 to which it is a support series has postponed its opening three meetings and discussions are continuing on if and when they may begin racing. Two W Series rounds were due to take place at Formula One meetings this year, in the US and Mexico, a real step forward that is now in jeopardy.</p> <p>Last year\u2019s inaugural season offered female drivers the chance to compete in F3 cars for a championship where the series covered all the costs, the intent being to promote their talent and help their careers move forward. For Powell it worked handsomely: she became one of several competitors whose subsequent success comprehensively proved the series is making a difference.</p> <p>Before the end of the season Powell was offered a drive in the US in the IMSA sports car championship. That was followed by a contract for a full-time seat in the Jaguar I-pace eTrophy series that supports Formula E meetings. Before its calendar also came to halt Powell had made her mark, with two podium finishes helping her to third in the standings, while in February she was given a shot in the Formula E rookie test for Envision Virgin Racing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d4f5622f129208b81af4997a73f03856787a5500\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4f5622f129208b81af4997a73f03856787a5500/6_120_1844_2305/800.jpg\" alt=\"Alice Powell pictured at the age of eight during her first season of karting.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alice Powell pictured at the age of eight during her first season of karting.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stuart Clarke/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cMy name wasn\u2019t out there, when I wasn\u2019t racing,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople started to forget about me, I hadn\u2019t been around, then the W Series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/apr/27/alice-powell-w-series-opportunity-back-out-racing\" title=\"\">came along</a> and the attraction of interest from around the world was incredible.

      "bodyText": "Twelve months ago Alice Powell described her return to motor racing as a new lease of life. After four years without a drive she grasped her chance in the all-female W Series with unbridled verve. However, with her career resurgent the opportunity to build on her success has been wrenched away by the coronavirus-induced sporting shutdown. It has struck Powell as a body blow. \u201cThe thought of having another year not racing is pretty gutting,\u201d she says bluntly. Powell fears there may be no racing this year but is emphatic that if that is necessary to defeat the virus, then every sport must take it on the chin. \u201cMy other half thinks that we might not go racing at all,\u201d she says. \u201cI say: \u2018Don\u2019t be silly,\u2019 but in the back of my mind I think he could be right. That is really upsetting because last year was my time back racing after being out for a long time.\u201d After lack of funding forced her out of racing to the extent that she believed her career was all but over, last year Powell finished the inaugural W Series on a high. The 27-year-old from Oxford won the final round at Brands Hatch and was third in the championship. Her performances caught the attention, new seats opened up and another season in the W Series beckoned. But the promise of 2020 lies in tatters and the outbreak may yet finish it off. It has clearly been a major disappointment and she admits to finding the situation depressing, but there is no pause as Powell immediately acknowledges the bigger picture. \u201cIf it means we can fight the virus, stop it from spreading, prevent illness and deaths then of course we should not go racing,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople\u2019s health is much more important. Clearly, there are far more important things in the world than us getting back in a car. \u201cWhen races started to get cancelled it really hit home. But it is absolutely the right decision. You can put so many lives at risk and we need to stop this spreading. The number of people at a racetrack, hundreds and thousands of people, you can\u2019t keep social distance at a racetrack. So it is the right thing to do.\u201d The W Series is no exception to the sporting lockdown. The DTM \u2013 the German touring car championship \u2013 to which it is a support series has postponed its opening three meetings and discussions are continuing on if and when they may begin racing. Two W Series rounds were due to take place at Formula One meetings this year, in the US and Mexico, a real step forward that is now in jeopardy. Last year\u2019s inaugural season offered female drivers the chance to compete in F3 cars for a championship where the series covered all the costs, the intent being to promote their talent and help their careers move forward. For Powell it worked handsomely: she became one of several competitors whose subsequent success comprehensively proved the series is making a difference. Before the end of the season Powell was offered a drive in the US in the IMSA sports car championship. That was followed by a contract for a full-time seat in the Jaguar I-pace eTrophy series that supports Formula E meetings. Before its calendar also came to halt Powell had made her mark, with two podium finishes helping her to third in the standings, while in February she was given a shot in the Formula E rookie test for Envision Virgin Racing. \u201cMy name wasn\u2019t out there, when I wasn\u2019t racing,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople started to forget about me, I hadn\u2019t been around, then the W Series came along and the attraction of interest from around the world was incredible. That surely had to help. Without the W Series I probably wouldn\u2019t have had the drives.\u201d Powell has been racing since she was eight. Her talent was recognised early yet despite success across a range of championships including GP3, she did not receive backing and as the money dried up so did the opportunities for her to compete. She continued as a racing coach but was working with her father in house renovations when the W Series offered her a second chance. It was a life-changing moment, brought home recently in a moment of quiet reflection during the lockdown. \u201cI was looking back through photos on my phone,\u201d she says. \u201cI have lots of photos of my dog and that kind of stuff and then it hit January last year and it\u2019s just all racing.\u201d Powell is as engaging and enthusiastic as she is sharp and competitive on the track.

      "bodyText": "People in parks across the UK were urged this weekend by police, rangers and volunteers to follow physical distancing guidance after some green spaces were reopened following public pressure. The government has warned people to continue adhering to the lockdown measures, despite the sunny weather and the desire to see friends and family over the Easter bank holiday weekend. Many local authorities took the decision to close green spaces following the introduction of lockdown measures due to concerns over public safety, prompting criticism that those living in crowded conditions would have nowhere to go to exercise and enjoy green space. Victoria Park in east London reopened on Saturday after more than a fortnight closed, and the local mayor said he was frustrated it had taken so long to reopen it. Local police and the council were said to have taken the decision jointly after some visitors were \u201cprovocative and hostile\u201d to officers and rangers enforcing physical distancing rules, but John Biggs, Labour mayor of Tower Hamlets, suggested the Metropolitan police held up the process of reopening the park. \u201cI\u2019m frustrated it\u2019s been shut for a while,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cWe made a joint decision and we needed to reassure each other that everything was in the right place.\u201d Biggs said there had been a number of incidents where people were not taking physical distancing seriously and that he hoped these events did not repeat themselves.

      "body": "<p>Matthew McConaughey became <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/07/matthew-mcconaughey-bingo-night-isolating-texans\">a bingo caller</a> for the residents of an assisted living facility in Texas last week and I started to realise that it\u2019s all gone a bit 1970s, hasn\u2019t it? I don\u2019t mean that sitcoms are racist again or that bin bags are piling up in the streets, although, for those of us who are lucky enough to be able to work from home while semi-dressed, the concept of a regular work week is starting to lose its shape, like a baggy old pair of pants. Which, incidentally, may also have been deemed a suitable work outfit, not so long ago.</p> <p>Like seemingly everyone else on the internet, celebrities have begun to put a retro filter on their lockdown activities. McConaughey playing bingo is a big 70s vibe, but the pinched optimism of <em>Good Life</em> potential is everywhere, which might be why <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/apr/08/felicity-cloake-perfect-lockdown-cooking-recipes-pea-soup-fishcakes-dal-tomato-sauce-pilaf-banana-bread-blueberry-muffins-oatcakes-summer-pudding\">banana bread</a> is having such a moment. I saw two members of Little Mix on the BBC talking about learning how to cook, baking and calling their mums. Victoria Beckham is <a href=\"https://www.hellomagazine.com/fashion/celebrity-style/2020040687564/victoria-beckham-tie-dyes-designer-t-shirts-isolation/\">tie-dying</a> T-shirts.</p> <p>This practical turn marks a shift from the high hopes some of us had for using our time well when the lockdown began. It was all self-improvement this and reading list that. I talked about starting a book club. I signed up for a four-week course in Irish language and culture, but it\u2019s been three weeks and I\u2019m languishing at 15% of week one: <em>Rebecca is ainm dom</em>. Instead, I\u2019m hoovering up articles that say it\u2019s normal to spend entire days and nights refreshing news pages in a state of idle despair, because these aren\u2019t ideal circumstances to do much of anything else, with apologies to key workers, who must be thoroughly over people moaning about boredom and these endless catch-up guides to all the telly you simply must watch.</p> <p>As hashtag content goes, in the watchability stakes, a low-level hum of inert worry is more <a href=\"https://www.nowness.com/story/andy-warhols-sleep\">Andy Warhol\u2019s</a> <em>Sleep</em> than <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>. I\u2019ll take the chirpy do-something celebrity stories over the ones carping on about mansion life \u2013 oh, the horror, which garden shall I choose? \u2013 because at least it throws up some curveballs. Would McConaughey have found his calling as a caller if he had not been forced to take time off from movies? Though I think he missed a trick by not doing it all in a <em>True Detective</em> mumble. I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s a charity money-maker to be had in a Zoom-able edition of Matthew McConaughey\u2019s Bingo Noir.

I think it\u2019s because, coming from a small town, theatre wasn\u2019t an option until I was an adult, bar a school trip to see <em>A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream</em> in glamorous Leicester. The last thing I went to this year was the brilliant <em>Scenes With Girls</em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/jan/22/scenes-with-girls-review-royal-court\">at London\u2019s Royal Court</a> in January and that\u2019s it, for now.</p> <p>Still, the internet is finding ways to bring the theatre into our living rooms, while attempting to prop up an industry that is, like so many others, struggling to survive. Phoebe Waller-Bridge has let us stream the <em>Fleabag</em> <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/a32062582/fleabag-stage-show-stream-online/\">stage show</a>, filmed at Wyndham\u2019s theatre in the West End, for which you can pay <a href=\"http://ondemand.sohotheatre.com/\">various amounts</a>, and the proceeds will be split between charities supporting the NHS, the National Emergency Trust and actors and theatre freelancers.

      "bodyText": "Matthew McConaughey became a bingo caller for the residents of an assisted living facility in Texas last week and I started to realise that it\u2019s all gone a bit 1970s, hasn\u2019t it? I don\u2019t mean that sitcoms are racist again or that bin bags are piling up in the streets, although, for those of us who are lucky enough to be able to work from home while semi-dressed, the concept of a regular work week is starting to lose its shape, like a baggy old pair of pants. Which, incidentally, may also have been deemed a suitable work outfit, not so long ago. Like seemingly everyone else on the internet, celebrities have begun to put a retro filter on their lockdown activities. McConaughey playing bingo is a big 70s vibe, but the pinched optimism of Good Life potential is everywhere, which might be why banana bread is having such a moment. I saw two members of Little Mix on the BBC talking about learning how to cook, baking and calling their mums. Victoria Beckham is tie-dying T-shirts. This practical turn marks a shift from the high hopes some of us had for using our time well when the lockdown began. It was all self-improvement this and reading list that. I talked about starting a book club. I signed up for a four-week course in Irish language and culture, but it\u2019s been three weeks and I\u2019m languishing at 15% of week one: Rebecca is ainm dom. Instead, I\u2019m hoovering up articles that say it\u2019s normal to spend entire days and nights refreshing news pages in a state of idle despair, because these aren\u2019t ideal circumstances to do much of anything else, with apologies to key workers, who must be thoroughly over people moaning about boredom and these endless catch-up guides to all the telly you simply must watch. As hashtag content goes, in the watchability stakes, a low-level hum of inert worry is more Andy Warhol\u2019s Sleep than Avengers: Endgame. I\u2019ll take the chirpy do-something celebrity stories over the ones carping on about mansion life \u2013 oh, the horror, which garden shall I choose? \u2013 because at least it throws up some curveballs. Would McConaughey have found his calling as a caller if he had not been forced to take time off from movies? Though I think he missed a trick by not doing it all in a True Detective mumble. I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s a charity money-maker to be had in a Zoom-able edition of Matthew McConaughey\u2019s Bingo Noir. Severed Legs Eleven, anyone? Phoebe Waller-Bridge: our living rooms are her stage now In more normal times, I go to the theatre on a handful of occasions a year and I always appreciate the ceremony and specialness of it. I think it\u2019s because, coming from a small town, theatre wasn\u2019t an option until I was an adult, bar a school trip to see A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream in glamorous Leicester. The last thing I went to this year was the brilliant Scenes With Girls at London\u2019s Royal Court in January and that\u2019s it, for now. Still, the internet is finding ways to bring the theatre into our living rooms, while attempting to prop up an industry that is, like so many others, struggling to survive. Phoebe Waller-Bridge has let us stream the Fleabag stage show, filmed at Wyndham\u2019s theatre in the West End, for which you can pay various amounts, and the proceeds will be split between charities supporting the NHS, the National Emergency Trust and actors and theatre freelancers. The National Theatre is into its second week of putting a classic performance up on YouTube, with an option to donate, if you can. Last week, it was James Corden\u2019s slapstick vehicle One Man, Two Guvnors; this week it\u2019s Jane Eyre. There are few things seemingly less suited to being enjoyed not live than theatre, which thrives on being seen as it unfolds, but in my flat we are turning these streams into a night out, without the \u201cout\u201d part. We\u2019ve got a cheap old projector and, after moving furniture to clear some wall space, with a glass of wine and a bit of imagination, it just about works.

      "bodyText": "When Debenhams filed for administration last week, it wasn\u2019t just suppliers of its stock, who are owed cash, that felt the pain. There are 22,000 jobs at risk if the retailer cannot be rescued and many of its 142 stores are unlikely to reopen, spelling more trouble for British high streets. And there is also a network of landlords who rely on quarterly rent payments from their shops. The outlook for these landlords was dark enough before the pandemic brought the British economy to its knees. More than 16,000 stores closed last year and the enforced shutdown of cafes, pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops is expected to result in thousands more pulling down the shutters for good. Since pre-industrial times, landlords and tenants have adhered to a schedule of quarterly rent payments, when annual commercial or agricultural rents were payable in four equal instalments on the \u201cquarter days\u201d, linked to religious festivals. The most recent payday, the second-quarter payment date of 25 March, was a far from harmonious occasion, however. Hammerson, owner of malls such as Birmingham\u2019s Bullring and Brent Cross in London, said it had only received 37% of the rent due for the second quarter. Its competitor Intu Properties, which owns the Trafford Centre in Manchester, received just 29% of second-quarter rents on the due date. London &amp; Associated Properties, which owns the Orchard Square shopping centre in Sheffield, said it had collected about 50% of rent due. It is not just Debenhams, New Look and Sir Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia group \u2013 to name just a few of the retailers in deep trouble \u2013 that are seeking help on rent. Vast, profitable businesses such as fast-fashion retailer Primark, sportswear chain JD Sports and Burger King are also refusing to pay their landlords the rent they are due.

Some landlords are furious that certain tenants have interpreted this as permission not to pay.

      "body": "<h2><strong>I\u2019m confused by all these new words\u2026</strong></h2> \n<p>Seldom have we had to get to grips so quickly with a slew of new terms and abbreviations. Had you told most people last Christmas that soon they would be WFH, they might have considered it a cryptic insult. Most probably had only a vague idea what an epidemiologist did or what a ventilator was, while PPE was (if anything) a soft Oxford degree favoured by politicians, rather than the personal protective equipment now urgently needed in hospitals. Few could have told you the difference between an epidemic (the outbreak and rapid spread of an infectious disease through a population) and a pandemic (an epidemic that occurs over a very wide geographical area, perhaps the whole world).</p> \n<p>Even the terminology of the virus itself is challenging: the coronaviruses are a family of pathogens, this particular one (being related to that which caused the Sars outbreak of 2002-3) denoted Sars-CoV-2. Covid-19 is the respiratory syndrome it causes, much as Aids is to HIV. A vaccine confers immunity (probably just for a limited period) to the virus; an antiviral interferes with viral replication in the body to slow or arrest its bad effects. Antibiotics attack bacterial pathogens, not viruses, but may be needed with Covid-19 to treat secondary infections such as pneumonia that take advantage of a compromised immune system. Expect to hear lots in the coming weeks about serological tests, which look for proteins in the blood that signal past infection, even if the virus has long since been cleared from the body. Those tests are under development, and they will provide vital information on how widespread infection has been \u2013 and whether many (or few) have had Covid-19 without any symptoms at all.</p> \n<p>While comparisons with wartime and the blitz spirit are deeply misleading, one analogy holds: the second world war slogan \u201cLoose talk can cost lives\u201d is apt here too.</p> \n<h2><strong>What\u2019s an important number and what\u2019s not?</strong></h2> \n<p>What makes the coronavirus so deadly is a combination of two numbers. The reproduction number (denoted R<sub>0</sub>) is the average number of people an infected individual goes on to infect in the absence of any social distancing or quarantining; the mortality rate is the percentage of infected people who die.</p> \n<p>Both depend on the biology of the virus, but neither is fixed. R<sub>0</sub> for the coronavirus is about 2.5 to three (compared with 1.3 for common flu), but that\u2019s an average \u2013 it varies from person to person. Reducing person-to-person contacts cuts the <em>effective</em> reproduction number R \u2013 and the epidemic will decay if it drops below one. The mortality rate, meanwhile, depends on the availability of healthcare for people with the most serious symptoms: it is about 0.4% in Germany, 4.6% in the UK, and more than 10% in Iran.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e8a5d369-ef41-4b4a-adf8-f34313e47e32\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you've started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should&nbsp;<b>stay at home for at least 7 days</b>.<br></p>\n    <p>If you live with other people,&nbsp;<b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p>After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019m confused by all these new words\u2026 Seldom have we had to get to grips so quickly with a slew of new terms and abbreviations. Had you told most people last Christmas that soon they would be WFH, they might have considered it a cryptic insult. Most probably had only a vague idea what an epidemiologist did or what a ventilator was, while PPE was (if anything) a soft Oxford degree favoured by politicians, rather than the personal protective equipment now urgently needed in hospitals. Few could have told you the difference between an epidemic (the outbreak and rapid spread of an infectious disease through a population) and a pandemic (an epidemic that occurs over a very wide geographical area, perhaps the whole world). Even the terminology of the virus itself is challenging: the coronaviruses are a family of pathogens, this particular one (being related to that which caused the Sars outbreak of 2002-3) denoted Sars-CoV-2. Covid-19 is the respiratory syndrome it causes, much as Aids is to HIV. A vaccine confers immunity (probably just for a limited period) to the virus; an antiviral interferes with viral replication in the body to slow or arrest its bad effects. Antibiotics attack bacterial pathogens, not viruses, but may be needed with Covid-19 to treat secondary infections such as pneumonia that take advantage of a compromised immune system. Expect to hear lots in the coming weeks about serological tests, which look for proteins in the blood that signal past infection, even if the virus has long since been cleared from the body. Those tests are under development, and they will provide vital information on how widespread infection has been \u2013 and whether many (or few) have had Covid-19 without any symptoms at all. While comparisons with wartime and the blitz spirit are deeply misleading, one analogy holds: the second world war slogan \u201cLoose talk can cost lives\u201d is apt here too. What\u2019s an important number and what\u2019s not? What makes the coronavirus so deadly is a combination of two numbers. The reproduction number (denoted R0) is the average number of people an infected individual goes on to infect in the absence of any social distancing or quarantining; the mortality rate is the percentage of infected people who die. Both depend on the biology of the virus, but neither is fixed. R0 for the coronavirus is about 2.5 to three (compared with 1.3 for common flu), but that\u2019s an average \u2013 it varies from person to person. Reducing person-to-person contacts cuts the effective reproduction number R \u2013 and the epidemic will decay if it drops below one. The mortality rate, meanwhile, depends on the availability of healthcare for people with the most serious symptoms: it is about 0.4% in Germany, 4.6% in the UK, and more than 10% in Iran. The bad news is that low testing rates means it is virtually impossible to track the progress of the virus, and can give a false sense of security. The good news is that if more people have the virus than we know, the mortality rate will be lower than the \u201cofficial\u201d value. There have been speculations that the extent of infection might be much greater than thought, and that most cases don\u2019t even show symptoms. But this idea is hard to reconcile with observations from countries with extensive testing, which seem to indicate that few people get the virus without knowing. I heard a story on social media. How do I find out if it\u2019s true?

The World Health Organization has said there could be a \u201cdeadly resurgence\u201d of the coronavirus if countermeasures are lifted too soon, while one of the Spanish government\u2019s own experts has said he thought it would have been sensible to keep non-essential workers at home for longer. Speaking on Saturday afternoon, the country\u2019s health minister, Salvador Illa, said Spain remained in strict lockdown and that people were only allowed out to go to work or to buy food or medicine. \u201cWe still have very, very drastic restrictions in place,\u201d he added. Illa said that the ban on non-essential workers travelling to work had only ever been a temporary measure intended to reduce the pressure on Spain\u2019s overstretched intensive care units. The minister insisted that all decisions were \u201ctaken on the basis of consensus\u201d and that the government followed the recommendations of experts. Illa also said the current lockdown could go on for a few more weeks at least. \u201cAs the prime minister has already said, it\u2019s very probable that these measures will be in force beyond 26 April,\u201d he said. \u201cSpain is not de-escalating; we remain in lockdown.\u201d He said the government was following the disease\u2019s movement on a daily basis and adapting its response accordingly. \u201cWe are maintaining the current measures - and haven\u2019t ruled anything out,\u201d he said. \u201cThe information we have at the moment confirms a slowing down of the disease and the growth in new cases is much lower than it was last week, or two weeks ago, or a month ago. \u201cBut today we still have 4,830 new cases and that means we need to stay in lockdown.

I\u2019ll save for another day the burgeoning celebrity-chatting-to-celebrity-over-shonky-wifi subset, and concentrate instead on the brand-new coronavirus podcasts. There are so many! Ideal for news junkies. Not so good for anxiety bunnies.</p> <p>The most interesting and direct is <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p08888tq\">The Coronavirus Diaries</a></strong>, a new weekly podcast from BBC Sounds and 5 Live. Several frontline healthcare workers report on their days, using their phones to record their everyday, ever-changing challenges. Vanessa, who works in a care home on the Wirral, talks about how hard it is for residents not to have visitors and what to do when supermarkets won\u2019t let you order in bulk online. Two tins of beans will not cut it. She\u2019s had to find different ways of getting food supplies, at the same time as rejigging her workers\u2019 shifts. Her deputy has been told to self-isolate for 12 weeks, living on \u00a395.85 a week.</p> <p>From an intensive care unit in south London, doctor Andrew explains how hard his job has become. It\u2019s hot in the operating theatre, wearing full PPE. He describes intubation: \u201cSo much more challenging to do when you\u2019re in a full gown\u2026 all of the virus-infested sputum was going to be aerosolised into my face.\u201d He can\u2019t see his colleagues\u2019 faces or hear them speak, so everyone is shouting at one another. His shifts are getting longer and longer as more doctors and nurses have to self-isolate in case they have the virus (still no tests for them, unbelievably). He is getting sores from his face-mask.</p> <p>And on Merseyside, Carmel, a nurse, has decided to move out of her family household, away from her parents, her sister and her son, in case she brings the virus back home with her. She cries as she does so, and so do we\u2026 Michelle Dignan presents this podcast, a little intrusively. We don\u2019t really need to be told how to react to these reports.</p> <p>For more conventional journalism, try LBC\u2019s daily corona pod, <strong><a href=\"https://www.globalplayer.com/podcasts/42KrPr/\">Coronavirus UK</a></strong>, in which Nick Ferrari, breakfast broadcasting terrier, gets sharp with those in charge of the UK response to the virus. Ferrari nurtures his relationships with ministers, and this show pulls in many more prominent politicians than the <em>Today</em> programme. Matt Hancock has been on quite a bit, as have Michael Gove and Jeremy Hunt, who chairs the health select committee. They are not let off the hook: Ferrari is the master of the precise, awkward question. LBC, as a station, is infatuated with coronavirus, its new post-Brexit obsession, and is covering it well but manically, fuelled by listeners phoning in, as well as politicians. Episodes are 25-35 minutes long.</p> <p>The World Service offers the <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w13xtv39/episodes/downloads\">Coronavirus Global Update</a></strong>. We hear about China, Spain, Italy, France, the US, from international correspondents, and this five-minute podcast gives an excellent, snappy overview. It\u2019s a headline-only news show, in ye olde BBC manner, which is reassuring in itself. The other main BBC Covid-19 offering, <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/series/p05299nl\">The Coronavirus Newscast</a></strong>, is of the modern BBC manner: this is <em>Brexitcast</em>, but coronafied. Laura Kuenssberg, Adam Fleming, Fergus Walsh and Chris Mason present from their various homes, with all the banter that engenders. If you\u2019re after an upbeat, insider-y show, this is the one for you.</p> <p>There are other daily shows, from ITV, Sky and the <em>Telegraph</em>, all of which are OK. <strong><a href=\"https://news.sky.com/topic/podcasts-8135\">Sky\u2019s</a></strong> is usually hosted by Dermot Murnaghan and has a dramatic feel, with swooshy music and inserted quotes from TV programmes. There\u2019s the occasional, irritating microphone peak and scuffle, caused by incorrect mic technique and unadjusted levels (someone give Murnaghan a pop-shield!). <strong><a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2020-03-19/coronavirus-what-you-need-to-know-itv-news-podcast-with-information-advice-and-analysis-on-the-pandemic/\">ITV\u2019s</a></strong> has Mary Nightingale, also occasionally mic-popping, and is a varied programme, as they all are: sometimes we get health correspondents, sometimes politicians, sometimes TV clips. Still, I would watch the TV headlines rather than listen to the spin-off podcasts. <strong><a href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9yc3MuYXJ0MTkuY29tL2Nvcm9uYXZpcnVzLXRoZS1sYXRlc3Q%3D\">The Telegraph\u2019s</a></strong> is less theatrical than its TV counterparts, but is a far easier listen. Perfectly presented by the fabulously named, fruitily voiced Theodora Louloudis, it\u2019s only around 10 minutes long and gives you all the headlines you need.</p> <h2>Three comforting non-coronavirus listens</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://play.acast.com/s/the-bunker/f5eeccfe-ed4d-4fdb-aac1-fd7a181723f6\">The Bunker Daily: Nigella\u2019s Lockdown Kitchen</a></strong><strong><br></strong><em>The Bunker</em> is not, by nature, a comfort listen, being a clever, up-to-the-minute discussion show that has grown out of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jun/11/remainiacs-today-womans-hour-its-a-fair-cop-radio-review\">Remainiacs</a></em>, a clever, up-to-the-minute anti-Brexit discussion show. Its weekly offering brings together the very smart Ian Dunt, Naomi Smith, Dorian Lynskey and Alex Andreou to discuss big issues. But its <em>Daily</em> show is more varied and this episode, where Nigella Lawson talks to Andreou, her friend, is a truly lovely thing. Lawson speaks so beautifully about food, creativity in the kitchen and lockdown. I hate cooking and I loved this episode.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theallusionist.org/allusionist/tranquillusionist\">The Tranquillusionist </a></strong><br>Helen Zaltzman has shifted the focus of her podcast <em><a href=\"https://www.theallusionist.org/\">The Allusionist,</a></em> to calm us down in these stressful times. In the first <em>Tranquillusionist </em>show, she reads out soothing words in alphabetical order, accompanied by gentle music. \u201cCuddle, cumulonimbus, custard, cwtch,\u201d says Zaltzman, and things feel instantly better. In the second episode she gives us Imagine by John Lennon, but with the words in reverse alphabetical order (I really love this one). And in the third, she reads out the annual winners of best in show at the Westminster dog show, starting in 1907: \u201cWarren Remedy, a smooth fox terrier\u201d. Lovely.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/nothing-much-happens-bedtime-stories-for-grown-ups/id1378040733?mt=2\">Nothing Much Happens </a><br></strong>This is a podcast designed to make you fall asleep. Yoga and meditation teacher Kathryn Nicolai writes all the stories and reads them out, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/oct/06/sensory-videos-relaxation\">classic A</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/oct/06/sensory-videos-relaxation\">SMR fashion</a>. Her voice is close to the mic, with a neutral American accent, and she reads the story twice, a little slower the second time. Slow tales about going to a cabin in the woods, about making cups of tea, about watching winter through the window. The podcast trains your brain, over time, into falling asleep. It slightly drives me mad, but I know a lot of people for whom this show really works.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Coronavirus Diaries (Radio 5 Live/ BBC Sounds) Coronavirus UK: LBC Daily Update LBC Coronavirus Global Update World Service/ BBC Sounds The Coronavirus Newscast BBC Sounds The Daily With Dermot Murnaghan sky.com Coronavirus: What You Need to Know itv.com Coronavirus: The Latest The Telegraph Podcasts are blossoming in this lockdown spring \u2013 a mixed blessing for an audio critic. I\u2019ll save for another day the burgeoning celebrity-chatting-to-celebrity-over-shonky-wifi subset, and concentrate instead on the brand-new coronavirus podcasts. There are so many! Ideal for news junkies. Not so good for anxiety bunnies. The most interesting and direct is The Coronavirus Diaries, a new weekly podcast from BBC Sounds and 5 Live. Several frontline healthcare workers report on their days, using their phones to record their everyday, ever-changing challenges. Vanessa, who works in a care home on the Wirral, talks about how hard it is for residents not to have visitors and what to do when supermarkets won\u2019t let you order in bulk online. Two tins of beans will not cut it. She\u2019s had to find different ways of getting food supplies, at the same time as rejigging her workers\u2019 shifts. Her deputy has been told to self-isolate for 12 weeks, living on \u00a395.85 a week. From an intensive care unit in south London, doctor Andrew explains how hard his job has become. It\u2019s hot in the operating theatre, wearing full PPE. He describes intubation: \u201cSo much more challenging to do when you\u2019re in a full gown\u2026 all of the virus-infested sputum was going to be aerosolised into my face.\u201d He can\u2019t see his colleagues\u2019 faces or hear them speak, so everyone is shouting at one another. His shifts are getting longer and longer as more doctors and nurses have to self-isolate in case they have the virus (still no tests for them, unbelievably). He is getting sores from his face-mask. And on Merseyside, Carmel, a nurse, has decided to move out of her family household, away from her parents, her sister and her son, in case she brings the virus back home with her. She cries as she does so, and so do we\u2026 Michelle Dignan presents this podcast, a little intrusively. We don\u2019t really need to be told how to react to these reports. For more conventional journalism, try LBC\u2019s daily corona pod, Coronavirus UK, in which Nick Ferrari, breakfast broadcasting terrier, gets sharp with those in charge of the UK response to the virus. Ferrari nurtures his relationships with ministers, and this show pulls in many more prominent politicians than the Today programme. Matt Hancock has been on quite a bit, as have Michael Gove and Jeremy Hunt, who chairs the health select committee. They are not let off the hook: Ferrari is the master of the precise, awkward question. LBC, as a station, is infatuated with coronavirus, its new post-Brexit obsession, and is covering it well but manically, fuelled by listeners phoning in, as well as politicians. Episodes are 25-35 minutes long. The World Service offers the Coronavirus Global Update. We hear about China, Spain, Italy, France, the US, from international correspondents, and this five-minute podcast gives an excellent, snappy overview. It\u2019s a headline-only news show, in ye olde BBC manner, which is reassuring in itself. The other main BBC Covid-19 offering, The Coronavirus Newscast, is of the modern BBC manner: this is Brexitcast, but coronafied. Laura Kuenssberg, Adam Fleming, Fergus Walsh and Chris Mason present from their various homes, with all the banter that engenders. If you\u2019re after an upbeat, insider-y show, this is the one for you. There are other daily shows, from ITV, Sky and the Telegraph, all of which are OK. Sky\u2019s is usually hosted by Dermot Murnaghan and has a dramatic feel, with swooshy music and inserted quotes from TV programmes. There\u2019s the occasional, irritating microphone peak and scuffle, caused by incorrect mic technique and unadjusted levels (someone give Murnaghan a pop-shield!). ITV\u2019s has Mary Nightingale, also occasionally mic-popping, and is a varied programme, as they all are: sometimes we get health correspondents, sometimes politicians, sometimes TV clips. Still, I would watch the TV headlines rather than listen to the spin-off podcasts. The Telegraph\u2019s is less theatrical than its TV counterparts, but is a far easier listen. Perfectly presented by the fabulously named, fruitily voiced Theodora Louloudis, it\u2019s only around 10 minutes long and gives you all the headlines you need. Three comforting non-coronavirus listens The Bunker Daily: Nigella\u2019s Lockdown Kitchen The Bunker is not, by nature, a comfort listen, being a clever, up-to-the-minute discussion show that has grown out of Remainiacs, a clever, up-to-the-minute anti-Brexit discussion show. Its weekly offering brings together the very smart Ian Dunt, Naomi Smith, Dorian Lynskey and Alex Andreou to discuss big issues. But its Daily show is more varied and this episode, where Nigella Lawson talks to Andreou, her friend, is a truly lovely thing. Lawson speaks so beautifully about food, creativity in the kitchen and lockdown. I hate cooking and I loved this episode. The Tranquillusionist Helen Zaltzman has shifted the focus of her podcast The Allusionist, to calm us down in these stressful times. In the first Tranquillusionist show, she reads out soothing words in alphabetical order, accompanied by gentle music. \u201cCuddle, cumulonimbus, custard, cwtch,\u201d says Zaltzman, and things feel instantly better. In the second episode she gives us Imagine by John Lennon, but with the words in reverse alphabetical order (I really love this one). And in the third, she reads out the annual winners of best in show at the Westminster dog show, starting in 1907: \u201cWarren Remedy, a smooth fox terrier\u201d. Lovely. Nothing Much Happens This is a podcast designed to make you fall asleep. Yoga and meditation teacher Kathryn Nicolai writes all the stories and reads them out, in classic ASMR fashion. Her voice is close to the mic, with a neutral American accent, and she reads the story twice, a little slower the second time. Slow tales about going to a cabin in the woods, about making cups of tea, about watching winter through the window. The podcast trains your brain, over time, into falling asleep. It slightly drives me mad, but I know a lot of people for whom this show really works.",

Even better-equipped systems in China, the US, UK and much of Europe have struggled to cope.</p> <p>For this reason, whichever way they turn, sub-Saharan governments are threatened by a financial collapse. Aid charities have already called for the IMF and World Bank to engineer a debt write-off to prevent such a situation arising. So far, the answer has been extra loans, albeit at low or zero interest rates, to bridge funding gaps in healthcare provision expected once the virus begins to make inroads.</p> <p>One of the reasons for resisting write-offs can be found in the way debts have built up over the past 15 years. Almost from the moment the G7 wrote off a large slice of developing-world debt at the Gleneagles conference in 2005, African nations have allowed their debt-to-GDP ratios to inch upwards. Encouraged by the World Bank, they have sought loans from major commercial banks and the bond markets.</p> <p>In the past six or seven years, the emphasis has switched to borrowing from China, in part to benefit from \u201cfree\u201d advice on infrastructure projects, built by Chinese contractors. So a debt write-off by international public bodies like the IMF merely allows developing-world countries to keep paying their exorbitant private-sector debt bills and Chinese-backed development loans.</p> <p>Another barrier is the lack, with a few exceptions, of any transformation in the governance of sub-Saharan states, despite 20 years of solid (albeit debt-fuelled) growth.</p> <p>Many of the executives in aid agencies involved in debt relief make the point that corruption remains rife and inequality has increased, aided by developed-world lawyers, accountants and bankers who help African oligarchs stash their gains overseas tax-free.</p> <p>Then there are the pre-colonial tribes and nations, which cut across today\u2019s borders and remain strong. They prevent post-colonial nations from developing strong governance and tackling corruption.</p> <p>A repeat of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jul/08/g8.development1\" title=\"\">Gleneagles deal</a> is difficult when so little appears to have changed in the meantime. Fatigue among donors, and a sense that money hasn\u2019t solved much so far, add to a sense of despair and fuel inaction.</p> <p>Yet, this is not a time for considering the moral hazards. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/coronavirus-global-leaders-urge-g20-to-tackle-twin-health-and-economic-crises\" title=\"\">The G20 must act quickly</a>, even out of self-interest. This is an interconnected world, and debts rebound if they are not dealt with as part of a programme that maintains confidence in the financial system.</p> <p>To wait for another debt default in sub-Saharan Africa will serve no one\u2019s purpose. A rescue should be put in place now, before Oxfam\u2019s dire predictions become reality.</p>",

The high rate of interest that sub-Saharan governments pay on their debts means that the cumulative stock of loans can be modest in relation to national income but still be unaffordable. This week, with the Covid-19 pandemic starting to have an impact on the African continent, senior officials at the IMF, the G20 and the World Bank will meet online for their spring conferences. To help them review the situation, research conducted by King\u2019s College London and the Australian National University for the aid charity Oxfam found that more than half a billion more people could be pushed into poverty unless urgent action is taken to bail out the world\u2019s poorest countries. Oxfam said the impact of shutting down economies to prevent the virus spreading would wreck vital industries and risked setting back the fight against poverty in sub-Saharan Africa by up to 30 years. If those governments attempt to intervene, as developed-world governments have, to support industries and communities suffering a sudden loss of income, then their public debts will soar and the world financial system will ultimately be threatened by debt defaults. Health systems in Africa are expected to be overwhelmed and what welfare systems that are in place will buckle under the strain. Even better-equipped systems in China, the US, UK and much of Europe have struggled to cope. For this reason, whichever way they turn, sub-Saharan governments are threatened by a financial collapse. Aid charities have already called for the IMF and World Bank to engineer a debt write-off to prevent such a situation arising. So far, the answer has been extra loans, albeit at low or zero interest rates, to bridge funding gaps in healthcare provision expected once the virus begins to make inroads. One of the reasons for resisting write-offs can be found in the way debts have built up over the past 15 years. Almost from the moment the G7 wrote off a large slice of developing-world debt at the Gleneagles conference in 2005, African nations have allowed their debt-to-GDP ratios to inch upwards. Encouraged by the World Bank, they have sought loans from major commercial banks and the bond markets. In the past six or seven years, the emphasis has switched to borrowing from China, in part to benefit from \u201cfree\u201d advice on infrastructure projects, built by Chinese contractors. So a debt write-off by international public bodies like the IMF merely allows developing-world countries to keep paying their exorbitant private-sector debt bills and Chinese-backed development loans. Another barrier is the lack, with a few exceptions, of any transformation in the governance of sub-Saharan states, despite 20 years of solid (albeit debt-fuelled) growth. Many of the executives in aid agencies involved in debt relief make the point that corruption remains rife and inequality has increased, aided by developed-world lawyers, accountants and bankers who help African oligarchs stash their gains overseas tax-free. Then there are the pre-colonial tribes and nations, which cut across today\u2019s borders and remain strong. They prevent post-colonial nations from developing strong governance and tackling corruption. A repeat of the Gleneagles deal is difficult when so little appears to have changed in the meantime. Fatigue among donors, and a sense that money hasn\u2019t solved much so far, add to a sense of despair and fuel inaction. Yet, this is not a time for considering the moral hazards. The G20 must act quickly, even out of self-interest. This is an interconnected world, and debts rebound if they are not dealt with as part of a programme that maintains confidence in the financial system. To wait for another debt default in sub-Saharan Africa will serve no one\u2019s purpose. A rescue should be put in place now, before Oxfam\u2019s dire predictions become reality.",

      "bodyText": "The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has revealed that 19 UK health workers have died after contracting coronavirus, amid further backlash over his request that NHS staff do not overuse protective equipment. Hancock said on Saturday he was unaware of any link between the deaths and a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) but an investigation would be carried out into the extent to which health workers had caught the virus on the frontline. He told Sky News his \u201cheart goes out to their families\u201d and it was \u201cheart-rending\u201d that such a high proportion of the victims were people who migrated to the UK to work for the NHS. On Friday Hancock urged the public to \u201ctreat PPE as the precious resource it is\u201d following weeks of criticism over the lack of vital equipment. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) dismissed any suggestions that healthcare staff were abusing or overusing PPE. The RCN\u2019s general secretary, Dame Donna Kinnair, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Saturday that no PPE was \u201cmore precious a resource than a healthcare worker\u2019s life, a nurse\u2019s life, a doctor\u2019s life\u201d. Speaking later on BBC Breakfast, Kinnair said she was hearing from nurses every day that they did not have enough protective equipment. She said: \u201cI take offence actually that we are saying that healthcare workers are abusing or overusing PPE. I think what we know is, we don\u2019t have enough supply and not enough regular supply of PPE. This is the number one priority nurses are bringing to my attention.

The Resuscitation Council UK considers chest compressions to be an \u201caerosol generating procedure\u201d (AGP) and recommends all team members wear a certain level of protective equipment before entering a room where it is being carried out. This recommendation is based upon evidence from around the world and in conjunction with the European Resuscitation Council and the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation, the association said. Public Health England guidance, on the other hand, does not consider the same procedure to be an AGP. First responders can commence chest compressions without that same level of equipment, \u201cwhile awaiting the arrival of other clinicians to undertake airway manoeuvres,\u201d according to its guidance. The row came as it emerged that London\u2019s Kingston hospital NHS foundation trust is set to run out of disposable gowns by Sunday. Intensive care unit staff, among others, have been issued with yellow plastic overalls as a replacement, which they will be tasked with washing. The government has urged the public to stay at home over the Easter holiday to slow the spread of the coronavirus. A British scientist has said a coronavirus vaccine could be ready as soon as September. Sarah Gilbert, a professor of vaccinology at Oxford University, told the Times she was \u201c80% confident\u201d the vaccine being developed by her team would work, and human trials were due to begin in the next fortnight.

      "body": "<p>A democratic socialist, Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign amplified and projected ideas that radical grassroots organizers have been demanding for centuries in this country. His surrogates gave fiery, mesmerizing speeches at rallies that featured crowds larger than 25,000. Now, he has suspended his presidential campaign. This was his second run for the Oval Office.</p> <p>Sanders\u2019 political outsider savviness was his strength and weakness. He was sometimes criticized for not having specific plans for black people. I agree with a more nuanced version of this claim: Sanders did not demonstrate how he would prevent racism from impeding the universal programs that would help black people. While disappointing and warranted, his shortcoming mostly provided an easy cover for liberals to undermine his political ascension. Former vice-president Joe Biden authored a devastating crime bill that increased policing and mass incarceration, but that was smoothed away with his \u201cWe Know Joe\u201d slogan aimed at black communities.

      "bodyText": "A democratic socialist, Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign amplified and projected ideas that radical grassroots organizers have been demanding for centuries in this country. His surrogates gave fiery, mesmerizing speeches at rallies that featured crowds larger than 25,000. Now, he has suspended his presidential campaign. This was his second run for the Oval Office. Sanders\u2019 political outsider savviness was his strength and weakness. He was sometimes criticized for not having specific plans for black people. I agree with a more nuanced version of this claim: Sanders did not demonstrate how he would prevent racism from impeding the universal programs that would help black people. While disappointing and warranted, his shortcoming mostly provided an easy cover for liberals to undermine his political ascension. Former vice-president Joe Biden authored a devastating crime bill that increased policing and mass incarceration, but that was smoothed away with his \u201cWe Know Joe\u201d slogan aimed at black communities. The California senator Kamala Harris laughed about threatening to prosecute poor black mothers for school absenteeism, but also made punchy race soundbites during debates that went viral. Even the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s defense of capitalism and neoliberal ideas was obscured by her larger pronouncements to protect black women in hospitals and the workplace \u2013 bastions of capitalist exploitation.

When Lewinsky learned that Tripp was sick, she said: \u201cNo matter the past\u2026 I hope for her recovery. I can\u2019t imagine how difficult this is for her family.\u201d A graceful response and one in stark contrast to what Lewinsky said when the then US president Bill Clinton was impeached for lying about their affair: \u201cI\u2019m really sorry for everything that\u2019s happened. And I hate Linda Tripp.\u201d</p> <p>Her loathing for the older woman was understandable. Taken into Lewinsky\u2019s confidence about Clinton, Tripp secretly recorded the conversations (giving them to the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr) and encouraging the former White House intern to keep the semen-stained dress (for evidence). Even after relentless censure, ridicule and disgrace, Tripp continued to view herself as a righteous whistleblower. However, 22 hours of secretly taped conversations suggest something less edifying: one woman (naive, obsessed) spilling her secrets to another woman, who coolly gathered information, then used it to jam her young friend\u2019s head on to a spike.</p> <p>Too simplistic? Maybe. The truth is always more complicated. After all, it was Clinton who put the main wrecking ball through the lives of the three women involved: Monica, Hillary and Linda. The same Clinton <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/06/bill-clinton-monica-lewinsky-affair-anxiety\">who recently said</a> he\u2019d had the affair with Lewinsky to \u201cmanage his anxieties\u201d.

While all betrayal is devastating, maybe because of entrenched sexism the female-on-female variety has an extra whiff of sulphur. It goes against the unspoken code, the feeling among women that ultimately we look out for each other, that it\u2019s them and us.</p> <p>It\u2019s the impulse that makes little girls pinky-promise their eternal devotion and teenagers keep secrets until they die. It\u2019s the young woman bursting into tears in the nightclub lavatory and finding herself comforted by a bunch of strangers who are her instant best friends. It\u2019s there behind workplace mentoring schemes. It\u2019s what makes younger women turn to older women for advice and older women feel proud to give it. And it\u2019s been there throughout #MeToo, with women giving testimonies and supporting each other, whatever the personal cost.</p> <p>Whatever was going on between Tripp and Lewinsky all those years ago, this crucial element \u2013 of instinctive warmth and trust between women \u2013 was missing, but only on one side.

Now they <em>have</em> mated, there is hope that a baby panda could come along and some people think it\u2019s because they are finally getting some privacy during the lockdown.</p> <p>After the closure of the park in late January, the amorous pandas were first spotted \u201ccuddling more intensely than usual\u201d and there were more panda lurrve signs such as scent markings and Ying Ying \u2013 the lady panda \u2013 \u201cspending more time in the water\u201d, which must be the panda equivalent of shaving your legs.</p> <p>It would appear that having loads of humans poking cameras at you is a major turn-off. Who\u2019d have thought it? All this raises serious issues about the wellbeing of not just pandas but all caged animals, how much this could be affecting libido and how much better off they would be left in the wild.</p> <p>At the very least, it needs acknowledging that onlookers are stressing pandas out and stopping them getting it on. Whatever other problems pandas have with mating, what amounts to human-on-panda dogging has to stop. Clearly, pandas need a bit of privacy, the equivalent of Barry White playing on the turntable, perhaps a lava lamp on its lowest setting. If you wouldn\u2019t like people rubbernecking at you while you\u2019re having sex, spare a thought for modest pandas.</p> <h2>Amazon rides roughshod to world domination</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d213e846d26f0803ff2ab8ff07f1b93682dc841e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d213e846d26f0803ff2ab8ff07f1b93682dc841e/0_101_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeff Bezos\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeff Bezos: laughing all the way to the bank.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lindsey Wasson/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Do we need to be careful that events don\u2019t lead us to sleepwalk into a Planet Amazon scenario?</p> <p>Debenhams has called in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/apr/06/stock-markets-gain-coronavirus-covid-19-lockdowns-disease-ftse-pound-oil-price-business-live\">administrators</a> again and many other smaller retailers are in trouble.

Where is the protection for these small businesses?</p> <p>This is not a wild attack on Amazon \u2013 most people use it, it\u2019s not responsible for coronavirus and the emphasis on essential items was understandable, particularly during our stockpiling phase.</p> <p>However, while Amazon says it has taken \u201cintense\u201d measures to protect staff, it\u2019s imperative that worker concerns are properly dealt with, whatever the cost. Moreover, such developments expose the power of Amazon and the essential vulnerability of the small businesses it claims to support.

Now they have mated, there is hope that a baby panda could come along and some people think it\u2019s because they are finally getting some privacy during the lockdown. After the closure of the park in late January, the amorous pandas were first spotted \u201ccuddling more intensely than usual\u201d and there were more panda lurrve signs such as scent markings and Ying Ying \u2013 the lady panda \u2013 \u201cspending more time in the water\u201d, which must be the panda equivalent of shaving your legs. It would appear that having loads of humans poking cameras at you is a major turn-off. Who\u2019d have thought it? All this raises serious issues about the wellbeing of not just pandas but all caged animals, how much this could be affecting libido and how much better off they would be left in the wild. At the very least, it needs acknowledging that onlookers are stressing pandas out and stopping them getting it on. Whatever other problems pandas have with mating, what amounts to human-on-panda dogging has to stop. Clearly, pandas need a bit of privacy, the equivalent of Barry White playing on the turntable, perhaps a lava lamp on its lowest setting. If you wouldn\u2019t like people rubbernecking at you while you\u2019re having sex, spare a thought for modest pandas. Amazon rides roughshod to world domination Do we need to be careful that events don\u2019t lead us to sleepwalk into a Planet Amazon scenario? Debenhams has called in the administrators again and many other smaller retailers are in trouble. Meanwhile, multibillionaire Amazon boss Jeff Bezos has faced strike action over claims of inadequate worker protection and putting \u201cprofits before safety\u201d. Furthermore, while the online goliath has dominated the marketplace for years, arguably killing off the high street, it\u2019s now making it near impossible for Amazon third-party sellers of non-essential items (including books) to operate, having temporarily withdrawn access to the Fulfilled by Amazon feature in which firms bulk ship their goods to Amazon warehouses and use their delivery network for a fee. Where is the protection for these small businesses? This is not a wild attack on Amazon \u2013 most people use it, it\u2019s not responsible for coronavirus and the emphasis on essential items was understandable, particularly during our stockpiling phase. However, while Amazon says it has taken \u201cintense\u201d measures to protect staff, it\u2019s imperative that worker concerns are properly dealt with, whatever the cost. Moreover, such developments expose the power of Amazon and the essential vulnerability of the small businesses it claims to support. Memo to Bezos: don\u2019t make people suspect that they\u2019re going to wake from this nightmare to discover a retail reality where only Amazon and the cockroaches survived. \u2022 Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist",

Other problems included seizures and conditions involving the supply of blood to the brain.</p> \n  <p>The team add that neurological problems were more common among those with more severe forms of Covid-19, while they note some patients who went on to be diagnosed with Covid-19 turned up at the hospital only with neurological problems and without typical symptoms such as a fever or cough.</p> \n  <p>The team also point to previous research which revealed that the coronavirus gets into human cells by interacting with an enzyme, called ACE2 that is present on the membranes of cells in the lungs as well as in the nervous system and skeletal muscle.</p> \n  <p>However, the study has limitations, including that it only involves a small group of patients, certain tests were not carried out due to infection concerns \u2013 meaning most problems were simply described by patients \u2013 and it is not clear to what extent the coronavirus is causing the neurological problems, or whether they were already present.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JAMANeuro/status/1248659372710006785\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p

Cambridge, said there were a number of initiatives looking into possible neurological problems linked to Covid-19.</p> \n  <p> But, she added, some of the symptoms outlined in the study may not be down to such disorders per se, noting symptoms such as dizziness and headaches are common when people are unwell, while symptoms such as loss of muscle mass can occur when people are bed-bound, and cognitive impairment can be a byproduct of being in intensive care.</p> \n  <p>But Newcombe noted that it was likely some patients were experiencing true neurological problems, noting reports of higher rates of stroke and blood clots, including in the lungs, chime with what she had seen.</p> \n  <p>Others said the results were not surprising.</p> \n  <p><strong>\u201c</strong>Many respiratory viruses appear to not only affect the respiratory system but can spread from the airways to the central nervous system,\u201d said Prof Julian Hiscox, chair in infection and global health at the University of Liverpool<strong tabindex=\"-1\">.</strong></p> \n  <p>Prof Ian Jones, professor of virology, at the University of Reading, added that the new findings should not distract from the focus on the respiratory problems Covid-19 causes.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAt the moment neurological complications might best be considered a consequence of Covid-19 disease severity rather than a distinct new concern,\u201d he said.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-11T10:19:45.025Z\">at 11.19am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div

Church leaders from across the UK have used social media and streaming to keep their congregations, many of whom are in their 80s and 90s, connected to the church when many are in isolation.</p> \n  <p>Rev Peter Atkinson has recreated Worcester Cathedral in a spare bedroom in his house from where he broadcasts morning services for people to stream at home. He stressed: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s really important that we don\u2019t think of Holy Week and Easter as being \u2018cancelled\u2019 - we are celebrating in a different way.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The reverend described how the unorthodox services so far have seemingly encouraged more people to attend church virtually, and may even be considered more public than conventional worship. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>An early morning midweek service in the cathedral might have a congregation of three or four, now the same service has been viewed several thousand times by the end of the day.</p> \n   <p>The churches have been closed for \u2018public worship\u2019 and here I am live streaming the same service from my spare room, and I get a message from a complete stranger in Australia saying \u2018so good to join your service this morning\u2019.

Due to all of their Easter services going online, it \u201cprovides more opportunity to people to get involved and I don\u2019t think the church will ever be the same again!\u201d</p> \n  <p>There are members of the congregation who are in their 80s and 90s who are now using Google Meets and other social media to stay connected to the church whilst in isolation. The reverend believes because younger members of the family are now stuck at home they now have the time to show their family members how to use the internet.</p> \n  <p>Rev Jim McNeil, who has served as minister for Alva Church in Scotland for 22 years, described himself as a \u201cbit of a technophobe\u201d before using Facebook to record and upload sermons.</p> \n  <p>There have been videos every night of holy week leading up to Easter Sunday and they are all recorded from inside the church and have proven to be popular. He said: \u201cWe are a wee church in a wee town and we get about a hundred worshippers in total on a normal Sunday,\u201d but the videos have accumulated more than double that number in views.</p> \n  <p>The church\u2019s congregation are mostly in their 60s and 70s and many of them have not had much trouble embracing the church\u2019s new social media approach to Easter.

      "bodyText": "The UK hospital death toll rose to 9,875 after a further 917 people died in hospital after testing positive for Covid-19, up from 8,958 the previous day. Turkey has supplied the UK with 250,000 items of protective equipment, the Ministry of Defence announced. The shipment includes 50,000 N-95 face masks; 100,000 surgical masks; and 100,000 protective suits; and will be taken to a regional NHS distribution hub to be delivered to medical centres across the country. The seemingly disproportionate effect of Covid-19 on people from BAME backgrounds needs to be urgently investigated by the government, according to the head of the British Medical Association, whose comments came after it was revealed that 19 NHS workers have died after contracting coronavirus. The health secretary Matt Hancock faced a backlash after he said PPE was \u201ca precious resource\u201d that health staff should not \u201coveruse\u201d. This angered many in the health sector, including the Royal College of Nursing who called the suggestion that health professionals who don\u2019t have the supplies they need were abusing or overusing PPE offensive. The home secretary Priti Patel launched a national communications campaign for those at risk of domestic abuse to signpost victims to where they can access help. Up to \u00a32m will also be used to enhance online support services and helplines for domestic abuse. Anyone who needs help in a domestic abuse situation, but is fearful an abuser may hear them calling, can dial 999 and press 55, which will let the police know they need assistance. And finally, the prime minister Boris Johnson \u201ccontinues to make very good progress\u201d in his recovery at St Thomas\u2019 hospital. I\u2019d like to say a huge thank you to everybody who got in touch today with a story and to all of you for reading along. That\u2019s it from us here on the UK side, but you can head over to our global live blog where our worldwide coverage of the coronavirus pandemic continues. This is from the BBC\u2019s Jessica Parker. In an update sent out on Friday (yesterday), Kingston Hospital NHS Foundation Trust warns staff it could run out of disposable gowns by Sunday. Patel, asked where she had been in recent weeks, said she had been working \u201cvirtually every single day\u201d on a range of policy areas related to the pandemic. Whether it\u2019s through the visa changes that I\u2019ve brought in over the last three weeks or whether it\u2019s the work of the Border Force where we were absolutely prioritising medical equipment, these are the changes that I have been working on. Patel said it it would be wrong to speculate about when the restrictions will be lifted, adding: When it comes to the long-term situation none of us can stand here today - and it would be wrong for us to do this - and speculate in terms of when restrictions might move and when they will be lifted This government, and rightly so, is following the scientific advice through, which meets twice a week, Sage, to look at the type of measures and approaches that we are taking as a government. They are taking questions from the media now. Patel, when pressed to apologise to NHS workers over a lack of personal protective equipment, couldn\u2019t quite do it. She said: I\u2019m sorry if people feel that there have been failings. After being asked twice if she would apologise to NHS staff and their families over the lack of \u201cnecessary PPE\u201d that has been linked to NHS workers becoming infected and dying, she said: I\u2019ve been very clear in what I have said and I\u2019m sorry that people feel that way. Powis has reiterated that the NHS remains available for people who are unwell with conditions that are not coronavirus and people should access services in the way they always have done. It is a bank holiday weekend, general practices are open, pharmacies are. So if you are unwell with a condition that is not coronavirus - if you have symptoms of a heart attack or symptoms of a stroke, if you have a sick child that\u2019s deteriorating, if you\u2019re a pregnant woman and you are worried about the movement of your baby - then you should be accessing services in the same way that you always have done. The NHS is open for business and capable of managing people with a wide range of illnesses. Stephen Powis, NHS England\u2019s medical director, is speaking now. He acknowledged anger at the few members of the public ignoring the rules and paid tribute to the vast majority complying. Transport use remains low. There has been a stabilisation in the number of new cases, \u201cby and large\u201d this has levelled off, he said. In turn, this is translating into early signs of stabilisation and first signs of a plateau in the number of people being hospitalised. We are still seeing high numbers of deaths \u2013 this will be the very final thing that will start to decrease. As long as people continue to follow the rules, this will begin to translate into a reduction in the number of people dying. Hewitt said the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council will publish enforcement data every fortnight throughout the crisis. Hewitt said that \u201cin those few cases\u201d where officers or police forces have \u201cmade mistakes in interpreting the new regulations\u201d they have quickly sought to correct them and provide the necessary clarity. Hewitt said since the new powers have been introduced, most people have quickly understood why it\u2019s important to follow the rules and no enforcement has been necessary. However, a small minority of people have refused to follow the instructions and officers have had to use their enforcement powers. He said next week they will publish the data on their enforcement so far, which will include the Easter weekend, but early data from 37 forces reveal 1,084 fines have been issued in England and Wales up to 8 April, an average of less than 84 per day across those forces. Hewitt reinforced the words of the home secretary to victims of domestic abuse \u2013 \u201cwe will come when you call for help\u201d. And to abusers, he said \u2013 \u201cdo not think this is a time when you can get away with this\u201d. We will still arrest, we will still bring into custody, and we will still prosecute. Martin Hewitt, the chair of the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council, is speaking now. He has given a number of examples of how the police continue to keep the country safe during the lockdown, including a man in London who was jailed for stealing PPE from a hospital. The National Crime Agency is taking down fraudulent websites and email addresses. He said initial figures from all forces show a 21% fall in overall crime across the last four weeks compared to the same period last year. Keep reporting crime to us. Our teams are working round the clock to keep you safe and respond to emergencies. Patel has thanked police for \u201cengaging with the public constructively\u201d in enforcing physical distancing measures. She said the vast majority of people were following the guidelines, but the police \u201cwill be unafraid\u201d to act if people choose to endanger the lives of others and flout the rules. Patel said it should be perpetrators who should have to leave the family homes, but this is not always possible. To ensure victims have a safe place to go to, the government is \u201clooking at alternative accommodation\u201d to provide refuge at this time. Patel said though there has not yet been a sustained rise in reports of domestic abuse to the police, there has been an increase in those seeking help for domestic abuse, which is \u201cextremely concerning\u201d. Anyone in immediate danger should dial 999 and press 55 on a mobile if you\u2019re unable to talk. Patel has launched a national communications campaign to reach out to those who are at risk of abuse to signpost victims to where they can access help they need at this time. It will tell them that they are not alone. She is also providing up to \u00a32m to enhance online support services and helplines for domestic abuse. Patel said the crisis is changing the challenges we face in terms of crime. Total crime has dropped as people follow the guidelines and stay at home, but criminality continues to adapted. Fraudsters have caused losses of \u00a31.8m to victims and children are being exploited online. Last week, the national domestic abuse helpline reported a 120% increase in the number of calls it received in one 24-hour period. Patel said the prime minister \u201ccontinues to make good progress\u201d. The home secretary is speaking now. As of 9am today, 78,991 people have tested positive for Covid-19 across the UK, excluding Northern Ireland. 20,101 patients are currently in hospital in Great Britain who have tested positive. 9,875 people have now died, an increase of 917 on yesterday\u2019s figures. Greater Manchester police (GMP) have apologised after a man was threatened with pepper spray and arrested as he dropped off food for vulnerable family members. A neighbour used his mobile phone to film the moment an officer approached the man outside an address in Fallowfield, Manchester, on Friday. It is understood the man was then de-arrested and issued with a fixed penalty notice. The Daily Mail has the story. In a statement (below) GMP said the incident \u201cwasn\u2019t dealt with in the professional way we would expect and we apologise for that\u201d and also asked the public to bear with the police who are working under stress in the current situation. The government\u2019s daily news conference is due to begin shortly and will be led for the first time by the home secretary, Priti Patel. Alongside her will be Stephen Powis, NHS England\u2019s medical director, and Martin Hewitt, the chair of the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council. The shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, has called on Dominic Raab to name a minister to run the Foreign Office while he deputises for the prime minister. She said: Over the coming days and weeks, decisions will need to be taken in real time to coordinate a response to this crisis that will rightly demand the full attention of Dominic Raab and his team. It is crucial, however, that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office continues to function effectively during this period. This is a global crisis and demands a global response. In addition, the swift and safe repatriation of UK citizens currently stranded overseas must be an absolute priority. There is growing concern that thousands of people are not able to access the support and advice they urgently need to return home. They must not be left to face this crisis alone. We are calling on Dominic Raab to immediately name a minister with responsibility for the day to day running of the Foreign Office while he deputises for the prime minister. This is to ensure we can support our citizens around the world and demonstrate the leadership necessary to overcome the challenges ahead. The BBC has provided extra detail on its donation of two working ventilators from the set of Holby City to the NHS\u2019s new Nightingale hospital in London\u2019s docklands. A spokesperson for BBC Studios, which makes the medical drama, said: Prior to the coronavirus crisis Holby City Production took delivery of two working anaesthetic machines with ventilators attached but immediately asked our supplier to offer them to the NHS when we became aware of the urgent demand several weeks ago. We received confirmation this week they had been sent to Nightingale London.\u201d Most equipment used on the show is outdated but the donated kit was a recent addition. The spokesperson added: The other ventilators currently used on set were purchased many years ago and are unsuitable for medical use whereas the machines delivered to the NHS were replacements that would allow the show to more accurately reflect a modern hospital setting. All the personal protection equipment on Holby City, Casualty and River City has gone to support our amazing NHS staff at several locations around the UK. The number of people with coronavirus who have died in a hospital setting in Northern Ireland has risen to 107, with 15 further deaths reported on Saturday. There were 128 new cases of the virus, bringing the total of confirmed positive tests in the region since the outbreak began to 1,717. Easter eggs have been delivered to hospitals around the UK as a thank you to NHS staff and those forced to spend the bank holiday away from family. More than 1,800 eggs were given out by the Chocolate Society, which set itself a challenge of seeing how many it could make in a 24-hour period. Al and Duncan Garnsworthy, who run the company, worked from 8.30am until 9am the following day to show their support for hard-working healthcare staff. The company also raised more than 3,000 for Heroes, an organisation that helps support the NHS and will help distribute the eggs. Healthcare workers were not the only ones to receive a treat, with SalutetheNHS.org delivering chocolate eggs to children in hospitals around the UK. The campaign, which has a goal of serving a million meals to the NHS front line, wanted to deliver a surprise to children who may be separated from families due to Covid-19 restrictions. Tesco supplied the eggs, which were then distributed by Yodel. Ron Dennis, co-founder of SalutetheNHS.org, said: Our aim here is to bring some joy to sick children stuck in hospitals over the Easter holiday weekend, and at a time when the awful Covid-19 virus might prevent them from being with their parents. Hopefully, it will bring a smile. A total of 9,875 patients have died in hospital after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK as of 5pm on Friday, the Department of Health and Social Care has said, up by 917 from 8,958 the day before. It added 334,974 tests have been carried out in the UK as of 9am on Saturday, including 18,091 tests on Friday. Of the the 269,598 people tested, 78,991 have tested positive for Covid-19. A total of 542 people who tested positive for coronavirus in Scotland have died, a rise of 47 on Friday\u2019s figure, according to the Scottish government. Across the country, 29,903 people have now been tested for Covid-19, with 5,590 testing positive. As of Friday night, 1,855 patients were in hospital with either confirmed or suspected coronavirus, an increase of 23. Of those, 212 were being treated in intensive care units, up five from the previous night and the same number as on Thursday. Thank you to everyone who has sent me emails and DMs with tips for the live blog. I really appreciate all your messages, especially the ones thanking the Guardian for its coverage. Please do continue to get in touch throughout the day with any stories, tips, advice or comments for me via the usual channels (below). Your thoughts are always welcome, and apologies if I can\u2019t reply to you all. Email: lucy.campbell@guardian.co.uk Twitter: @lucy_campbell_ NHS England said a further 823 people have died in hospital in England after testing positive for coronavirus, including an 11-year-old child, bringing the death toll there to 8,937. The patients were aged between 11 and 102 years old and 33 of the 823 patients (aged between 29 and 94 years old) had no known underlying health condition. Of the 823 new hospital deaths announced today by NHS England, 115 occurred on 10 April while 695 took place between 1-9 April. The remaining 12 deaths occurred in March, with the earliest new death taking place on 25 March. NHS England releases updated figures every day showing the dates of every coronavirus-related death in hospitals in England, often including new deaths that took place several days or even weeks ago. This is because of the time it takes for deaths to be confirmed as testing positive for Covid-19, post-mortem tests to be processed, and data from the tests to be validated. The figures published today by NHS England show that 4 April currently has the highest total for the most hospital deaths occurring in a single day - 671 - though this is likely to change in future updates. Recorded messages, mounted police and volunteer wardens with megaphones have been welcoming locals in east London\u2019s reopened Victoria Park, urging them to follow new physical distancing measures during the lockdown. The park and Tower Hamlets council came in for intense criticism three weekends ago after pictures posted on social media showed a local market in the grounds bustling with people despite government guidance to practice physical distancing. The furore, which occurred days before a nationwide lockdown came into effect, prompted the park to shut for a fortnight, before reopening on Saturday with restrictions in place. Signs bearing new rules at the popular public space inform people of a ban on picnics, ball games and sunbathing, with cyclists being told to dismount upon entry. Announcements are also ringing out over loudspeakers telling people to follow the measures or face being moved on or fined. Turkey has supplied the UK with 250,000 items of protective equipment, the Ministry of Defence has announced. The shipment, which arrived at Oxfordshire\u2019s Brize Norton RAF base on Friday, includes 50,000 N-95 face masks; 100,000 surgical masks; and 100,000 protective suits. The supplies will be taken to a regional NHS distribution hub to be delivered to medical centres across the country, the MoD added. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said: The delivery of this vital equipment will bring protection and relief to thousands of critical workers across the UK, as they bravely and tirelessly work to keep us safe. It is also a tribute to the strong bilateral ties with our ally Turkey, and I am immensely grateful for their kind gesture. As Nato allies we can always depend on each other, whatever the threats we face. This is just one way the UK\u2019s armed forces are helping, in addition to helping to establish temporary hospitals, delivering supplies and assisting with a variety of tasks to support the NHS and other public bodies. Transport union leaders have criticised a bus company for providing movable \u201cshower curtains\u201d as barriers to protect drivers from the spread of coronavirus. The Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) hit out at First South West buses after receiving complaints over the clear plastic film being used as a screen. The union said it had asked for protective Perspex screens to be installed, similar to ones in supermarkets that have been protecting checkout staff. Video footage sent to the RMT shows a driver moving a transparent piece of plastic film, which covers their door but does not continue up to the windscreen, leaving a large gap. The driver said: It won\u2019t actually cover you properly, you\u2019ve got to fight the bloody door to get into it and it doesn\u2019t actually cover that much. The thin film, which the RMT described as a \u201cshower curtain\u201d, is fixed to the top of the cab but not attached anywhere else, which the union said has led to passengers simply pulling the barrier back to talk to drivers. The criticism comes after at least 14 transport workers have died after testing positive for Covid-19, including nine bus drivers. The transport company, which is part of the large FirstGroup, serves areas including Cornwall and Somerset. In a letter to the company\u2019s managing director, RMT general secretary, Mick Cash, has urged it to \u201cstep up to protect your staff in this time of national emergency\u201d. FirstGroup bus operator Cornwall by Kernow said they have increased cleaning and social distancing measures on the buses and provided every driver with hand sanitiser and gloves. A spokesman said: The safety and welfare of our colleagues and passengers remains our utmost priority. We are incredibly proud of our drivers who continue to run these essential services. We are confident that these screens, which are used by other major bus operators, are of sufficient standard to help keep our drivers and customers safe. We\u2019re adjusting a few screens to ensure they\u2019re fitted correctly. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the British Medical Association, said it is \u201cabsolutely tragic\u201d that 19 health workers have died after contracting coronavirus. He told Sky News on Saturday: This is absolutely tragic. In terms of doctors who I represent, it\u2019s extremely concerning that 10 of the 11 doctors are from black and Asian minority backgrounds, almost all of them having come from overseas having given their lives to the health service. He expressed concern about a lack of protective equipment. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have the right protection, there\u2019s greater risk of becoming infected,\u201d he said, He added: There\u2019s also a greater need to protect our BAME doctors. We have higher levels or prevalence of underlying conditions such a diabetes, heart disease and renal disease. Downing Street has given an update on the condition of the prime minister following his release from intensive care on Thursday. Speaking on Saturday, a Number 10 spokeswoman said: \u201cThe prime minister continues to make very good progress.\u201d Here is a little more much-needed positive news: Twin brothers, one a soldier and the other a surgeon, have played a role in the battle to set up and run London\u2019s temporary NHS Nightingale hospital. British army Lt Col Phill Moxey, commanding officer of 1st Battalion, The Royal Anglian Regiment, led a team that helped to transform part of the ExCel centre into a hospital. His brother Paul, a vascular surgeon in the capital\u2019s St George\u2019s hospital, is on call to aid the new Nightingale facility\u2019s dedicated medical team. The Suffolk-born twins, aged 42, made radically different career choices as children and this is the first time their individual skills have been brought to bear on the same mission. Lt Col Moxey, told PA Media: It\u2019s not lost on either of us the apparent utter contrast in our chosen professions - soldier versus surgeon. But both roles have taken many years of experience to get to and both have required a degree of sacrifice, patience and tolerance on the home front. Neither of us could have got to where we are without the support of our families. Both roles require calmness under pressure, leadership and constant education. News that a coronavirus vaccine could be ready by September should be treated with \u201ccautious optimism\u201d, a medical expert has said. Professor Stephen Evans, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, warned on Saturday that there are \u201ca number of hurdles to before you get to the point where the population is protected\u201d. His comments came after Sarah Gilbert, a professor of vaccinology at Oxford University, told the Times a coronavirus vaccine could be ready for the general public by September. Speaking to PA Media, Evans commended Gilbert for being careful to make clear there are no guarantees. He said: Cautious optimism is entirely justified in these difficult times but if you think that that\u2019s it, then you could be sorely disappointed. There are numbers of hurdles to overcome before you get to the point where the population is protected. He said having the vaccine ready and proven to be safe is one thing, but availability in the millions of doses required for large-scale rollout across the UK with a system for delivery is a different matter. Evans added: I think getting all of that in place before the end of the year would be amazing, so it\u2019s not just having the vaccine, it\u2019s actually being able to deliver them. What I would be doing and be prepared to invest in would be the system to deliver extremely large numbers of vaccine doses to the population as a whole. Such investment would pay off, whether it was the Oxford vaccine or some other that proved to be effective and have minimal harms. After revealing 19 UK health workers have died after contracting coronavirus and amid backlash over his request that NHS staff do not overuse personal protective equipment, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said he was unaware of any link between the deaths and a lack of PPE but an investigation would be carried out into the extent to which health workers had caught the virus on the frontline. Here is the video: England\u2019s half a million \u201cempty homes\u201d should be opened up to health workers on the frontline of the coronavirus pandemic who need accommodation close to their workplaces, campaigners have urged. Government data, analysed by Action on Empty Homes, shows England is host to as many as 579,000 vacant properties. About 226,000 of these are long-term empty homes, 253,000 are second homes and 100,000 are vacant Airbnb lets. Will McMahon, the group\u2019s director, said at this time of national crisis, every person and company who has a housing resource that can help with the emergency should step up now: Local councils should ask homeowners to volunteer their second or habitable long-term empty homes for use by essential workers. Airbnb should be compelled to share the data necessary to identify whole house lets close to hospitals. Companies that are no longer using staff flats should step forward and offer them for use. In a national crisis, where lives are at stake, we need everyone to be pulling in the same direction and ensuring that resources, including housing, are available for use where they are needed most. Here is some much-needed midday joy. A 99-year-old former guardsman who survived three years in a German prisoner of war camp was clapped out of hospital on Friday after recovering from Covid-19. Albert Chambers, who will be 100 in July, is now \u201cfit and well\u201d according to Tickhill Road hospital, in Doncaster, South Yorkshire. Chambers was admitted to Doncaster Royal Infirmary after breaking his arm in a fall, but showed signs of coronavirus after he was moved to Tickhill Road for rehabilitation. He was a Coldstream Guard in the second world war and, at one time, helped to protect Buckingham Palace. But he was wounded in Germany and spent three years in a prisoner of war camp, the hospital told the PA Media news agency. The Liverpool fan, from Doncaster, said he was \u201ca very lucky man\u201d as he was discharged. He said: When I get home I\u2019m going to tell all of my neighbours how marvellous the nurses are here. I want to say thank you very much to them. I appreciate every bit of what they have done for me. They couldn\u2019t have been any better. The Duchess of Cornwall has recommended 10 good reads for those wanting solace during the coronavirus outbreak. Camilla said Travels On My Elephant by her late brother Mark Shand \u201calways brings a tear to my eye\u201d and she has listed him among nine authors picked for readers. Encouraging others to read to help them cope with feelings of isolation during the lockdown, the duchess said: Ernest Hemingway, famously, once said \u2018there is no friend as loyal as a book\u2019. In these challenging times when we are isolated from the ones we love, many of us are finding comfort in reading, to fire up our imaginations, to take us on journeys and to make us laugh. With that in mind here is a list of my dearest \u2018friends\u2019, I hope you all enjoy them as much as I have and can I wish you all a very happy Easter. If you\u2019re interested in Camilla\u2019s recommendations, here is the thread: The Duke of York has made a rare public appearance since stepping down from royal duties in the wake of the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. Andrew was pictured with his ex-wife the Duchess of York packing cupcakes into gift bags for the Thames Hospice, which provides care for people with life-limiting illnesses. The images, posted by Sarah Ferguson\u2019s assistant Antonia Marshall on Instagram on Thursday, also show the duke smiling as he helps deliver the items to the hospice in Windsor. It is one of the first times the duke, 60, has been spotted in public following his disastrous Newsnight interview last year over his relationship with convicted sex offender Epstein. He was previously seen with the Queen attending a Sunday service at St Mary the Virgin church in Hillington, Norfolk, back in January. The UK\u2019s seaside resorts risk becoming permanent \u201cghost towns\u201d without government support to help their economies recover from the coronavirus lockdown, councils have warned. Towns and villages heavily reliant on seasonal tourism are said to be facing an unprecedented threat as visitor numbers plummet amid guidance to stay at home and slow the spread of Covid-19. The District Councils Network, which represents councils for many of England\u2019s tourist and culture locations, is calling on the government to help businesses stay afloat by issuing grants and administering rate reliefs. The government\u2019s coronavirus hardship fund must also help families falling through the benefits system, it added. Councillor Mark Crane, the DCN\u2019s lead member for stronger economies, said: Some of our finest, most picturesque and beautiful tourist villages and towns, including those rich in cultural importance and heritage, face an unprecedented challenge. These are places dependent on seasonal demand in order to survive, which are usually guaranteed large numbers of visitors week in week out, but this year this is sadly unlikely to be the case. With people rightly staying away to minimise the spread of infection, this could have a devastating impact on many places that rely on the tourism industry. There\u2019s a real risk that if they don\u2019t recover, our tourist towns could become ghost towns. It will also put huge pressure on families suffering lost income and high unemployment. The Central Motorway Police Group (CMPG) said a motorcycle had been seized from a male rider who failed to stop while making a non-essential journey in Stoke-on-Trent. In a tweet alongside a picture of the vehicle, the CMPG said: \u201cBike seized, rider reported for several offences and is now getting his daily exercise.\u201d Researchers in China have released a report linking Covid-19 to a range of neurological problems. The study, reported in the journal JAMA Neurology, looked at 214 patients in hospitals in Wuhan with Covid-19, finding 78 reported neurological symptoms, with 38 showing dizziness, 28 reporting headaches, 12 reporting taste impairment, and 23 having injury to skeletal muscles. Other problems included seizures and conditions involving the supply of blood to the brain. The team add that neurological problems were more common among those with more severe forms of Covid-19, while they note some patients who went on to be diagnosed with Covid-19 turned up at the hospital only with neurological problems and without typical symptoms such as a fever or cough. The team also point to previous research which revealed that the coronavirus gets into human cells by interacting with an enzyme, called ACE2 that is present on the membranes of cells in the lungs as well as in the nervous system and skeletal muscle. However, the study has limitations, including that it only involves a small group of patients, certain tests were not carried out due to infection concerns \u2013 meaning most problems were simply described by patients \u2013 and it is not clear to what extent the coronavirus is causing the neurological problems, or whether they were already present. Responding to the study, Dr Virginia Newcombe, honorary consultant in neurosciences critical care unit at Addenbrookes hospital, Cambridge, said there were a number of initiatives looking into possible neurological problems linked to Covid-19. But, she added, some of the symptoms outlined in the study may not be down to such disorders per se, noting symptoms such as dizziness and headaches are common when people are unwell, while symptoms such as loss of muscle mass can occur when people are bed-bound, and cognitive impairment can be a byproduct of being in intensive care. But Newcombe noted that it was likely some patients were experiencing true neurological problems, noting reports of higher rates of stroke and blood clots, including in the lungs, chime with what she had seen. Others said the results were not surprising. \u201cMany respiratory viruses appear to not only affect the respiratory system but can spread from the airways to the central nervous system,\u201d said Prof Julian Hiscox, chair in infection and global health at the University of Liverpool. Prof Ian Jones, professor of virology, at the University of Reading, added that the new findings should not distract from the focus on the respiratory problems Covid-19 causes. \u201cAt the moment neurological complications might best be considered a consequence of Covid-19 disease severity rather than a distinct new concern,\u201d he said. The female stars of Coronation Street have released a video highlighting the help available to domestic abuse victims during the lockdown. Shelley King, Sair Khan, Sally Dynevor, Sally Carman and former show star Julie Hesmondhalgh all feature in the message, released in conjunction with Women\u2019s Aid. Experts have warned they expect domestic violence to rise while the UK copes with the Covid-19 outbreak and charities have said their helplines are experiencing an increase in use. In the series of home videos, the group say: The world is going through a really difficult time right now and many of us are isolating at home. For anyone who is experiencing domestic abuse, it is no doubt terrifying to be isolated with an abuser. If you are in a situation where you are being abused, or you fear that you may be abused, there are measures in place that can help protect you. The video encourages those at risk to keep a mobile phone on them at all times and use the \u201csilent solution\u201d when calling the police. Anyone needing help, but fearful an abuser may hear them calling, can dial 999 and press 55, which will let the police know they need assistance. You can watch the video on YouTube here: The campaign comes after a recent Coronation Street storyline saw Geoff Metcalfe increase his influence over Yasmeen Nazir, revealing the damage of non-physical abuse. The ITV soap consulted Women\u2019s Aid on the storyline, which was intended to educate viewers on the \u201cinvisible prison\u201d created by controlling partners. Easter has taken a virtual turn this year, as people have been urged to stay at home by the government. Church leaders from across the UK have used social media and streaming to keep their congregations, many of whom are in their 80s and 90s, connected to the church when many are in isolation. Rev Peter Atkinson has recreated Worcester Cathedral in a spare bedroom in his house from where he broadcasts morning services for people to stream at home. He stressed: It\u2019s really important that we don\u2019t think of Holy Week and Easter as being \u2018cancelled\u2019 - we are celebrating in a different way. The reverend described how the unorthodox services so far have seemingly encouraged more people to attend church virtually, and may even be considered more public than conventional worship. An early morning midweek service in the cathedral might have a congregation of three or four, now the same service has been viewed several thousand times by the end of the day. The churches have been closed for \u2018public worship\u2019 and here I am live streaming the same service from my spare room, and I get a message from a complete stranger in Australia saying \u2018so good to join your service this morning\u2019. If that\u2019s not public, I don\u2019t know what is! On Palm Sunday Rev Dean Aaron Roberts from BMMR parishes (Bedwas, Machen, Michaelston-y-Fedw and Rudry) just outside Cardiff, helped to set up a Google Meets online video Bible discussion group for Easter. Due to all of their Easter services going online, it \u201cprovides more opportunity to people to get involved and I don\u2019t think the church will ever be the same again!\u201d There are members of the congregation who are in their 80s and 90s who are now using Google Meets and other social media to stay connected to the church whilst in isolation. The reverend believes because younger members of the family are now stuck at home they now have the time to show their family members how to use the internet. Rev Jim McNeil, who has served as minister for Alva Church in Scotland for 22 years, described himself as a \u201cbit of a technophobe\u201d before using Facebook to record and upload sermons. There have been videos every night of holy week leading up to Easter Sunday and they are all recorded from inside the church and have proven to be popular. He said: \u201cWe are a wee church in a wee town and we get about a hundred worshippers in total on a normal Sunday,\u201d but the videos have accumulated more than double that number in views. The church\u2019s congregation are mostly in their 60s and 70s and many of them have not had much trouble embracing the church\u2019s new social media approach to Easter. He added: I suppose there are a lot of silver surfers and we haven\u2019t taken into consideration that these people are a lot more tech savvy than we think they are. Bus workers in London will receive sick pay from the first day of being off work, under a deal announced by the Unite union. Unite said the deal follows pressure from the union on bus operators, Transport for London (TfL), London\u2019s mayor and the government, for better protection from Covid-19 for bus workers. A total of 14 London transport workers have died after contracting the virus, nine of them bus workers. Unite said some bus workers may have felt they had to go to work when exhibiting signs of the disease because of a lack of sick pay. The union says that the victory, securing sick pay from day one regardless of length of service, means that bus workers fearful of having contracted Covid-19 can stay at home knowing they will not be \u201cplunged into immediate hardship\u201d. Unite regional officer John Murphy said: If they fall victim to this virus, bus workers need to be able to go on sick pay from day one, to isolate themselves and to recuperate. They should not face a terrible choice between health and hardship. So, we are extremely relieved to have secured sick pay at full wage for all bus workers in London from day one. Keeping people at home when they are unwell has to be part of the effort to combat this virus. With this victory, we can now concentrate our efforts to make people safer at work, continuing to press for the best in PPE, including making masks and gloves available for drivers, so they feel safe in their environment, and for the sealed door trials to be abandoned and sealed doors rolled out immediately across the capital\u2019s buses. My colleague Haroon Siddique has written more on the seemingly disproportionate effect of Covid-19 on people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds, who comprise 44% of NHS medical staff. After the first 10 doctors in the UK named as having died after contracting coronavirus were all BAME, the head of the British Medical Association has called on the government to urgently investigate if and why BAME people are more vulnerable to the disease. As well as the doctors, three out of six nurses named as having died have also been BAME as was a hospital pharmacist and at least one healthcare assistant. The overall death figures in the UK have not been broken down by ethnicity but early research published this week showed that 35% of almost 2,000 patients in intensive care units were BAME. Dr Chaand Nagpaul said: At face value, it seems hard to see how this can be random \u2013 to have the first 10 doctors of all being of BAME background. Not only that, we also know that in terms of the BAME population, they make up about a third of those in intensive care. There\u2019s a disproportionate percentage of BAME people getting ill. We have heard the virus does not discriminate between individuals but there\u2019s no doubt there appears to be a manifest disproportionate severity of infection in BAME people and doctors. This has to be addressed \u2013 the government must act now. You can read the full story here. Good morning! I\u2019m Lucy Campbell, here to take you through another day as the lockdown continues. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, is under fire from within the health sector after he said there is enough PPE to go around if used in line with official guidance and was \u201cnot being used more than is needed\u201d. He told BBC Breakfast this morning it was important that healthcare workers use the \u201cright amount\u201d of protective equipment as it is a \u201cprecious resource\u201d. He added: I am not impugning anyone who works for the NHS and I think they do an amazing job. But what I am reiterating, stressing, is the importance to use the right amount of PPE both to have enough and also to use it as the precious resource that it is. He also told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme he did not blame any health workers who had used more PPE than was \u201cstrictly necessary\u201d given the tough circumstances they faced. He said: We have drawn up guidelines on what to use. It is really important that people don\u2019t overuse PPE either. I don\u2019t want to impugn blame on people who have used more PPE than the guidelines suggest because I understand the difficulties in the circumstances. What I would say it is very important to use the right PPE and not overuse it. Of course there have been examples but I don\u2019t want to stress that because I also understand the circumstances in which people might have used more PPE than was strictly necessary according to the guidelines. But the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) dismissed any suggestions that healthcare staff were \u201cabusing or overusing\u201d PPE. The RCN general secretary, Dame Donna Kinnair, told the Today programme this morning that no PPE was \u201cmore precious a resource than a healthcare worker\u2019s life, a nurse\u2019s life, a doctor\u2019s life\u201d. Speaking later on BBC Breakfast she said that every day she was hearing from nurses saying they did not have enough protective equipment, adding: I take offence actually that we are saying that healthcare workers are abusing or overusing PPE. I think what we know is, we don\u2019t have enough supply and not enough regular supply of PPE. This is the number one priority nurses are bringing to my attention, that they do not have adequate supply of protective equipment. The Labour leader Keir Starmer also found it \u201cinsulting\u201d to suggest healthcare workers were \u201cwasting\u201d PPE. After the UK recorded its deadliest daily rise on Friday, which was worse than both Italy and Spain at their peaks, Hancock also reminded the public to stay at home and maintain physical distancing this Easter bank holiday weekend. He went on to pay tribute to the 19 NHS workers who have died after contracting coronavirus. He told BBC Breakfast: My heart goes out to their families, these are people who have put themselves on the front line. The work is going on to establish whether they caught coronavirus in the line of duty while at work or whether, like so many other people, caught it in the rest of their lives. It is obviously quite difficult to work that out. What matters is we pay tribute to their service. He also acknowledged the significance of the diversity of the NHS workers who have died \u2013 a high number of whom came from BAME backgrounds. He added: I\u2019m particularly struck at the high proportion of people from minority ethnic backgrounds and people who have come to this country to work in the NHS who have died of coronavirus. I find it really upsetting actually and it is a testament to the fact that people who have come from all over the world have come and given their lives in service to the NHS and paid for that with their lives. I think we should recognise their enormous contribution. The Telegraph (paywall) has profiled those NHS workers who have lost their lives. We\u2019ll be bringing you all the latest UK coronavirus updates throughout the day as they come in. As ever, your input is invaluable.

It\u2019s a way of showing how the good news of Christ\u2019s resurrection has been passed on from the first Easter by every generation until now.\u201d It is the Queen\u2019s first Easter message. It is understood she chose to release it on Easter Saturday so as not to overshadow traditional Easter messages from religious leaders. The audio message was recorded at Windsor castle, using similar precautions to protect the 93-year-old monarch as those deployed for her rare televised address last week. She recorded it in the White Drawing Room with the sound engineer in the next room. As with the broadcast, the equipment had been set up before the recording and appropriately cleaned before she came into contact with it. She said: \u201cThis year, Easter will be different for many of us but by keeping apart we keep others safe. But Easter isn\u2019t cancelled; indeed, we need Easter as much as ever. The discovery of the risen Christ on the first Easter Day gave his followers new hope and fresh purpose, and we can all take heart from this. \u201cWe know that coronavirus will not overcome us. As dark as death can be \u2013 particularly for those suffering with grief \u2013 light and life are greater. May the living flame of the Easter hope be a steady guide as we face the future.\u201d",

If you want proof, look at the coronavirus that has changed everything and consider the undisputed fact that it spread because of humanity\u2019s abuse of animals.</p> <p>Imagine a world where facts changed minds. The United Nations, governments and everyone with influence would now be saying we should abandon meat or at a minimum cut down on consumption. Perhaps my reading is not as wide as it should be, but I have heard nothing of the sort argued. Making the case would be child\u2019s play and would not be confined to emphasising that Covid-19 probably jumped species in Wuhan\u2019s grotesque wet markets. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/sars\">Sars</a> epidemic of 2002-04 began in Guangdong, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/10/sars-virus-bats-china-severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome\">probably in bats</a>, and then spread to civet cats, sold in markets and eaten in restaurants. The H7N9 strain of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/bird-flu\">bird flu </a>began in China, once again, and moved to humans from diseased poultry.</p> <p>China is a viral petri dish because the Communist party silences voices that warn of danger, as the heroic doctor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/chinese-inquiry-exonerates-coronavirus-whistleblower-doctor-li-wenliang\">Li Wenliang</a> found. Centuries of imperial and socialist dictatorship have taught people to respect the adage \u201cThe shot hits the bird that pokes its head out\u201d. Repression combines with folk beliefs in the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-china-cause.html\">medicinal power of animal carcasses</a>, a deadly quackery that the world\u2019s fastest growing middle class has the money to indulge. Bats, which may be the original source of coronavirus as well as Sars, are meant to restore eyesight. The palm civet is devoured as a sham cure for insomnia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"87c92c41d883eace6c50b4f7d066d5a2d9633e81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/87c92c41d883eace6c50b4f7d066d5a2d9633e81/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A health worker administers Ebola vaccine to a woman in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A health worker administers Ebola vaccine to a woman in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olivia Acland/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet it is too comfortable to damn the Chinese Communist party, essential though that task is. Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-(mers-cov)\">originated in the Middle East</a>, as its name suggests, and came to humans via camels. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ebola\">Ebola</a> began in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and was probably caught from gorillas and chimpanzees. Diseases have always jumped species, but the Covid-19 pandemic may be a sign of an ominous acceleration. A paper this month in the <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society</em> suggests the rate of new infections <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2019.2736\">could be rising</a> as humans cram into every corner of the planet. The loss of habitat and the exploitation of wildlife through hunting and trade increased the risk of infectious \u201cspillover\u201d, it said. Ferocious punishments for the use of \u201cexotic\u201d animals for food and medicines are required. Once again, though, that is too easy a slogan for people in the west to chant and feel virtuous as they chant it. We should be examining our own diets.</p> <p>If antibiotic resistance continues to grow, we may look back on the deaths of the coronavirus pandemic of 2020, and say: \u201cReally? Was that all?\u201d Resistance could end the age of medical progress, returning humanity to a time when minor injuries and routine operations could be fatal. The over-prescription of antibiotics to humans explains in part why bacteria are evolving to resist it, and why <a href=\"researchers%20are%20predicting%2010%20million%20deaths%20a%20year%20from%20antibiotic%20resistance%20by%202050.\">researchers are predicting 10 million deaths a year from antibiotic resistance by 2050.</a> Antibiotic use in the intensive and unfathomably cruel production of meat is as pernicious.

      "bodyText": "The boast that \u201cwhen the facts change, I change my mind\u201d is a proud one. \u201cWhen the facts change, I reinforce my prejudices\u201d is truer. If you want proof, look at the coronavirus that has changed everything and consider the undisputed fact that it spread because of humanity\u2019s abuse of animals. Imagine a world where facts changed minds. The United Nations, governments and everyone with influence would now be saying we should abandon meat or at a minimum cut down on consumption. Perhaps my reading is not as wide as it should be, but I have heard nothing of the sort argued. Making the case would be child\u2019s play and would not be confined to emphasising that Covid-19 probably jumped species in Wuhan\u2019s grotesque wet markets. The Sars epidemic of 2002-04 began in Guangdong, probably in bats, and then spread to civet cats, sold in markets and eaten in restaurants. The H7N9 strain of bird flu began in China, once again, and moved to humans from diseased poultry. China is a viral petri dish because the Communist party silences voices that warn of danger, as the heroic doctor Li Wenliang found. Centuries of imperial and socialist dictatorship have taught people to respect the adage \u201cThe shot hits the bird that pokes its head out\u201d. Repression combines with folk beliefs in the medicinal power of animal carcasses, a deadly quackery that the world\u2019s fastest growing middle class has the money to indulge. Bats, which may be the original source of coronavirus as well as Sars, are meant to restore eyesight. The palm civet is devoured as a sham cure for insomnia. Yet it is too comfortable to damn the Chinese Communist party, essential though that task is. Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) originated in the Middle East, as its name suggests, and came to humans via camels. Ebola began in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and was probably caught from gorillas and chimpanzees. Diseases have always jumped species, but the Covid-19 pandemic may be a sign of an ominous acceleration. A paper this month in the Proceedings of the Royal Society suggests the rate of new infections could be rising as humans cram into every corner of the planet. The loss of habitat and the exploitation of wildlife through hunting and trade increased the risk of infectious \u201cspillover\u201d, it said. Ferocious punishments for the use of \u201cexotic\u201d animals for food and medicines are required. Once again, though, that is too easy a slogan for people in the west to chant and feel virtuous as they chant it. We should be examining our own diets. If antibiotic resistance continues to grow, we may look back on the deaths of the coronavirus pandemic of 2020, and say: \u201cReally? Was that all?\u201d Resistance could end the age of medical progress, returning humanity to a time when minor injuries and routine operations could be fatal. The over-prescription of antibiotics to humans explains in part why bacteria are evolving to resist it, and why researchers are predicting 10 million deaths a year from antibiotic resistance by 2050. Antibiotic use in the intensive and unfathomably cruel production of meat is as pernicious. Factory farming strains animal health. Breeding sows that are not given enough time to recover before being impregnated again, and chickens in crowded cages suffering from heat stress that brings salmonella and E coli, need repeated doses. In 2012, when the then chief medical officer, Sally Davies, warned that antibiotics were losing their \u201ceffectiveness at a rate that is both alarming and irreversible\u201d, she compared the looming health crisis to global warming. To make her comparison complete, we can add that meat eating does indeed contribute disproportionately to the production of greenhouse gasses. Ban the use of antibiotics in farming, then. Treat meat, cow milk and cheese as we treat tobacco and alcohol and hit them with punitive taxes. Make the illegal trade in wild animals as great a crime as the illegal trade in weapons.

It is inevitable that the demand and the pressures on PPE and demand for PPE are going to be exponential. They are going to be incredibly high. And of course we are trying to address that as a government.\u201d</p> \n<p>Speaking to Sky News after the press conference, the shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really an apology, was it? It was one of those half-hearted apologies where you use the word \u2018sorry\u2019 to give the impression that you are apologising but you are not actually in reality apologising.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/comparison\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Patel\u2019s comments came as the health secretary, Matt Hancock, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/11/matt-hancock-reveals-deaths-of-19-nhs-workers-amid-ppe-row\">said that </a>19 UK health workers had died after contracting the virus. He faced intense criticism on Friday after requesting that NHS staff do not overuse protective equipment and instead treat it as \u201ca precious resource\u201d.</p> \n<p>Ashworth said: \u201cWe hear stories every day of healthcare workers on the frontline forced to cut up curtains to make their own PPE. We\u2019ve heard stories of nurses in bin liners because they couldn\u2019t get PPE, and those nurses have now come down with coronavirus. This really has been unacceptable, simply not good enough.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Department of Health and Social Care said on Saturday that a total of 9,875 patients had died in UK hospitals after testing positive for coronavirus as of 5pm on Friday, up 917 on the previous day.</p> \n<p>During her first appearance chairing the government briefing, Patel also launched a public awareness campaign for domestic abuse victims.

      "bodyText": "The home secretary has said she is sorry if people feel there has been a failure to supply sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) to NHS staff, as it was revealed that 19 UK health workers had died after contracting coronavirus. Speaking at the daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing, Priti Patel was asked twice if she would apologise about the lack of PPE being provided to frontline workers. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if people feel that there have been failings,\u201d she said. \u201cI will be very, very clear about that.\u201d However, she added: \u201cBut at the same time, we are in an unprecedented global health pandemic right now. It is inevitable that the demand and the pressures on PPE and demand for PPE are going to be exponential. They are going to be incredibly high. And of course we are trying to address that as a government.\u201d Speaking to Sky News after the press conference, the shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really an apology, was it? It was one of those half-hearted apologies where you use the word \u2018sorry\u2019 to give the impression that you are apologising but you are not actually in reality apologising.\u201d Patel\u2019s comments came as the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said that 19 UK health workers had died after contracting the virus. He faced intense criticism on Friday after requesting that NHS staff do not overuse protective equipment and instead treat it as \u201ca precious resource\u201d. Ashworth said: \u201cWe hear stories every day of healthcare workers on the frontline forced to cut up curtains to make their own PPE. We\u2019ve heard stories of nurses in bin liners because they couldn\u2019t get PPE, and those nurses have now come down with coronavirus. This really has been unacceptable, simply not good enough.\u201d The Department of Health and Social Care said on Saturday that a total of 9,875 patients had died in UK hospitals after testing positive for coronavirus as of 5pm on Friday, up 917 on the previous day. During her first appearance chairing the government briefing, Patel also launched a public awareness campaign for domestic abuse victims. She said talks are ongoing to provide charities and the domestic abuse commissioner with an additional \u00a32m to bolster domestic abuse helplines and online support. The injection of cash is aimed at ensuring victim support is available after charities reported a surge in activity since the social distancing guidelines came into force almost three weeks ago. Patel said: \u201cI am now asking this nation to use that amazing compassion and community spirit to embrace those trapped in the horrific cycle of abuse. \u201cAnd to help us all look out for those who need help, we have created a symbol of hope - a handprint with a heart on - so that people can easily show that we will not tolerate abuse as a society, and that we stand in solidarity with victims of domestic abuse.\u201d From next week, adverts raising awareness of where people can seek help will run across social media, and materials will be made available, including to charities and supermarkets. Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow home secretary, said the government\u2019s measures did not go far enough. \u201cThere needs to be real cross government collaboration to support this sector and this should include ring-fencing some of the chancellor\u2019s recently announced charity funding to support domestic abuse services and the wider violence against women and girls sector,\u201d he said. Patel told the press conference that the virus was changing the nature of the threat the UK faces from crime. She said that while total crime had dropped as people follow the advice to stay at home, criminals were adapting to exploit the virus. She added: \u201cFraudsters are exploiting coronavirus as a hook for new acquisitive crimes with losses to victims already exceeding \u00a31.8m. The perpetrators of sickening online child abuse are seeking to exploit the fact that more and more young people and children are at home and online. \u201cAnd in the last week the National Domestic Abuse Helpline reported a 120% increase in the number of calls it received in one 24-hour period.\u201d The chairman of the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council, Martin Hewitt, said there had been 21% drop in crime overall in the past four weeks compared with the same period last year. He said only a small minority of people had refused to follow social distancing instructions, resulting in officers having to use their enforcement powers. He said next week they would publish enforcement data, which would include the Easter weekend, but that early data from 37 forces revealed 1,084 fines had been issued in England and Wales up to 8 April, an average of fewer than 84 a day.",

For one thing, unequal numbers must offer some protection against women he calls \u201c<a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexwickham/dominic-raab-attitude-towards-woman-and-gender\">obnoxious bigots</a>\u201d. Using quotas to increase women\u2019s representation is, he once wrote in the <em>Times</em>, \u201cmorally wrong\u201d. According to the younger Raab, \u201cyounger men suffer as a result of previous male domination for which they bear no responsibility\u201d. He took special exception to the idea, debated after the 2008 banking collapse, that such catastrophes might be less likely under the Lehman Sisters. Michael Lewis, author of <em>The Big Short</em>, for example, said that, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/19/neuroeconomics-women-city-financial-crash\">were it up to him</a>, \u201cI would take steps to have 50% of women in risk positions in banks.\u201d Christine Lagarde, the former head of the IMF, has likewise <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/05/if-it-was-lehman-sisters-it-would-be-a-different-world-christine-lagarde\">argued for increased female representation</a>: \u201cThis very diversity also leads to more prudence and less of the reckless decision-making that provoked the crisis.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One tribute celebrated Johnson\u2019s public acts of crass, heteronormative recklessness, his mad cycling and speeding</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But guided, as ever, by the science, Raab dismissed such arguments as \u201cplaying on stereotypes that paint men as innately gung-ho and women as more risk-averse\u201d.</p> <p>He could not have known that his own party would later become the sex-stereotyper\u2019s No 1 choice, having sidelined more risk-averse women in favour of a man whose catchphrase was \u201cdo or die\u201d and default insult \u201cgirly swot\u201d. Affectionate pieces about Boris Johnson, when he went into intensive care, could not have made it clearer that his risk-loving, competitive, sexually incontinent, sporty, stereotypically male performance is \u2013 at least to his fraternity of awed admirers \u2013 central to his political appeal. In one tribute, headlined \u201cMr Invincible\u201d, Stephen Robinson celebrated Johnson\u2019s public acts of crass, heteronormative recklessness, his mad cycling and speeding. \u201cFew politicians \u2013 let alone a future prime minister \u2013 could get away with having boasted, as he did in the <em>Spectator</em> magazine, of driving at 160mph up the M40.\u201d</p> <p>Yet to be established, however, is how effective the gendered display, solo and otherwise, will be in the current crisis, beyond the Johnson fan base. The flag-accessorised confirmation, at the daily death count, that men are overwhelmingly in charge has not reassured everyone and not only because it advertises, instructively for any children watching, a hierarchy unevolved, like some of the star performers\u2019 fighting rhetoric, since the second world war.</p> <p>That key decisions about containing the virus are made exclusively by men \u2013 Johnson, Matt Hancock, Raab, Michael Gove, Rishi Sunak \u2013 assisted by the \u201cget Brexit done\u201d brigade, could have implications still more troubling than this group\u2019s demonstrable indifference to the imminent impact of lockdown on women and children, its <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-52092131\">early floundering</a> on abortion. </p> <p>Of Johnson\u2019s early, already comically useless, stab at domestic advice \u2013 \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52011928\">use delivery services where you can</a>\u201d \u2013 one can only think it must have sounded great over Deliveroos inside the frat house, where the ministry of dudes also believes that \u201cstrain every sinew\u201d will greatly reassure health workers actually risking their lives.</p> <p>Yesterday the government briefing was led by Priti Patel for the first time. She highlighted help to victims of domestic abuse, but it seems unlikely that regular appearances at the lectern by this or another female cabinet favourite, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2020/feb/14/how-representative-is-boris-johnsons-new-cabinet\">from the handful available</a>, would have made much difference to the Johnson cabal\u2019s strategy. Though to be fair to Patel, she might have made it more brutal. One reason sex quotas have to be substantial enough to morally outrage Raab is to ensure that female success in male-dominated institutions is not reserved for those willing to imitate stereotypical maleness, possibly in an exaggerated form.</p> <p>But what if women were fairly represented in the senior bodies protecting the UK from Covid-19? <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/uk/cabinet-reshuffle-men-boris-johnson-prepares-sack-top-women-1393752\">Was Andrea Leadsom right</a> to argue, in the <em>Telegraph </em>in February, for \u201cthe excellence that a diverse range of views brings to decision-making\u201d?

He took special exception to the idea, debated after the 2008 banking collapse, that such catastrophes might be less likely under the Lehman Sisters. Michael Lewis, author of The Big Short, for example, said that, were it up to him, \u201cI would take steps to have 50% of women in risk positions in banks.\u201d Christine Lagarde, the former head of the IMF, has likewise argued for increased female representation: \u201cThis very diversity also leads to more prudence and less of the reckless decision-making that provoked the crisis.\u201d But guided, as ever, by the science, Raab dismissed such arguments as \u201cplaying on stereotypes that paint men as innately gung-ho and women as more risk-averse\u201d. He could not have known that his own party would later become the sex-stereotyper\u2019s No 1 choice, having sidelined more risk-averse women in favour of a man whose catchphrase was \u201cdo or die\u201d and default insult \u201cgirly swot\u201d. Affectionate pieces about Boris Johnson, when he went into intensive care, could not have made it clearer that his risk-loving, competitive, sexually incontinent, sporty, stereotypically male performance is \u2013 at least to his fraternity of awed admirers \u2013 central to his political appeal. In one tribute, headlined \u201cMr Invincible\u201d, Stephen Robinson celebrated Johnson\u2019s public acts of crass, heteronormative recklessness, his mad cycling and speeding. \u201cFew politicians \u2013 let alone a future prime minister \u2013 could get away with having boasted, as he did in the Spectator magazine, of driving at 160mph up the M40.\u201d Yet to be established, however, is how effective the gendered display, solo and otherwise, will be in the current crisis, beyond the Johnson fan base. The flag-accessorised confirmation, at the daily death count, that men are overwhelmingly in charge has not reassured everyone and not only because it advertises, instructively for any children watching, a hierarchy unevolved, like some of the star performers\u2019 fighting rhetoric, since the second world war. That key decisions about containing the virus are made exclusively by men \u2013 Johnson, Matt Hancock, Raab, Michael Gove, Rishi Sunak \u2013 assisted by the \u201cget Brexit done\u201d brigade, could have implications still more troubling than this group\u2019s demonstrable indifference to the imminent impact of lockdown on women and children, its early floundering on abortion. Of Johnson\u2019s early, already comically useless, stab at domestic advice \u2013 \u201cuse delivery services where you can\u201d \u2013 one can only think it must have sounded great over Deliveroos inside the frat house, where the ministry of dudes also believes that \u201cstrain every sinew\u201d will greatly reassure health workers actually risking their lives. Yesterday the government briefing was led by Priti Patel for the first time. She highlighted help to victims of domestic abuse, but it seems unlikely that regular appearances at the lectern by this or another female cabinet favourite, from the handful available, would have made much difference to the Johnson cabal\u2019s strategy. Though to be fair to Patel, she might have made it more brutal. One reason sex quotas have to be substantial enough to morally outrage Raab is to ensure that female success in male-dominated institutions is not reserved for those willing to imitate stereotypical maleness, possibly in an exaggerated form. But what if women were fairly represented in the senior bodies protecting the UK from Covid-19? Was Andrea Leadsom right to argue, in the Telegraph in February, for \u201cthe excellence that a diverse range of views brings to decision-making\u201d? Johnson sacked her the following week. Just as literature on risk can\u2019t prove that, run by women, the banks would not have collapsed, we can\u2019t be sure a significant female presence would have altered attitudes when the Johnson friendship group was choosing not to focus on supplies of protective gear and ventilators, not to maintain testing, not to scrutinise arrivals from abroad, not to stop handshaking and not to prohibit massive gatherings such as the England-Wales rugby at Twickenham and the Cheltenham races, despite the World Health Organization\u2019s advice and the evidence from Italy. But if it\u2019s mistaken to imagine that gender diversity might have influenced pre-lockdown attitudes to risk, when tens of thousands of solitary deaths were reportedly assessed as a fair exchange for the survivors\u2019 prosperity, something has to explain why the UK approach was, if not the full gung-ho, so far from inspiring trust. Compare it, for instance, to decisions made in New Zealand, Norway, Denmark, Iceland and Germany \u2013 where policymaking seems to have been guided, above all, by caution. Respect, in any event, to Jacinda Ardern, Erna Solberg, Mette Frederiksen, Katr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir and Angela Merkel. \u2022 Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist",

Many residents are still worried about the number of asymptomatic patients, as well as released patients who retest as positive but do not show symptoms. Others worry about the number of imported cases, as Chinese travellers return from infected countries. Yesterday the National Health Commission reported 46 new cases from the day before, all but four of them from abroad. Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, has seen no new cases for seven days. \u201cWe are still worried and will stay inside. There are still people who have come out that are retesting positive,\u201d said Zhou, 68, who lives in Hankou and who had ventured outside of her home for the first time in two months. Others said they were eager to return to work but still worried about the possibility of a second outbreak. \u201cGoing back to normal doesn\u2019t mean the virus disappears,\u201d said Iris Yao, 41, who also lives in Hankou. At a recently reopened convenience store just outside Wuhan Youfu Hospital near the Huanan Seafood market where cases were first detected, a store owner said she would not have returned to work if she did not have to. \u201cIf I don\u2019t come out, I can\u2019t make money and I cannot eat. If I could, I would stay home,\u201d she said. Several said their neighbourhoods, after loosening restrictions, had become strict again. Some suspected new infections had emerged. Others said they did not trust what was officially reported. Coco Han, 22, who was infected with the virus in January, remembered how her compound in Wuchang still posted its \u201cvirus free\u201d sign even when she was at home sick. But residents also said they believed the government had made up for early missteps, including being slow to alert the public about the virus and suppressing doctors who attempted to warn residents. Chen, 60, from the city of Yichang, which was also placed under strict travel curbs at the beginning of the outbreak, had just returned to Wuhan to go back to work. He was proud of the government\u2019s efforts to contain the virus. \u201cThe government and the country banded together,\u201d he said. \u201cThe party really puts the people first.\u201d Across the city, the after-effects of the epidemic are visible. At a funeral home in Wuchang district, relatives of those who have died over the last two months are still coming to retrieve their ashes. A tent has been put up to house those waiting, with plastic chairs spaced one metre apart. Local residents said that in recent weeks the funeral home had had to limit the number of people who could come to 100 a day. Zhang, whose daughter is studying in Hong Kong, does not want her to come back yet because he does not believe it is safe enough. \u201cSome people believe the disaster is over, but there are also people who don\u2019t see it that way,\u201d he said. \u201cThe danger here is not necessarily bigger than in other Chinese cities, but it is there. From regular people to the government, everyone knows it.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 12 April 2020 to change the headline to more accurately reflect the content of the piece.",

A small boy with a huge grin leaps into his mother\u2019s arms. She\u2019s not much older than a kid herself, with her hair in braids. Later he tells her that he has \u201ctwo mummies\u201d \u2013 her and his grandmother, who he now lives with. \u201cNo, I\u2019m your mum,\u201d she says. A three-month-old baby, visiting her mother with two older siblings, sleeps in her carer\u2019s arms. Sixteen-year-old Sophie and her mother, Gail, also doing time for fraud, sit locked in deep conversation. \u201cThis is the first time since I got here [last] January that I\u2019ve had this time just with her,\u201d Gail, 46, says. Children have to be escorted by an adult into prisons in NSW so normally Sophie\u2019s dad, Gail\u2019s ex-partner, will accompany her. \u201cI appreciate it so much \u2013 to have my daughter uninterrupted for four hours. We can just talk, laugh, cry. And the officers are letting us. They\u2019re not hovering over us.\u201d Gail says she deserves to do time for her crime: she stole money to support a drug habit and got six years. \u201cI wasn\u2019t coping a lot on the outside so I used drugs to block out all the pain of my childhood,\u201d which was characterised by \u201ca lot of abuse: physical, sexual and emotional\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve done programs to address my offending behaviours and I\u2019ll keep my promise to you, Soph, that this is the one and only time,\u201d she says. Sophie nods, her eyes welling up. \u201cObviously it was hard at the start but it\u2019s getting easier,\u201d she says. \u201cBut yeah, it\u2019s still hard.\u201d \u201cWe would say that children serve a silent sentence when their mother goes to jail,\u201d says Kelly-Anne Stewart, principal adviser, women offenders, for Corrective Services NSW. \u201cResearch tells us that children who have a parent in custody certainly suffer a range of ... psychosocial and emotional issues.\u201d And there are long-term consequences, too. Kids with a parent in jail are four to six times more likely to end up in jail. They are 40% more likely to drop out of school. Life for mothers and young babies separated by prison is particularly difficult, says Stewart. \u201cAnyone who\u2019s had a baby would know the bond, and that bonding time, is very important.\u201d There\u2019s only one correctional facility in New South Wales that allows women to keep their preschool-aged children with them, but there are limited places and strict conditions. Not everyone qualifies. About 70% of the 1,000 women in custody in NSW are parents; 40% of those detained women are on remand \u2013 that is, they are awaiting trial and have not been found guilty by a court, a percentage that Stewart admits is \u201cincredibly high\u201d. Being on remand is very stressful, she says. \u201cYou don\u2019t know when you\u2019re getting out \u2026 If you don\u2019t have someone to step in, your children might go into emergency foster care.\u201d The average time for an inmate to be on remand in NSW is 48 days. \u201cThat\u2019s just long enough to cause some serious problems in your life,\u201d says Stewart. And yet a large proportion of women held on remand will not end up getting a custodial sentence. Danielle Fender, service and programs officer at Dillwynia, has done the hard work of fostering relationships with caseworkers to convince custodial carers to participate in today. \u201c[The carers] don\u2019t have to bring [the kids] in if they don\u2019t want to, and that\u2019s where it can get nasty,\u201d she says. \u201cThere were some people who applied and the family were like, nope, we\u2019re not bringing them. \u201cOther people are scared about bringing them into this environment.\u201d For inmates like Amy and Gail, outside of days like today it\u2019s six-minute phone calls in the morning before school and \u2013 before they were suspended by the national cabinet because of coronavirus \u2013 supervised visits of one to two hours every few weeks, depending on security clearance. \u201cWe\u2019re usually in white overalls, zip-tied up the back, so it\u2019s confronting for the children,\u201d says Amy. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to sit in a certain spot. The inmate can\u2019t get up and move around.\u201d Shine for Kids advocates for prison to be a last resort for primary caregivers who are convicted of non-violent crimes, and coronavirus has made that more urgent than ever, says the organisation\u2019s national programs manager, April Long. \u201cThe risk of Covid-19 to this population is extremely high,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are community alternatives to incarceration.\u201d Long supports the suspension of visits to prisons during the pandemic, but has called for video conferencing and free phone calls to be made available \u201cfor parents in custody to remain connected with their children during this time\u201d. Long knows the stigma and shame of losing a parent to jail. It wasn\u2019t until she was 30 that she felt able to talk about the fact that her dad had been incarcerated during her childhood, and the impact it had. \u201cIt\u2019s really challenging, because you\u2019ve got that grief and loss \u2013 it is considered an adverse childhood experience \u2013 [but] different from divorce or the death of a parent, you\u2019re not encouraged to talk about it. \u201cNo one brings you a casserole or rallies around you when a parent goes to prison. \u201cThere are about 75,000 children in Australia right now with a parent in prison,\u201d says Long. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of children who, if we don\u2019t support them now, are at risk of lifelong risk factors including incarceration themselves. The research shows us that. \u201cThe thing that we need to remember is that a lot of these women have [also] been the victims of crime. \u201cA lot of them have been victims of childhood sexual abuse, the vast majority [of women in jail] have been victims of family and domestic violence. I think we have to look at ourselves as a society and [ask]: how have we failed these women?\u201d Sophie will be at least 19 when her mother gets out of jail. \u201cI came in here with her as a 15-year-old,\u201d says Gail, \u201cand I\u2019m going to go out with her picking me up. \u201cYou\u2019re going to pick me up, yeah?\u201d she says, turning to her daughter, a mix of hope and fear on her face. Her daughter attempts a smile and nods. \u201cYeah, I will.\u201d * Names have been changed to protect the identity of inmates\u2019 children.",

Federation executive director Frank Quinlan says the the RFDS faces an unusual tension to ensure it can get into communities to provide medical services and evacuations, without carrying the virus into already isolated places. \u201cAll these communities are experiencing the same health issues they would be experiencing without the [Covid-19],\u201d Quinlan says. \u201cTransportation with people experiencing infectious diseases, or suspected, is a routine part of our business so we are well set up.\u201d \u2018This is a massive opportunity\u2019 The virus outbreak closely followed the horrendous summer of bushfires in the eastern states, and the need to isolate has effectively closed down bushfire recovery centres designed to support communities coping with losses of properties, businesses and livestock. Towns such as Batlow and Tumbarumba in NSW were badly hit, losing significant parts of their orchard and softwood industries. Internet connectivity is an issue in those areas as well, making home-schooling and business frustrating and exacerbating the difficulties of lockdown. In Western Australia, Wongan Hills pork, orange and wheat grower Sue Middleton has spent the past two months rearranging her workforce to allow for isolation and keep employees healthy, protect families and to allow products to continue to markets. She ships pork to Singapore and elsewhere, so she has welcomed the federal government\u2019s export assistance, after the lack of carrying capacity increased freight charges for her business by six times. Middleton says connectivity remains a huge issue but is hopeful that if that hurdle can be solved, rural Australia will emerge in a more competitive place to attract population. She believes if telehealth and connectivity were strengthened, rural communities could compete with the comparative advantages of cities that provide jobs and access to health. \u201cThere is a massive opportunity for rural Australia,\u201d she says. Andrew Vann, the vice-chancellor of Charles Sturt University, Orange, says regional universities are well set up to provide external services, but he is concerned at the hit on regional economies. \u201cWe are worried about the loss of economic capacity, we need to be here to train people,\u201d Vann says. \u201cThere is a risk to the economic future of regional Australia in all of these towns.\u201d But, like Middleton, he is bullish about rural futures. \u201cI think the tide was already turning in favour of regional Australia,\u201d Vann says. \u201cI think people will say, do I really want to be with 6 million people when I\u2019ve discovered I can work from home?\u201d",

      "bodyText": "To paraphrase Liverpool manager, J\u00fcrgen Klopp, sport is very much the most important of the least important things, but it, along with the closure of playhouses and cinemas, has suffered the biggest shock to our society from coronavirus. Because of the way in which seasons operate in both northern and southern hemispheres the virus has brought some sports to a premature end, and prevented the start of others. With that comes some questions to ponder and what might have been. Premier League We began with Klopp, so let us first look at the Premier League. For all long suffering Liverpool fans (myself included) this is bitter one. It is hard to capture just how amazing the 2019-20 season had been for the Reds: So far in front are they that with nine games still to play they are just two wins away from securing the title. Out of 29 matches, only one loss, and one draw. The rest wins. So far in front are they that the real competition was history. They were five wins away from tying Manchester City\u2019s record of 32 wins in a season, and just 18 points behind their 100 point record set in 2017-18: After 29 matches they have amassed four more points than any other team at that stage in the history of the Premier League. A truly great team, and one that even if they are awarded the title, will always have with it a dreaded, and decidedly undeserved, asterisk. NBA This season\u2019s NBA has been one of the most fascinating in a decade. No one team seemed dominant, with no Miami Heat or Golden State Warriors style super teams. At one stage the Milwaukee Bucks looked on track to become the third team ever to achieve 70 wins. Their three consecutive loses before the shutdown probably put paid to that, but the unanswered questions remain: could the Bucks\u2019 style of play win in the playoffs? Would instead LeBron James lead the LA Lakers to a title at the age of 35 and win with his third different team? What of the LA Clippers and last year\u2019s playoff beast Kawhi Leonard? And what the heck do the Philadelphia 76ers make of this season \u2013 a season that promised so much and became an injury soap-opera? If the season ends now (and can you really re-start a season after such a long suspension and still call it the same season?) it also will put an end to one of the great individual seasons by Giannis Antetokounmpo. His \u201cplayer efficiency rating\u201d (which attempts to gauge a player\u2019s overall performance) for this season is bested in the modern era only by Michael Jordan in 1987-88 and James in 2008-09: That is hall of fame level stuff. And again the asterisk is likely to appear. Tennis Tennis has had one of the more odd seasons \u2013 the Australian Open was played without issue, but it looks like no other grand slam will be played. Right now the site of the US Open is being used as a make-shift hospital. The shutdown brings many questions \u2013 firstly directed at Roger Federer and Serena Williams. Both turn 39 this year, and even for these two age is an issue. Does this put an end to their hopes of another grand slam title? For both, Wimbledon and the US Open are their best chances, meaning that next year will see them almost 40 by the time the final slam rolls around. (To be honest, though Federer seems to be taking it all in his stride) Djokovic looked so dominant in Melbourne that a calendar year slam was again being mooted \u2013 now gone. Is the year off for Nadal good for resting his troublesome knee, or does it put the younger generation that bit closer to taking over. Speaking of whom, Dominic Thiem, and Alexander Zverev looked ready to truly challenge at the slam level \u2013 their frustration must be seething. On the women\u2019s side, we see Ash Barty sitting at No 1, perhaps the only one who understands taking time off from the sport. But now she is being robbed of a peak year, and any sense of momentum she might have constructed over the past 12 months. Can you restart where you left off? AFL and NRL Neither of these competitions really began. Sure the NRL played two rounds and the AFL, one, but so long will have been the lay-off that any restarted season really should scrub those points. For both competitions there is less the what-if question of the EPL and NBA, and more a wonder what this means for the players. While it is not a perfect indictor, a look at the 20 highest scoring players in the Brownlow medal show that players have three real peak years from 25-27 years of age, and after 31 the drop-off is severe: That means players like Patrick Cripps, Josh Kelly and even 24-year-old Marcus Bontempelli lose what is expected to be the year that sees them take over the completion. For others like Andrew Gaff, who turns 28, soon to be 29-year-olds Nat Fyfe and Dustin Martin, and 30-year-old Patrick Dangerfield, a key year at their best is lost. For those over 31 like Scott Pendlebury, Joel Selwood and Buddy Franklin, the time at the peak goes ever further in the rear-view mirror. For Gary Ablett Jr, it is gone for good? The NRL has announced it will start on 28 May with 13 more rounds. While this will be great for fans if it happens, if it means the end of NRL Island, then I weep for that gloriously wacky idea. Rubgy union Maybe this could have been the year the Wallabies win the Bledisloe Cup? OK, maybe that question is answerable. Tokyo Olympics The deferment of the Tokyo Olympics introduces an added level of difficulty for those athletes whose careers are based around one window every four years. Gone is the opportunity to see the contest between Kenyan Robert Keter and Ugandan Joshua Cheptegei, who both broke the men\u2019s 5km road world record earlier this year. We also lose the sight of Swedish pole vaulter, Armand Duplantis, who broke the pole vault world record twice in February, operating at his peak powers. For one great athlete the odds are now stacked just that bit higher. Women\u2019s gymnastics is well and truly a young person\u2019s game \u2013 so much so that in 1997 they made 16 the minimum age. In 2016, Simone Biles, at 19 years of age, won the women\u2019s all-around. Even then that made her the oldest winner since the Sydney Olympics: Since 1972 only two women have won medals in the all-around Olympics competition over the age of 22. Biles is now 23. To win next year aged 24 (and half) would make her the oldest winner in the modern era by more than three years. As they say, if anyone can, she can, but it just shows how losing a year of your sporting life matters a great deal more than it does for other careers.

Critics of Maher <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/bill-maher-goes-on-despicably-racist-rant-against-china-over-coronavirus\">pointed out</a> that Asian Americans have faced abuse and attacks since the virus took hold in the US.</p> <p>More than 500,000 cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed in the US, with New York, New Jersey and Michigan worst hit. Together, the three states account for more than 10,000 deaths.</p> <p>On Saturday, Cotton also took aim at Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic governor of Michigan, regarding a stay-at-home order which deemed <a href=\"https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2020/04/michigans-updated-coronavirus-stay-at-home-order-will-close-garden-centers-and-other-parts-of-grocery-stores.html\">garden centers</a> to be non-essential businesses.</p> <p>\u201cI get that Governor Whitmer is auditioning to be [vice-president],\u201d Cotton wrote on Twitter. \u201cFoolish, theatrical orders with no public-health benefits may generate headlines, but they undermine public confidence. Then again, Joe Biden <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/03/politics/joe-biden-trump-china-coronavirus/index.html\">called the China travel ban \u2018xenophobic\u2019</a>.

We also know that just a few miles away from that food market is China\u2019s only biosafety level four super-laboratory, that researches human infectious diseases. \u201cWe don\u2019t have evidence that this disease originated there but because of China\u2019s duplicity and dishonesty from the beginning, we need to at least ask the question to see what the evidence says, and China right now is not giving evidence on that question at all.\u201d The Chinese ambassador to the US censured Cotton following his remarks on Fox and said the senator\u2019s floating of the conspiracy theory was \u201cabsolutely crazy\u201d. The senator walked back on the issue shortly afterwards and said the theory was one of \u201cat least four hypotheses about the origin of the virus\u201d. But Cotton, other leading Trump allies and the president himself have continued to refer to Covid-19 as the Wuhan or Chinese virus, denying that it is racist or discriminatory to do so. On Saturday, Texas senator Ted Cruz was among prominent figures to defend Bill Maher, after the comedian condemned protests against naming the virus with reference to China. Critics of Maher pointed out that Asian Americans have faced abuse and attacks since the virus took hold in the US. More than 500,000 cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed in the US, with New York, New Jersey and Michigan worst hit. Together, the three states account for more than 10,000 deaths. On Saturday, Cotton also took aim at Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic governor of Michigan, regarding a stay-at-home order which deemed garden centers to be non-essential businesses. \u201cI get that Governor Whitmer is auditioning to be [vice-president],\u201d Cotton wrote on Twitter. \u201cFoolish, theatrical orders with no public-health benefits may generate headlines, but they undermine public confidence. Then again, Joe Biden called the China travel ban \u2018xenophobic\u2019. So maybe those two are a good match.\u201d In fact, though Trump placed restrictions on travel from China \u2013 which Biden now backs \u2013 he did not ban such travel entirely. The World Health Organization has cautioned against travel restrictions, saying they can be counterproductive. Research indicates the virus mainly came to the US from Europe, not China. Nonetheless, on Saturday Cotton also tweeted an opinion piece entitled: \u201cTime to put China on lockdown for its dishonesty.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The US has suffered more confirmed coronavirus deaths than any other country, and on Saturday was poised to soon reach 20,000 Covid-19 fatalities, new data indicated. By Saturday evening, Johns Hopkins University\u2019s tally of US Covid-19 fatalities was at 19,877. Italy followed with 19,468. The US was also the first country to report 2,000 deaths in a single day, with 2,108 people dying in the previous 24 hours. New York, the hardest-hit US state, saw 783 deaths on Friday, raising the total to 8,627, governor Andrew Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany, the state capital. \u201cThat is not an all-time high, and you can see that the numbers [are] somewhat stabilizing \u2013 but it is stabilizing at a horrific rate,\u201d Cuomo said. Also on Saturday, the New York Times published a devastating report chronicling Donald Trump\u2019s repeated failures over several months to take the coronavirus crisis seriously, and how the president\u2019s suspicion of the so-called Deep State \u201ccolored\u201d his response even as the death toll began to soar.

There have been 29,507 reported recoveries in the US, the researchers also said. Worldwide coronavirus deaths now total 108,167. Confirmed cases have reached 1,765,030. Recorded worldwide recoveries total 396,693. The US coronavirus crisis is widely recognized to have been exacerbated by slow federal responses and patchwork state-level approaches. \u201cThe shortcomings of Mr Trump\u2019s performance have played out with remarkable transparency as part of his daily effort to dominate television screens and the national conversation,\u201d the Times reported, referring to the president\u2019s rambling and falsehood-ridden press briefings from the White House, which even Republican allies believe are hurting his popularity. No briefing was scheduled for Saturday. The Times article added more recent detail to the Guardian\u2019s in-depth investigation of Trump\u2019s missing six weeks published two weeks ago. Guardian reporting found that a botched rollout of testing, the decision to disband the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s pandemic response team and Trump\u2019s reliance on his own hunches over professional medical advice contributed to confusion and lack of leadership at a critical moment. Specifically, the Times notes that Trump\u2019s belief in the existence of a \u201cDeep State\u201d of bureaucrats and intelligence officials dedicated to his downfall \u2013 a conspiracy theory dismissed by even his closest allies as \u201cfor nut cases\u201d \u2013 caused him to ignore warnings from government experts. \u201cHe could have seen what was coming,\u201d the Times headline said. In a statement, White House spokesman Judd Deere said: \u201cWhile the media and Democrats refused to seriously acknowledge this virus in January and February, President Trump took bold action to protect Americans.\u201d On Friday, White House task force public health expert Dr Deborah Birx said there were signs the outbreak was stabilising, but warned: \u201cWe have not reached the peak.\u201d Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US expert on infectious diseases, recently said the US outbreak would approach its end when new infections numbered almost zero, with the number of deaths close behind. \u201cI believe that in a few months, hopefully, that we\u2019ll get it under control enough that it won\u2019t be as frightening as it is now, but it will not be an absent threat,\u201d Fauci told the Times. On MSNBC on Friday, Fauci was asked if the presidential election in November might be affected. The doctor indicated that was not his area of expertise, replying: \u201cI would hope that by November we would have things under such control that we could have a real degree of normality. That\u2019s my interest and my job as a public health person.\u201d Questions about normalcy are especially fueled by the stalled US economy, as coronavirus-related business closures and slowdowns have caused 16 million people to lose their jobs. Trump has pushed for a reopening of the economy and reportedly hopes to do so by May. But the president has also qualified this hope somewhat, saying at Friday\u2019s briefing: \u201cI want to get it open as soon as possible \u2026 I would love to open it. I\u2019m not determined.\u201d Trump is expected to announce a council of medical and business leaders to assist him with the \u201cbiggest decision I\u2019ve ever had to make\u201d: when to reopen America for business amid a global pandemic. In New York on Saturday, Cuomo also addressed questions about reopening the economy in his briefing. \u201cThis is no time for politics,\u201d he said. \u201cYou start to hear this dialogue on reopening, and you start to hear people with political theories on whether we should open faster, whether we should reopen sooner,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cThat is corrosive and destructive \u2013 and if we don\u2019t stop it, it will feed on itself. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if there\u2019s going to be a second wave or not.\u201d Health experts have warned that prematurely lifting stay-at-home restrictions could prompt a \u201cdeadly resurgence\u201d of coronavirus.",

Johnson chaired last Saturday morning\u2019s coronavirus meetingwith senior ministers, medical advisers and officials and, as ever, the word afterwards was that he had been \u201cin good spirits\u201d. But clearly it was becoming more and more of a struggle.</p> <p>After the meeting the PM\u2019s diary was completely cleared and that evening his pregnant partner Carrie Symonds tweeted that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/04/carrie-symonds-recovering-from-coronavirus\">she too was suffering from symptoms</a> and was also going to self-isolate. </p> <p>The worrying news mounted day after day. At just before 8pm on Sunday, on the advice of his doctor, Johnson was driven in a government car a few hundred metres from Downing Street to be admitted to St Thomas\u2019 Hospital.</p> <p>Again, his team tried to play down the significance of the moment, saying his admission was \u201cprecautionary\u201d. But the PM could no longer pretend to be Winston Churchill. He called Dominic Raab, foreign secretary and first secretary of state, and asked him to chair the main government meeting on coronavirus the next morning and stand in for him on other duties.</p> <p>Then last Monday evening his condition worsened on the ward, and he was transferred to intensive care. The Queen was informed and the news was made public.</p> <p>Charles Walker, a Tory MP who knows Johnson well, said that when he received a text on his phone relaying the news, he and his wife \u2013 like much of the country \u2013 found it hard to take. \u201cWe had watched the Queen on Sunday night, one of the anchors in our lives. She took us back to the moment in her reign when she broadcast during the war with her sister. Then to suddenly hear that our prime minister had been taken into intensive care \u2026 in my 52 years I really have to say I think it was the darkest hour. We had lots of friends and family contracting the virus, and had news of so many people dying, then you think, \u2018my God, we could lose him as well\u2019.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71e4ade188ae66e9f69ad7f70273b0932bd8ee60\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71e4ade188ae66e9f69ad7f70273b0932bd8ee60/0_16_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dominic Raab leaves Downing Street on 9 April with the prime minister in hospital.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dominic Raab leaves Downing Street on 9 April with the prime minister in hospital.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron Chown/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That night people across the country, from all walks of life, reported having sleepless nights.

My first priority is and will always be the student-athletes and doing what is best for the program and the university.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Gundy has come under criticism since a Tuesday conference call with reporters where he said he hoped to have the team return to the on-campus football facilities on 1 May, in defiance of federal social-distancing guidelines. He said the the media has been overly negative in its coverage of what he called the \u201cChinese virus and added that if one of his players or coaches were to test positive after then, they would be \u201cquarantined just like we do people that get the flu\u201d.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe get people that get the flu during the season, we quarantine them, we treat them, we make sure they\u2019re healthy, we bring \u2018em back,\u201d Gundy said. \u201cIt would be the same thing here, but at some point, we\u2019ve got to go back to work. We\u2019ve got to get these guys back in here. ... From what I read, the healthy people can fight this, the antibodies make it better. They\u2019re doing some blood transplants now with the people that have already gotten the disease, that have gotten over it that have the antibodies that can fight it. There\u2019s a lot of people who can figure this out. May 1\u2019s our goal. Don\u2019t know if it will happen. Players will come in after that.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The remarks prompted a swift statement from the university, which said: \u201cWe will adhere to the advice of public health experts who are making informed decisions in the best interest of the citizens of our nation and state based on sound scientific data.\u201d</p> \n  <p>It\u2019s not the first time Gundy, whose annual salary is $5.13m, has whipped up controversy over his right-wing views. But USA Today\u2019s Dan Wolken made a salient point <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/dan-wolken/2020/04/07/oklahoma-state-coach-mike-gundy-coronavirus-comments/2966225001/\">in a Wednesday op-ed</a> that Gundy\u2019s political ideology is immaterial:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Hey, according to \u201cDr. Gundy,\u201d what\u2019s the harm in 18-, 19-, 20-, 21-year-olds possibly getting exposed to coronavirus? If they\u2019re healthy, it\u2019s all good, right? At any rate, we\u2019ve got to get moving, Gundy suggested, because paying salaries and \u201ccontinuing the economy in this state\u201d relies on the bodies of unpaid amateurs and people will \u201cfeel better\u201d watching football on TV.</p> \n   <p>Herd immunity, right? That\u2019s actually what Dr. Gundy was getting at. In fact, he referred to players as \u201cthe herd of healthy people\u201d who can fight the virus, even though that is, uh, not exactly the way any of this works. </p> \n   <p>None of this should be a surprise. Gundy has been edging toward the cliff of absurdity for a while now. In November 2018, he blamed \u201cliberalism\u201d for players transferring, saying \u201cI\u2019m a firm believer in the snowflake.\u201d He acknowledged Tuesday he\u2019s getting a lot of his information these days from the ultra-conservative One America News Network, an outlet he described as objective and non-political despite its history of pushing debunked right-wing conspiracy theories related to the murder of Seth Rich, and Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting survivor David Hogg.</p> \n   <p>But this isn\u2019t really about Gundy\u2019s political ideology or his sources of information. It\u2019s about him saying the quiet part out loud regarding how many college coaches view their players.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-11T22:17:48.787Z\">at 11.17pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e92312a8f08db3109f20e00\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-11T21:10:54.485Z\">10.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Arkansas senator Tom Cotton, who <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/17/business/media/coronavirus-tom-cotton-china.html\">floated a conspiracy theory</a> which said the Chinese government created Covid-19 in a weapons lab <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/11/republican-tom-cotton-coronavirus-china\">claimed on Saturday</a> that \u201ccommon sense has been my guide\u201d since he first learned of the outbreak in mid-January.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>\u201cNot Chinese communist lies.

But we do know that we have to get to the bottom of that.

The US has suffered more confirmed coronavirus deaths than any other country, and on Saturday was poised to soon reach 20,000 Covid-19 fatalities, new data indicated. Cuomo undercuts De Blasio bid to keep New York schools shut until September. New York governor Andrew Cuomo and New York City mayor Bill de Blasio once again had differing opinions on who has authority to implement certain Covid-19 policies. Every US state is now under a disaster declaration. Wyoming has become the 50th, and final, US state to be under a disaster declaration following approval by Donald Trump on Saturday. That means for for the first time in history every US state is under a disaster declaration, which allows federal funds to be used by state and local governments during the pandemic.

We thank you, we pray for you, we owe you a great debt. This message is for my black brothers and sisters: We must survive. This pandemic is real and the damage that is left in the wake of the coronavirus is realized mostly in our communities. Bad policy, institutional neglect and overexposure place us disproportionately in arm\u2019s reach of the dangers of this deadly virus. \u201cWe are the essential worker. We are the most impacted. Yet the focus of the resources aren\u2019t being invested in us. We cannot wait for a government that has never prioritized us; we must look out for ourselves. So take care of you first, share your resources, protect the elderly and stay home as much as possible. Please stay safe, stay healthy and survive. Because whether they know it or not, the world needs us \u2013 and we need us.\u201d The US Air Force Air Thunderbirds conducted a flyover in celebration of frontline workers, flying past all the major hospitals throughout the Las Vegas valley. Brigadier general Robert Novotny said: \u201cWe were looking at how we could continue to fly and also give back to the community with a salute to the real heroes out there on the front lines who are keeping us safe from the virus.\u201d Oklahoma State University football coach Mike Gundy has apologized for comments he made during a teleconference this week about the national response to the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cI have been made aware that comments from my press conference have offended some,\u201d Gundy said in a statement issued on Saturday. \u201cIt was never my intention to offend anyone and I apologize. My first priority is and will always be the student-athletes and doing what is best for the program and the university.\u201d Gundy has come under criticism since a Tuesday conference call with reporters where he said he hoped to have the team return to the on-campus football facilities on 1 May, in defiance of federal social-distancing guidelines. He said the the media has been overly negative in its coverage of what he called the \u201cChinese virus and added that if one of his players or coaches were to test positive after then, they would be \u201cquarantined just like we do people that get the flu\u201d. \u201cWe get people that get the flu during the season, we quarantine them, we treat them, we make sure they\u2019re healthy, we bring \u2018em back,\u201d Gundy said. \u201cIt would be the same thing here, but at some point, we\u2019ve got to go back to work. We\u2019ve got to get these guys back in here. ... From what I read, the healthy people can fight this, the antibodies make it better. They\u2019re doing some blood transplants now with the people that have already gotten the disease, that have gotten over it that have the antibodies that can fight it. There\u2019s a lot of people who can figure this out. May 1\u2019s our goal. Don\u2019t know if it will happen. Players will come in after that.\u201d The remarks prompted a swift statement from the university, which said: \u201cWe will adhere to the advice of public health experts who are making informed decisions in the best interest of the citizens of our nation and state based on sound scientific data.\u201d It\u2019s not the first time Gundy, whose annual salary is $5.13m, has whipped up controversy over his right-wing views. But USA Today\u2019s Dan Wolken made a salient point in a Wednesday op-ed that Gundy\u2019s political ideology is immaterial: Hey, according to \u201cDr. Gundy,\u201d what\u2019s the harm in 18-, 19-, 20-, 21-year-olds possibly getting exposed to coronavirus? If they\u2019re healthy, it\u2019s all good, right? At any rate, we\u2019ve got to get moving, Gundy suggested, because paying salaries and \u201ccontinuing the economy in this state\u201d relies on the bodies of unpaid amateurs and people will \u201cfeel better\u201d watching football on TV. Herd immunity, right? That\u2019s actually what Dr. Gundy was getting at. In fact, he referred to players as \u201cthe herd of healthy people\u201d who can fight the virus, even though that is, uh, not exactly the way any of this works. None of this should be a surprise. Gundy has been edging toward the cliff of absurdity for a while now. In November 2018, he blamed \u201cliberalism\u201d for players transferring, saying \u201cI\u2019m a firm believer in the snowflake.\u201d He acknowledged Tuesday he\u2019s getting a lot of his information these days from the ultra-conservative One America News Network, an outlet he described as objective and non-political despite its history of pushing debunked right-wing conspiracy theories related to the murder of Seth Rich, and Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting survivor David Hogg. But this isn\u2019t really about Gundy\u2019s political ideology or his sources of information. It\u2019s about him saying the quiet part out loud regarding how many college coaches view their players. Arkansas senator Tom Cotton, who floated a conspiracy theory which said the Chinese government created Covid-19 in a weapons lab claimed on Saturday that \u201ccommon sense has been my guide\u201d since he first learned of the outbreak in mid-January. \u201cNot Chinese communist lies. Not \u2018the models\u2019. Not so-called \u2018public-health experts\u2019. Just common sense. Many elected leaders have also been guided by common sense. Others haven\u2019t.\u201d The virus is believed to have originated in a market in Wuhan in which wild animals were sold. But in an appearance on Fox News in February, Cotton floated a conspiracy theory which suggests the virus was manufactured in a Chinese bioweapons facility. \u201cHere\u2019s what we do know,\u201d he said. \u201cThe virus did not originate in the Wuhan animal market. Epidemiologists \u2026 have demonstrated that several of the original cases did not have any contact with that food market. That the virus went into that food market before it came out of that food market. \u201cSo we don\u2019t know where it originated. But we do know that we have to get to the bottom of that. We also know that just a few miles away from that food market is China\u2019s only biosafety level four super-laboratory, that researches human infectious diseases. \u201cWe don\u2019t have evidence that this disease originated there but because of China\u2019s duplicity and dishonesty from the beginning, we need to at least ask the question to see what the evidence says, and China right now is not giving evidence on that question at all.\u201d A federal judge has ruled Kentucky\u2019s largest city cannot halt a drive-in church service planned for Easter. From the Associated Press: On Fire Christian Church had sued Louisville mayor Greg Fischer and the city after Fischer announced drive-in style religious gatherings were not allowed on Easter. US district judge Justin Walker sided with the church. \u201cOn Holy Thursday, an American mayor criminalized the communal celebration of Easter,\u201d Walker wrote in his sternly worded 20-page opinion. \u201cThat sentence is one that this Court never expected to see outside the pages of a dystopian novel, or perhaps the pages of The Onion.\u201d Walker added that \u201cThe mayor\u2019s decision is stunning. And it is, \u2018beyond all reason,\u2019 unconstitutional.\u201d Fischer had argued that drive-in church services weren\u2019t \u201cpractical or safe\u201d for the community. However, Walker noted that drive-thru restaurants and liquor stores were still allowed to operate. Coronavirus continues to tear through New York City\u2019s jails. The city\u2019s Department of Correction said that 318 detainees, and 562 staff members, have tested positive for Covid-19 as of Saturday morning; two jailed persons have died from the virus. According to the New York Times, seven jail staffers have died due to coronavirus as of Wednesday. New Jersey governor Phil Murphy has issued an executive order requiring face coverings for all customers entering restaurants and bars to pick up carry-out food in the state. Murphy\u2019s order, which goes into effect on Monday at 8pm, comes as New Jersey\u2019s numbers continue to surge with at least 58,151 cases and 2,183 deaths due to Covid-19 \u2013 including 3,599 new positive tests and 251 new fatalities in the last 24 hours \u2013 second only to New York nationally. \u201cSome may view this as another inconvenience,\u201d Murphy said during his daily press briefing on Saturday in Trenton. \u201cBut you know what would be really inconvenient, is if you ended up in hospital with Covid-19 or if you infected a family member. We accept this is inconvenient.\u201d The order also includes a directive for NJ Transit and private carriers to cut all rail and bus capacity by 50% in an effort to curb the spread and for all transit workers to be provided face masks and gloves. Wyoming has become the 50th, and final, US state to be under a disaster declaration following approval by Donald Trump on Saturday. That means for for the first time in history every US state is under a disaster declaration. The US Virgin islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico are also under disaster declarations, which allow federal funds to be used by state and local governments during the pandemic. \u201cThough Wyoming has not reached the dire situations of some states, this declaration will help us to prepare and mobilize resources when we need them,\u201d said Wyoming\u2019s governor, Mark Gordon, in a statement after requesting the declaration earlier this week. There have been 253 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Wyoming to date. Wyoming is the least populated state in the US. So far there have been no deaths from Covid-19 among its 578,000 residents. The US government has executed the Defense Production Act for the law\u2019s first project during the Covid-19 outbreak. The act allows the government to order private industry to assist in the defense of the nation. The $133m project will \u201cincrease domestic production capacity of N95 masks to over 39m in the next 90 days,\u201d according to a government press release. The release said that the companies involved in the project will be released in the coming days. Coronavirus continues to take its toll on the emergency services. The New York Fire Department says that 714 of its members have tested positive for Covid-19 and approximately 2,700 of the department are currently sick or on medical leave. That\u2019s a striking number given that the FDNY has a total of 17,000 members, a number that includes firefighters EMS and civilians. The archbishop of New Orleans, Gregory Aymond, is one of nearly 20,000 residents of Louisiana to have tested positive for Covid-19, so it\u2019s no surprise he took precautions when giving his Good Friday blessing. The Times-Picayune/New Orleans Advocate reports that the 70-year-old, who has now recovered from the virus, sprinkled holy water from a second world war-era biplane above the city. \u201cWhen I first did it, the water came back on me,\u201d Aymond said, \u201cbut then I got situated.\u201d He was not the first religious leader to fly above the city this month. Rabbi Lexi Erdheim of the Congregation Gates of Prayer Synagogue in Metairie flew in the same plane as the archbishop to offer a Passover blessing. \u201cIt was really powerful, seeing everything at once,\u201d she said, \u201cespecially after being inside the same four walls for so long.\u201d Aymond said he was cautious at first about flying in a plane that is older than himself. \u201cI asked some questions about the plane,\u201d he said. \u201cEventually my questions became trust.\u201d The US navy dismissed Brett Crozier, the commander of the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier, earlier this month after he raised the alarm about an outbreak of coronavirus on his ship. The acting secretary of the US navy, Thomas Modly, subsequently resigned after he said Crozier was \u201ctoo naive or too stupid\u201d to captain the ship. Meanwhile, Crozier\u2019s concerns continue to look justified. CNN reports that 550 of the ship\u2019s sailors have tested positive for Covid-19. Fox News reports that that figure is 75% of the total number of members of the US navy to have tested positive for the virus worldwide. One member of the ship\u2019s crew is understood to be in intensive care in Guam. New Jersey has the second most deaths from Covid-19 of any state in the US. The state\u2019s governor, Phil Murphy, has said customers entering restaurants and bars for takeouts must now wear a facemask, while capacity on public transport will be cut by 50% in an effort to control the outbreak. Murphy said on Saturday that 251 people had died of the virus in New Jersey over the last 24 hours, bringing the total to 2,183 since the outbreak began. Murphy added that he believed measures to slow the spread of the virus are working but there is still work to do. \u201cThe curve is flattening,\u201d he said. [But] we\u2019re not in the end zone folks, we cannot spike any footballs, we\u2019re not even first and goal.\u201d Richard Luscombe has an update from behind the scenes at the White House. A devastating New York Times report published on Saturday chronicles Donald Trump\u2019s repeated failures over several months to take the coronavirus crisis seriously, and how his suspicion of the so-called Deep State \u201ccolored\u201d his tortoise-paced response even as the death toll from Covid-19 began to soar. The newspaper paints a picture of a chronically divided White House, with scientists and medical experts at odds with, and often losing out to, Trump\u2019s political, economic and financial advisers in the battle for the president\u2019s ear. The internal wranglings, the Times says, slowed any clear, consistent or timely decision-making against the backdrop of Trump\u2019s impeachment and trial in the US Senate. \u201cMr Trump\u2019s response was colored by his suspicion of and disdain for what he viewed as the \u2018Deep State\u2019 - the very people in his government whose expertise and long experience might have guided him more quickly toward steps that would slow the virus, and likely save lives,\u201d the report, compiled and written by six New York Times reporters, claims. \u201cThe shortcomings of Mr Trump\u2019s performance have played out with remarkable transparency as part of his daily effort to dominate television screens and the national conversation,\u201d it adds, referring to the president\u2019s rambling and falsehood-ridden press briefings from the White House, which even Republican allies believe are hurting his popularity. The Times article adds more recent detail to the Guardian\u2019s in-depth investigation of Trump\u2019s missing six weeks published two weeks ago. Our reporting found that a botched rollout of testing, the administration\u2019s decision to disband the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s pandemic response team and Trump\u2019s reliance on his own hunches over professional medical advice contributed to the confusion and lack of leadership at a critical moment for the US. Specifically, the Times notes that it was Trump\u2019s fear of, and belief in the existence of a \u2018Deep State\u2019 \u2013 a conspiracy theory dismissed by even his closest allies as \u201cfor nut cases\u201d \u2013 that caused him to ignore warnings from government experts. \u201cHe could have seen what was coming,\u201d the Times headline says. New York governor Andrew Cuomo and New York City mayor Bill de Blasio once again had differing opinions on who has authority to implement certain Covid-19 policies. This time, it involved De Blasio\u2019s announcement on Saturday morning that New York City schools would remain closed for the rest of the school year. De Blasio said his administration is forging a \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d to safely reopen schools in September and that \u201cnext year is going to have to be the greatest academic year New York public schools have ever had.\u201d At Cuomo\u2019s daily press briefing shortly thereafter, however, the governor contended \u201cthere has been no decision on [closing New York City] schools.\u201d Cuomo added: \u201cWhen we made the decision to close the schools, we made it for the entire region. Any decision to reopen them will also be a coordinated decision.\u201d Cuomo was then pressed on the topic and De Blasio\u2019s earlier statements. \u201cThat\u2019s his opinion. He didn\u2019t close them and he can\u2019t open them,\u201d Cuomo said \u201cIt happened on a metropolitan-wide basis and we\u2019ll act on a metropolitan basis, coordinating with Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester [counties].\u201d Cuomo insisted school closures and reopenings were his call. \u201cIt is my legal authority in this situation,\u201d he told reporters. Freddi Goldstein, De Blasio\u2019s press secretary, took issue with Cuomo\u2019s comments. \u201cThe Governor\u2019s reaction to us keeping schools closed is reminiscent of how he reacted when the Mayor called for a shelter in place. We were right then and we\u2019re right now,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cSchools will remain closed, just like how we eventually \u2013 days later \u2013 moved to a shelter in place model.\u201d A TV news channel in Mississippi has found a church pastor who says he plans to hold an in-person Easter Sunday service \u2013 in contravention of a mayor\u2019s executive order \u2013 because he\u2019s upset that more people will be at home improvement stores tomorrow than would be permitted in his congregation. \u201cIt\u2019s kinda hard for me to understand why I can only have 10 in a worship service when I go to Lowe\u2019s, Home Depot, and there are more than 10,\u201d Jesse Horton Sr, pastor at Jackson\u2019s Emmanuel Baptist missionary church, told WAPT-TV. \u201cWhy is it that everything else can be open?\u201d Chokwe Antar Lumumba, the mayor of Jackson, has taken a hard line on a coronavirus lockdown, challenging the authority of Tate Reeves, the Mississippi governor, and threatening to cut off electricity to any businesses that defy his instructions. \u201cIf you live in the city of Jackson, you take my executive order,\u201d said Lumumba, who has signed a directive outlawing gatherings of more than 10 people. Conversely, as in many other states, Reeves\u2019 own stay-at-home order appears to exempt religious services at houses of worship. Horton says he plans to press ahead with his Easter service tomorrow, but promises to shut it down if Jackson cops show up to enforce the order. \u201cWe will likely have more than 10. We will be sitting in space. I\u2019m going to say to the congregation, \u2018Let\u2019s be as safe as possible. Let\u2019s not do anything foolish\u2019,\u201d he said. Horton\u2019s is not the only Mississippi church making waves in the debate over religious freedoms during the pandemic. Greenville\u2019s Temple Baptist Church is suing the city government and mayor for breaking up a drive-in service it recently staged, and issuing $500 fines to attendees, according to the Washington Times. The church insists it followed state and federal guidelines and that those who attended remained in their vehicles with windows fully closed, turning into the service on their car radios. \u201cThis is government overreach,\u201d Kristen Waggoner, general counsel of the Alliance Defending Freedom, a religious rights law firm, said in a tweet. \u201cIf [the] government allows waiting in a car at Sonic it should permit a drive-thru Easter service. [The] first amendment is not completely suspended, nor does government have unlimited authority to target churches however they please.\u201d The Greenville mayor Errick Simmons told the newspaper he hadn\u2019t seen the lawsuit but that the city\u2019s actions were to save lives and not intended to restrict religious freedoms. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau says his country faces a \u201cfork in the road\u201d after public health officials revealed a projected death toll between 11,000 and 22,000. \u201cWe will not be coming back to our former normal situation; we can\u2019t do that until we have developed a vaccine and that could take 12 to 18 months,\u201d Trudeau said in an address to the House of Commons in Ottawa. \u201cWe don\u2019t exactly know how long \u2013 we hope it\u2019s earlier rather than later.\u201d He adds: \u201cOver the coming weeks and months, we will face a number of obstacles. We will go through periods of uncertainty. Fear and uncertainty will continue to be a part of our daily lives. And unfortunately, together, we will mourn the loss of loved ones. Even if we take every possible precaution, the situation may get worse before it gets better. That is the sad reality our country faces. Our determination to put an end to this virus and our commitment to look out for one another will be put to the test, but I know that we are up to the challenge.\u201d The US is poised to reach 19,000 confirmed coronavirus deaths \u2013 more than any other country, new data indicates. On Saturday morning, Johns Hopkins University\u2019s tally of US Covid-19 fatalities was at 18,860. Italy followed in fatalities, with 18,849. The US was also the first country to report 2,000 deaths in a single day, with 2,108 people dying in the previous 24 hours. The US outbreak, now exceeding a half-million confirmed cases, outpaces Spain, the country with the second-most confirmed cases, by approximately 340,000. \u201cTo the extent it\u2019s flattering I appreciate it,\u201d Cuomo says of the speculation about his running for higher office, before going out of his way to shut it town. \u201cThere is no politics here. I have no political agenda, period. I\u2019m not running for president, I\u2019m not running vice-president. I\u2019m not running anywhere. I\u2019m not going to Washington. I\u2019m staying right here. I said to the people of this state, unequivocally, when I was running for governor, I will serve as your governor. Well they all say that, and then they do something different. \u201cI\u2019m not that person. I am going to do what i said I was going to do.\u201d Cuomo says \u201cthere has been no decision on (closing New York City) schools\u201d, appearing to trump De Blasio\u2019s announcement from earlier this morning, \u201cWhen we made the decision to close the schools, we made it for the entire region,\u201d Cuomo says. \u201cAny decision to reopen them will also be a coordinated decision.\u201d When pressed, the governor is more explicit: \u201cThat\u2019s his opinion. He didn\u2019t close them and he can\u2019t open them. It happened on a metropolitan-wide basis and we\u2019ll act on a metropolitan basis, coordinating with Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester (counties).\u201d Cuomo has spent a good deal of time on the weight of the re-opening decision. \u201cRe-opening is both a public health question and an economic question, and I\u2019m unwilling to divorce the two,\u201d Cuomo says. \u201cThere is no economic answer that does not attend to public health. In my opinion, you can\u2019t ask the people of this state and this country to choose between lives lost and dollars gained, No one is going to make that quid pro quo. I understand the need to bring back the economy as quickly as possible, I understand people need to work. I also know we need to save lives and we have. One cannot be at the expense of the other.\u201d He adds: \u201cThe worst thing that can happen is we make a misstep and we let our emotions get ahead of logic and fact and we go through this again.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt I have worked hand in glove with the president here,\u201d says Cuomo, who stresses the need to keep politics out of any decision to re-open. \u201c[Trump] has really responded to New York\u2019s needs.\u201d The governor elaborates on the multiple models and forecasters that have projected greater death tolls than what have been realized so far, emphasizing that it\u2019s far too soon to tell when everything will be over and when things can go back to normal. \u201cI say it\u2019s too soon to tell, it\u2019s too soon for Monday morning quarterbacking, because the game isn\u2019t even over yet,\u201d Cuomo says. \u201cWhat do you think we\u2019re in, the sixth inning for baseball? You think were at halftime if it\u2019s a football game? You don\u2019t know yet what the actual issue is going to be, and you don\u2019t know yet how this turns out, because many decisions have to be made. You have to re-open, you have to decide how to re-open, you have to decide when to re-open. And that is going to be impactful. We don\u2019t know if there\u2019s going to be a second wave or not. All of these things are yet to come, so anyone who wants to say, well, here\u2019s the score at halftime and I\u2019m going to now claim try to collect my bet because it\u2019s halftime, it doesn\u2019t work that way. The game has to be over and this game isn\u2019t over.\u201d New York governor Andrew Cuomo starts with the good news at his daily coronavirus briefing from Albany: \u201cThe curve of the increase is continuing to flatten. The number of hospitalizations appears to have hit an apex and the apex appears to be a plateau.\u201d With the US on the edge of passing Italy as the country with the most coronavirus deaths \u2013 by some counts it already has \u2013 the governor announced 783 deaths in New York on Friday, raising the total to 8,627. Cuomo said the death rate in the state was \u201cstabilizing\u201d but was clear that this is still a terrible outbreak: the death rate was stabilizing \u201cat a horrific rate\u201d, he said, causing \u2018incredible loss and pain\u2019. \u201cPeople ask: well, when is it over, when is it over, when it is over?\u201d Cuomo says. \u201cWinston Churchill said: Now this is not the end, it is not even the beginning of the end, but it is perhaps the end of the beginning. It\u2019s just a great Churchill quote, it\u2019s precise and how he uses language. I think that\u2019s a fair statement of where we are now.\u201d A federal judge on Friday granted temporary bail to Michael Avenatti after the former Stormy Daniels lawyer voiced coronavirus concerns at the Manhattan federal jail where he was being held. Avenatti was convicted in the Southern District of New York this February of trying to extort sportswear titan Nike. He was arrested in California shortly before this trial for allegedly violating bail, leading to his detention in Manhattan\u2019s Metropolitan Correctional Center. Avenatti still faces another federal trial in Manhattan, for allegedly defrauding Daniels, as well as a federal fraud trial in California. In arguing for bail, Avenatti\u2019s lawyer said in an 18 March court filing that he is among the \u201cmost-at-risk for contracting Covid-19\u201d both because he is a \u201cdetained prisoner, and therefore far more susceptible to the virus\u201d as well as a recent bout of pneumonia. Central District of California judge James Selna agreed to release Avenatti for 90 days on a $1m bond. Avenatti is also required to be quarantined in a federal Bureau of Prisons facility for 14 days. He must wear a \u201clocation monitoring bracelet\u201d and is not allowed to \u201cpossess, use, or access any digital devices that offer or allow internet access\u201d. Avenatti also is not permitted to \u201copen, either directly or indirectly, any new bank accounts, credit card accounts, or other financial Accounts,\u201d or conduct \u201cany financial transactions exceeding $500\u201d without prior approval, Selna said in his decision. A report from our man in Miami, on Donald Trump\u2019s man in Florida, Republican governor Ron DeSantis, and his uneven response to the coronavirus crisis\u2026 It\u2019s been another bumpy week for Florida\u2019s governor Ron DeSantis, previously criticised for his slow response to the pandemic and now under fire for falsely claiming that nobody under 25 had died of coronavirus. Teachers in South Florida fear that DeSantis\u2019s incorrect statement, made at a roundtable discussion on Thursday, indicated his desire to reopen schools in the state soon. \u201cI don\u2019t think nationwide there\u2019s been a single fatality under 25. For whatever reason it just doesn\u2019t seem to threaten kids,\u201d the governor said, before going on to say such \u201cdata\u201d should be a factor in a decision to reopen schools in two-week increments. The statement was not true. Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s leading infectious diseases expert, debunked it at Friday\u2019s White House press briefing and warned that students would likely get infected if schools opened too early. DeSantis himself tried to walk back the comment at his own Friday briefing, insisting he had meant nobody under 25 had died in Florida, which is true. But it didn\u2019t save him a dressing-down from the United Teachers of Dade union, which accused the governor of gambling with the health of students and school employees. \u201cThe notion that reopening our schools is an option because \u2018if you\u2019re younger, it just hasn\u2019t had an impact\u2019 is not only completely contradictory to what we know to be the facts of this pandemic, it is dangerous for our communities at large,\u201d union president Karla Mats said in a statement. \u201cIt takes teachers, administrators, bus drivers, cafeteria workers, custodians, and a host of other folks to make sure [schools] function and run accordingly. Many would be placed at great risk through this type of exposure, not to mention their families.\u201d The missteps appear to be taking a toll on DeSantis\u2019s popularity, according to the Tampa Bay Times. In an article on Saturday, the newspaper says support for the governor has plummeted while that for his counterparts in other states has soared, linking to a Microsoft News poll that ranked DeSantis third-worst nationwide at handling the pandemic. De Blasio closes by wishing New Yorkers a happy Easter despite the outbreak and lockdown. \u201cGod bless all New Yorkers in the middle of this incredibly difficult crisis,\u201d he says, leaving the stage. De Blasio is asked about the impact of the coronavirus crisis in the Bronx, the poorest of the five boroughs of New York City. \u201cThere are real disparities in how this crisis is playing out,\u201d he says, citing \u201ca cycle of unfairness that\u2019s playing out very painfully and deeply\u201d. The question focuses on education needs in the Bronx with the New York public schools system shut down until September. Once again \u2013 here\u2019s Ed Pilkington and Ankita Rao\u2019s report about the Bronx and its place within the crisis in New York City: In the New York presser, De Blasio is asked if social distancing guidelines in the city might be tightened further. He would do so if it became necessary, he says. For example he could tighten the definition of what is essential work even further, or limit the number of people who are allowed to do it. But De Blasio adds: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy to do theoreticals either way\u201d, referring to being asked to describe how social restrictions might alternatively be loosened. \u201cHere is a plan that New Yorkers are actually making work,\u201d he adds, even though the city is not out of the woods yet. He wants strict enforcement and sustained progress, before talking about \u201csome loosening up\u201d. Our reporter takes a look at grim milestone expected today, and what Donald Trump and federal experts have said about prospects of returning to normalcy: The US was poised on Saturday to reach 19,000 confirmed coronavirus deaths \u2013 more than any other country, new data indicate. The US outbreak, now exceeding a half-million confirmed cases, outpaces Spain, the country with the second-most confirmed cases, by approximately 340,000. On Saturday morning, Johns Hopkins University\u2019s tally of US Covid-19 fatalities was at 18,777. Italy continued to lead in fatalities, with 18,849, but the US was also the first country to report 2,000 deaths in a single day, with 2,108 people dying in the previous 24 hours. Researchers at John Hopkins have tallied a total of 501,615 confirmed US cases. Spain follows with 161,852. Italy ranks third, at 147,577. There have been 29,191 reported recoveries in the US, the researchers also said. Worldwide coronavirus deaths now total 103,795. Confirmed cases have reached 1,712,674. Recorded worldwide recoveries total 353,706. The US coronavirus crisis is widely recognized to have been exacerbated by slow federal responses and patchwork state-level approaches. White House expert Dr Deborah Birx has said there are positive signs that the outbreak is stabilising, but warned: \u201cWe have not reached the peak.\u201d Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US expert on infectious diseases, recently said the US outbreak will approach its end when new infections number almost zero, with the number of deaths close behind. \u201cI believe that in a few months, hopefully, that we\u2019ll get it under control enough that it won\u2019t be as frightening as it is now, but it will not be an absent threat,\u201d Fauci told The New York Times. On MSNBC on Friday, Fauci was asked about the presidential election: \u201cIf you had your way, and I know November to a lot of people seems a long time from now, would people in all 50 states have the right and ability to vote by mail?\u201d Fauci indicated that was not his area of expertise, according to Mediaite, replying: \u201cI would hope that by November we would have things under such control that we could have a real degree of normality. That\u2019s my interest and my job as a public health person.\u201d Questions about normalcy are especially fueled by the stalled US economy, as coronavirus-related business closures and slowdowns have caused 16 million people to lose their jobs. Donald Trump has pushed for a reopening of the economy and reportedly hopes to do so by May. But the president has qualified this hope somewhat, saying at Friday\u2019s press briefing: \u201cI want to get it open as soon as possible \u2026 I would love to open it. I\u2019m not determined.\u201d Trump is expected to next week announce a council of medical and business leaders who will assist him with the \u201cbiggest decision I\u2019ve ever had to make\u201d: When to reopen America for business amidst a global pandemic. Health experts have warned that prematurely lifting stay-at-home restrictions could prompt a \u201cdeadly resurgence\u201d of coronavirus. Answering questions from the press, De Blasio says New York can plan to reopen its public school system, the largest in the US, in September as that may be a time when \u201cthings will get more back to normal\u201d in the city. But it isn\u2019t a hard target or a sure one, of course. De Blasio details new moves being taken to protect New York City\u2019s homeless from the coronavirus outbreak. By 20 April, he says, 6,000 single adult New Yorkers who are homeless will have been moved to hotels rather than normal homeless shelters. Those transferred to hotels and afforded isolation conditions will include seniors and those with Covid-19, the mayor says. Here again is Ed Pilkington and Ankita Rao\u2019s piece on coronavirus and the \u201cTwo New Yorks\u201d\u2026 \u201cHaving to tell you that we cannot bring our schools back for the remainder of this school year is painful, but I can also tell you it is the right thing to do,\u201d De Blasio said. He adds that the city will work with parents towards reopening the city\u2019s public schools in September. He says the city will ensure every child who needs an iPad or computer will have one by the end of April, as so many children do not have such devices of their own: De Blasio says 240,000 more will go out. Helplines for parents in multiple languages will be expanded, he says, and a lot more creative at-home programming is coming too. Seniors looking forward to graduating high school will be supported in order to graduate on time \u2013 a full plan will be out next week, the mayor says. De Blasio says his administration is working on a \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d for reopening in September in a safe way and in a way that will help disadvantaged students and everyone affected. \u201cNext year is going to have to be the greatest academic year New York public schools have ever had,\u201d De Blasio adds. In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio has announced that public schools will stay closed for the rest of the academic year. Here\u2019s a link to his press conference: I\u2019m a parent of two children in such schools and one in a pre-school subject to the same rules. So the attempt to teach Spanish at the kitchen table will continue until June. Ah, well. And now, Monty Python-style, the news for giraffes. And for humans seeking good news amid so much bad. The Audobon Nature Institute in New Orleans, a city hit hard by Covid-19, has announced the birth of a giraffe named Hope, to a giraffe named Sue Ellen. \u201cWhat name could be more fitting than \u2018Hope\u2019 in these challenging times?\u201d Audobon president and chief executive Ron Forman told the Associated Press. \u201cHope is what has sustained our community through seemingly insurmountable crises in the past and what we must hold onto as we continue on in the coming days and weeks. May we all take comfort in the reminder that, even in the darkest of days, life continues, undaunted.\u201d The teetering ruminant was born 6ft tall, weighing 189lbs. Like other zoos, aquariums and wildlife parks, the Audubon Nature Institute has been forced to close its facilities to the public during the coronavirus outbreak and, the AP reports, is asking the federal government for funds. Here\u2019s Jonathan Watts on some other heartwarming zoo news: Congressional Republican leaders Mitch McConnell (Senate) and Kevin McCarthy (House) are out with a statement seeking to pressure Democrats over relief efforts for the staggering US economy. The Republicans want a \u201cclean\u201d increase in funding, under the CARES Act stimulus bill passed last month, for the Paycheck Protection Program, which aims to help small businesses. Democrats Chuck Schumer (Senate) and Nancy Pelosi (House) want more money for hospitals and state and local governments. That is of course putting things absurdly simply. Here\u2019s the Republican statement in full, via CNN\u2019s Phil Mattingly: Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, hasn\u2019t announced the time for his daily briefing yet but usually they come along around 11am ET, an hour or so from now. Cuomo\u2019s handling of the crisis in the worst-hit US state has been generally praised, even to the extent of insistent reports that some Democrats would like him to replace Joe Biden as the party\u2019s likely nominee to face Donald Trump in November. For what it\u2019s worth, Cuomo has flatly denied any interest in that. (And done so to his brother, Chris Cuomo, a CNN anchor who has coronavirus himself.) Here\u2019s the New York Times on how Cuomo and Biden get along. On Friday, meanwhile, Governor Cuomo did what a lot of US politicians like to do and quoted Winston Churchill: Churchill quotes are notoriously tricky things, because he often didn\u2019t say what most people now believe he did. Cuomo, at least, is on safe ground here: it\u2019s from a speech on 10 November 1942, after Britain had managed a victory over Nazi Germany, at El Alamein, but when as it would turn out there were nearly three years left to fight. The New York numbers again, according to Johns Hopkins: 174,489 cases 7,887 deaths And here\u2019s Ed Pilkington and Ankita Rao\u2019s devastating piece on how when it comes to the coronavirus there are two New York Cities, with drastically different experiences: The coronavirus outbreak has ravaged the US economy and pitched hundreds of thousands of households into peril, without paychecks and with even food supply uncertain. From Texas, a stunning story and images from the San Antonio Express-News: In perhaps the most sobering reminder yet of the economic fallout caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the San Antonio Food Bank aided about 10,000 households Thursday in a record-setting giveaway at a South Side flea market. \u201cIt was a rough one today,\u201d said Food Bank president and CEO Eric Cooper after the largest single-day distribution in the nonprofit\u2019s 40-year history. \u201cWe have never executed on as large of a demand as we are now.\u201d Thursday\u2019s drive-thru at Traders Village was the fourth such event for the Food Bank since 31 March \u2026 about 6,000 households preregistered for Thursday\u2019s distribution on the Food Bank\u2019s website, Cooper said. But thousands more showed up, hoping to put something on their tables. Here\u2019s a screengrab of the front page of the paper: Here, meanwhile, is Adam Gabbatt\u2019s recent report about what the coronavirus crisis means for local papers such as the Express-News. It\u2019s not good, as Penny Abernathy, Knight chair in journalism and digital media economics at the University of North Carolina, predicts a swath of newspaper and website closures. \u201cI think there\u2019ll be hundreds, not dozens,\u201d Abernathy said. \u201cAn extinction-level event will probably hit the smaller ones really hard, as well as the ones that are part of the huge chains.\u201d A worrying report from the Associated Press, about how the coronavirus is affecting the Navajo Nation, about whose attempts to tackle the outbreak Nina Lakhani reported earlier this month: Two leaders of the largest Native American reservation in the US are in self-quarantine as the Navajo Nation prepares for a weekend-long curfew aimed at curbing the coronavirus outbreak. The virus has swept with ferocity through the Navajo Nation, a 27,000-square-mile reservation which spans parts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. The tribe has recorded nearly 600 cases and 22 deaths. Navajo president Jonathan Nez and vice-president Myron Lizer are quarantining themselves as a precaution after being in close proximity with a first responder who later tested positive. They say they donned masks and gloves while visiting communities and are following protocols to isolate. Their decision came as the tribe prepared for the 57-hour reservation-wide curfew that began Friday at 8pm. Strict enforcement has been promised, with Navajo police able to issue citations that may include fines up to $1,000 or jail time. \u201cWith the number of positive cases rising, it\u2019s imperative that we make smart decisions to protect the ones we love,\u201d Nez said on Friday. \u201cPlease think of our grandmothers and grandfathers and those with underlying conditions. Let us also remember that we \u2026 are strong, our ancestors overcame many atrocities, for us to be here today \u2013 let\u2019s honor their sacrifices by making good decisions.\u201d Access to healthcare and medical supplies is a concern on the Navajo Nation and in other tribal communities in the south-western US that have seen spikes in the number of cases over the past week. A philanthropic effort announced by former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson is the latest aimed at getting more supplies to the Navajo Nation. The national guard in Arizona and New Mexico have helped. Former Navajo president and chairman Peterson Zah said his community had resorted to curfews appropriately to avoid panic but the reaction to the first faraway US coronavirus outbreaks was too gradual. \u201cIt\u2019s like rain,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re way out in the desert, like on the Navajo Nation, and you look out during the summer and you know that the rain is coming because the clouds are billowing up and you\u2019ve got to prepare. People started running around when it started raining. Before the rain came, we should have been all in sync with one another.\u201d Here\u2019s Nina\u2019s report in full: https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/02/navajo-nation-grassroots-self-help-coronavirus \u2026 and welcome to another day of coverage of the coronavirus outbreak in the US. Sobering news this Saturday morning, as researchers at Johns Hopkins University put the US on course to overtake Italy as the country with the most confirmed Covid-19 deaths, with nearly 19,000, after recording more than 2,000 deaths in one day. By Johns Hopkins\u2019 count there have been more than 102,000 deaths worldwide, 18,849 of them in Italy. The same count says there have been more than 500,000 cases confirmed in the US, with New York at nearly 175,000 cases and nearly 8,000 deaths. In New York on Friday, Governor Andrew Cuomo reported a leap of more than 700 deaths, but also reported that hospitalisations are remaining relatively flat. New Jersey has recorded nearly 2,000 deaths and Michigan nearly 1,300. At the White House on Friday, task force member Dr Deborah Birx said that despite encouraging signs that the outbreak in the US is beginning to level off, \u201cWe have not reached the peak.\u201d Here\u2019s our interactive map, based on those Johns Hopkins figures: At the same White House briefing, Donald Trump mused further about the need to reopen the US economy, although he did indicate he would defer to experts including Dr Birx as the end of current federal social distancing guidelines, on 30 April, draws near. Here\u2019s Washington bureau chief David Smith\u2019s report. There is no coronavirus taskforce briefing on the White House schedule today. Of course, that can change if the president decides he wants to talk to the press \u2013 and chase his precious ratings, particularly as his polling numbers drop. He did so last Sunday. Debate continues in the US over whether major broadcasters and news outlets should carry the briefings, at which the president is somewhat prone to make misleading claims, attack journalists and indulge in rather naked electioneering. More to come \u2013 in the meantime here\u2019s David Smith again, with a look at the symbiotic relationship between Trump and Fox News, and how it has shaped America\u2019s Covid-19 response:",
